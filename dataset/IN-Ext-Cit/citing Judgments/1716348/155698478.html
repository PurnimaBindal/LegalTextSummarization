26/05/2012

Present. Ld. APP for State. 

              Convict from JC  with counsel.

              Learned   counsel   submits   that   convict   is   aged   about   38   years.     He   is 

running a grocery shop and is also selling milk.  His parents already expired. He has 

two children and wife to support.  He is also diabetic.  He also remained in custody 

for about 46 days during trial.  He is not the previous convict nor habitual offender.  

              Learned defence counsel has further contended that benefit of probation 

be   given   to   the   convict   U/s.   4   of   <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_2">Probation   of   Offenders   Act</a>.   Learned   defence 

counsel has further contended that according to <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Section 307</a> of IPC, conviction of 


SC No. 19/1/10                                                             1
 accused falls within first part of the same as he has already been acquitted for offence 

U/s. 333 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.  Hence, the second part of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_5">Section 307</a> of IPC  is not applicable, so, 

there is no bar to extend the benefit of probation U/s. 4 of <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_6">Probation of Offenders 

Act</a>.  Learned defence counsel has further contended that other offences i.e. U/s. 186 

of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>, U/s. 279 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>, U/s. 353 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> are punishable with imprisonment or fine 

and they are not punishable with imprisonment for life  and or for death. 

              In support of his contentions learned defence counsel has relied upon 

2005 (3) CC Cases 01 (S.C.) titled as <a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_10">MCD V. State of Delhi and Anr</a>., 2005 (1) 

CC cases 21 (SC) titled as <a href="/doc/1024514/" id="a_11">Prithvi Raj &amp; Ors. V. Kamlesh Kumar &amp; Anr. And</a> 

2007(1) CC Cases 611 (S.C.) titled as <a href="/doc/738920/" id="a_12">Gulzar V. State of M.P.  

              Learned</a> defence counsel has further contended that in a case U/s. 326 of 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>, which is also punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for either 

description for a term, which may extend to 10 years, probation was granted as held 

on 2005 (4) CC Cases  246 (P&amp; H) titled as  Major Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 

              On   the   other   hand,learned   APP   has   contended   that   the   judgments   as 

relied   upon   by   learned   defence   counsel   are   not   applicable   to   the   facts   and 

circumstances of the present case. Ld. APP has further contended that the judgment 

relied upon, by which, benefit of probation was given on conviction U/s. 326 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>, 

is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.

              Although accused has been acquitted for the offence U/s. 333 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>, 

which deals with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to public persons, but it does not 

mean that PW3 HC Jagpal had not sustained any injuries in this incident and hurt was 

caused to him. Accused was not convicted for offence U/s. 323 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a> as he was 

convicted for higher offence U/s. 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>. In view of  it, the contentions of learned 

defence counsel are not forceful in any manner and part II of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_18">Section 307</a> of IPC is 

applicable,   so,   benefit  of  probation   cannot   be   extended,   as   prayed   for,   U/s.   4   of 

<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_19">Probation of Offenders Act</a>.

for traffic violation and thereafter, at about 3.40 p.m., one Wagon­R came from 

the side of Canal, bearing No. DL­2CB­3849 after jumping the red light.   Two 

of the constables gave signal to stop the car.  The driver reduced the speed of 

the car.  He came in front of the car to stop it, but instead of stopping the car, 

the driver accelerated the speed.  Those two Constables saved themselves, but 

he was hit by the driver.  He fell on the bonnet of the car.  He raised noise, but 

the driver did not stop the car, rather accelerated more speed and started driving 

the car in zig zag manner to threw him from the bonnet.  Even then, he did not

private car to Indian Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.  One police gypsy was standing 

there and started chasing the said driver.   He had identified the driver of the 

said Wagon R, while he was on the bonnet and had raised the noise.  He was 

provided treatment in the hospital.  Local police came there with traffic police 

officials. His statement was recorded Ex. PW3/A.  He was discharged from the

rest.  Identity of the car has not been disputed.  PW3 has identified the car from 

the photographs as Ex. P1.  Photographs are Ex. P2 and Ex. P3.  PW3 has also 

identified his uniform, which he was wearing at the time of incident i.e. pant as 

Ex. P4 and shirt as Ex. P5 and also pointed out some black marks on the shirt, 

which appeared due to rubbing of tyres.

<p id="p_11">            Another witness is PW4 Constable Balvinder.  He has stated that on 

30/01/2010, he was on duty at Shalimar Bagh, Kela Godown from 8.00 a.m. to 

9.00   p.m.   At   about   3.00   p.m.,   he   alongwith   PW3   HC   Jagpal   and   PW7

Maruti Wagon R bearing registration No. DL­2CB­3849 came from the side of 

Pitampura.  He gave signal to spot the Maruti Wagon R.  Driver of the Wagon 

R came there in slow speed and applied the brakes. PW3 HC Jagpal came in 

front of Maruti Wagon R, as a result of which, he fell down on the bonnet. 

Accused was driving the Wagon R in zig­zag manner. Thereafter, PW3 HC 

Jagpal was thrown by the accused by applying brakes.

</p><p id="p_13">            PW7 HC Jitender has stated that on 30/01/2010, he was posted as 

Constable at Ashok Vihar Traffic Circle.  On that day, he alongwith PW3 HC 

Jagpal and PW4 Constable Balwinder was present at U &amp; V Block, near T 

Point, to check the traffic violators and to book the offenders.  At about 3.40 

p.m., one Wagon R bearing registration No. DL­2CV­3849 came from the side 

of  Pitam Pura   canal and after jumping the red light, it was going towards 

Jaspal Kaur Public school.   They made signal to stop the car.  The driver of the 

said car slowed down the speed of the  car, but again he accelerated the speed 

of the car and hit PW3 HC Jagpal, who was in front of the car. They did not see 

thereafter HC Jagpal as due to the impact HC Jagpal fell on the bonnet of the 

car.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">            Learned   defence   counsel  has   contended   that  depositions  of   these 

witnesses cannot be believed as PW3 HC Jagpal has stated that he came in front 

of the car to stop it, whereas PW4 Ct Balvinder has stated that he gave signal to 

stop  the  Maruti  Wagon  R  and  PW7 HC Jitender has stated that  they made 

signal to stop the car, but again, he has stated that driver of the car slow down 

the speed of the car , but again he accelerated the speed of the  car and hit HC 

Jagpal, who was in front of the car. So, it is not clear, who had given signal to 

stop the car.  
</p>
<p id="p_15">            Learned defence counsel has further contended that it has come in 

the cross examination of PW3 HC Jagpal that accused had jumped the red light 

for right turning, whereas PW4 Constable Balvinder has stated that Wagon R 

was going straight from red light.  So, it is not known whether accused, while 

driving Wagon R, was going straight from the red light or had taken a turn on 

the right side of the red light, hence, witnesses cannot be believed to the extent

 that accused had jumped the red light.

<p id="p_16">            Information   of   this   incident   was   given   on   30/01/2010   to   PW8 

Constable Sushil Kumar, who was working as DD writer at PS Shalimar Bagh 

from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.  On that day, at about 4.03 p.m., on receipt of a call 

from wireless operator about hitting of traffic police official by one unknown 

vehicle at the red light of U &amp; V Block, Shalimar Bagh, he recorded DD No. 

46B,   copy   of   which   was   handed   over   to   PSI   Surender   Singh   for   further 

necessary action. PW8 has proved the copy of DD No. 46B as Ex. PW8/A.  He 

has also produced the original DD register. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">            Learned defence counsel has contended that from the deposition of 

PW8 Constable Sushil Kumar, it is clear that even at the time of making call, 

registration number of Wagon R was not known to the police officials, which 

shows that accused has been falsely implicated in this case.

as SI at  PS Shalimar Bagh.  On that day, on receipt of copy of DD no.46B, he

PW11 SI Baljeet Singh regarding the proceedings conducted at the spot and 

also about arrest of the accused in this case.   PW5 Constable Yogesh Kumar 

has also identified the car as Ex. P1 and driving licence of accused as Ex. P6. 

</p><p id="p_22">         PW1   HC   Raghuraj   Singh   has   further   corroborated   with   the   facts 

regarding registration of FIR.  He has stated that on 30/01/2010, he was posted 

at PS Shalimar Bagh and was working as duty officer from 4.00 p.m. to 12 

night. On that day, he received ruqqa, sent by PW11 SI Baljeet Singh through 

PW5 Constable Yogesh, on the basis of which, he recorded FIR of this case, 

copy of which is Ex. PW1/A.  He also made his endorsement on the ruqqa Ex.

 PW1/B and handed over copy of FIR and ruqqa to PW5 Constable Yogesh to 

further handover the same to PW11 SI Baljeet Singh. PW1 has produced the 

original FIR register.  PW1 HC Raghuraj Singh  has not been cross examined 

by learned defence counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_23">          So, from the depositions of the witnesses, prosecution has been able to 

prove beyond reasonable doubts that on the statement of PW3 HC Jagpal Singh, 

ruqqa was prepared by PW11 SI Baljeet Singh, which was handed over to PW5 

Constable Yogesh, who got registered the case from the PS and came back at 

the spot. He handed over copy of FIR and ruqqa to PW11 SI Baljeet Singh. 

Nothing has come out from the cross examination of PW5 Constable Yogesh to 

disbelieve his testimony. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">          PW6 HC Prem Singh  has stated that on 30/01/2010, he was posted as 

In­charge, QRT, Police gypsy.  On that day, at about 3.40 p.m., he was present 

at the red light of UV block, Shalimar  Bagh and the traffic staff was checking 

the vehicles near the red light.  At that time, one Wagon R car bearing No. 3849 

hit one Constable of traffic police as he had given signal to stop the Wagon R, 

who  had jumped the red light.  The driver of the car instead of stopping the car, 

hit one Head Constable Jagpal as a result of which, he fell down on the bonnet 

of the Wagon R.  Then the driver of the Wagon R suddenly applied brake, due 

to which, Head Constable Jagpal fell down on the road and the driver of the 

Wagon R ran over the car on Head Constable Jagpal.  
</p>
<p id="p_25">          PW6 HC Prem Singh has further deposed that they raised noise and 

chased the Wagon R and intercepted the driver with the Wagon R at Shalimar 

Village.     They   apprehended   the driver, whose name they came to know as 

Manoj Kumar.  They brought  back the accused with the car at the spot and 

handed   over   him   with   the   car   to   PW11   SI   Baljeet   Singh.   PW6   has   also

 identified the car as Ex. P1 and photographs of the car as Ex. P2 and Ex. P3. 

</p><p id="p_26">         PW11 SI Baljeet Singh has further stated that he came back to the spot 

and handed over ruqqa to PW5 Constable Yogesh.  Thereafter, Wagon R was 

seized and accused was arrested at the spot, which is corroborating with the 

deposition of PW6 HC Prem Singh, who has stated that Wagon R of accused 

was brought back at the spot and was handed over to PW11 SI Baljeet Singh. 

</p><p id="p_27">         In the cross examination, PW6 HC Prem Singh has stated that PW3 

HC Jagpal had given signal to stop the car of the accused in his presence.  So, 

in view of the same, the contention of learned defence counsel that it is not 

clear as to who had given signal to stop the car is of no force. More so, it is not 

material as to who had given the signal because in natural practice, in case of 

violation  of traffic rules, everyone on duty gives signal to stop the vehicle. 

According to cross examination of PW6 HC Prem Singh, he was sitting on the 

front seat of the gypsy.  They gypsy was standing on the red light on the left 

side lane of the road. So, it cannot be said that he had not seen the incident. 

Wagon R came from the side of Pitam Pura and was going towards Jaspal Kaur 

Public School.     According to cross examination of PW6, when accused took 

right turn after jumping the red light, he was driving the Wagon R at the speed 

of 40 k.m. per hour, which also clarify that accused had taken right turn after 

jumping the red light and in view of the same, the contention of learned defence 

counsel is not forceful as to whether accused was going straight or had taken a 

right turn on the red light.   Nothing came out from the cross examination of 

PW6 HC Prem Singh to disbelieve his testimony regarding his presence at the 

spot and also that he had not chased the accused after the incident.  

</p><p id="p_28">         According   to   PW7   HC   Jitender,   they   all   chased   the   said   car   and 

reached at Jaspal Kaur Public School.  They saw crowd there.  They came to

 know that Head Constable Jagpal was taken to some hospital by the school van. 

They did not see the driver with the car there at that time.  They tried to search 

the   offending   car   and   also   made   inquiries   as   to   in   which   hospital   Head 

Constable Jagpal was taken.   Thereafter, the offending car with its driver i.e. 

accused was brought at the spot by the QRT staff. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">           This part of the deposition of PW7 HC Jitender is corroborating with 

the   deposition   of   PW6   HC   Prem   Singh,   who   has   stated   that   after   the 

apprehension of accused, he was brought at the spot with the car.   PW7 HC 

Jitender  has  further  deposed   about  the arrest  of accused and preparation  of 

arrest memo and personal search memo. 
</p>
<p id="p_30">           PW7 HC Jitender has further deposed that they made a call on the 

mobile phone of Head Constable Jagpal and came to know that he was admitted 

in Indian Hospital.   He reached there.  He signed the seizure memo of sealed 

pullanda   containing   wearing   clothes   of   HC   Jagpal   as   a   witness   at   point   C, 

which is Ex. PW4/A.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">           PW7 HC Jitender has also stated that one QRT was also standing near 

the spot, which chased the accused on seeing the incident and brought back the 

accused with the vehicle at the spot i.e. at Jaspal Kaur Public School. They saw 

that HC Jagpal fell down after about 200 meters as accused drove the car in zig 

zag manner and suddenly applied the brakes.    
</p>
<p id="p_32">           PW7 HC Jitender has also identified the uniform of HC Jagpal as Ex. 

P4 and Ex. P5, car as Ex. P1 and photographs of the car as Ex. P2 and Ex. P3. 

</p><p id="p_33">           In the cross examination also, PW7 HC Jitender has stated that one 

police official came in front of the Wagon R and two were on the side. He 

chased the Wagon R on two wheeler scooter belonging to one public person. 

Firstly, PCR van reached there and he remained there for about 15­20 minutes

 with the IO.  Constable Balwinder and QRT staff were present there. 

</p><p id="p_34">           Witnesses   have   also   stated   that   beside   the   accused,   one   lady   and 

children were sitting in the Wagon R.  QRT brought back the Wagon R with its 

driver at the spot.  So, it is also corroborating the fact regarding apprehension 

of accused from Jaspal kaur Public school and further that accused was brought 

back   at   the   spot   and   was   arrested   in   this   case.   In   such   manner,   PW7   HC 

Jitender has also corroborated with PW6 HC Prem Singh regarding the arrest of 

accused Manoj and seizure of Wagon R in this case. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">           PW11   SI   Baljeet   Singh   has   further   deposed   that   he   had   collected 

photocopy of challan No. 267035 prepared by HC Jagpal Singh, on 30/01/2010 

at   3.30   p.m.   of   vehicle   No.   DL­2CAH­0532   Ex.   PW11/C.     He   moved   an 

application on 02/02/10 to the Mechanical Inspector to inspect the Wagon R 

Car   No.   DL­2CV­3849,   which   is   Ex.   PW11/D,   and   report   is   Ex.   PW9/A. 

PW11   has  further  deposed   that   he  had   also  collected  copy  of  duty  register 

regarding   duty   of   PW3   HC   Jagpal,   PW4   Constable   Balvinder   and   PW7 

Constable Jitender Ex. PW11/E.  He had also obtained opinion on the MLC of 

PW3   HC   Jagpal   regarding   the   nature   of   injuries   and   on   completion   of 

investigation, he prepared charge­sheet. He also obtained complaint U/s. 195 of 

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_34">Cr.P.C</a>.. After completion of investigatioin, he filed charge­sheet. 

</p><p id="p_36">           PW11  SI  Baljeet  Singh has also identified the Wagaon R Car No. 

DL­2CV­3849 as Ex. P1 and photographs as Ex. P2 and Ex. P3.  

</p><p id="p_37">           According to PW9 retired ASI Devender Kumar, on 02/02/10, on the 

request   of   IO,   he   reached   at   PS   Shalimar   Bagh   and   conducted   mechanical 

inspection of Maruti Wagon R bearing No. DL­2CV­3849.   He prepared his 

report Ex. PW9/A. As per report, he found fresh damages. Bonnet was found 

dented from front side. Front wind screen glass was found broken and wipers

 were found bended and broken. The car was fit for road test. 

</p><p id="p_38">          In the cross examination, PW9 has stated that if a person hangs on the 

wipers,   they   they   cannot   be  broken. A person can lie on the bonnet, while 

holding the wipers in the running position of the car and has further stated that 

it depends on the position of the body and skill of the driver as to whether the 

driver can cross over the body of an average built person at the speed of 30­40 

k.m. per hour.   The mechanical inspection of the car is corroborating with the 

deposition   of   PW3   HC   Jagpal   regarding   fresh   damages   on   Wagon   R   car, 

denting on bonnet from front side,  bending and breaking of  wind screen glass 

because HC Jagpal after the impact had struck against the wind screen and fell 

down on the bonnet, but he hold the wipers of the car and  accused threw him 

on the road by driving the vehicle in zig zag manner and by applying the brakes 

suddenly. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">          The suggestion itself proves the presence of accused at the spot as 

given   to   PW3   HC   Jagpal   in   the   cross   examination   that   accused   became 

perplexed and applied the brakes.  Accused has not given any explanation to the 

damages of the car, as observed during the mechanical inspection by PW9 and 

it is not suggested to PW9, the mechanical inspector,that no such fresh damages 

were found by him during the inspection on 02/02/10 in the said Wagon R No. 

DL­2CV­3849.   So,   prosecution   has   been   able   to   prove   beyond   reasonable 

doubts that on that day, at the time of incident, accused hit PW3 HC Jagpal, 

who due to the impact, fell down on the bonnet and accused drove the car in 

zig zag manner and had suddenly applied brakes due to which, PW3 HC Jagpal 

fell down in front of the car and the accused ran over the car on him.

 ACP Traffic, North West, Delhi.  On that day, HC Jagpal, Ct Jitender and Ct 

Balwinder were deployed for traffic duty at Kela Godwon area, Shalimar Bagh, 

Delhi.  They were obstructed by accused Manoj Kumar from performing their 

official duties and as such, a case was registered against accused Manoj.   So, 

after satisfying himself, he made complaint U/s. 195 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_36">Cr.P.C</a>. alongwith list 

of   witnesses   Ex.   PW9/A.     PW10   has   not   been   cross   examined   by   learned 

defence counsel, hence, his testimony is unrebutted and unshaken. 

</p><p id="p_41">          To prove  the injuries  and nature of injuries sustained by PW3 HC 

Jagpal in this occurrence, PW2 Dr. Santosh Jena has been examined. He has 

stated that on 30/01/2010, he examined patient Jagpal Singh with the alleged 

history   of  RTA.  On   examination,   multiple  bone  pain  and  multiple   abrasion 

right leg, left knee and bilateral thigh were observed. Lacerated wound on right 

eye lid and swelling on right ankle were also observed.  He had gone through 

the x­ray place and there was fracture on lateral malleolous (fibula), but he had 

not prepared the MLC.  PW2 has not been cross examined by learned defence 

counsel in any manner.

<p id="p_42">          As MLC was not proved by PW2 Dr. Santosh Jena, hence, PW12 Sh.

has been examined, who has deposed that he has been deputed by the Medical 

Superintendent to depose in place of Dr. Ranjeeta, who was working as CMO

constable   Balwinder   and   PW7   Constable   Jitender   were   on   duty   at   Kela 

Godown. 
</p>
<p id="p_45">           In the statement, accused has stated that he has been falsely implicated 

in this case due to enmity with the police official.  Nothing has been brought on 

record to prove the enmity nor anything has been suggested to any witness that 

the   said   police   official   was   having   any   enmity   with   the   accused.     So,   the 

explanation of accused is not acceptable in any manner.  Even accused has not 

examined the said lady in his defence, who was sitting in the car at the time of 

incident with children.  
</p>
<p id="p_46">           In view of the above, the witnesses examined by the prosecution are 

inspiring   confidence   and   are   trustworthy.     They   have   no   reason   to   depose 

falsely against the accused in any manner. Nothing has been brought on record 

that   prosecution   witnesses   have   any   motive   to   depose   falsely   against   the 

accused and to implicate him in this case.

<p id="p_47">           It has been proved from the deposition of PW3 HC Jagpal that he 

alongwith PW4 Ct Balwinder and PW7 Ct Jitender was on duty for checking 

traffic violators at the red light of U &amp; V Block, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi.  It is not 

disputed that PW3 HC Jagpal, PW4 Ct Balwinder and PW7 Ct Jitender were 

not public servant. One traffic challan, which was prepared by PW3 HC Jagpal

HC   Jagpal   alongwith   other   persons   was   on   duty   to   check   the   persons 

committing traffic violation at the red light of U&amp; V Block and the same has

<p id="p_48">           From   the  depositions   of   the  witnesses,   particularly   PW6  HC   Prem 

Singh, who was on duty at QRT, it is proved beyond reasonable doubts that HC 

Jagpal had given signal to stop the Wagon R, who had jumped the red light, but 

accused did not stop the Wagon R, rather reduced the speed and while PW3 HC 

Jagpal came in front of the Wagon R, he again accelerated the speed and hit HC 

Jagpal, who fell on the bonnet of the Wagon R.

<p id="p_49">           PW10 ACP Sh. Amrik Singh has deposed about complaint U/s. 195 of 

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39">Cr.P.C</a>. and he has not been cross examined in any manner by learned defence 

counsel for accused.  Accordingly, prosecution has been able to prove  that on 

30/01/2010,  at  about  3.40  p.m.,   while accused Manoj  Kumar   was driving 

Wagaon R car No. DL­2CV­3849, he jumped the red light and took a right turn 

towards Jaspal Kaur Public School. PW3 HC Jagpal had given him signal to 

stop   the   car,   but   he   did   not   stop   the   same   and   in   such   manner,   accused 

voluntarily obstructed public servant i.e. PW3 HC Jagpal, who was discharging 

his public functions as such. Accordingly, prosecution has been able to prove 

offence U/s. 186 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">IPC</a> beyond reasonable doubts against accused Manoj, 

for which, he is held guilty and convicted for the same. 

</p><p id="p_50">           According  to the deposition of PW3 HC Jagpal, he came in front of 

Wagon R to stop it, but instead of stopping the car, accused accelerated the 

speed and he was hit by the accused. He fell down on the bonnet of the car. He 

raised noise, but driver did not stop the car, rather accelerated the speed and 

started driving the same in zig zag manner  to threw him from the bonnet and

 when he did not fell down from the bonnet, even by driving the car in such 

manner by the accused, then accused suddenly applied the brakes and he fell 

down in front of the car and the driver ran over the car over him and fled away 

from  the spot.   Although,  PW3  HC Jagpal  has been cross examined on this 

aspect, but his testimony remained unrebutted and unshaken during the cross 

examination and he inspires confidence.  
</p>
<p id="p_51">           This   fact   is   also   corroborated   with   other   facts   as   visible   from   the 

photographs of the Wagon R car Ex. P2 and Ex.P3, in which, the front wipers 

of the Wagon R can be seen in damaged condition and front wind screen of the 

car   is   also   visible   in   broken   condition.     The   mechanical   inspection   of   the 

Wagon R car was conducted by PW9 retired ASI Devender Kumar.   He has 

proved his inspection report Ex. PW9/A.  According to the report, front wind 

screen glass was found broken and wipers were found bended and broken.  The 

car was fit for road test. 
</p>
<p id="p_52">           PW9 retired ASI Devender Kumar in the cross examination has rather 

supported the case of the prosecution that if a person hangs on the wipers, then 

they cannot be broken as being made of steel.   The width and length of the 

bonnet might be 2½ feet each.  A person can lie on the bonnet, while holding 

the   wipers   in   the   running   position   of  the  car.  The   ground  clearance   of   the 

Wagon R is about one feet. The Wagon R can cross over a person, if lying on 

the road.  So, from the deposition of PW9, prosecution  has been able to explain 

the damages in the Wagon R due to the incident as happened in the manner 

deposed by PW3 HC Jagpal and nothing has been brought on record to rebut 

the same in any manner that the damages to the Wagon R were caused by some 

other means.

 able   to   prove   beyond   reasonable   doubts   that   after   hitting   PW3   HC   Jagpal, 

accused drove the Wagon R in a rash and negligent manner, in zig zag manner, 

while PW3 HC Jagpal was hanging on the bonnet holding the wipers of the car 

and when accused failed to threw HC Jagpal from the bonnet, then he applied 

brakes, due to which, he fell down in front of the car and accused ran over the

to prove offence U/s. 279 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41">IPC</a> against the accused beyond reasonable 

doubts, for which, he is held guilty and convicted for the same. 

</p><p id="p_54">          From the deposition of PW3 HC Jagpal, prosecution has also been 

able to prove that accused Manoj used criminal force against PW3 HC Jagpal, a

from discharging his duties as such public servant and instead of stopping the 

car, when PW3 HC Jagpal came in front of the car, he accelerated the speed of 

the Wagon R  and hit PW3 HC Jagpal, so, prosecution has also been able to 

prove   offence   U/s.   353   of   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42">IPC</a>   beyond   reasonable   doubts   against   the

injuries to a public servant to deter him from discharging his duties. To prove

who   had   examined   the   injured   and   found   multiple   bone   pain   and   multiple

that he had not prepared the MLC. So, from the deposition of PW2 Dr. Santosh 

Jena, prosecution has been able to prove the nature of injuries as simple only as 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">SC No. 19/1/10                                                     20</span>
 no X­ray plate has been brought on record and no report of radiologist has been 

proved regarding the fracture on lateral malleolus (fibula). 

</p><p id="p_56">           To prove the nature of injuries, as opined, PW12 Sh. Rajender Singh, 

Administrative officer, Indian Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi,  was called, who 

has identified signatures of Dr. Ranjeeta, who had prepared MLC of PW3 HC 

Jagpal and has identified the same in the handwriting of Dr. Ranjeeta as Ex. 

PW12/A, but he could not identify the signatures of   doctor, who had given 

opinion regarding nature of injuries on the MLC as grievous.  So, prosecution 

has not been able to prove offence U/s. 333 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44">IPC</a> against accused Manoj 

in any manner, accordingly, he is acquitted for the same. 

</p><p id="p_57">           To prove offence U/s. 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45">IPC</a>, again, PW3 HC Jagpal has deposed 

the manner, in which, he was hit by accused Manoj.  PW3 HC Jagpal has stated 

that  accused, while driving Wagon R car No. DL­2CV­3849jumped the red 

light and they gave signal to stop.   The driver reduced the speed of the car. 

PW3 HC Jagpal came in front of the car to stop it, but instead of stopping the 

car, the driver accelerated the speed.  Two of the Constables saved themselves, 

but he was hit by the driver and he fell down on the bonnet of the car. He raised 

noise,   but   accused   did   not   stop   the   car,   rather   accelerated   more   speed   and 

started   driving   the   same   in   zig   zag   manner   to   threw  him   from   the   bonnet. 

When   he did not fell down from the bonnet even by driving the car in this 

manner, then the driver suddenly applied  the brakes and PW3 HC Jagpal fell 

down in front of the car. The driver ran over the car over him and fled away 

from the spot. 
</p>
<p id="p_58">           PW3 HC Jagpal has further stated that   he was discharged from the 

hospital   on 07/02/2010.   According to the case of the prosecution, he was 

admitted in the hospital on the same day i.e. 30/01/2010.  PW3 HC Jagpal has 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">SC No. 19/1/10                                                        21</span>
 further deposed that he sustained injuries all over his body and injuries on the 

ribs.  Even after discharge, he was unable to move and he took one month bed 

rest.  
</p>
<p id="p_59">           Injureis have been corroborated by PW2 Dr. Santosh Jena, who had 

examined PW3 HC Jagpal on 30/01/2010. 
</p>
<p id="p_60">           In the cross examination, PW3 HC Jagpal has again testified that he 

rolled beneath the car, when accused ran over the car over him. According to 

PW9 Retired ASI Devender Kumar, the Wagon R could cross over a person, if 

lying on the road and it depends on the position of the body and skill of the 

driver    as  to   whether  driver  could cross  over the body of an average  built 

person at the speed of 30­40 k.m. per hour.  
</p>
<p id="p_61">           During reexamination of PW3 HC Jagpal by learned Addl;. PP, while 

identifying his uniform, PW3 HC Jagpal pointed out some black marks on the 

shirt, which he told that these were the marks of rubbing of  tyre and further in 

the cross examination, he has stated that hole appeared on  the back  of the shirt 

due to rubbing on the road and has denied the suggestion that cloth piece was 

cut from the hole from the backside of the shirt.  
</p>
<p id="p_62">           During reexamination of PW3 HC Jagpal, The Court also observed 

that there was no mark of use of any scissor in the hole. So, from the deposition 

of PW3, it has also been proved beyond reasonable doubts that after throwing 

HC Jagpal from the bonnet by applying brakes suddenly, accused ran over the 

the car   over the body of PW3 HC jagpal, which is corroborating with the 

marks appearing on the uniform of PW3 HC Jagpal, identified before the Court, 

which was seized in this case.  The testimonies of the witnesses are  unrebutted 

and unshaken regarding the seizure of the uniform of HC Jagpal in this case and 

nothing   has   been   brought   on   record   to   disbelieve   the   testimonies   of   these

 witnesses.  
</p>
<p id="p_63">           Although,   prosecution   has   not   been   able   to   prove     the   nature   of 

injuries as grievous, but to prove offence U/s. 307 of IP, nature of injuries are 

not material, rather it has to be seen whether accused had committed the act of 

running over of Wagon R on the body of PW3 HC Jagpal with such intention or 

knowledge or that under such circumstances, if he by that act caused death, he 

would be guilty of murder. In the present case,  from the deposition of PW3 HC 

Jagpal, it is clear that after hitting PW3 HC Jagpal, when he fell down on the 

bonnet of the car, instead of stopping the car or gradually reducing the speed of 

the car to stop the same to save life of PW3 HC Jagpal, accused drove the car in 

zig zag manner and accelerated the speed and not only this, to threw PW3 HC 

Jagpal from the bonnet of the car, he applied brakes suddenly and when HC 

Jagpal   fell   down     in   front   of   the   car   due   to   sudden   application   of   brakes, 

accused ran over the car over the body of PW3 instead of stopping the car, 

which is fortified with the uniform of PW3 HC Jagpal produced before the 

Court and identified and further some rubber marks  were shown in the Court 

on the uniform. 
</p>
<p id="p_64">           In such circumstances, it is proved that accused, while acting in this 

manner, was having knowledge  that under such circumstances by his said act, 

death could be caused.   Accordingly, prosecution has been able to prove 

offence U/s. 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_46">IPC</a> against accused Manoj beyond reasonable doubts, 

for which, he is held guilty and convicted for the same. </p><pre id="pre_2">
