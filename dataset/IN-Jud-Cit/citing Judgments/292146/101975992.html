<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiff has filed the suit for passing off on the basis of prior
user and adopter of the mark "INNOVOLT". The plaintiff claims that
they are the proprietor of the mark, as it is a coined mark which
cannot be appropriated by the defendant in relation to same
description of alleged and cognate goods.

mark "INNOVOLT" for a wide range of products and services related to
electronic and power saving since 2005 and 2007 in the United States
of America and in India respectively. The mark "INNOVOLT" was first
coined by the plaintiff. It has been using the mark "INNOVOLT"

 class 9 for "VOLTAGE SURGE PROTECTORS and VOLTAGE SURGE
SUPPRESSORS".
</p><p id="p_4">4.      The reputation of the "INNOVOLT" name/mark is not limited only
to electronics/appliance protection, but to other activities as well. The
plaintiff has developed new products and services and expanded its
market share with an ever growing range of branded goods and
services. Substantial goodwill and worldwide reputation have accrued
to the plaintiff as a result of continuous sales, sales promotion and
advertising of products bearing the "INNOVOLT" trademark by the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_5">5.      The domain name of the plaintiff being www.innovolt.com was
created on 8th March, 2001 as alleged which expires on 8th March,
2017.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      It is also stated in the plaint that the defendant has adopted the
identical and deceptively mark and "INNOVOLT (logo)" and filed for
the same vide Application No. 2101609 in         Class 9 for the following
goods;       "INVERTERS,   UPS,   POWER     BACKUP    SYSTEMS,      POWER
CONVERSION SYSTEMS, BATTERY CHARGERS, POWER SUPPLIES,
BATTERIES, CELLS, SCIENTIFIC, ELECTRIC, PHOTOGRAPIC, OPTICAL,
WEIGHING, MEASURING APPARATUS AND INSTRUMENTS".
</p><p id="p_7">7.      Both goods are falling in Class 09. It is alleged by the plaintiffs
that the defendant has even copied the "Lightning Bolt' which is a very
peculiar/distinct feature of the plaintiff's mark.
</p><p id="p_8">8.      The defendant has filed the written statement and reply.         The
defendant has denied each and every averment made in the plaint. It
is stated that the defendant has adopted and used the mark since
2011. The adoption was bonafide. Thus, no injunction is liable to be
granted.

<p id="p_9"> 9.     The defendant in its written statement has claimed the prior user

otherwise claimed user as proposed to be used.

<p id="p_10"> 11.    The plaintiff has even acquiesced in respect of the said
registrations of the defendant, who has not filed the opposition when
the applications of the defendant were advertised. The plaintiff has not
filed any rectification proceeding before the Intellectual Property
Appellate Board by challenging the registrations after registration. The
said trademarks of the defendant are valid, no interim order is liable to
be passed.
</p><p id="p_11">12.    It is argued by Mr.Shailen Bhatia, counsel appearing on behalf of
the defendant that the plaintiff has failed to prove the continuous prior
use of the trademark in question. The plaintiff has filed the application
for registration on 9th November, 2011 under No. 2231196 in Class 9
with the user statement as "PROPOSED TO BE USED". He referred the
Division Bench judgment passed in the case of <a href="/doc/57269371/" id="a_1">Pioneer Nuts and
Bolts Pvt. Ltd. v. Goodwill Enterprises</a>, 2009 (41) PTC 362
(Del.)(DB), (para 17).
</p><p id="p_12">13.    The plaintiff has filed a copy of the so called Joint Venture
Agreement dated 3rd October, 2009. The following defendant's
comments are made by Mr.Bhatia, learned counsel for the defendant
during the course of hearing.
</p><p id="p_13">       a)    In paragraph 8 of the plaint, the plaintiff itself averred that
             the said Agreement was terminated in 2012 in order to
             show the user of the matter in India on behalf of plaintiff by
             the third party.
</p><p id="p_14">       b)    There is not a single document to suggest that the
             agreement was ever acted upon. The Agreement has no
             witnesses. The Agreement contains schedules which are
             either completely blank or contains certain blanks. The same
             does not prove adoption or use of the alleged trademark. No

              mention of the use of the said trademark in the agreement.
             The agreement is void as it is without consideration.
</p>

<p id="p_15">14.    Mr. Bhatia has also referred certain documents filed by the
plaintiff, the same are in the nature of copy of invoices. His comments
to the said documents are that the mark INNOVOLT has not been
mentioned. The details of the same are as under :

</pre><p id="p_16">15.    Mr.Bhatia states that the plaintiff cannot claim any trans-border
reputation. The plaintiff has not placed sufficient material on record to
show that the plaintiff's alleged trademark is well-known in overseas
countries. The plaintiff's products are also not available in duty free
shops and embassies. Moreover, no person imports UPS/Inverters
from abroad because this product is service based rather he would
prefer to purchase such products from the local market.
</p><p id="p_17">16.    Mr.Bhatia has referred the following judgments in support of his
submissions and has submitted that plaintiff in the present case
cannot take the advantage of any decision passed by the Supreme
Court and many High Courts where the advantage is given to the

referred by him are as follows:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">17.    As far as adoption of mark is concerned, it is submitted that the
adoption of the trademark 'INNOVOLT' by the defendant is bonafide.
The defendant adopted the trademark 'INNOVOLT' by using two words
Inverter and voltage. The defendant's corporate name is KEVIN
POWER SOLUTIONS LTD. The word POWER SOLUTION is of a same
species as INVERTER/VOLTAGE. There is a connection between the
two. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim any monopoly over such a
word. The adoption of the word by the defendant is well explained.
The defendant has not taken the plaintiff's alleged trademark. There
is also a delay in bringing the action by the plaintiff and the goods are
not identical.       The application filed by the plaintiff for grant of
injunction is liable to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_19">SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF
</p><p id="p_20">18.    Mr.Sudhanshu Batra, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the plaintiff has stated that the word INNOVOLT was coined by the
plaintiff and it has been using the word "INNOVOLT worldwide since
2005 and commercially since 2008. It has been using the word
"INNOVOLT" in India since 2007. The defendants have not coined the
word "INNOVOLT".
</p><p id="p_21">       The plaintiff is the prior adopter and user of the mark
"INNOVOLT" in the field of Voltage surge protectors and Voltage surge
suppressors in International Class 9. Therefore, to protect its interests



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.573/2013                                           Page 6 of 40</span>
 in the well-known and established names, the plaintiff has filed
numerous Trade Mark Applications in various classes all over the
world. The relevant documents have already been filed with the plaint
and are on record before this Court. The defendant has blatantly
copied the said mark of the plaintiff and hence such adoption by the
defendant is highly dishonest.
</p><p id="p_22">19.    It is denied by Mr. Batra that the plaintiff has no intention to sell
goods in India under the alleged trademark 'INNOVOLT', as the
plaintiff has been actively selling its products in India along with its JV
partners. Filing the opposition against the mark of the defendant does
not bar the plaintiff from filing the instant suit. The plaintiff is highly
aggrieved as the defendant is trying to pass off his goods as that of
the plaintiff and hence the instant suit. It is alleged by the counsel that
the plaintiff has been and continues to be engaged in electronics
power protection and management which extends the lifespan of
equipment by safe-keeping it from common power disturbances that
damage electronics. The technology, incubated at the Georgia Institute
of Technology Research Institute's Advanced Technology Development
Center, solves a host of power problems that most businesses and
consumers are not aware of but are paying for through shortened
electronics lifespan and decreased product reliability. This patented
technology       guards   against   damages    from    99.5%    of     power
interruptions including, but not limited to, infinite voltage and current
variations. All such goodwill arising from the use of the "INNOVOLT"
name accrues to the plaintiff and plaintiff only.

details of the relevant documents filed by the plaintiff as well as the
defendant are as below:-

concerned, prima-facie, it appears that the defendant has adopted the
trademark INNOVOLT from February, 2011 and has started using the
same thereafter, as it also appears from the record that the defendant
has filed an application for registration of the trademark in the month
of February, 2011.

from various places. These invoices are from the years 2008 to 2011.
Learned counsel for the defendant has pointed out that in some of the

 that each of the invoices issued by the plaintiff and the mark
INNOVOLT is the dominant and essential part of the corporate name of
the plaintiff.       Even otherwise, there is evidence on behalf of the
plaintiff to show that the plaintiff has been using the mark INNOVOLT
either as a part of its corporate name or as a mark prior to the
defendant.       The plaintiff has admittedly obtained the registration in
United States of America on 30th December, 2011 wherein the use was
mentioned on 21st October, 2005 in commence 21st January, 2008.
The applications for the registration of the trademark INNOVOLT are
filed by the plaintiff in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia,
Mexico and South Africa whereas the registration was granted in
United States and Madrid Protocol - Protection in Australia, China,
Europe, Japan, Singapore and South Korea prior to the use of the
defendant. The plaintiff has filed the copy of the brochure of Innovolt
Inc, pamphlets regarding different INNOVOLT products.

innovolt.com and other websites have been placed on record showing
the various awards and honors conferred on INNOVOLT and various
published advertorials/advertisements and printouts of various articles
about the plaintiff which would show that the plaintiff was there in the
overseas countries at least since 2008. The revenue of the plaintiff is
about 10 Billions in one year and they were having the plans in 2011,
2012 and which has been raised about 30 millions subsequently and
they have the plan to raise from 15 million to 20 million in institutional

 Pune, dated 1st October, 2009, to use the mark INNOVOLT in the Asian
territory to manufacture the INNOVOLT products. These documents,
prima-facie, would show that the plaintiff is well-known in many
countries of the world since 2008.      In 2009, there was the Joint
Venture Agreement with an Indian Company and they have been
receiving the orders from the Indian Company and selling the goods in
India. Thus, the plaintiff has been able to make out even a case of
trans-border reputation as well as the prior user of the mark
INNOVOLT.

the defendant's counsel.
</p><p id="p_68">       Learned counsel for the defendant has not denied the fact that
the mark INNOVOLT was adopted by the plaintiff in overseas countries
prior to the adoption and using the mark by the defendant. He has
also not denied that the defendant has adopted the trademark
INNOVOLT in the year 2011 in India. The documentary evidence filed
by the plaintiff prima facie would establish that there is a user by itself
or through franchise till 2012 bearing the trademark INNOVOLT which
is prior to the use of defendant.
</p><p id="p_69">28.    The trademark INNOVOLT is not a dictionary word.           It has no
meaning. It appears that it was coined by the plaintiff. It is apparent
that the plaintiff is a foreign party who time and again tried to use the
trademark in India in many ways.           The application filed by the
defendant for registration of the foreign trademarks is questionable.
There is a prohibition of the registration of the similar mark which is
already known and famous mark if the latter mark would cause unfair
advantage or detrimental to the trademark of the plaintiff.               The
defendant is trying to give the justification for adoption and user of the
mark. However, the fact remains that the trademark INNOVOLT is not
a dictionary word.    The defendant cannot give the justification after
splitting the mark if the mark is a coined one by another party who is
claiming himself to be the proprietor of the mark.        The justification
given by the defendant is just an after-thought, as the defendant

 being the subsequent adopter and user of the mark. No other party
can derive the benefit by giving the flimsy justification. The fact
remains that the defendant is not the proprietor of the mark. It has
used the trademark subsequent to the use of the plaintiff. There is no
force if the application filed by the plaintiff after the application of the
defendant as         proposed   to be used.   The plaintiff cannot make the
incorrect statement in the application. In fact, earlier the plaintiff was
exporting the goods in India against the orders. The plaintiff is taking
the advantage of prior user in overseas countries for which they are
entitled under the law. Therefore, it does not make any difference if in
India the user claimed as proposed to be used. The decision referred
by the counsel in the case of Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd.'s
case (supra) does not help him as these facts of foreign user were not
available in that case. In this regard, it is settled law for injunction of
passing off that while considering the application for injunction, the
Court has to see who is the prior user of the mark in question.

first in the world market. In the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_4">Milmet Oftho Industries &amp;
Ors. v. Allergan Inc</a>.,(2004) 12 SCC 624 the Supreme Court has held
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "The Court has to keep in mind the possibility that with the
      passage of time, some conflict may occur between the use
      of the mark by the Applicant in India and the user by the
      overseas company. The Court must ensure that public
      interest is in no way imperiled. It must also be remembered
      that nowadays goods are widely advertised in newspapers,
      periodicals, magazines and other media which is available
      in the country. This results in a product acquiring a
      worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark in respect of a drug is
      associated with the Respondents worldwide it would lead to
      an anomalous situation if an identical Mark in respect of a
      similar drug is allowed to be sold in India. However one note
      of caution must be expressed. Multinational corporations,
      who have no intention of coming to India or introducing
      their product in India should not be allowed to throttle an
      Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a product in
      India, if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the
      mark and developed the product and is first in the market.
      Thus the ultimate test should be who is first in the market."

</p><p id="p_76">33.    One of the essential ingredients is goodwill. The classic case of
passing off as it existed since its genesis always insist the existence of
goodwill of a merchant in order to give him a locally enforceable right
to sue for passing off. This has been explained by Kerly's in his book
called Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (Fourteenth Edition)
(South Asian Edition 2007), wherein the concept of goodwill has
always been categorized as local in character and the learned author
observed thus as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "Since an essential ingredient of passing off is damage (or
       prospective damage) to goodwill, he (the Plaintiff) must
       show that he had, at the date when the Defendants started
       up, in this country not merely a reputation but a goodwill
       capable of being damaged. Goodwill, however, is local; it is
       situated where the business is. Thus a foreign claimant
       may have a reputation in this country-from travellers or
       periodicals of international circulation or, increasingly, from
       exposure on the Internet-yet still fail in an action for
       passing off because he has here no business and so no
       goodwill. Such cases have been not uncommon in recent


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) No.573/2013                                             Page 17 of 40</span>
        years, and have caused considerable difficulty. Where
       there is a substantial reputation here, our courts will often
       accept minimal evidence that a business exists here, but
       there has to be some".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_77">34.    This concept of goodwill and the insistence of localized business
has been traditional concept of passing off which sometimes is called
as classic case of passing off.       The concept of passing off has
undergone changes due to advent of technology and modernization.
The courts entertaining the case of passing off can discount the
localized existence of goodwill and the business in the territory specific
if the substantial nature of reputation has been proved which has some
kind of nexus in the territory where the protection is sought and the
said concept in the modern language is called trans-border reputation
whereas the goodwill is always local in character, the concept of
reputation is dynamic and is all encompassing.
</p><p id="p_78">35.    The reputation of a person can transcend boundaries by virtue of
its advertisement in the newspapers, media circulation, expatriate
reputation due to cultural akinness and all other relevant factors which
connect one country's business with that of another. This has been
aptly explained by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_6">N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, AIR 1995 Delhi 300 wherein
the concept of trans-border reputation was approved in the following
words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "(25) Thus a product and its trade name transcend the
       physical boundaries of a geographical region and acquire a
       trans border or overseas or extraterritorial reputation not
       only though import of goods but also by its advertisement.
       The knowledge and the awareness of the goods of a
       foreign trade and its trade mark can be available at a place
       where goods are not being marketed and consequently not
       being used. The manner in which or the source from which
       the knowledge has been acquired is immaterial".

law laid down by the Division Bench of this Court was again reiterated.
This exposition of 1996 in the case of Whirlpool [supra] has been
further revisited by the Courts in India more importantly in the case of
<a href="/doc/1913188/" id="a_8">Allergan Inc. v. Milment Oftho Industries</a>, 1999 PTC (19) (DB)
160 wherein it has carefully analyzed the interplay between the
goodwill and reputation in a case of passing off action and has laid
down that the Courts in India have followed the third approach which
is a middle path wherein strict insistence of localized business is not
necessary. However, reputation which is sought to be protected has to
be substantial one having global character. The observation made by
Hon'ble Judge is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "13. Reputation is the connection that the public makes
       between a particular product or service and a particular
       source which may or may not be known. Some Courts
       have held that reputation which is built up on the basis of
       trade within the country is entitled to protection from
       passing off. Others Court have made some concession to
       the communication explosion and held that if the plaintiff
       has a reputation in another country, his right to the mark
       will be protected if it is coupled with some actual or
       proposed business activity within the country (See Alain
       Beniardin et Cie v. Pavilion Properties, (1967) RFC 581;
       Amway Corporation. v. Eurway Int. Ltd. (1974) RFC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       82."Still other Courts have held that with the increase in
       international commerce, mass media communications and
       the frequency of the foreign travel, political and geographic
       boundaries do not stem the exchange of ideas and instant
       information. Local business is not an essential ingredient of
       a passing off action. However, the reputation must be well
       established or a known one See : Panhard et Levassor v.
       Panhard Motor Co. Ltd., (1901) 18 RPC 405; Sheraton
       Corpn. v. Sheraton Motels, (1964) RPC 202; Orkin

       Canadian Patent Reporter 433; Vitamins L. D.'s Application
       for Trademark, 1956 (1) RPC 1. The decisions which reflect
       the first and second view have so held for reasons which
       are partly historic, partly geographic and partly because
       reputation was equated with goodwill. Goodwill has been
       defined as the benefit derived from reputation. It is not the
       reputation required to found a passing off action. The law
       of passing off is not trammelled by definitions of goodwill
       developed in the field of revenue law [per <a href="/doc/1783722/" id="a_9">Hockhart J.,
       Conagra Inc. v. McCain Foods (Aust) P. Ltd</a>., 1993 (23) IPR
       193 231]. It is an asset of a business assessable in terms
       of money and transferable (See IRC v. Muller, (1901) AC
       217, Trego v. Hunt (1896) AC 7; ITC v. B.C. Srinivas
       Shetty. In my opinion reputation framing the basis of a
       passing off action need not be so localised. Whatever the
       compulsion for the Courts taking the first or second view in
       other countries, as far as this country is concerned, Courts
       in India prescribe to the third view and have held that a
       plaintiff  with    a   reputation    which     is  established
       internationally can sue to protect it in this country even if it
       does not have any business activity here. In other words
       reputation of a product may precede its introduction and
       may exist without trade in such product in the country. <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_10">See

<p id="p_82">38.    The position of law uptill Milment (supra) has been followed that
the Courts in India by placing reliance on the said decision have
proceeded to grant interim orders to the multi-nationals having their
brands which are of global character and prevented the misuse of the
said brands by protecting trans-border reputation subject to fulfilling of
essential characteristics necessary to prove trans-border reputation.
The decision in the case of Milment (supra) was also rendered in the
year 2004 when the impact of internet, e-commerce, social media was
yet to be seen and realized.

 strengthened and has been taken to another level wherein the court
has not merely relied upon the decision of Milment (supra) and
Whirlpool (supra) but has also extended the principle of trans-border
reputation by observing that the existence of a merchant on web
pages which are of foreign origin and social media are sufficient to
show the trans-border nature of reputation without having any activity
in India at the relevant time. Though it is very broad extension of the
concept of trans-border reputation, but it is a question of fact in each
case as to how the internet documents are sufficient to show the
global character of the trademark and the reputation attached to the
same. The impact of the said decision which has been given very
recently is yet to be seen and analyzed by the other Courts in India in
the   upcoming       times.   Effectively,    the   concept   of   trans-border
reputation and goodwill is interesting in academic sense. However, due
to advent of internet media, international travel, the insistence on the
localized business as well as trans-border reputation is nowadays more
or less dealt with in a kind of presumptive approach rather than by
actual establishment of the same.            As the international businesses
grow and proximity between the markets would increase, over the
time this concept will become weaker and on one good day world will
be treated as one market and injunction order could be passed against
the registered proprietor on the basis of unregistered trademark in an
action of passing off as held in the case of Whirlpool (supra).

<p id="p_85">Passing Off
</p><p id="p_86">40.    Even the test of confusion and deception in order to prove the
case of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of
Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, reported in
(2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Supreme Court while considering a plea
of passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in no uncertain
terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services under a
trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by
the Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
services in the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to
the business of one who has the property in that name. It was held
that honesty and fair play are and ought to be the basic policy in the
world of business and when a person adopts or intends to adopt a
name which already belongs to someone else, it results in confusion,
has the propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone
else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.
</p><p id="p_87">       It was also held in Laxmikant v. Patel (supra) that the
principles which apply to trademark are applicable to trade name also.

       not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently

Research and development of its products in India. However, sales of
a mark have no relevance when there has been dishonest adoption of
a mark. This Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1789155/" id="a_17">Jolen Inc. v. Doctor &amp; Company</a>,

      <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_20">N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a> (1996) 5 SCC 714 :
      1996(16) PTC 583 (<a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_21">SC) and Milmet Oftho Industries v.
      Allergan Inc</a>. (2004) 12 SCC 624. In Whirlpool, the
      worldwide    prior   user   was     given    preference    nay
      predominance over the registered trademark in India of the
      defendant. In Milmet, the marks of pharmaceutical
      preparation were similar but the prior user worldwide had
      not registered its mark in India whereas its adversary had
      done so. This Court approved the grant of an injunction in
      favour of the prior user. Additionally, in the recent decision
      in <a href="/doc/127697258/" id="a_22">S. Syed Mohiden v. P. Sulochana Bai</a> (2015) 7 SCALE
      136, this Court has pithily underscored that the rights in a
      passing-off action emanate from common law and not from
      statutory provisions, nevertheless the prior user's rights will
      override those of a subsequent user even though it had
      been accorded registration of its trademark. Learned
      Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant has endeavoured to
      minimize the relevance of Whirlpool as well as Milmet by
      drawing the distinction that those trademarks had attained
      worldwide reputation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">              However, we think that as world shrinks almost to
      global village, the relevance of the transnational nature of a
      trademark will progressively diminish into insignificance. In
      other words, the attainment of valuable goodwill will have
      ever increasing importance. At the present stage, the
      argument in favour of the Defendant-Appellant that we find
      holds more water is that in both Milmet and Whirlpool, as
      distinct from the case before us, the prior user of the
      successful party predated the date of application for
      registration of the competing party.

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">              The question to examine, then, would be whether
      prior user would have to be anterior to the date of
      application or prior to the user by the Defendant-Appellant.
      In other words, the question before the Court would remain
      whether the situation on the date of application for
      registration alone would be relevant, or whether the
      developments in the period between this date and the date
      of grant of registration would have any bearing on the rights
      of the parties. All these considerations will be cast into a
      curial cauldron to be appreciated by the Court before which

<p id="p_90">43.    As per the decision of this Court in the case of Jolen Inc.
(supra) which has already been discussed in the previous paragraphs,
sales are immaterial. It is denied that the plaintiff has not sold any
goods in India. The plaintiff along with its erstwhile JV partners
Integral Technologies Pvt. Ltd, located in Pune and Asian Electronics
Limited has sold many products all over India.
</p><p id="p_91">44.    None of the judgments referred by the learned counsel for the
defendant is applicable to the facts of the present case. As far as the
decision referred by Mr.Bhatia in Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (supra)
is concerned, the injunction was not granted, as the Court found that
the trans-border reputation is not made out, by referring the
judgments, in which it was held that the plaintiff did not file the
documents/invoices to prove its sale in foreign countries and nothing
was placed on record about the worldwide registrations of the
plaintiff's trademark in different countries or its sale in or outside India
or extensive advertisements in India/foreign magazines. However, the
present case is not of such nature. It is also pertinent to mention that
the issue of goodwill and reputation has already been dealt with by
this Court in subsequent judgment passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.
Muralidhar in the case of Cadbury U.K. Limited (supra). Therefore,
the facts in the case referred are materially different.
</p><p id="p_92">45.    As far as the case of The Gillette Company and others
(supra) is concerned, the injunction in the said case was not granted
and the plaintiff did not produce sufficient material on record to claim
the trans-border reputation in India in respect of the products in
question and further, the use of the trademark FLEXGRIP is protected

 under <a href="/doc/840618/" id="a_23">Section 30(1)(b)</a> of the Act. Such situation has not happened in
the present case, as the trademark INNOVOLT is a famous trademark
in many overseas countries.      The documents in this regard are
available on record. The trademark has also been used in India. The
defendant is not using the mark INNOVOLT as a bonafide description,
rather the defendant after filing of the suit has incorporated the
company by the name of 'Innovolt Powertech Pvt. Ltd.'
</p><p id="p_93">46.     The plaintiff is the prior user of the mark "INNOVOLT" for
electronic and power saving across the world and has been using the
mark "INNOVOLT" ever since 2005. The defendant has themselves
admitted that they have adopted the mark "INNOVOLT" only in 2011.
This is nearly 5 years after the mark "INNOVOLT" of the plaintiff has
earned recognition in the world market and positioned itself as a well-
established mark.
</p><p id="p_94">47.     The other decision referred by Mr.Bhatia of Pioneer Nuts
(supra) the same does not help the case of the defendant as the
defendant in the present case obtained the domain name after filing of
the suit. They have also incorporated the company having the name
Innovolt very recently. In the referred case, the facts of foreign user
mark were missing. In the present case, admittedly the plaintiff has
adopted and used the mark Innovolt in overseas countries prior in
time. Hence, all the versions are distinguishable to the facts and
circumstances in the present case.

 was treated as conclusive. It was held that with the passage of time
the law of requirement of common field of activity in a passing off
action has undergone a radical change and as such there was no
requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim on passing
off action, because the real question in each of such cases is, whether
there is, as a result of mis-representation, a real likelihood of
confusion or deception of the public and consequent damage to the
plaintiff is likely to be caused and if that is taken to be the test then
the focus is shifted from the external objective test of making
comparison of activities of the parties, to the state of mind of public, in
deciding whether it will be confused.

      marks or their close resemblance is only one of the tests for
      determining the question of likelihood of deception or
      confusion. Trade connection between different goods is
      another such test. Ex hypothesis, this latter test applies only
      when the goods are different. These tests are independent
      tests. There is no reason why the test of trade connection
      between different goods should not apply where the
      competing marks closely resemble each other just as much
      as it applies, as held in the "Black Magic" and "Panda"
      cases, where the competing marks were identical. Whether

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       "8.     Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that it is not really
      necessary to consider different judgments of the House of
      Lords because Lord Denning had also observed that the
      defendants would have no defence if the user of the name
      of the defendants is likely to deceive irrespective of the fact
      whether the user was honest and that conclusion of Lord
      Denning is also approved by Lord Devlin who was in
      minority. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that in the present
      case, there is a specific evidence on record that the word
      "Bajaj" was used by the defendants dishonestly and
      deliberately with a view to take advantage of the reputation
      earned by the plaintiffs. The learned counsel referred to us
      to a passage at p. 408 in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and
      Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, and submitted that once
      intent to deceive is established, then the defendants could
      not claim that they were entitled to use word "Bajaj" as a
      trading sign. In support of the submission, the learned
      counsel invited our attention to the brochure (Ex. 'G'
      annexed to the plaint) wherein the defendants have claimed
      that Bajaj quality is well accepted and appreciated
      internationally. Mr. Tulzapurkar points out and it is not in
      dispute that the defendants have never marketed their
      goods abroad, nor have they even claimed that their goods
      are sold all over the country. Mr. Tulzapurkar is right and we
      agree with the learned trial Judge that the brochure
      published in the year 1987 is issued with a view to cause
      deception or confusion in the mind of the customers. The
      word 'Bajaj' has quite a great reputation in the country and
      abroad and the publication of the brochure in year 1987
      clearly indicates that the defendants were not honest in the
      use of the word "Bajaj" and an attempt was made to pass
      off their goods with the mark "Bajaj" with the intention to
      secure advantage of the reputation earned by the plaintiffs.

      the plaintiffs and the defendants are totally different and,
      therefore, there is no cause or apprehension that the use of
      the word "Bajaj" is likely to cause deception or confusion in
      the mind of the public. Mr. Cooper submitted that the
      articles manufactured by the defendants are utensils and
      those marketed by the plaintiffs are electrical goods or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.573/2013                                            Page 30 of 40</span>
       appliances and, therefore, it is unlikely that the purchasers
      of utensils would be confused by the use of the word "Bajaj"
      on the articles of the defendants. The learned counsel
      submitted that the plaintiffs' goods are sold under registered
      mark under Class 11, while the goods manufactured by the
      defendants fall under Class 21. Class 11 refers to
      installations for lighting, heating, steam generating,
      cooking, refrigerating, drying, ventilating, and other
      purposes, while Class 21 refers to small domestic utensils
      and containers (not of precious metal nor coated therewith).
      The submission of Mr. Cooper is that as the articles
      manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are
      different, the question of deception would not arise. It is not
      possible     to   accept    the  submission.    The    articles
      manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are
      kitchen wares and are commonly used in almost every
      kitchen in this country. The mere fact that the articles
      manufactured by the contesting parties are different in
      nature is no answer to the claim that the defendants are
      guilty of passing off. We entirely agree with the conclusion
      recorded by the learned trial Judge that there is identity of
      the goods, the mark and the consumer and the goods
      manufactures by both the plaintiffs and the defendants are
      sold under one shop. Mr. Cooper complained that the
      electric goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the
      stainless steel utensils manufactured by the defendants are
      not sold in one shop. The submission is not accurate
      because it is common experience that kitchen ware or
      kitchen appliances like mixers, grinders, pressure cookers,
      and stainless steel utensils are sold in the same shop. At
      this interim stage, we are not prepared to accept the
      submission of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no
      reason to take different view from that of the
      learned single Judge on this aspect. In our judgment, prima
      facie, it is clear that the defendants have intentionally and
      dishonestly tried to pass off their goods by use of name
      "Bajaj".

<p id="p_101"> In case on the date of adoption, it is found, he was aware about the
mark of the rightful owner, the using of the mark and filing of
application in the Trade Marks office is fraudulent.       As dishonesty
starts from the beginning itself the subsequent user is to be
considered as tainted, as the party was aware that the mark actually
belongs to other party and he is not the owner of the same.             It is
totally immaterial if the registration is objected of a copied mark of a
party who adopted and used the mark in earlier point of time. There is
not much difference, if the registration is obtained on the basis of non-
filing of opposition. The main reason is that it is for the Court to decide
the common law remedy wherein the interim order can be passed. The
Trade Marks Registry or the Appellant Board are not empowered to
pass the interim order against the party who has appropriated the
mark deliberately. The party who has stolen the mark cannot claim the
benefit of      concurrent user   because   the   governing   principle       of
concurrent user lies on account of honesty. It is also immaterial if the
defendant has filed the application prior in time or owner of the mark
has claimed user as proposed to be used if the mark is already known
and used in overseas countries.

and Co. Ltd., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at page 181 that "in my judgment,
the circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the
first instance are of considerable importance when one comes to
consider whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest
user.    If the user in its inception was tainted it would be difficult in
most cases to purify it subsequently". It was further noted by the
learned Judge in that case that he could not regard the discreditable
origin of the user as cleansed by the subsequent history."

<p id="p_103"> Delay, if any
</p><p id="p_104">53.     The suit has been filed in the year 2013. The plaintiff is a foreign
company. There is no much delay in bringing the action. The delay, if
any, for some period cannot debar the interim orders sought by the
plaintiff. In the case of <a href="/doc/134913/" id="a_27">M/s. Bengal Waterproof Ltd. vs. M/s.
Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Co</a>., AIR 1997 SC 1398 it was
held as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      "20.........It is now well settled that an action for passing
      off is a common law remedy being an action in substance
      of deceit under the Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever
      fresh deceitful act is committed the person deceived
      would naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour.
      Thus every time when a person passes off his goods as
      those of another he commits the act of such deceit.
      Similarly whenever and wherever a person commits
      breach of a registered trade mark of another he commits
      a recurring act of breach or infringement of such trade
      mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each
      time of such infringement to the party aggrieved. It is
      difficult to agree how in such a case when in historical
      past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not
      maintainable in absence of proper relief, for all times to
      come in future defendant of such a suit should
      be armed with a license to go on committing fresh acts of
      infringement and passing off with impunity without being
      subjected to any legal action against such future
      acts."
</blockquote><p id="p_105">54.     The ratio of the aforesaid decisions is squarely applicable to the
facts of the present case. Thus, injunction cannot be refused on
account of delay as the plaintiff has made a strong prima facie case of
passing off. Even otherwise, from the facts in the present case, there
is no much delay in bringing the action by the plaintiff against the
defendants.        The plaintiff has filed the suit against the defendant in
2013.        The       defendant     has     admitted     that       it      has
launched the product in 2011. There is a small delay of more than one

suit for the purpose of collecting documents and preparing the
papers. Thus, prima facie, said plea has no force.

<p id="p_106">Domain Name
</p><p id="p_107">55.    Domain names are entitled to the protection as a trademark and
the trademark law applies to the activities on internet. The mere fact
that petitioner has no registered domain name by itself may not stand
in the way of a passing off action. The defendant has obtained the
domain name as per plaintiff after filing of the suit. The following are
the decisions in which the domain name is protected by the Courts:
</p><p id="p_108">a)     In Marks and Spencer v. One in a Million, (1998) FSR 265, it
       was held that any person who deliberately registers a domain
       name on account of its similarity to the name, brand name or
       trademark of an unconnected commercial organization must
       expect to find himself on the receiving end of an injunction to
       restrain the threat of passing off, and the injunction will be in
       terms which will make the name commercially useless to the
       dealer.       It was held in that decision that the name MARKS &amp;
       SPENCER could not have been chosen for any other reasons than
       that it was associated with the well known retailing group. The
       decision further goes on to say that when the value of the name
       consists solely in its resemblance to the name or trademark of
       another enterprise, the court will normally assume that the
       public is likely to be deceived, for why else would the defendants
       choose it ? It was also stated that someone seeking or coming
       upon a website called http://marksandspencer.co.uk would
       naturally assume that it was that of the plaintiffs.

<p id="p_109"> b)     <a href="/doc/1597432/" id="a_28">In Acqua Minerals Ltd. v. Pramod Borse and Another</a>, 2001
       PTC 619, while considering an injunction sought to restrain the
       defendants from using the mark BISLERI or BISLERI.COM the
       court observed that so far as the Registering Authority of the
       domain name is concerned it agrees for registration of domain
       name only to one person. That is on first come first serve basis.
       If any person gets the domain name registered with the
       Registering Authority which appears to be the trade name of
       some other person, the Registering Authority has no mechanism
       to inquire whether the domain name sought to be registered is
       in prior existence and belongs to another person.       The court
       referring to Rule 4 of the Domain Name Registration Policy
       observed thus as under:-

           to why did he choose a particular name for registration
           as a domain name or for that purpose as a trade name
           which was already in long and prior existence and has
           established its goodwill and reputation there is no other
           inference to be drawn than that the said person wanted
           to trade in the name of the trade name he has picked
           up for registration or as a domain name because of its
           being an established name with widespread reputation
           and goodwill achieved at huge cost and expenses
           involved in the advertisement.'

       209, the Bombay High Court, while granting an injunction
       restraining the defendants from using the mark/domain name
       "RADIFF" or any other similar name, it was held that when two
       similar domain names are considered there is every possibility of
       internet user being confused and deceived in believing that both
       domain names belong to one common source and connection
       although the two belong to two different persons.        Once the

        intention to deceive is established, the Court should not make
       further enquiry about the likelihood of confusion. If it is found
       that a man's object in doing that which he did was to deceive,
       that he had an intention to deceive the Court, will very much
       infer that his object has been achieved, if the facts tend to show
       that, that is the case and to say that his intention to deceive
       ripening into receipt gives ground for an injunction.

       (25) PTC 61 (Del) the plaintiff was a producer of a news
       program       under   the   name   and   style   AAJ   TAK     while     the
       defendant's adopted the name KHABAREIN AAJ TAK in respect of
       newspapers.       The mark of the defendants was an exact
       reproduction of the plaintiff's mark.       The Court observed that
       while the words "Aaj" and "Tak" may be individually descriptive
       and may not be monopolized by any person, but their
       combination does provide protection as a trade name if it has
       been in long, prior and continuous user and it gets identified
       with such persons.

           they accidentally arrived at a different but similar web

           conclude that the first domain name owner had mis-
           represented its goods or services through its

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">           12. The services of the plaintiff under the
           trademark/domain name 'Yahoo!' have been widely
           publicised and written about globally. In an Internet
           service, a particular Internet site could be reached by
           anyone anywhere in the world who proposes to visit the
           said Internet site. With the advancement and progress
           in technology, services rendered in the Internet has
           also come to be recognised and accepted and are being
           given protection so as to protect such provider of
           service from passing off the services rendered by others
           as that of the Plaintiff. As a matter of fact in a matter
           where services rendered through the domain name in
           the Internet, a very alert vigil is necessary and a strict
           view is to be taken for its easy access and reach by
           anyone from any corner of the globe. There can be no
           two opinions that the two marks/domain names

           action for passing off for in such a case there is every

prima-facie case for the grant of ad-interim injunction, as the

identical or allied and cognate goods. The balance of convenience also
lies in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant, as the
