<p id="p_1">IA. No.19122/2014
</p><p id="p_2">1.    This application is filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC seeking an
interim injunction to restrain the defendant, its directors, assignees, etc. from
manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising or dealing in medicinal
preparations under the impugned trade mark „DECITAS‟ or any other mark
which is structurally or deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s registered trade
mark „DECITEX‟ registered under Class 5 or any act of passing off of the
defendant‟s business or goods.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The accompanying suit is filed seeking a decree of permanent
injunction, an order for delivery of the infringing goods and a decree for

 damages and costs.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff is a Company registered
under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 2013 and is wholly owned subsidiary of Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. which is ranked as one of the top five pharma
companies in India which was set up in India in 1983. It is stated that one of
the preparations manufactured by the plaintiff, is under the trade mark
DECITEX which is a coined mark. The said product is used for treating
cancer/chemotherapy. It is stated that the product DECITEX contains a
salt/molecule Decitabine.     It is further pleaded that the trade mark
DECITEX was coined by the plaintiff‟s predecessor as trade mark in July,
2011 and enjoys inherent distinctiveness indicating trade origin and source
of the goods. The said trade mark has been used extensively and
commercially by the plaintiff in the course of medicinal preparations since
December, 2011. It has acquired formidable goodwill and reputation as a
badge of quality for cancer and originating from the plaintiff. The trade
mark DECITEX was registered in India under Class 5 on 15.07.2011. The
name of the subsequent proprietor was also duly registered by an application
dated 03.09.2013 with the Trade Mark Registry. Hence, the plaintiff has
statutory rights to the exclusive use of its registered trade mark DECITEX. It
is stated that the goodwill and reputation of the trade mark DECITEX is
evident from the statement of annual accounts and promotional expenditure.
In 2013-14 sales figures were Rs. 382.19 lakhs and the promotional
expenses were approximately Rs. 19.11 lakhs. It is further stated that the
mark DECITEX is a well known mark as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/1981744/" id="a_2">Section 2(1)</a>
(zg) of the Trade Mark Act.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    The defendant is also a Company incorporated under the Companies



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                             Page 2 of 19</span>
 Act, 2013 and is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing
pharmaceutical preparations. It is stated that in the second week of
September 2014, the plaintiff through its field force came across defendant‟s
product under the impugned trade mark DECITAS which is deceptively
similar to the plaintiff‟s trade mark DECITEX. Further the defendant‟s drug
is used for treatment of the same ailment, namely, cancer.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    It is stated that the plaintiff conducted a search of the defendant‟s
impugned trade mark with the Trade Mark Registry and found that an
application for the mark DECITAS dated 19.04.2014 was applied by the
defendant as "proposed to be used". This application has yet to be
advertised. It is vehemently stated that the defendant‟s trade mark DECITAS
is visually, structurally, phonetically and deceptively similar to the
plaintiff‟s trade mark DECITEX.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    It is stated that the defendant has malafidely adopted the trade mark
DECITAS in April 2014 for the sale of its product which amounts to unfair
trade practice and unfair competition. It is pleaded that the conduct of the
defendant is unethical, unfair, lacks bona fide and is unlawful.
</p><p id="p_8">7.    The defendant has filed its written statement and the reply to the
interim application. It has been pleaded in the written statement:-
</p><p id="p_9">(i)   That DECITAS and DECITEX are both based on the drug/molecule
Decitabine. The prefix „DECI‟ in the trade name of the plaintiff and
defendant represents the molecule or the active ingredient present in the
drugs manufactured by both the parties. It is stated that no one can claim
monopoly over a name or short name of a molecule/active ingredient of the
drug. The plaintiff‟s DECITEX is not a coined word and is merely based on
active ingredient Decitabine.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                                 Page 3 of 19</span>
<p id="p_10"> (ii)    It is further stated that the name of the molecule Decitabine is publici
juris and is common to trade. No person can claim monopoly of the name.
</p><p id="p_11">(iii)   It is further pleaded that suffix of both the competing marks
DECITAS and DECITEX i.e. „TAS‟ and „TEX‟ are totally phonetically and
visually different. In fact, it is stated that in the adoption of the trade mark
DECITAS, the prefix „DECI‟ indicates the molecule decitabine and the
suffix „TAS‟ represents the name of the Company that manufacture the drug
i.e. „INTAS‟ respectively. It is pleaded that it is common methodology in
pharma industry to name medicines/products/trade marks by using a
combination of an abbreviation of the molecule with the corporate/company
name. Some of the registered trademarks of the defendant company are
AMTAS, CEFDITAS, CEFTAS, etc. It is reiterated that „TAS‟ suffix is
used by the defendant in most of its products.
</p><p id="p_12">(iv)    There are several other trademarks with the prefix „DECI‟ which
disentitles the plaintiff from making out any case of infringement of the
trade mark. The abbreviation of „DECI‟ cannot be monopolised by the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_13">8.      I may note that when this matter came up for hearing on the first date
on 30.09.2014, learned counsel for the defendant had entered appearance
and had sought time to file written statement. No interim orders were
passed on that date. Subsequently, the defendant filed IA No. 4165/2016
under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC pleading that the plaintiff has its Registered
(Principal) Office in Mumbai and the suit cannot be instituted in courts
within the territory of Delhi. This application was dismissed by this court on
27.01.2017.
</p><p id="p_14">9.      I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                               Page 4 of 19</span>
<p id="p_15"> 10.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff has reiterated that the impugned drug
DECITAS is structurally and phonetically identical to the plaintiff‟s trade
mark DECITEX. He further stresses that both the drugs are used for the
treatment of the same aliment, namely, cancer/chemotherapy. He further
states that there has been no delay on the part of the plaintiff in filing the
suit. The defendant entered into in the market in 2014. The drug approval of
the defendant is of 19.04.2014. The present suit was filed within three
months thereafter. He further states that even if the plea of the defendant is
accepted about the salt Decitabine, the defendant are free to use the word
„DECI‟ but need to change the suffix so that the word which is coined is not
visually and phonetically similar to that of the plaintiff‟s. He relies upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_3">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. (2001) 5 SCC 73, and in the case of <a href="/doc/120264982/" id="a_4">Neon
Laboratories Ltd. v. Medical Technologies Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>., 2016 (2) SCC 672
and the judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/88182074/" id="a_5">Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd.
vs. Lupin Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., 2018 (74) PTC 103.
</p><p id="p_16">11.     Learned senior counsel for the defendant has pleaded as follows:-
</p><p id="p_17">(i)     He pleads that the name of the defendant Company manufacturing the
drug is Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. „TAS‟ is a suffix for respective
trademarks of many products/drugs manufactured by the defendant. There
are 23 registered trademarks with the said suffix „TAS‟.
</p><p id="p_18">(ii)    He further pleads that the plaintiff has clearly stated that they have no
objection in case the prefix „DECI‟ is used. The explanation for using „TAS‟
is already stated and hence, the plaintiff cannot possibly have any objection
to the use of the trade mark „DECITAS‟.
</p><p id="p_19">(iii)   He relies upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of F.

<p id="p_20"> <a href="/doc/1389940/" id="a_6">Hoffmann-La Roche and Company Ltd. vs. Geoffrey Manners and
Company Pvt. Ltd</a>., AIR 1970 SC 2062 and the judgment of this Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_7">Astrazeneca UK Limited and Anr. vs. Orchid Chemicals and
Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., 2007(34) PTC 469 (Del).
</p><p id="p_21">(iv)   It is further stated that the defendant launched its product in 2014.
Sales figures are above Rs.5 crores. Hence, it is pleaded that this Court may
not at this stage i.e. five years after filing of the suit pass any interim
injunction in favour of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_22">12.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff in rejoinder has specifically stated
that the judgments citied by the learned senior counsel for the defendant are
prior to the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_8">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.(supra) which is a judgment of Three-Judge
Bench which would squarely apply to the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_23">13.    There is hardly any controversy regarding the basic facts. The
plaintiff has been using the trade mark DECITEX for its medicinal
preparations used for cancer/chemotherapy since July 2011. The said trade
mark was registered on 15.07.2011. The defendant launched its drug for
cancer/chemotherapy using the trade mark DECITAS in the year 2014. An
application for registration of the same was filed on 19.04.2014 which stated
that the said trade mark is proposed to be used.
</p><p id="p_24">14.    It is obvious that the plaintiff has statutory and common law rights in
the registered trade mark DECITEX. The issue is as to whether the
impugned trade mark used by the defendant DECITAS is deceptively
similar to that of the plaintiff‟s trade mark DECITEX. In this context
reference may be had to the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_9">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.(surpa). The said

 judgment pertains to medicine sold under the brand name of Falcitab sold by
the respondent as compared to the medicine Falcigo used by the appellant.
The Supreme Court formulated the test as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "16. Dealing once again with medicinal products, this Court in F.
    Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. Ltd. Vs. Geoffrey Manner &amp; Co. Pvt.
    Ltd., 1969(2) SCC 716 had to consider whether the word
    "Protovit" belonging to the appellant was similar to the word
    "Dropovit" of the respondent. This Court, while deciding the test
    to be applied, observed at page 720-21 as follows:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         The test for comparison of the two word marks were
         formulated by Lord Parker in Pianotist Co. Ltd.s
         application as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         You must take the two words. You must judge of them,
         both by their look and by their sound. You must consider
         the goods to which they are to be applied. You must
         consider the nature and kind of customer who would be
         likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all
         the surrounding circumstances; and you must further
         consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade
         marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the
         goods of the respective owners of the marks. If,
         considering all those circumstances, you come to the
         conclusion that there will be a confusion, that is to say,
         not necessarily that one man will be injured and the
         other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a
         confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to
         confusion in the goods-then you may refuse the
         registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in
         that case.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">    It is necessary to apply both the visual and phonetic tests. <a href="/doc/133524703/" id="a_10">In Aristoc
    Ltd. v. Rysta Ltd. the House of Lords</a> was considering the resemblance
    between the two words "Aristoc" and "Rysta". The view taken was that
    considering the way the words were pronounced in English, the one
    was likely to be mistaken for the other. Viscount Maugham cited the
    following passage of Lord Justice Lukmoore in the Court of Appeal,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                             Page 7 of 19</span>
     which passage, he said, he completely accepted as the correct
    exposition of the law:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         The answer to the question whether the sound of one
         word resembles too nearly the sound of another so as to
         bring the former within the limits of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_11">Section 12</a> of the
         Trade Marks Act, 1938, must nearly always depend on
         first impression, for obviously a person who is familiar
         with both words will neither be deceived nor confused.
         It is the person who only knows the one word and has
         perhaps an imperfect recollection of it who is likely to
         be deceived or confused. Little assistance, therefore, is
         to be obtained from a meticulous comparison of the two
         words, letter by letter and syllable by syllable,
         pronounced with the clarity to be expected from a
         teacher of elocution. The Court must be careful to make
         allowance for imperfect recollection and the effect of
         careless pronunciation and speech on the part not only of
         the person seeking to buy under the trade description,
         but also of the shop assistant ministering to that persons
         wants.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">    It is important that the marks must be compared as wholes. It is not
    right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion
    of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in
    the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion.
    The true test is whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is
    such that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in
    the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark. Thus
    in Lavroma case Lord Johnston said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">         we are not bound to scan the words as we would in a
         question of comparatio literarum. It is not a matter for
         microscopic inspection, but to be taken from the general
         and even casual point of view of a customer walking
         into a shop."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">    On the facts of that case this Court came to the conclusion that
    taking into account all circumstances the words Protovit and
    Dropovit were so dissimilar that there was no reasonable



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                             Page 8 of 19</span>
     probability of confusion between the words either from visual or
    phonetic point of view.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                xxxxxxxx


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">    19. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of
    phonetic similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which
    the competing words are written is different and the conclusion so
    arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding precedent of this Court
    in Amritdharas case (supra) where the phonetic similarity was
    applied by judging the two competing marks. Similarly, in Durga
    Dutt Sharmas case (supra), it was observed that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
         doubt, make out that the use of the defendants mark is
         likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the
         plaintiffs and the defendants mark is so close either
         visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches
         the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
         evidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights
         are violated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                xxxxxxxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">    24. In the case of R.J. Strasenburgh Co. Vs. Kenwood
    Laboratories, Inc. reported in 106 USPQ 379, as noted in the
    decision of Morgenstern Chemical Company‟s case (supra), it had
    been held that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">    Physicians are not immune from confusion or mistake.
    Furthermore it is common knowledge that many prescriptions
    are telephoned to the pharmacists and others are handwritten,
    and frequently handwriting is not unmistakably legible. These
    facts enhance the chances of confusion or mistake by the
    pharmacists in filling the prescription if the marks appear too
    much alike when handwritten or sound too much alike when
    pronounced."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      27. As far as present case is concerned, although both the drugs are
      sold under prescription but this fact alone is not sufficient to
      prevent confusion which is otherwise likely to occur. In view of
      the varying infrastructure for supervision of physicians and
      pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic,
      urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with
      high degree of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict
      measurers to prevent any confusion arising from similarity of
      marks among medicines are required to be taken."

<p id="p_25">15.    <a href="/doc/120264982/" id="a_12">In Neon Laboratories Limited vs.Medical Technologies Limited and
Others</a> (supra) the Supreme Court was dealing with a trademark used by the
plaintiff PROFOL. In contrast, the defendant was using the trademark
ROFOL. In those facts the Supreme Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">         "3. It has been pleaded that the predecessor-in-title of
         respondent-Plaintiff 1 had coined and invented the trade
         mark Profol in April 1998 and not applied for registration of the
         said trade mark on 24-5-1998 in Class V. However, it seems to
         us that this claim may not find acceptance inasmuch as Profol is
         almost an anagram of and is phonetically almost
         indistinguishable from the molecular compound, namely,
         "Propofol". In our opinion, to claim exclusivity of the user, the
         trade mark should normally partake of a new creation, or if an
         existing word, it should not bear descriptive characteristics so
         far as the product is concerned, nor should it be of an extolment
         or laudation. It would be surprising if exclusivity is given to
         marks such as "bestsoap", etc. Having said this, we must accept
         the reality that in the pharmaceutical industry it is commonplace
         that trade marks reproduce and resonate the constituent
         composition. While this aspect and feature may be a good
         ground for declining registration of the trade mark, it may
         nevertheless remain a favourable determinant in a passing off

           action. So far as the subject trade marks are concerned, not only
          do their names constitute part of the generic drug "Propofol",
          but they are also so similar that even the medical
          practitioner/anaesthesiologist concerned could fail to discern the
          difference between them."</blockquote>

<p id="p_28">17.   Hence, the test to see as to whether the trade mark of the defendant is
deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff is as to whether the essential
features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the
defendant. Phonetic similarity would constitute an important index. To see
as to whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading similarity to another,
the rival marks have to be compared as a whole. All the surrounding
circumstances have to be considered. Further the competing marks have to
be compared keeping in mind a unwary purchaser of average intelligence
and imperfect recollection. In my opinion, the mark used by the defendant
DECITAS when compared as a whole is structurally and phonetically prima
facie identical and similar to the trade mark of the plaintiff DECITEX. That
apart, likelihood of confusion in this case is much more as the drugs of the
respective    parties   deal    with    the     same   medical   problem     i.e.
cancer/chemotherapy. Strong measures are required to prevent confusion
arising from similarities of marks in medicines. In my opinion, there is no
merit in the plea of the defendant that the mark of the defendant is not
deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                               Page 13 of 19</span>
 for the defendant. It has been vehemently argued that the suffix 'TAS' has
been taken from the name of the defendant Company i.e. Intas
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. It has also been pleaded that the plaintiff has no
objection to the use of the prefix 'DECI' by the defendant and hence, he
cannot object to the trade mark DECITAS. This plea is misplaced.

         "We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is
         well known that the question whether the two marks are
         likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first
         impression. It is for the court to decide that question.
         English cases proceeding on the English way of
         pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it
         may be stated is not always the same, may not be of
         much assistance in our country in deciding questions of
         phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word
         is an English word which to the mass of the Indian people
         is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in deciding a
         question of similarity between two marks, the marks have
         to be considered as a whole. So considered, we are
         inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks with
         which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from the
         syllable 'co' in the appellant's mark, the two marks are
         identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as

              would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the
             one mark from the other."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">20.    Hence, the attempt of the learned senior counsel for the defendant in
splitting the impugned trade mark DECITAS to claim the prefix „DECI‟ is
copied from the molecule Decitabine and the word „TAS‟ is copied from the
name of the defendant Intas Pharmaceutical ltd. is a misplaced contention.
The marks have to be compared as a whole and cannot be split up to justify
the use of the impugned trade mark.
</p><p id="p_32">21.    Leaned senior counsel for the defendant has also relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1389940/" id="a_24">Hoffmann-La Roche and
Company Ltd. vs. Geoffrey Manners and Company Pvt. Ltd</a>.(supra). In
that case the Supreme Court was considering as to whether the mark
DROPVIT is deceptively similar to the mark PROTOVIT. The Court held as
follows:-.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      "13. In order to decide whether the word "DROPOVIT" is
      deceptively similar to the word "PROTOVIT" each of the two
      words must, therefore, be taken as a whole word. Each of the two
      words consists of eight letters, the last three letters are common,
      and in the uncommon part the first two are consonants, the next
      is the same vowel 'o', the next is a consonant and the fifth is
      again a common vowel 'o'. The combined effect is to produce an
      alliteration. The affidavits of the appellant indicate that the last
      three letters "VIT" is a well known common abbreviation used in
      the pharmaceutical trade to denote Vitamin preparations. In his
      affidavit dated January 11, 1961 Frank Murdoch, has referred to
      the existence on the Register of about 57 trade marks which have
      the common suffix "VIT" indicating that the goods are vitamin
      preparations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      14. It is apparent that the terminal syllable "VIT" in the two
      marks is both descriptive and common to the trade. If greater




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(COMM) 1206/2016                                               Page 15 of 19</span>
         regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words, it is
        difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with
        the other. The letters „D‟ and „P‟ in "DROPOVIT" and the
        corresponding letters „P‟ and „T‟ in "PROTOVIT" cannot
        possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so
        dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion
        between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of
        view.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">        17. Having taken into account all circumstances of the present
        case we are of the opinion that the High Court and the Joint
        Registrar of Trade Marks were right in holding that there was no
        real tangible danger of confusion if respondent's trade was
        allowed to continue to remain on the Register and the application
        for rectification made by the appellant should be dismissed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">22.      Hence, in those facts that the Supreme Court came to a conclusion
that „VIT‟ is well known common abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical
trade to denote vitamin preparations. There is no factual similarity with this
case.

       Single Judge. In our considered opinion, where the marks are
      distinct and the features are found to be dis-similar, they are not
      likely to create any confusion. It is also admitted by the parties
      that there is a difference in the price of the two products. The
      very fact that the two pharmaceutical products, one of the
      appellants/plaintiffs and the other of the respondent/ defendant,
      are being sold at different prices itself ensures that there is no
      possibility of any deception/confusion, particularly in view of
      the fact that customer who comes with the intention of
      purchasing the product of the appellants/plaintiffs would never
      settle for the product of the respondent/defendant which is
      priced much lower. It is apparent that the trademarks on the two
      products, one of the appellants/plaintiffs and the other of the
      respondent/defendant, are totally dissimilar and different."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">24.    A closure look at the judgment will show that the court had come to a
conclusion that taken as a whole the suffix of the two names distinguishes
and differentiates the two products. When they are taken as a whole the
aforesaid two trademarks cannot said to be either phonetically or visually or
in any manner deceptively similar to each other. The Court concluded as
follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">       "19....It is true that the aforesaid words/trade names cannot be
       deciphered or considered separately, but must be taken as a
       whole. But even if they are taken as a whole, the prefix 'Mero'
       used with suffix in the two competing names, distinguishes
       and differentiates the two products. When they are taken as a
       whole, the aforesaid two trade marks cannot be said to be
       either phonetically or visually or in any manner deceptively
       similar to each other."</blockquote>

<p id="p_36">       Hence, on the facts the court took the view that the two marks are
neither visually nor phonetically similar to each other.

 plaintiff, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_26">Cadila Health
Care Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. (supra) which is a later
judgment of Three-Judge Bench is fully applicable to the facts of this case.

the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1389940/" id="a_27">Hoffmann-La Roche and Company Ltd.
vs. Geoffrey Manners and Company Pvt. Ltd</a>.(supra) is misplaced.
</p><p id="p_38">26.   It is lastly pleaded by the learned senior counsel for the defendant that
the defendant had launched the drug in 2014 and the sales of the drug are
now above Rs. 5 crores a year. Hence, this court may not grant any interim
injunction in favour of the plaintiff. I do not find this contention at all
persuasive. When this application for injunction came up for the first
hearing, injunction was not granted as the defendant appeared on seeing the
matter on the list and sought time to file written statement. Subsequently,
this application could not be heard for one reason or the other including a
couple of adjournments taken by the learned counsel for the defendant. On
10.07.2015, the defendant vehemently argued that the present suit is not
maintainable as this court lacks territorial jurisdiction. On 30.08.2016
defendant filed IA No. 4165/2016 under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC raising the
same objection about the territorial jurisdiction. This application was heard
and dismissed on 27.01.2017. It is only thereafter that on the present
application, arguments were heard. In my opinion, substantial time has been
spent adjudicating upon the preliminary objection raised by the defendant
about the lack of territorial jurisdiction of this court to adjudicate the present
suit. The said objection was rejected. I do not see how the defendant can be
permitted to take advantage of this delay which was primarily on account of
the preliminary objection raised by the defendant.

<p id="p_39"> 27.   In my opinion, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case. The
plaintiff have approached the court within three months of launch of the
drug by the defendant. Balance of convenience is also in favour of the
plaintiff. An injunction order is passed restraining the defendant from
manufacturing, selling, advertising or dealing in the drug/medicinal
preparations using the impugned trade mark „DECITAS‟ or any other mark
which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s registered trade mark
