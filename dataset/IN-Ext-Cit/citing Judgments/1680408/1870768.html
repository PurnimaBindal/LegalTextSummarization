                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      In these three writ petitions the challenge is against the orders passed

by the respondents terminating the service of the petitioners. The facts are

narrated and documents are referred to as contained in Writ Petition

No.11393/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   In Writ Petition No.11393/2008, the petitioners have been

appointed in the post of Office Assistant, Service Assistant and

Management Assistant. In the other two writ petitions also the posts are

designated respectively as Office Assistant, Service Assistant and

Management Assistant. The pleas raised by the petitioners in a nutshell are

the following:
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   The second respondent is a company registered under the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> under the control of the State of Kerala. It came into

existence on 1.4.2001. The petitioners were appointed on a temporary

basis on daily wages initially.         The second respondent published a

notification dated 4.8.2004 inviting applications to which the petitioners

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">11393/08                               2</span>

responded. Meanwhile, by the notice of agenda produced as Ext.P1, a

proposal was mooted to regularize the remaining staff who were working on

consolidated pay structure or in daily wages structure. In the agenda, the

item covered on the said point is item No.5 wherein it is stated that there are

23 numbers of casual employees who are in daily wages and engaged on

regular basis. Subsequently, in the 23rd meeting of the Board this proposal

was examined and a sub committee was constituted for finalizing the same.

The said committee consisted of the then Minister for Agriculture as

Chairperson, Agricultural Production Commissioner and Chief Executive

Officer. Ext.P2 is the relevant extract of the minutes. It was resolved that the

committee was constituted for the purpose of finalising the proposal and

the committee will take appropriate decision after evaluating the proposal.

The report of the committee is produced as Ext.P3.      This was considered in

the 25th Board Meeting dated 25.1.2006. It is stated that going by the

decision taken, as evidenced by Ext.P4, the petitioners were entitled to be

regularized. The Board conducted an interview and accordingly orders

were issued as Exts.P5 (a) to (e) appointing them in service.            In the

appointment order it is further stated that the appointment will be

provisional and they will be in probation for a period of one year from

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">11393/08                               3</span>

1.1.2006. The same is issued by the Chief Executive Officer. Just       before

the completion of one year, the period of probation was extended by a

period of    three months.     But subsequently they were issued notice

terminating their service with effect from 31.3.2007.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. These    termination orders were challenged in Writ Petition

No.11174/2007 and connected cases. After hearing the respondents, the

orders of termination were quashed for want of notice to the petitioners.

The orders were directed to be treated as notices and they were directed to

be given a hearing by the competent authority before passing appropriate

orders.     Accordingly,     the  petitioners   submitted   their   individual

representations. Again, rejecting their contentions, the orders of termination

have been issued as Exts.P9 to P13 and similar orders in other writ petitions.

</p><p id="p_5">       5. The above orders are under challenge on various grounds. Mainly,

it is contended that there are no reasons for terminating their service. They

have been appointed after a valid decision taken by the Board of Directors

to regularize them. They have completed the period of probation also

without any complaint. There is real need to continue them. The important

contention raised is that only the Board is competent to terminate their

service and herein the orders of termination are issued by the Chief

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">11393/08                               4</span>

Executive Officer who is not the appointing authority at all.

</p><p id="p_6">      6. The respondents have filed a detailed counter affidavit and an

additional counter affidavit sustaining the orders of termination.      The

apparent contention raised is that there was no decision to regularize their

service and the proposal was only in respect of contract employees and

regarding others, further report was awaited and before consideration of the

matter, the Chief Executive Officer appointed the petitioners. The further

contentions raised are that the method of recruitment provided in the

Regulations have not been followed and not even an open advertisement

was issued and no selection process was undertaken. The petitioners were

only daily waged employees and that the said appointment was also without

following any procedure.       Some of the petitioners have gained the

appointment without having even the qualification for the respective post .

There are lot of irregularities in the matter of appointment. Relying upon

the provisions of the Regulations, learned counsel for the respondents

disputed the contention that only the Board of Directors are competent to

pass orders in the matter. Regarding the competency of the Chief Executive

Officer, it is pointed out that the Board of Directors passed necessary

resolution to delegate the power to the Chief Executive Officer and

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">11393/08                                5</span>

subsequently the decisions have been ratified by the Board also. Further, the

appointing authority is the Chief Executive Officer and the petitioners have

been appointed by the orders of the Chief Executive Officer at that point of

time.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       7.  Reliance is placed by learned counsel for the petitioners on

Regulation 13 which is extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "13. Termination of Service: The service of an employee of the

       council may be terminated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (a) as a result of disciplinary action taken against him in accordance

             with these rules.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (b) in the event of the employee being declared medically unfit for

       further continuance in the Council's service.

       Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 13 or any other rules

       contained herein, the Board may terminate the service of an

       employee, in the event it is proved that he/she has secured a job in the

       council by furnishing wrong or misleading information."

</blockquote><p id="p_8">It is contended that going by sub-regulations (a) and (b), they govern cases

of disciplinary action or action in the case of an employee being declared

medically unfit. But, going by the non-obstante clause therein, the Board

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">11393/08                              6</span>

alone can terminate the service of an employee in the event it is proved that

he/she has secured a job in the council by furnishing wrong or misleading

information.    Learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon various

decisions also in support of the plea. It is contended that the resolutions

delegating the power to the Chief Executive Officer, cannot be sustained, as

the power conferred on the Board of Directors is a quasi-judicial power and

not merely administrative.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       8. The Regulations defining "appointing authority" under clause 2(1)

is to the following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "'APPOINTING AUTHORITY' means the Chief Executive or any

       other officer or agency to whom the board may delegate powers to

       make appointments to various posts in the council."

</blockquote><p id="p_10">Sub-clause 9 mentions about disciplinary authority which is defined as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">       "'DISCIPLINARY AUTHOIRTY' means an officer or authority

       competent to impose penalties as provided in these rules."

The main question raised is whether it is the Chief Executive Officer or the

Board that is having the power to pass the order of termination. Of course,

going by clause 13 of the non-obstante clause therein, the Board is

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">11393/08                              7</span>

conferred with power in case of any irregular or illegal appointment.

</p><p id="p_12">      9. In the additional counter affidavit, a resolution and an Office order

have been produced s Ext.R2(g) and R2(h). Item 5 of the resolution dated

19.8.2001 concerns delegation of powers to the Chief Executive Officer.

The resolution is to the effect that the draft of the delegation of powers to

the Chief Executive Officer of the Council is approved. Ext.R2(h) is the

consequential office order issued in accordance with the resolution.        It

carries the heading `delegation of powers to the Chief Executive Officer.'

Item I bears the heading `general' and item II bears the heading 'personnel'.

Item 2 is extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "II. PERSONNEL

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       i) xxxxxxxxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       ii) xxxxxxxxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       iii) To discharge, dismiss, remove or terminate from service, any

       employee of the Council based on good and sufficient reasons and

       subject to departmental proceedings, as per the staff regulations of

       the Council.</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">       iv) xxxxxxx

The powers to make appointments and the power to discharge, dismiss,

remove or terminate from service subject to the departmental proceedings

and as per the staff regulations of the council is delegated to the Chief

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">11393/08                              8</span>

Executive Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      10.   The question is whether the said delegation will satisfy the

express clause contained in the regulation. It is true that going by Clause 13

of the non-obstante clause, orders of termination have to be passed by the

Board of Directors. Going by the definition of `appointing authority', the

Chief Executive Officer is the named person. In this case, the appointment

orders have been issued by the Chief Executive Officer .        Therefore, the

question is whether he is deprived of the right to effect the order of

termination as authorized by the Board of Directors. After the judgment of

this court by Ext.R2(e) resolution the Board authorized the Chief Executive

Officer to conduct personal hearing. Thereafter, he submitted a detailed

report in the matter to the Board of Directors. This was considered by the

Board in the meeting held on 2.1.2008 and the Chief Executive Officer was

directed to examine the representations and submissions made by the

employees and pass appropriate orders after considering the merits of each

individual case as directed in the judgment. Ext.R2(f) is the said resolution.

A reading of the resolution shows that after examining the detailed report of

the   Chief Executive Officer, the Board was             convinced that the

appointments were in total violation of the staff regulations and the same

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">11393/08                                 9</span>

are vitiated by various illegalities. It is after entering such a conclusion that

the Chief Executive Officer was authorized to pass orders in the matter.

`     11. Learned counsel for the petitioners, relying upon the principles

stated in Barnard and others v. National Dock Labour Board and others

(1953 (2) QB 18) and in H.L.(E) Vine v. National Dock Labour Board

{(1957) AC 488}, contended that the disciplinary powers cannot be

delegated as being a quasi-judicial function and thus the orders of

termination are illegal. In the first of those decisions, it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "The decision whether or not to impose penalties (amounting to

       serious cases to dismissal) for alleged offences if those offences are

       proved, is a judicial decision, or, at all events, a quasi-judicial

       decision, and cannot from any reasonable point of view be regarded

       as merely administrative; and as my Lords have pointed out, a judicial

       function is one which from its very nature is incapable of being

       delegated."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">In the subsequent decision in Vines' case {(1957) A.C.488} it was held that

"the plaintiff's dismissal was invalid since the local Dock Labour Board had

no power under the Scheme to delegate to a disciplinary committee their

disciplinary powers given by clause 16 of the Order."

</p><p id="p_17">      12.    In answer to the said contentions, learned counsel for the

respondents relied upon the decision of the Apex Curt in Pyare Lal

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">11393/08                            10</span>

<a href="/doc/511990/" id="a_2">Sharma v. Managing Director and others</a> {(1989) 3 SCC 448.} A similar

case was considered by the Apex Court therein. It was held in para 19 thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "We may now take up the third point. Sharma was appointed as

       Chemical Engineer by the Board of Directors. The powers of the

       Board of Directors to appoint officers of Sharma's category were

       delegated to the Managing Director on September 12, 1974 and as

       such from that date the Managing Director became the appointing

       authority. Needless to say that employees of the company are not

       civil servants and as such they can neither claim the protection of

       <a href="/doc/1140464/" id="a_3">Article 311(1)</a> of the Constitution of India nor the extension of that

       guarantee on parity.    There is no provision in the Articles of

       Association or the regulations of the company giving same

       protection to the employees of the company as is given to the civil

       servants under <a href="/doc/1140464/" id="a_4">Article 311(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.       An

       employee of the company cannot, therefore, claim that he cannot be

       dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which

       he was appointed. Since on the date of termination of Sharma's

       services the Managing Director had the powers of appointing

       authority, he was legally competent to terminate Sharma's services."</blockquote><p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">      13. Learned counsel for the respondents also invited my attention to

the principles stated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1526057/" id="a_5">Maharashtra State Mining

Corporation v. Sunil</a> {(2006) 5 SCC 96.}          There the decision of the

Managing Director was ratified by the Board of Directors and in such

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">11393/08                                11</span>

circumstances, it was held that the ratification relates back to the date of

dismissal order and validated the same. In para 7 their Lordships held thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "The High Court rightly held that an act by a legally incompetent

       authority is invalid. But it was entirely wrong in holding that such an

       invalid act could not be subsequently "rectified" by ratification of the

       competent authority. Ratification by definition means the making

       valid of an act already done. The principle is derived from the Latin

       maxim rathabitio mandato aequiparatur, namely, "a subsequent

       ratification of an act is equivalent to a prior authority to perform such

       act."    Therefore, ratification assumes an invalid act which is

       retrospectively validated."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20"> Therefore, going by the principles stated therein, a ratification will make

the act valid. Going by the dictum laid down in the above two cases, as the

Managing Director was the appointing authority who appointed the

petitioners, it cannot be held that the orders of termination are invalid.

Ext.R2(f) the report of the Chief Executive Officer was examined and it was

resolved that the appointments made are illegal and without following any

procedure. The same amounts to a decision taken by the Board of Directors

in effect to terminate the service of the petitioners. In the subsequent

meeting of the Board of Directors held on 28.3.2008, the minutes of which

have been produced as Ext.R2(g), the minutes of the Board meeting dated

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">11393/08                             12</span>

2.1.2008 have been confirmed. Resolution No.4 takes note of the action

taken by the Chief Executive Officer based on a representation from the

employees who have been issued termination orders. It was also resolved to

verify whether any more appointments are there not in conformity to the

Council's guidelines and if so appropriate action may be initiated. In that

view of the matter, the action of the Chief Executive Officer stands ratified

by the Board of Directors. Of course, learned counsel for the petitioners

have got a contention, relying upon the affidavit filed by some of the Board

members, that no such resolution was taken. But no materials have been

produced to show that the meeting was not conducted and no such

resolution was adopted.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      14. Therefore, going by the principles stated by the Apex Court, two

things are evident.   The Chief Executive Officer being the appointing

authority, the orders of termination issued by him cannot be said to be

faulty. There was a valid delegation of power to him by the Bord of

Directors, to take action, as noted already. Apart from that, the Board of

Directors ratified the decision taken by the Chief Executive Officer.

Therefore, the action will be saved.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      15. In that view of the matter, the contention that it was only the

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">11393/08                             13</span>

Board of Directors who could have pass orders of termination, cannot be

upheld. Therefore, the main ground on the challenge against the orders of

termination falls to ground.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      16. The other contention raised by the petitioners is that going by the

proposal as contained in Ext.P1 which culminated in the resolution Ext.P2,

there is a valid appointment and therefore the reasons stated in the orders of

termination that no proposal was there to appoint them, or to regularise

them, cannot be accepted. Ext.P1 is the notice of agenda which contains a

proposal to regularize the remaining staff.      The details of 23 casual

employees who are in daily wages, have been mentioned therein. Ext.P2

will show that a committee was formed for finalizing the proposal and the

decision therein is to the effect that the committee will take appropriate

decision after evaluating the proposal.     Ext.P3 will show that the sub

committee proposed that all staff with one year experience can be

regularised subject to the performance to be decided on the basis of

scrutiny. Ext.P4 is the minutes of the 25th meeting of the Board of Directors

dated 25.1.2006, the full text of which is produced as Ext.R2(i). With

regard to the regularization of the staff it is contained as item 7 and the

decision is to the following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_24">wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">11393/08                               14</span>

</p><p id="p_25">      (i) To regularise all contract staff who are completed 1 year of

      service.
</p>
<p id="p_26">               (ii)   In case of casual/daily wages employees, form a

       Screening Committee and evaluate them. Suitable candidates may

       be appointed on contract basis initially.
</p>
<p id="p_27">These decisions are relied upon in support of the orders of appointment. It

is clear from the above decision also, that the only decision was to

regularize all contract staff who have completed one year of service and

regarding daily wages employees, the decision was only to form a

Screening Committee and evaluate them.         The appointment orders show

that an interview was held on 24.1.2006, evidently prior to the said Board

meeting.        Nothing is stated in the appointment orders about any

resolution taken by the Board on 25.1.2006 to appoint them. Therefore, the

contention raised by the respondents that the then Chief Executive Officer

passed the orders of appointment without being empowered by any decision

of the Board or based on any follow up action taken on 25.1.2006, appears

to be correct. Even if the procedure contemplated in Ext.P4 was taken, a

scrutiny committee should have been formed to          evaluate the case of

casual/daily wages employees. That was not done. Therefore, the action of

the Chief Executive Officer in appointing the petitioners, is rightly found

wpc 11109, 11132&amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">11393/08                               15</span>

objectionable in the orders of termination.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      17. It is clear from the proceedings that the initial engagement on

daily wages and the provisional appointment thereafter was made without

notifying the vacancies by inviting applications.       This has resulted in

denying an opportunity to similarly placed candidates. Therefore, the said

finding in that regard is also correct. The detailed reasons have been stated

in the orders of termination to the effect that the principles of reservation

have not been followed and the appointment was in total violation of the

recruitment rules. Going by the recruitment rules, open advertisement was

necessary and in the absence of which, it should have been through

Employment Exchanges or by campus recruitment. None of these methods

were followed. It is also found that some of the petitioners are not even

qualified in accordance with the qualifications prescribed for the post.

confers the status of an approved probationer". In Secretary, State of

Karnataka and others's case {(2006) 4 SCC 1}, a Constitution Bench of

the Apex Court held that in the matter of public employment, the authority

is bound to follow a constitutional scheme. It was held that the absorption

or regularisation of temporary, casual or daily wages employees dehors the

constitutional scheme, cannot be accepted .The same principle was followed

in State of Manipur and others's case {(2007) 5 SCC 65} and in

Government of A.P. and others {(2008) 5 SCC 241}.             The consistent

view taken therefore is that in the matter of public employment, any

backdoor appointment, dehors the procedure, cannot confer any right on the

appointees for continuance.        In that view of the matter, the adhoc

appointment could not have been regularized at all. In this case, as found

earlier, Exts.P1 to P4 will not show that there was any concrete decision on

the part of the second respondent to regularize the daily wage employees.

A similar question was considered by this court in Dr. Ing. Pyarilal S.K.'s

case (ILR 2005 (3) Ker. 8) and in Usha K.'s case (ILR 2007 (4) Ker.862)

In the latter decision, after regularization of provisional hands, based on the

dictum laid down in Secretary, State of Karnataka's case {(2006) 4 SCC

1}, the Government reviewed its decision to regularize the provisional

employees. The challenge against the same was repelled by this court and it

was held that the Government is empowered to review wrong decisions

conferring regularization of illegally appointed provisional employees.

Clauses Act</a> an appointing authority is entitled to dismiss or terminate or

revoke the appointment. Herein, the appointments were made obviously by

the Chief Executive Officer.        The termination is not by way of any

disciplinary action taken but in view of the illegality in the appointments

itself. Going by the principles stated in Usha K.'s case (ILR 2007 (4)

Ker.862) the appointing authority is entitled even to revoke a decision to

regularize the employees who were appointed illegally. In that view of the

matter also, the orders of termination cannot be faulted.

the interim orders passed in all these cases, the petitioners were permitted to

attend to their respective duties until further orders and further it is made

clear that the continuance on the strength of the orders of this court shall not

by itself confer any right on the petitioners and such continuance again will

be subject to further orders to be passed by this court. Therefore, it is made

clear that the petitioners will be entitled for the monetary benefits including

salary and other benefits for the period during which they have worked

during the pendency of these writ petitions. Before effecting termination,

they will be paid off such amounts payable, if any, and any other statutory

benefits.
