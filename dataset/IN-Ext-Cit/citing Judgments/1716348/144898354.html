</pre>
<p id="p_1">               Vide this order I shall dispose off this appeal filed by the 

      defendant/appellant   against   the   impugned   judgment/decree 

RCA  No. 7/10                                                           Page no. 1 of 15
       dated 29.03.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_2">   1.     Brief facts, in nut­shell, are that plaintiff/respondent  filed the 

      suit   for   recovery   of   Rs.   60,000/­   U/o   37   of   CPC.     The 

      defendant/appellant   approached   the   plaintiff/respondent   for 

      grant of friendly  loan Rs. 60,000/­  as he was in dire need  of 

      money   for   the   marriage   of   his   brother.     Plaintiff   was   having 

      cordial relation with the defendant and he had given a sum of 

      Rs. 60,000/­ to the defendant on interest  @ 24% per annum. 

      The  defendant  has   issued  a  post  dated  cheque   of   involved 

      amount   in   the   present   suit   to   repay   the   said   loan   amount 

      advance  by the plaintiff  to the defendant.    When  the cheque 

      was presented for encashment  by the plaintiff, the same was 

      dishonoured and the plaintiff was very shocked on receiving the 

      said   report   from   the   banker   of   defendant     and   narrated   the 

      story  in this  regard  to the defendant.  The defendant  assured 

      the plaintiff to repay the amount but he failed to pay the same. 



</p><p id="p_3">RCA  No. 7/10                                                                   Page no. 2 of 15
       Thereafter, plaintiff sent a legal notice dated 10.11.2009 to the 

      defendant but the defendant  failed to pay the amount, so the 

      present suit has been filed. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">   2.        The   defendant   was   served   with     summons   for 

      appearance of the summary suit but the defendant failed to file 

      appearance within the statutory period of 10 days, so Ld. Trial 

      Court, in terms of contents of the  order 37 CPC  admitted the 

      contents/averments   of   the   plaint   and   in   the   absence   of   any 

      appearance on behalf of defendant, present suit is decreed in 

      favour   of   the   plaintiff.   The   appellant   being   aggrieved   by   the 

      impugned judgment has filed the   present appeal   against the 

      judgment/decree passed by the Ld. Trial Court. 

</p><p id="p_5">   3.        It   is   contended   by   the   Ld.   counsel   for   the 

      appellant/defendant   that   appellant/defendant   was   not   served 

      with summons for appearance  as per law on 29.01.2010 under 

      provision   of   Order   37   of   CPC.   The   appellant/defendant   is 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                   Page no. 3 of 15
       served through courier  and there is no such order  of the Ld. 

      Trial Court that appellant/defendant was to be served by way of 

      courier instead of registered post.   It is further contended that 

      said   courier   was   received   by   the   appellant/defendant     on 

      22.01.2010 i.e. after the next date of hearing in the present suit 

      in the trial court, therefore, the appellant/defendant has refused 

      to accept the same.   There is no service on the defendant of 

      the present summary suit, for summons for appearance.  It has 

      been further contended that on 22.01.2010,  the Ld. Trial Court 

      has observed that appellant/defendant has not been served, so 

      fresh process to the defendant were ordered to be served by 

      way   of   PF/RC   for   03.03.2010   but   the   Ld.   Trial   Court   on 

      29.03.2010   had   decree   the   suit   observing   therein   that 

      appellant/defendant failed to file the appearance within 10 days 

      w.e.f   29.01.2010.     It   has   been   further   contended   that 

      plaintiff/respondent   has   never   tried   to   serve   the 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                              Page no. 4 of 15
       appellant/defendant  as plaintiff/respondent has never sent the 

      summons through registered post and sent the same through 

      courier without there being any order of the court in this regard. 

      It has been further contended that even if it is presumed that 

      appellant/defendant   has   been   served   through   courier   but 

      service through courier is not a service in the eyes of law U/o 

      37 Rule 3 of CPC as no document along with complete set of 

      paper book was sent to the defendant through courier.  Even if, 

      it   is  presumed   that   appellant/defendant   has   been   served   but 

      the said service is per se illegal, so judgment passed by the Ld. 

      Trial Court  is liable  to be set aside.    In this regard  he relied 

      upon  "<a href="/doc/1433208/" id="a_1">Goyal   MG   Gases   Ltd.   V.   Premium   International

</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">   4.       It   has   been   further   contended   that   Ld.   Trial   Court   has 

      passed the order in a hurriedly manner without going through 

      the   records   as   the   appellant/defendant   had   already   filed   his 

      appearance,  so the Ld. Trial Court has failed to exercise   its 

      jurisdiction   in   a   judicious   manner.     It   has   been   further 

      contended that Ld. Trial Court has also failed to appreciate the 

      fact that the trial court is lacking   territorial jurisdiction as the 

      defendant/appellant is resident of Ghaziabad and the cheque in 

      question was also drawn in Punjab National Bank, Ghaziabad. 

      So no cause of action or any part of cause of action has arisen 

      within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court and it is settled 

      preposition   of   law   that   if   the   court   is   lacking   territorial 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                  Page no. 6 of 15
       jurisdiction to entertain the suit, the judgment/decree passed by 

      the said Court is nullity and liable to be set aside at any time. 

      In this regard he has relied upon "<a href="/doc/1876565/" id="a_7">Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. 


      V.  Union  Of  India  &amp;  Another</a> (2004) 6 SCC  254,  Rashtriya

      Industries Ltd</a>. 177 (2011) Delhi Law Times 789". 


</p><p id="p_8">   5.       It has been further contended that respondent/plaintiff has 

      not   come   to   the   court   with   clean   hands,   as   the 

      plaintiff/respondent   has   withheld   the   material   documents   and 

      also suppressed material facts from the court in order to gain 

      advantage in the case,  so the person who is playing fraud with 

      the Court  can be summarily be thrown out at any stage of the 

      litigation.  So the decree/judgment is liable to be set aside and 

      in this regard he has relied upon  "<a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_9">MCD V. State Of Delhi &amp;

</p><p id="p_11">    6.        It has been further contended that appearance was filed 

      by the defendant on 08.03.2010 so even if, there is a delay of 

      some   days   in   filing   appearance   the   delay   should   have   been 

      condoned.  In this regard he has relied upon   "<a href="/doc/1653951/" id="a_10">Nand Singh V. 


      Estate Officer and Anr</a>. AIR 1993 DELHI 38".  


</p><p id="p_12">   7.        It   has   been   further   contended   that,   even   if,   there   is   a 

      delay   of   about   one   month     so   the   decree/judgment   passed 

      which   should   have   been   condoned   by   the   Ld.   Trial   Court, 

      therefore, impugned judgment/decree is liable to be set aside. 

      It has been further contended that if there is delay occurred on 

      account   of   some   mistake   of   Ld.   counsel   for   the   parties,   the 

      delay   should   be   condone.   In   this   he   has   relied   upon  "<a href="/doc/827161/" id="a_11">M/s

</p><p id="p_14">   8.        On   the   other   hand,   Ld.   counsel   for   the 

      defendant/appellant  has contended that the loan was advance 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                     Page no. 8 of 15
       to the defendant at Delhi as the plaintiff/respondent is resident 

      of   Delhi, so a part of cause of action has accrued within the 

      territorial   jurisdiction   of   the   Ld.   Trial   Court   and 

      defendant/appellant  was served  and he has filed appearance 

      on 12.03.2010 whereas as per his admission he was served on 

      29.01.2010 with  the summons for appearance of this summary 

      suit.     The   defendant   had   failed   to   file   appearance   with   the 

      statutory   period   of   10   days   so   this   application   is   barred   by 

      limitation and has rightly been taken into  consideration by the 

      Ld. Trial Court. There is no merits in the appeal and it is prayed 

      that this appeal may be dismissed with cost. 

</p><p id="p_15">   9.        I   have   heard   the   Ld.   counsel   for   the   parties   and   have 

      gone through the record. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">   10.       The first contention of the Ld. counsel for the appellant is 

      that   he  has   not   been   served   as  per   law  and   the   process   of 

      summary   suit   i.e.   summons   for   appearance   has   not   been 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                    Page no. 9 of 15
       served on the defendant/appellant.  It has been contended that 

      summons   for   appearance   of   summary   suit   were   not 

      accompanied   by   the   copy   of   plaint   nor   any   document   was 

      annexed with it, so the same is not a legal service in the eyes 

      of law.  It has been further contended that there was no order 

      with regard to the service of the defendant/appellant by courier 

      and the defendant/appellant has been served with the process 

      through the courier on 29.01.2010  i.e. after the date fixed for 

      hearing of the present suit and it has been further contended 

      that Trial Court has observed that on 22.01.2010 defendant has 

      not been served and fresh process was issued for 03.03.2010 

      but   there   appears   to   be   no  substance   in   the   contention   that 

      appellant/defendant  was  not  served  as per U/o 37 Rule  3 of 

      CPC   for   putting   appearance   in   terms   of   the   procedure   of 

      summary suit.   It has been very categorically admitted by the 

      defendant/applicant   in   his   above   said   application   moved   for 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                 Page no. 10 of 15
       filing appearance that defendant was served with  summons for 

      appearance of the summary suit on 29.01.2011.  There can be 

      no dispute regarding the ratio of judgments relied upon by the 

      appellant/defendant relating to the service but the ratio of those 

      judgment  is not applicable   to the facts and circumstances of 

      the present  case as defendant  himself  admitted  in his above 

      said   application   for  appearance   that   he   was   served   with   the 

      summons for appearance  of this summary suit on 29.01.2011 

      and he filed this application on 10.03.2010.  Therefore, there is 

      no   illegality   in   the   service   of   the   defendant/appellant   with 

      summons for appearance. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">   11.      Now   coming   to   the   second   contention   of   the 

      appellant/defendant   that   there   is   no   delay   in   putting 

      appearance   as   the   defendant/appellant   was   granted   time   by 

      the Ld. Trial Court for filing appearance,  but this contention is 

      also contrary to the document on record of the Ld. Trial Court. 


</p><p id="p_18">RCA  No. 7/10                                                               Page no. 11 of 15
       In the order dated 03.03.2010, the Ld. Trial Court has observed 

      that despite service on 29.01.2010, the defendant has not file 

      the appearance in terms of the order 37 CPC and counsel for 

      the defendant  has  sought  adjournment  and  that  adjournment 

      was granted.  
</p>
<p id="p_19">   12.      From  the perusal  of order  dated  29.03.2010  passed  by 

      the Ld. Trial Court, it can not be inferred that delay in putting 

      the   appearance   was   condoned   and   the   adjournment   was 

      granted in order to give an opportunity to the defendant to file 

      appearance   after   moving   an   application   for   condonation   of 

      delay.   Appearance   filed   by   the   defendant/appellant   is   not 

      accompanied by any application seeking condonation of delay. 

      The statutory period for putting appearance is 10 days as per 

      the procedure  provide  for  summary  suit.    Even  further  more, 

      the appellant/defendant had not moved  application before the 

      Ld.   Trial   Court   for   seeking   condonation   of   delay   in   putting 


RCA  No. 7/10                                                                Page no. 12 of 15
       appearance,   no   such   ground   is   also   made/detailed   in   the 

      grounds of appeal. Judgment relied upon by the Ld. counsel for 

      the   defendant/appellant     to   fortify   his   submissions   that   oral 

      application is maintainable for seeking condonation of delay is 

      not applicable to the facts of present case. There is no dispute 

      regarding  the ratio  of judgment  relied  upon  by the defendant 

      but   there   is     a   delay   of   more   than   one   month   in   putting 

      appearance by the appellant  whereas   in the judgment  relied 

      upon by the Ld. counsel for the defendant/appellant there was 

      delay of only one day.  So far as the judgment relied upon by 

      the Ld. counsel for the defendant in case titled "<a href="/doc/827161/" id="a_12">M/s Aradhana 


      Textile V. Vishnu Textiles (Supra</a>)"  same is not applicable to 

      the facts and circumstances of the present case.  This is not a 

      case of defendant that on account of mistake of his counsel, he 

      could   not   file   appearance   within   the   prescribed   period   of 

      limitation.

<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">RCA  No. 7/10                                                                 Page no. 13 of 15
</p><p id="p_22">    13.       The   last   contention   raised   by   the   Ld.   counsel   for   the 

      defendant   that   this   Ld.   Trial   Court   has   not   the   territorial 

      jurisdiction   to   entertain   the   suit.   This   contention   is   to   be 

      entertained only, in case, the defendant had put appearance in 

      terms   of   procedure   prescribed   for   summary   suit   but   in   the 

      absence   of   any   appearance   on   behalf   of   the   defendant   the 

      averments made in the plaint of summary suit are deemed to 

      be admitted and the plaintiff is entitled for judgment forthwith. 

      But   even   for   the   sake   of   arguments   this   contention   of   Ld. 

      counsel  for the defendant is to be accepted that there is lack of 

      territorial   jurisdiction   in   the   Ld.   Trial   Court   as   cheque   was 

      issued in Ghaziabad and parties are also residing in Ghaziabad 

      but for determination of   the territorial jurisdiction as disclosed 

      in the plaint the loan was disbursed in Delhi so a part has been 

      accrued within the territorial jurisdiction of the Ld. Trial Court of 

      Delhi.    So this contention  of Ld. counsel for the defendant  is

       also fallacious and same is to be rejected. 

</p><p id="p_23">   14.      From the above said discussion, I am of the opinion that 

      the Ld. counsel for the appellant/defendant has failed to point 

      out   any   illegality   in   the   impugned   judgment/order,   so   the 

      present   appeal   is   hereby   dismissed.     Reader   is   directed   to 

      prepare Decree Sheet accordingly.  TCR be sent back. File be 

      consigned to record room.
