     the same day. The detenu had applied for bail before the Court of the Additional

     Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mumbai and was released on bail on 21 st

     November, 2014 with a condition that the detenu should not leave the country




                                       
     without prior permission of the Court. The detenu had applied for modification of
                             
     this condition by moving an application before the learned Additional Chief
                            
     Metropolitan Magistrate on which an order came to be passed on 2 nd February

     2015 whereby the condition was modified directing the detenu to attend DRI

     office on the first Monday of every month for a period of six months. The case of
      


     the sponsoring authority is that the statement of the detenu and other persons
   



     who were alleged to be involved was recorded on 19 th October 2014 and after

     approval of the Scrutiny committee as obtained on 12th February 2015 a





     proposal was forwarded to the detaining authority on 20th February 2015. The

     detaining authority thereafter was seized with the proposal. In the reply affidavit





     filed on behalf of the detaining authority it is stated that by letter dated 11 th

     March 2015 further information on 12 issues was sought from the sponsoring

     authority which came to be forwarded by the sponsoring authority to the

     detention order came to be issued on 10th April, 2015. In our opinion, the above

     petitioner that the sponsoring authority took almost more than 4 months to

     forward its proposal to the detaining authority. Admittedly the statements of the

     detenu and concerned persons were recorded on 19 th October, 2014. Further the




                                        
     detenu was in custody up to 21st November, 2014. That is almost for a month
                             
     from the date of his arrest. After release of the detenu he had applied for
                            
     modification of the bail conditions i.e. modification of the conditions that he

     would not be permitted to leave the country without the prior permission of the

     Court came to be modified by an order dated 2nd February 2015 passed by the
      


     learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. The effect of this modified
   



     bail order was that the detenu was free to undertake travel to a foreign country.

     detaining authority being a period of more than 4 months finds no explanation in

     the sponsoring authority is absolutely silent that any such information was

     sought by the detaining authority alleged to be sought by its letter dated 11 th

     March, 2015.         This goes to the root of this matter and raises a serious doubt




                                           
     about the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction claimed to have been reached

     conduct on the part of the detaining authority in handling of the detention

     proposal and claiming that the subjective satisfaction has been arrived at, to pass

     the detention order. In our opinion, these facts clearly go to show that the delay
      


     in passing the detention order is not only inordinate but also unexplained which
   



     would completely vitiate the subjective satisfaction.

     April 1986 the driver and cleaner of the truck made a statement implicating the

     appellant as a main person. The appellant thereupon absconded and had moved

     for an anticipatory bail on 21st April 1987 but no orders were passed as the police




                                         
     made a statement that there was no proposal at that stage to arrest him. The

     cause of detention was the transportation of foreign liquor on 29/30 th December,

     appellant moved an anticipatory bail application there was no proposal to arrest

     the appellant. When the appellant was arrested on 2 nd February 1987 and on the





     same day he made a statement admitting the facts. In the meanwhile the proposal

     to detain the appellant was placed before the District Magistrate. The District

     International Container Transhipment Terminal. The sponsoring authority took

     some time to determine whether the prejudicial activities of the detenu justified




                                                          
     the detention. During the inquiry, it transpired that the detenu and two others

     were part of a well-organised gang operating in smuggling of red sanders in India

     and abroad. It is only thereafter that on 17th December 2012 the sponsoring




                                       
     authority made recommendations for the detention of the detenu and two others
                             
     under <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_25">section 3</a> of the COFEPOSA Act. In the counter affidavit, it was stated by
                            
     the respondents that the record of the sponsoring authority and the scrutiny

     committee and other material consisted of over 1000 pages. The proposal of the

     sponsoring authority was received in the Office of the detaining authority on 21st
      


     December 2012 as a huge proposal was required to be evaluated and scrutinized
   



     with great care, caution and circumspection, the detaining authority upon such

     scrutiny and evaluation decided on 25th January 2013 to place the proposals





     before the screening committee and forwarded the same to it on 1st February

     2013.      The Supreme Court observed that if one expects care and caution in





     scrutiny and evaluation on the proposals, time taken by the detaining authority to

     place the proposal before the screening committee it cannot be said in the facts of

     the case there is an inordinate delay. The meeting of the scrutiny committee had

     in detail and after the said process, the detaining authority decided on 15th April

     2013 to detain the detenu.        In these facts, the time taken for coming to the




                                                             
     decision was held to have been sufficiently explained.                       In para 18 the Supreme

     Court has observed that the necessity to pass a detention order is required to be

     considered in the facts and circumstances of each case so as to determine whether




                                          
     the live-link between the prejudicial activity and the purpose of detention is
                             
     snapped. The Supreme Court has observed thus :
</p>                            
<p id="p_24">      18. "From what we have stated above, it cannot be said that there is undue delay
     in passing the order of detention and the live nexus between the prejudicial
     activity has snapped. As observed earlier, the question whether the prejudicial
     activity of a person necessitating to pass an order of detention is proximate to the
     time when the order is made or the live-link between the prejudicial activity and
      


     the purpose of detention is snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of
     each case. Even in a case of undue or long delay between the prejudicial activity
   



     and the passing of detention order, if the same is satisfactorily explained and a
     tenable and reasonable explanation is offered, the order of detention is not
     vitiated. We must bear in mind that distinction exists between the delay in
     making of an order of detention under a law relating to preventive detention like





     COFEPOSA and the delay in complying with procedural safeguards enshrined
     under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_26">Article 22 (5)</a> of the Constitution. In view of the factual scenario as
     aforesaid, we are of the opinion that the order of detention is not fit to be quashed
     on the ground of delay in passing the same."

     India cannot be nullified by such arbitrary exercise of powers by the authorities
