 CORAM: Honble Shri Satish K Agnihotri J 


 Dated: 03/08/2012


: Judgement 




        (Delivered on this 3rd day of August, 2012)

      (Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">227</a> of the
                  Constitution of India)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_3">2.   The  petitioner, being an employee of  the  Pandit

     Kishorilal Shukla Law College (for short "the respondent

     College"), has filed this petition seeking to quash the

     notice dated 9-7-2012 (Annexure - P/4) without impleading

     the State Government as well as Pandit Ravishankar Shukla

     University (for short "the University") as  party/

     respondents. The respondent No.1 is the Governing Body,

     respondent No.2 is the Society registered under the

     <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_3">Societies Registration Act</a>, respondent No.3 is the College

     affiliated to the University and the respondent No.4 is

     the Secretary to Nandgaon Shiksha Mandal.

</p><p id="p_4">3.   Shri  Kotecha, learned counsel appearing  for  the

     petitioner, would submit that since the respondents are

     performing the job of public duty, hence they are amenable

     to the writ jurisdiction of this Court and, as such, the

     question, which arises for consideration is whether a writ

     petition is maintainable against the private parties on

     the ground that they are performing the duty of imparting

     education, which, according to the petitioner, is a public

     duty.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   Shri Kotecha, in support of his contention, placed

     reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/261493/" id="a_4">Binny

     Ltd. and another v. V. Sadasivan</a> and others1.  According

     to the learned counsel for the petitioner, since the

     respondents are performing the public duty of imparting

     education, the writ is maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   In Binny Ltd. (supra), the issue was whether the High

     Court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under

     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India could have

     interfered with the decision of a private limited company,

     the Supreme Court after having considered several aspects

     of the matter observed that "in the matter of employment

     of workers by private bodies on the basis of contracts

     entered into between them, the Courts had been reluctant

     to exercise the powers of judicial review and whenever the

     powers were exercised as against private employers, it was

     solely done based on public law element involved therein."

     observed as under:

               seen that a writ of mandamus
               or  the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article
               226</a>   is   pre-eminently   a
               public law remedy and is not
               generally  available  as   a
               remedy    against    private
               wrongs.   It  is  used   for
               enforcement    of    various
               rights of the public  or  to
               compel  the public/statutory
               authorities   to   discharge
               their  duties  and  to   act
               within their bounds. It  may
               be  used to do justice  when
               there  is  wrongful exercise
               of  power  or a  refusal  to
               perform duties. This writ is
               admirably equipped to  serve
               as  a  judicial control over
               administrative actions. This
               writ  could also  be  issued
               against any private body  or
               person, specially in view of
                    the words used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article
               226</a>   of  the  Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               However,   the   scope    of
               mandamus   is   limited   to
               enforcement of public  duty.
               The  scope  of  mandamus  is
               determined by the nature  of
               the  duty  to  be  enforced,
               rather than the identity  of
               the  authority against  whom
               it is sought. If the private
               body is discharging a public
               function  and the denial  of
               any  right  is in connection
               with the public duty imposed
               on such body, the public law
               remedy can be enforced.  The
               duty cast on the public body
               may  be either statutory  or
               otherwise and the source  of
               such  power  is  immaterial,
               but,   nevertheless,   there
               must   be  the  public   law
               element   in  such   action.
               Sometimes,  it is  difficult
               to    distinguish    between
               public  law and private  law
               remedies.    According    to
               Halsbury's Laws of  England,
               3rd  Edn., Vol. 30, p.  682,
               `a  public  authority  is  a
               body,   not  necessarily   a
               county   council,  municipal
               corporation  or other  local
               authority  which has  public
               statutory duties to  perform
               and which perform the duties
               and    carries    out    its
               transactions for the benefit
               of  the  public and not  for
               private    profit.'    There
               cannot    be   any   general
               definition     of     public
               authority or public  action.
               The   facts  of  each   case
               decide the point.

<p id="p_9">7.   The Supreme Court in The Praga Tools Corporation v.

</p><p id="p_10">     Shri C.A. Imanual and Others2, while considering issue

     whether a writ lies against the company incorporated under

     the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Companies Act</a>, observed that "a mandamus lies to

     secure the performance of a public or statutory duty in

     the performance of which the one who applies for it has a

     sufficient legal interest. Thus, an application for

     mandamus will not lie for an order of reinstatement to an

     office which is essentially of a private character nor can

     such an application be maintained to secure performance of

     obligations owed by a company towards its workmen or to

     resolve any private dispute."

     Court further observed as under :

               non-statutory body  and  one
               incorporated    under    the
               <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_12">Companies   Act</a>  there   was
               neither  a statutory  nor  a
               public duty imposed on it by
               a   statute  in  respect  of
               which  enforcement could  be
               sought   by   means   of   a
               mandamus, nor was  there  in
               its        workmen       any

               for  enforcement of any such
               statutory  or  public  duty.
               The  High  Court, therefore,
               was right in holding that no

<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                    "15. If the rights  are
               purely    of    a    private
               character  no  mandamus  can
               issue. If the management  of
               the  college  is  purely   a
               private body with no  public
               duty  mandamus will not lie.
               These are two exceptions  to
               mandamus. But once these are
               absent  and when  the  party
               has    no    other   equally
               convenient remedy,  mandamus
               cannot be denied. It has  to
               be   appreciated  that   the
               appellants     trust     was
               managing    the   affiliated
               college   to  which   public
               money  is paid as government
               aid.  Public money  paid  as
               government aid plays a major
               role    in    the   control,
               maintenance and  working  of
               educational    institutions.
               The  aided institutions like
               government      institutions
               discharge public function by
               way  of  imparting education
               to    students.   They   are
               subject  to  the  rules  and
               regulations      of      the
               affiliating      University.
               Their activities are closely
               supervised by the University
               authorities.  Employment  in
               such           institutions,
               therefore, is not devoid  of
               any  public  character.3  So
               are  the  service conditions
               of  the academic staff. When
               the   University   takes   a
               decision regarding their pay
               scales,  it will be  binding
               on   the   management.   The
               service  conditions  of  the
               academic     staff      are,
               therefore, not purely  of  a
               private  character.  It  has
               super-added  protection   by
               University         decisions
               creating  a legal right-duty
               relationship   between   the
               staff  and  the  management.
               When  there is existence  of
               this  relationship, mandamus
                    cannot be refused to the
               aggrieved party."

     has not been impleaded as a party/respondent.  It is

     stated that the respondent College is affiliated by the

     Indisputably, a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the

     the public duty is performed by an institution, even if

     the college or institution. They are regulated by the

     rules, regulations, etc. for the purpose of service

     conditions of the employees, teachers and also for the

     purpose of maintaining merit and excellence in the

     institution.  This is also the requirement of  the

     University to comply with the certain norms before grant

     of affiliation.

               performance of a  public  or
               statutory   duty   in    the

               who  applies for  it  has  a
               sufficient  legal  interest.
               Thus,  an  application   for
               mandamus will not lie for an
               order of reinstatement to an
               office  which is essentially
               of  a private character  nor

<p id="p_23">16.  The petition lacks the above-stated details in its

     pleadings.  It appears that the appointment of the

     petitioner  is on account of contract between  the

     respondent College and the petitioner.  Copy of the

     appointment order has also not been filed here.  Thus, it

     is not possible to hold that the respondent College was

     discharging a public duty, though it may be imparting

     education, but that also some times is a part of private

     duty, if not regulated or controlled by the affiliating

     body or by the State Government. Thus, impleading of State

     Government as well as the University to ensure that public

     duty, which is alleged to be performed by the respondent

     College is properly secured by the State and also to

     establish that the respondent College was performing the

     public duty or statutory duty or the same was running on

     State funding or under an obligation to discharge any

     function as held by the Supreme Court in Federal Bank Ltd.

     (supra).  Thus, for want of material, it cannot be held

     that since the educational institution is imparting

     education, therefore, it comes within the meaning of

     'public duty'.

<p id="p_24">17.  In view of the above, the petitioner has failed to

     establish that the respondent College was performing

     public duty, the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> of the
