 JUDGMENT (Per Sunil K. Kotwal).

 .                L.P.A. No.304 of 2010 is filed by Gaurishankar

</pre><p id="p_1"> Mohanlal Vyas and L.P.A. No.229 of 2011 is filed by Abdul Hamid

 Mohammad Yusuf against the order passed by learned Single

 Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.1980 of 1998. In Writ

 Petition No.1980 of 1998 only Gaurishankar Mohanlal Vyas has

 challenged the judgment and order passed by learned Member,

 Maharashtra            Revenue   Tribunal,   Aurangabad         in    Revision

 No.27/13/92/L.          These both Letters Patent Appeals being filed

 against one and the same judgment and order passed by Single

 Judge of this Court, are disposed of by this common judgment.


</p><p id="p_2"> 2.               The facts leading to institution of these Letters

 Patent Appeals are that, one Mariyam Bee w/o Abdul Kadar was

 the land-lady and owner of agricultural land bearing Survey

 No.243 admeasuring 21 Acres 6 Gunthas and Survey No.248

 admeasuring 23 Acres 7 Gunthas.               The entire land was in

 possession of three tenants namely (1) Imamsaheb (2) Mehtab

 and (3) Govind Sule. On 29 March 1959 the land-lady Mariyam

 Bee filed application under Section 44 of the Hyderabad Tenancy

 and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the

 "Hyderabad Tenancy Act") for possession of entire tenanted land.

 That application was allowed by Tahsildar on 06.11.1959.

 However, on 04.06.1963 the tenants obtained restoration of part

 of the tenanted land, in the appeals preferred by tenants as well

 as land-lady, which were disposed of by the Collector.                    On

 21.03.1964 the land-lady obtained possession of 11 Acres 20

 Gunthas out of Survey No.243, leaving 9 Acres 26 Gunthas for

 tenants and 12 Acres 20 Gunthas land out of Survey No.248

 leaving 10 Acres 27 Gunthas for the tenants. On 22.03.1967 the

 land-lady Mariyam Bee, under her oral gift i.e. Hiba, gave land

 admeasuring 11 Acres 20 Gunthas out of Survey No.243 to one

 Abdul Hamid and 12 Acres 20 Gunthas out of Survey No.248 to

 one Hoor Begum. In the month of April 1970 the name of Abdul

 Hamid was recorded in the record of right of land given to him.

 Even Hoor Begum handed over her land in possession of Abdul

 Hamid for cultivation.        In the year 1972 Abdul Hamid filed

 R.C.S. No.163/1972 for declaration of his title and for perpetual

 30.11.1973 the application by tenants for restoration of tenanted

 land was dismissed by Tahsildar. On 19.04.1975 Tenancy Appeal

 dismissed. The tenants filed Revision Application No.179/08/75/

 Osmanabad            before   the   Maharashtra    Revenue         Tribunal,

 Aurangabad. On 14.09.1975 one of the tenant Govind Sule died.

 His Legal Representatives were not brought on record in

 Revision Before the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal.                          The

 Revision Application preferred by tenants was allowed and the

 matter was remanded by Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal to

 Tahsildar for fresh inquiry. On 14.10.1979 tenant Imam Saheb

 died. His Legal Representatives were brought on record. On

 application of tenants filed under Section 46 of the Hyderabad

 Tenancy Act on 28.10.1988. The tenants filed appeal before the

 Deputy Collector, which was allowed on 22.01.1992. The Deputy

 Collector directed to restore the possession of Survey No.243

 admeasuring 11 Acres 20 Gunthas and Survey No. 248

 admeasuring 12 Acres 20 Gunthas situated at Latur to the

 tenants.         That order was challenged by Abdul Hamid and

 Gaurishankar Vyas before the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal,

 Aurangabad by filing Revision Application No.27/13/92/L. That

 Revision was dismissed and the order passed by Deputy Collector

 regarding restoration of possession of tenanted land to the

 tenants, was confirmed. Against that order only Gaurishankar

 Vyas filed Writ Petition No. 1980 of 1998.

 the present Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable.

 these Letters Patent Appeals are maintainable. So also the order

 dated 26.03.2018 passed by this Court does not slightly indicate

 appellant is that one of the tenant namely Govind Sule died on

 14.09.1975 and his Legal Representatives were not brought on

 record till date of decision of Writ Petition, and therefore, the

 learned        Single         Judge   committed    error         by     taking       legal

 representatives of Govind Sule on record while dismissing the

 Writ      Petition.            His    contention   is      that       as    the     Legal

 Representatives of Govind Sule were not brought on record, the

 Revision before Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal came to be

 abated at-least regarding tenancy right of Govind Sule.

 restoration of possession of tenanted land within the period of

 limitation of two years, as provided under Section 32 (1) of

 Hyderabad Tenancy Act.           Learned Counsel for the appellant

 submits that as the application for restoration of possession

 under Section 44 of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act was filed on

 03.08.1973, i.e. after more than two years from 22.03.1967 i.e.

 after execution of oral Gift in favour of Abdul Hamid and Hoor

 Begum, the application for restoration of possession filed by

 tenant is barred by limitation. He placed reliance on the cases of

 "Laxman Dhondu Bhor Vs. VithobaLaxman Bhor and

 others" (1987 Mh.L.J. 641), "Balraj Taneja and another Vs.

 Sunil Madan and another" (AIR 1999 SC 3381), "Jay Laxmi

 to non-bringing Legal Representatives of Govind Sule on record.

 He has also raised objection that as the disputed land was

 brought within the municipal limits of Latur Municipal Council,

 the provisions of Hyderabad Tenancy Act are not applicable in

 view of Section 102-A (f) of Hyderabad Tenancy Act. He placed

 learned Single Judge has rightly interpreted Section 46 of the

 Hyderabad Tenancy Act. As Section 46 of the said Act does not

 prescribe any limitation for filing application for possession on

 the ground of breach of Section 45 (1) (b) of the Hyderabad

 Tenancy Act, the bar of limitation under Section 32 (1) of the said

 Act is not applicable in the case at hand. Land-lady parted with

 possession of the land in the year 1967 after execution of Hiba

 did not obtain in writing their refusal to accept the possession of

 land on the same terms of tenancy as mandated under Section 45

 (1) (b) of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act. Thus, no cause of action

 arose even in the year 1967 to the tenants to claim restoration of

 legally prosecute the proceeding on behalf of all tenants including
