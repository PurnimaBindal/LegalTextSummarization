      the spot where he came to know that the injured was shifted to hospital
      by his family members and in the mean time ASI Mamur Khan along with
      staff also reached the hospital where he found the dead body of Nand
      Kishore @ Nandu. On receipt of DD No. 51 A SI Suresh Chand reached the
      spot and then DDU hospital where he recorded the statement of Kishan Lal
      father of the deceased. Kishan Lal informed the police that at 09:30 p.m
      one Ballu came to their house and told his son that some boys were calling
      him, on which his son Nandu went with Ballu. At about 10:30 pm, Kishan
      Lal received information from his brother Phool Chand that some boys of
      B-Block were beating his son. Kishan Lal went to the spot on motorcycle
      and his brother, Phool Chand followed him on another motor cycle and on
      reaching the spot Kishan Lal saw that Nandu was lying on floor and
      accused Ballu was holding him from hairs, accused Nandu was holding him
      by hands and accused Mohd. Guddu was holding a broken glass tumbler
      and was hitting Nandu on his neck and side of the back and accused Arif
      Ahmed was standing at a little distance."

<p id="p_4">3.    At the very outset, Ms. Saahila Lamba, learned counsel appearing

for the appellants submitted that the appellants would be challenging the

conviction and order of sentence only to the extent that the alleged

offence committed by the appellants would not fall under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a>

IPC but under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_3">Section 304</a> Part I IPC. Additionally, qua appellant No. 1

Narender, contention raised by the counsel was that the role, which is

ascribed to appellant No.1, Narender was that he caught hold of the

deceased, by his feet while the deceased was being assaulted by appellant

No. 2 Mohd. Guddu and, therefore, it cannot be said that appellant No.1

shared common intention with appellant No. 2 to commit the murder of

the deceased. In order to bring home the point that offence, which would

be made out against the appellants would be culpable homicide not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                              Page 2 of 18</span>
 amounting to murder punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_4">Section 304</a> Part I IPC,

submission made by learned counsel for the appellants can be outlined as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">(i)     None of the witnesses, produced by the prosecution, disclosed as to

        how and in what manner the dispute between the deceased and the

        accused persons started and, therefore, the genesis of the incident

        remained a mystery.
</p>
<p id="p_6">(ii)    The stand of the prosecution and the defence fully supports the fact

        that the appellants and other accused were unarmed at the time of

        the commission of the crime and the weapon of the offence was a

        broken glass tumbler, taken by the accused persons from nearby

        juice shop belonging to Jaffar Ali PW-7.
</p>
<p id="p_7">(iii)   The use of broken glass tumbler, as a weapon of offence, clearly

        proves that a fight between accused persons and the deceased was

        sudden, without any premeditation, without their being any

        intention on the part of the accused to commit the murder of the

        deceased. Furthermore the fact of glass tumbler, being picked up

        from a nearby juice shop, is a clear pointer to the fact that some

        sudden quarrel/fight had taken place between the appellants and the

        deceased and it was out of anger or provocation that appellant No.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                           Page 3 of 18</span>
        1 hit the deceased with broken glass tumbler.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(iv)   Out of 9 injuries, as were found on the person of the deceased, only

       injury No. 6 proved fatal and was held by the Doctor to have

       caused death of the deceased and this injury No. 6 was also

       inflicted at the back of the deceased, which further reflects that the

       intention of the appellants was not to murder the deceased,

       otherwise, the deceased would have been hit from his front at some

       vital part of his organ.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(v)    The grudge which the appellants and their co-accused were nursing

       against the deceased cannot be said to be so strong that they would

       have carried out the murder of the deceased as the deceased was

       merely an accused of murdering a friend of the accused persons

       and not of their any blood relation.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(vi)   The only role ascribed to appellant No. 1 Narender was that he

       caught hold of the deceased, by his hands while the deceased was

       being assaulted by appellant No. 2. There is no allegation made by

       the prosecution that appellant No. 1 Narender himself inflicted any

       injury upon the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.     Based on the above submissions counsel for the appellants urged

that the present case is a fit case for converting the offence from Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                            Page 4 of 18</span>
 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> to <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_6">Section 304</a> Part I IPC. In support of her arguments counsel

for the appellants placed reliance on the following judgments:-

</blockquote><p id="p_12">5.    Refuting the said submissions of counsel for the appellants, Ms.

Richa Kapoor, learned APP for the State strongly contended that the

appellants have been rightly convicted for an offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11">Section

302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_12">34</a> IPC and there is no scope for interference in the well reasoned

judgment and order on sentence passed by the learned Trial Court.

Counsel argued that there was previous enmity between the deceased and

the accused persons and with a view to eliminate the deceased, he was

called from his house through Ballu and then was attacked by all the

accused persons, as a result of which Nandu expired. Counsel further

submitted that the case of the prosecution is based on the testimony of an

eye witness PW4 Kishan Lal, who is father of the deceased and in his

testimony he fully supported the case of the prosecution. Counsel further

submitted that PW4 himself saw the appellant Narender, holding the

hands of Nandu and Guddu, appellant No. 2 hitting Nandu with a broken

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                           Page 5 of 18</span>
 glass tumbler. Counsel also argued that the deceased Nandu was picked

up by PW4 and he put him on a motorcycle, which was driven by Phool

Chand, and both of them took Nandu to DDU hospital where he was

declared brought dead. Counsel also argued that although Phool Chand,

PW3 turned hostile but as per the settled legal position, his testimony on

material aspects can be read into evidence to the extent it supports the

case of the prosecution. Counsel further argued that testimony of PW4 is

duly corroborated by the evidence of PW7 and PW8, medical and

forensic evidence and evidence adduced by the police officials.

</p><p id="p_13">6.    Dealing with the first issue whether the offence committed by the

appellants would only be culpable homicide amounting to murder under

<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_13">Section 300</a> IPC clause thirdly or would be culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, under Exception 4 <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_14">section 300</a> IPC, let us first

reproduce the said provision which reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_15">Section 300</a>
      "Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if
      the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
      death, or-

      offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the
      harm is caused. or-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person
      and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary

      dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury
      as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for
      incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
      Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_16">Section 300</a> of the Code, reads as follows:

<p id="p_14">7.    In     the   landmark      judgment      of   <a href="/doc/1296255/" id="a_17">Virsa     Singh v. State     of

Punjab</a> reported in (1958) 1 SCR 1495, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held

that the following are the four steps of inquiry involved in the offence of

Murder under <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_18">section 300</a> IPC, clause thirdly:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">      "i.     first, whether bodily injury is present;
      ii.     second, what is the nature of the injury;
      iii.    third, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that

              unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended; and
      iv.     fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described
              made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause
              death in the ordinary course of nature."
</p>
<p id="p_16">8.    In the present case as per the post mortem report of the deceased

(Ex. PW-15), following injuries were inflicted on the deceased by the

accused persons:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      a. "Contused lacerated wound with clean cut and well defined margins
         present over left parieto occipital region of dimensions 4.5 cm X .5 cm
         X bone deep.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      b. Contused wound in an area 2.5 cm X 1 cm present over right ala nose
         and dried up blood and clots present over face and nostrils.
      c. Abraded contusion present over the lateral aspect of neck on the right
         side in an area of 7 cm X 3 cm, 5 cm above the clavicle (collar bone)
      d. Incised wound with clean cut and regular margins present over left side
         nape of neck area, 3 cm below the hairline, obliquely arranged of size
         2.5 cm X 1 cm X muscle deep, 2 cm from mid line.

             chest cavity deep, both angle acute (elliptical shape), 1 cm from mid
            line, on exploration traversed and pierced ninth inter-costal space,
            penetrating and cutting through left lung.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">         g. Incised wound with clean cut margins and well defined shape present
            over the back of the lower chest-upper abdomen, 9 cm below injury
            No.6, 5 cm from mid line, of size 2.5 cm X 1 cm X muscle deep.
         h. Incised wound of size 2.5 cm X .7 cm X 3 cm present over the right
            buttock, 8 cm from the natal cleft and 21 cm from right iliac spine.
         i.    Abrasion of irregular shape of light brown- reddish colour,           of
               dimensions 4 cm X 3 cm present over left knee- patellar region."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_17">9.       The cause of death as opined by the doctor (PW-15) who

conducted the post mortem of the deceased was haemorrhagic shock

consequent upon injuries to left lung and heart i.e. injury no. 6, sufficient

to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">10.          Thus all the above elements are fulfilled, there is an injury on the

left lung as well as on the heart of the deceased; it is a fatal injury; the

injury is the one which the accused intended to inflict and also the injury

has been proved to be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of

nature. Thus it has sufficiently been proved that the accused has

committed murder of the deceased under <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_19">Section 300</a> IPC. To this extent

we do not find any infirmity in the decision of Learned Trial Court.


</p><p id="p_20">11.      In order to bring the offence under this exception IV of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_20">Section 300</a>

IPC, four things shall be proved by the accused:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">        i.    "That the act was without premeditation.
       ii.    There was a sudden quarrel
      iii.    In the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel there was a sudden fight.
      iv.     Offender did not take undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual

         manner."



</pre><p id="p_21">12.   <a href="/doc/456565/" id="a_21">In Pappu v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> reported in (2006) 7 SCC

391 the Hon'ble Apex Court almost exhaustively dealt with the

parameters of Exception IV to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_22">Section 300</a> of the Code. The relevant

paras of the judgment are reproduced as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "13...The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without
      premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the offender's having
      taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the
      fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within
      Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be
      noted that the "fight" occurring in Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_23">Section 300</a> Indian Penal
      Code is not defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> Indian Penal Code</a>. It takes two to make a fight.
      Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to
      cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury
      on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat
      between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not
      possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a
      sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or
      not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the
      application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a
      sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown
      that the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or
      unusual manner. The expression "undue advantage" as used in the
      provision means "unfair advantage. It cannot be laid down as a rule of
      universal application that whenever one blow is given, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_25">Section 302</a> Indian
      Penal Code is ruled out. It would depend upon the weapon used, the size of
      it in some cases, force with which the blow was given, part of the body on
      which it was given and several such relevant factors. "
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">13.   For this purpose let us examine the facts of the case once again. As

per the case proved by the prosecution, accused Ballu, came to the house

of deceased at 9:30 p.m., to take him along, on the pretext that few people

called him. After about an hour, i.e. at 10:30 p.m., the father of the

deceased was informed by PW-3, Phool Chand that some persons were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                               Page 9 of 18</span>
 beating his son. Immediately thereafter PW-3 went on the spot and saw

that his son was lying on the floor, accused Ballu was holding him by the

hair; Narender was holding him by hands and Guddu was holding a

broken glass tumbler and was hitting deceased on his neck and side of

back. This statement of PW-4 found corroboration from the statement of

PW-3, Phool Chand as well as PW-8, Manish Kumar. PW-3 although

turned hostile on material aspects in his testimony, yet his statement that

Krishan Lal was present on the spot at the time of the incident and also

that he and Krishan Lal together took the deceased to the hospital,

corroborates the statement of PW-4. PW-8 in his statement before the

court deposed that on 4/4/2007 he was present at his shop and he came to

know that deceased had received injuries. Immediately thereafter he went

to the spot and saw that deceased was lying in a pool of blood and pieces

of glass were lying scattered. It also came on record through PW-7 Jaffar

Ali that the glass tumbler in the hands of accused Guddu was taken by the

accused from one juice shop in the area. Thus as per the admitted case of

prosecution, PW-3 Phool Chand only saw the deceased being beaten up

by the accused at around 10:30 p.m whereas the deceased went to meet

the accused persons at 09:30 p.m i.e. an hour before the incident.

Therefore no body is the witness of what happened in that one hour
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                          Page 10 of 18</span>
 between the deceased and accused persons. Even no weapon of offence

has been carried by the accused persons in advance rather it was picked by

Guddu from a shop on the spot. This fact also clearly shows that there was

no pre mediation on the part of the accused persons to kill the deceased,

because had it been the case they must have brought one or the other

weapon to kill the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">14.   In the present case unfortunately no witness has been brought on

record, who would have witnessed the reason of fight between the parties,

however as per the MLC report of the accused, Kalim, Arif and Mohd.

Guddu, they had also received injuries during the fight. As per the

evidence of PW-6, Ajay Sharma, the injuries on the persons of accused,

Kalim and Mohd. Arif, were possible with broken glass. He also deposed

that there were old abrasions with scars seen on the left hand dorsal of the

appellant which could be one to seven days old. Thus after taking all the

facts and circumstances in consideration we think that there must have

been some fight between the parties. In the absence of any other

circumstance to prove contrary we firmly believe that some quarrel must

have taken place between the accused persons and the deceased which led

to the alleged offence.

<p id="p_25">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                           Page 11 of 18</span>
</p><p id="p_26"> 15.   It shall be noted that accused persons were having no previous

animosity with the deceased. Although, PW-4 has deposed before the

court that appellant Narender had a grouse against the deceased because

the deceased was involved in the murder of one of his friend. However we

are not inspired by his statement firstly because he was an interested

witness and also because his statement does not find corroboration from

any other evidence on record.

</p><p id="p_28">16.   In the matter of Satish Narayan Sawant Vs. State of Goa, reported

in 2009 CrLJ 4655, where the accused had inflicted number of injuries in

the heat of passion without any premeditation and without any intention

that he would cause that injury, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the case

was covered by Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_26">Section 300</a> of the IPC; the accused was

convicted under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">Section 304-II</a> of the IPC. Relevant paragraph of the said

judgment is reproduced as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "As already noted, it is quite clear from the record that there was an
      altercation preceding the incident. The place of occurrence is a residence
      inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the
      deceased was armed with any weapon. Initially the accused-appellant also
      did not have any weapon with him but during the course of the incident he
      went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed the
      deceased. PW-7 in his cross examination has categorically stated that
      death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other
      injuries were superficial in nature. So, it was only Injury No. 1 which was
      fatal in nature. Factually therefore, there was only one main injury caused
      due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased
      and therefore, it cannot be said that there was any intention to kill or to
      inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness. Records clearly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                               Page 12 of 18</span>
       establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to
      the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of
      scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and
      that there was heated exchange of words and 30 scuffle between the
      parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place. There is,
      therefore, provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the
      moment. That being the factual position, we are of the considered view
      that the present case cannot be said to be a case under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_28">Section 302</a> IPC
      but it is a case falling under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_29">Section 304</a> Part II IPC. It is trite law that
      Section 304 Part II comes into play when the death is caused by doing an
      act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention
      on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily
      injury as is likely to cause death."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_30">17.   In the view of the facts and circumstances stated above we find that

it has been sufficiently proved on record that there was a sudden quarrel

between the accused persons and the deceased, on which a sudden fight

ensued between them and in that transaction only the accused caused the

deceased, a bodily injury. Although, the injuries inflicted proved to be

fatal, but it was inflicted in the heat of passion and without any

premeditation, and also without the accused taking undue advantage or

acting in a cruel or unusual manner.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">18.   This brings us to the last contention raised by the Counsel for the

appellants, that the role ascribed to appellant No. 1 Narender, was that he

had caught hold of the deceased, by his hand while the deceased was

being assaulted by appellant No.2. There is no allegation made by the

prosecution that appellant No. 1 Narender himself inflicted any injury

upon the deceased.

</p><p id="p_34"> 19.   Common intention as envisaged under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_30">Section 34</a> IPC is an

exception to rule of evidence. It lays down the principle of constructive

liability, wherein if one person also commits the crime, all the other

persons who were sharing a common intention with them, will also be

liable. A person may be having a similar intention like other, but a similar

intention becomes common when they mutually agree to commit an

offence conjointly i.e. there is meeting of mind consensus ad idem. This

mutual agreement results into a mutual agency, wherein one person

represents the other and therefore even if one person commits the offence,

it is deemed that all of them have committed the same. It is further

pertinent to mention here that for proving common intention, it is essential

to prove that there was a meeting of mind. The burden of proving the

meeting of minds is on the prosecution. The burden is strict and the court

shall not presume anything till proved.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">20.   In the present case, as far as appellant No. 1 is concerned, there is

nothing proved on record by the prosecution that he had any common

intention to kill the deceased or that he had any previous knowledge of the

fact that the act of the accused Guddu will cause murder of the deceased.

Merely because the accused Narender was holding deceased by hands, it

cannot be concluded that he was having a common intention with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Crl.A. No. 1165/2010                                           Page 14 of 18</span>
 appellant No.2 to cause death of the deceased, although the intention

could be to cause the grievous hurt as he was assisting the accused in

hitting the deceased with the help of a glass tumbler.

SCALE 252, where an altercation took place and the accused Prabhu

Dayal inflicted one axe blow on the head of the deceased causing his

death and co-accused/appellant Jagannath who was also armed with axe

inflicted simple injuries to others, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "Concededly, the occurrence took place all of a sudden. The act of theft on
      the part of the accused persons was complete. They had been taking away
      the wood. They were followed by the deceased and PW-11. They must
      have been obstructed from taking away the wood by them as the same
      were in their possession. It was at that juncture the deceased was said to
      have been assaulted by Prabhudayal and Dhan Singh. In a situation of this
      nature where the accused persons had acted at the spur of the moment
      having regard to the altercations which had preceded the incident, in our
      opinion, it is difficult to lead to the conclusion that Prabhudayal and the
      appellant had developed a common intention of causing death of the
      deceased.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">      XXX

      We, therefore, are of the considered view that the appellant is guilty of
      commission of an offence under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_32">Section 326</a> of the Indian Penal Code and
      not under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_33">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_34">34</a> thereof."

exchanged between the accused and deceased and without any

premeditation, co-accused inflicted single knife blow on the body of the

deceased, while appellant caught hold of the hands of the deceased. The

Court held that the appellant cannot be said to have shared common
