Electoral Reforms

     March 2015
    D.O. No.6(3)/240/2013-LC(LS)                                              12 March, 2015

Dear Shri Sadananda Gowda ji,

     The Ministry of Law and Justice, in January 2013, requested the Twentieth Law
Commission of India to consider the issue of "Electoral Reforms" in its entirety and suggest
comprehensive measures for changes in the law. While working on the subject, the Supreme
Court of India, in the matter of "Public Interest Foundation &amp; Others V. Union of India &amp; Anr -
Writ Petition (Civil) No. 536 of 2011, directed the Law Commission of India to make its
suggestions on two specific issues, viz., (i) 'curbing criminalization of politics and needed law
reforms'; and (ii) 'impact and consequences of candidates filing false affidavits and needed law
reforms to check such practice'. In the light of this judgment, the Commission worked
specifically on these two areas and, after series of discussions, followed by a National
Consultation held on 1st February 2014, submitted its 244th Report titled "Electoral
Disqualifications" on 24th February 2014 to the Government of India.

    After the submission of Report No.244, the Commission circulated another questionnaire
to all registered national and State political parties seeking their views on ten points, the
response received was not very encouraging, though. However, the Commission undertook
an extensive study to suggest electoral reforms, held various rounds of discussions with the
stakeholders and analysed in-depth the issues involved. After detailed deliberations, the
Commission has now come up with its recommendations which are put in the form its final
Report, Report No.255, titled "Electoral Reforms", which is sent herewith for consideration
by the Government.
    With warm regards,
                                                                       Yours sincerely,

                                                                           Sd/-

                    BACKGROUND TO THE REPORT

    A. History of Electoral Reform in India

    "I mean to diminish no individual, institution or phase in our history when I say
    that India is valued the world over for a great many things, but for three over all
    others : The Taj Mahal; Mahatma Gandhi; and India's electoral democracy."
</p><p id="p_6">                                                    - Gopalkrishna Gandhi (2013)1

    "It needs little argument to hold that the heart of the Parliamentary system is free
    and fair elections periodically held, based on adult franchise, although social and
    economic democracy may demand much more."
</p><p id="p_7">                                                   - Supreme Court of India (1978)2

1.1            These two quotes, although more than three decades apart,
speak to the same message of the importance of democracy, and hence,
purity in the election process. It is trite to say but important to note that a fair
and unbiased electoral process, with greater citizen participation is
fundamental to safeguarding the values of democracy.
</p>
<p id="p_8">1.2           Maintaining the purity of the electoral process however, requires
a multi-pronged approach, which includes removing the influence of money
and criminal elements in politics, expediting the disposal of election petitions,
introducing internal democracy and financial transparency in the functioning of
the political parties, strengthening the Election Commission of India
(hereinafter "ECI"), and regulating opinion polls and paid news.
</p>
<p id="p_9">1.3           Unfortunately, these are some of the issues, which have
plagued the Indian electoral system over the decades and have eroded the
trust of many people in the country. Consequently, over the years, a number
of committees have examined some of the major challenges and issues
affecting India's electoral system and have made suggestions accordingly.
Both the Law Commission in its 170th Report on "Reform of the Electoral
Laws" in 1999 and the ECI in its seminal 2004 "Proposed Electoral Reforms"
report have addressed some of these challenges. Other Committees and
Commissions, which have examined these issues, are:

action, required for the enhancement of the quality of democracy, by reducing

</p>
<p id="p_13">       B. Consultation Paper Issued by the Law Commission

1.4           In January 2013, the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of
India requested the Twentieth Law Commission to consider the issue of
"Electoral Reforms" in its entirety and suggest comprehensive measures for
changes in the law. Accordingly, the Commission, under the guidance of the
then Chairman, Justice (Retd.) D. K. Jain, former Judge of the Supreme Court
of India, prepared and circulated a Consultation Paper in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_14">1.5            The Consultation Paper listed eight major issues for
consideration, including, de-criminalisation of politics and disqualification of
candidates; need to strengthen provisions relating to the period of
disqualification; false affidavits; state funding of election expenses and
donations to political parties; regulation of the conduct of political parties;
adjudication of election disputes and enhancement of punishment for electoral
offences; issues pertaining to the role of the electronic and print media, and
various other issues.
</p>
<p id="p_15">1.6             The Consultation Paper was widely circulated amongst -
political parties and elected representatives, Houses of Parliament and State
Legislatures, High Court Bar Associations, the ECI, heads of other important
National Commissions and institutions, civil society organisations, jurists and
academics and other eminent and public spirited persons - in a bid to get
diverse and comprehensive feedback from all these stakeholders.
</p>
<p id="p_16">1.7          The Commission received over 157 responses, with the largest
number of responses being received from individuals, followed by civil society
organisations. The ECI was the only Commission that sent its response, and
former Chief Election Commissioners (hereinafter "CEC") were also
consulted. However, the response from the political class was discouraging,
with only one national party, being the Indian National Congress, and one
registered party, being the Welfare Party of India sending in their views.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                              2</span>
<p id="p_17"> Further, only eight Members of Parliament, four each from the Lok Sabha and
Rajya Sabha, responded.
</p>
<p id="p_18">    C. The 244th Report of the Law Commission

1.8            While the Commission was working towards preparing a Report
to submit to the Government, the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed an order on
16th December 2013 in <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_10">Public Interest Foundation v. Union of India, W.P.
(Civil</a>) 536 of 2011, vide D.O. No. 4604/2011/SC/PIL(W) dated 21st
December, 2013 requesting the Law Commission to "expedite consideration"
for giving a report on the two issues of (a) de-criminalisation of politics and (b)
disqualification for filing false affidavits by the end of February 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_19">1.9          Subsequently, a National Consultation on these two issues was
organised by the Commission on 1st February 2014, and various political
parties 3 were represented. Apart from the parties, a cross-section of
stakeholders from all parts of society - such as a retired Supreme Court judge
and former Chairman of the Law Commission; various senior advocates, a
former CEC, members of the ECI; a Member of Parliament; and various
representatives from the Bar and the Bench, from academia, and from civil
society organisations - were also present.
</p>
<p id="p_20">1.10           This culminated in the submission of the first part of the
Commission's work on decriminalisation of politics and disqualification for
filing false affidavits in the form of the 244th Report titled "Electoral
Disqualifications"    on   24th   February  2014.    The    Commission's
recommendations were subsequently forwarded to the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     D. The Present Report

1.11           After submitting the 244th Report, the Commission circulated
another questionnaire to all the registered national and State political parties
requesting their views on issues such as possible amendments to the Tenth
Schedule of the Constitution to do away with the concept of 'merger' and
'split'; expediting the disposal of election petitions; giving statutory status to
the Model Code of Conduct; incorporating the right to recall in the
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_11">Representation of People Act</a>, 1951 (hereinafter "RPA"); the right to reject

work, seeks to examine these issues; the issues raised in the earlier
consultation paper; and other related issues; to suggest amendments to the
Constitution, the RPA, 1951 and other laws to strengthen our electoral system
further.

<p id="p_23">1.12          While the Commission was preparing the second part of its
Report dealing with the aforementioned issues, the Supreme Court, in its
latest order dated 16th January 2015, in a PIL in Yogesh Gupta v ECI, 4
recorded the government's submission that it would seek the views of the Law
Commission, and the submission of an interim report, on the issue of totaliser
for counting votes. Hence, the Commission has given its recommendations on
the same.

<p id="p_24">1.13           The Commission hoped to receive constructive suggestions
from the political parties to assist it in the submission of the second part of its
Report, dealing with the issues in the questionnaire. However, once again, the
Commission received very few responses from the various political parties,
with only two national parties (being the Indian National Congress and the
Communist Party of India (Marxist)) and three registered state parties (being
the Shiv Sena, the Zoram Nationalist Party, the People's Party of Arunachal)
sending in their views. This was very discouraging given that political parties
are one of the most important stakeholders in the electoral process.

                       ELECTION FINANCE REFORM

2.1           Electoral reforms often contain proposals for reforming election
funding, and candidate and party expenditure. This Chapter discusses the
issue under three broad sub-groups: limits on political contributions and party
and candidate expenditure; disclosure norms and requirements; and State
funding of elections. These issues are governed by the provisions of the RPA,
the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 (hereinafter "Election Rules"), the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_12">Companies Act</a>, 2013, and the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (hereinafter "<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_14">IT Act</a>").
</p>
<p id="p_30">2.2           Part A of this Section provides a brief summary snapshot of the
relevant laws governing each of the three aspects, while Part B discusses the
need for election finance reform. Parts C analyses the laws regulating election
expenditure, contributions, and disclosure and Part D provides the
comparative perspective. Part E then describes the legal lacunae causing the
under-reporting of election spending while Part F examines the case for State
funding of elections. Part G concludes with a summary of recommendations.

 B. Need for Election Finance Reform

2.4            It is now well established that money plays a big role in politics,
</pre><p id="p_32">whether in the conduct, or campaigning, for elections. The Election
Commission of India (hereinafter "ECI"), in its guidelines issued on 29th
August 2014, recognised that "concerns have been expressed in various
quarters that money power is disturbing the level playing field and vitiating the
purity of elections."6 What gives rise to these concerns about the role of big
money in politics? These are not mere theoretical debates but are actual
problems afflicting the electoral process in India. Money, often from
illegitimate sources, results in "undisguised bullying" when it is used (both
authorised and unauthorised) to buy muscle power, weapons, or to unduly
influence voters through liquor, cash, gifts. Currency notes come first in
containers, then in truckloads, moving to wholesale/small retail forms, and
finally to suitcases and in people's pockets. Mr. Qureshi, in his book,
documents instances of Returning Officers and Chief Electoral Officers in
Tamil Nadu seizing crores of rupees in cash, bundles of saris and dhotis and
hundreds of gas stoves.7 It is evident that money is used in myriad of forms in
today's election process, but what are its consequences? Why is there a need
for election finance reform? The answers to these questions are articulated
below.
</p>
<p id="p_33">2.5            First, is the undeniable fact that financial superiority translates
into electoral advantage, and so richer candidates and parties have a greater
chance of winning elections. This is best articulated by the Supreme Court in
Kanwar Lal Gupta v Amar Nath Chawla (hereinafter "Kanwar Lal Gupta"), 8
when it explained the influence of money as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "...money is bound to play an important part in the successful
       prosecution of an election campaign. Money supplies "assets for
       advertising and other forms of political solicitation that increases the
       candidate's exposure to the public." Not only can money buy
       advertising and canvassing facilities such as hoardings, posters,
       handbills, brochures etc. and all the other paraphernalia of an election
       campaign, but it can also provide the means for quick and speedy
       communications and movements and sophisticated campaign
       techniques and is also "a substitute for energy" in that paid workers
       can be employed where volunteers are found to be insufficient. The
       availability of large funds does ordinarily tend to increase the number of
       votes a candidate will receive. If, therefore, one political party or
       individual has larger resources available to it than another individual or
       political party, the former would certainly, under the present system of

<p id="p_36">         conducting elections, have an advantage over the latter in the electoral
        process". [Emphasis supplied]

2.6          The Supreme Court, in its 2014 decision in Ashok Shankarrao
Chavan v Madhavrao Kinhalkar (hereinafter "Ashok Shankarrao Chavan"),9
repeated this line of reasoning, where it highlighted how money was used to
buy votes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "55. In recent times, when elections are being held it is widely reported
        in the Press and Media that money power plays a very vital role. Going
        by such reports and if it is true then it is highly unfortunate that many of
        the voters are prepared to sell their votes for a few hundred rupees.</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">        ...... This view of ours is more so apt in the present day context,
        wherein money power virtually controls the whole field of election and
        that people are taken for a ride by such unscrupulous elements who
        want to gain the status of a Member of Parliament or the State
        Legislature by hook or crook." [Emphasis supplied]

2.7           Second, and connected to the above point is the issue of
equality and equal footing between richer and poorer candidates. This can be
explained with the help of the Court's observations in Kanwar Lal Gupta on
the rationale behind expenditure limits:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "...it should be open to individual or any political party, howsoever
        small, to be able to contest an election on a footing of equality with any
        other individual or political party, howsoever rich and well financed it
        may be, and no individual or political party should be able to secure an
        advantage over others by reason of its superior financial strength."10
2.8     Similarly, in Ashok Shankarrao Chavan, 11 the Supreme Court noted
that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        "...it is a hard reality that if one is prepared to expend money to
        unimaginable limits only then can he be preferred to be nominated as a
        candidate for such membership, as against the credentials of genuine
        and deserving candidates."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">2.9          The Court's observations are not made in vacuum. A simple
perusal of the Lok Sabha 2014 candidates reveals that 27% (or 2208
candidates) of all the candidates were "crorepati candidates," and the average
asset of each of the 8163 candidates was Rs. 3.16 crores. The percentage of
crorepati candidates increased from 16% in 2009 Lok Sabha elections.12

2.10           Third, in complete contravention to the various laws and ECI
notifications, there is widespread prevalence of black money, bribery, and

<p id="p_41"> quid pro quo corruption; this helps candidates fund their campaigns. The
Supreme Court, affirming the conclusions of the 2002 report of the National
Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (hereinafter
"NCRWC"),13 recognized this reality in PUCL v Union of India14 and stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "One of the most critical problems in the matter of electoral reforms is
       the hard reality that for contesting an election one needs large amounts
       of money. The limits of expenditure prescribed are meaningless and
       almost never adhered to. As a result, it becomes difficult for the good
       and the honest to enter legislatures. It also creates a high degree of
       compulsion for corruption in the political arena. This has progressively
       polluted the entire system. Corruption, because it erodes performance,
       becomes one of the leading reasons for non-performance and
       compromised governance in the country. The sources of some of the
       election funds are believed to be unaccounted criminal money in return
       for protection, unaccounted funds from business groups who expect a
       high return on this investment, kickbacks or commissions on contracts
       etc." [Emphasis supplied]

2.11   Likewise, in Ashok Shankarrao Chavan,15 the Court observed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "48. It is common knowledge as is widely published in the Press and
       Media that nowadays in public elections payment of cash to the
       electorate is rampant and the Election Commission finds it extremely
       difficult to control such a menace. There is no truthfulness in the
       attitude and actions of the contesting candidates in sticking to the
       requirement of law, in particular to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_39">Section 77</a> and there is every
       attempt being made to violate the restrictions imposed in the matter of
       incurring election expenses with a view to woo the electorate
       concerned and thereby, gaining their votes in their favour by corrupt
       means viz by purchasing the votes.....</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       56. It is unfortunate that those who are really interested in the welfare
       of society and who are incapable of indulging in any such corrupt
       practices are virtually sidelined and are treated as totally ineligible for
       contesting the elections." [Emphasis supplied]

2.12           Candidates and political parties have devised ingenious ways to
disguise the illegitimate sources and expenditure of money by holding
community feasts, organising birthday parties and marriages, giving costly
gifts, or topping up mobile phones. Money is sometimes transferred through
cash packets slipped in newspapers, through rural moneylenders and

<p id="p_44"> pawnbrokers or by organising 'fake aartis'. 16 In fact, Tamil Nadu gained
notoriety for the "Thirumangalam formula", when Rs. 5000 was paid per voter
in Thirumangalam in Madurai in the 2009 bye-elections and other methods
were used to distribute money and earn votes.17

2.13           Fourth, the current system tolerates, or at least does not
prevent, lobbying and capture, where a sort of quid pro quo transpires
between big donors and political parties/candidates. While the problem of
bribery, corrupt practices and black money are important, to some extent, they
have distracted from the larger problem of election finance and the capture of
government by private individuals and interest groups. The Supreme Court,
citing a note from Harvard Law Review on campaign finance regulation,
articulated this concern in Kanwar Lal Gupta observing:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "A less debatable objective of regulating campaign funds is the
       elimination of dangerous financial pressures on elected officials. Even
       if contributions are not motivated by an expected return in political
       favours, the legislator cannot overlook the effects of his decisions on
       the sources of campaign funds."18
2.14          Similarly, Justice Kennedy in McConnell v Federal Election
Commission very well, when recognising the problem of solicitation as a
corruption, said:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "The making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the
       money and to the one who solicits the payment (by granting his
       request). Rules governing candidates' or officeholders' solicitation of
       contributions are, therefore, regulations governing their receipt
       of quids."19

2.15         Unregulated, or under-regulated, election financing leads to two
types of capture: the first involves cases where the industry / private entities

ordinary citizens and what they think of as "public interest."21

2.16           Thus, lobbying and capture give undue importance to big donors
and certain interest groups, at the expense of the ordinary citizen and violates
what the Indian Supreme Court terms, "the right of equal participation [of each
citizen in the polity]."22 In Kanwar Lal Gupta, the Supreme Court expressed its
views on this issue when it stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        "The other objective of limiting expenditure is to eliminate, as far as
        possible, the influence of big money in electoral process. If there were
        no limit on expenditure political parties would go all out for collecting
        contributions and obviously the largest contributions would be from the
        rich and the affluent who constitute but a fraction of the electorate. It is
        likely that some elected representatives would tend to share the views
        of the wealthy supporters of their political party, either because of
        shared background and association, increased access or subtle
        influences which condition their thinking."23

2.17          Finally, the argument for election finance reform is premised on
a more philosophical argument that large campaign donations, even when
legal, amount to what Lessig terms "institutional corruption", 24 which
compromise the political morality norms of a republican democracy. Here,
instead of direct exchange of money or favours, candidates alter their views
and convictions in a way that attracts the most funding. This change of
perception leads to an erosion of public trust, which in turn affects the quality
of democratic engagement.25
2.18 Having touched upon the need for election finance reform, it is useful to
examine the laws regulating election expenditure, disclosure and contribution

       party expenditure

2.20.1       Section 77 of the RPA does not directly limit the election

question of third party expenditure, namely the financing of a candidate's
campaign by political parties, corporate donors, or well wishers.

<p id="p_62"> 2.20.2        Till 1975, the Supreme Court refused to regard third party
expenditure as electoral expenditure within the meaning of Section 77 of the
RPA.27 This changed with Kanwar Lal Gupta, where the Supreme Court relied
on the "authorisation" of expenditure by a candidate in excess of the election
expenditure limits to note:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        "When a political party sponsoring a candidate incurs expenditure
        specifically in connection with his election, as distinguished from
        expenditure on general party propaganda, and the candidate knowingly
        takes advantage of it or participates in the programme or activity or
        consents to it or acquiesces in it, it would be reasonable to infer, save
        in special circumstances, that he impliedly authorised the political party
        to incur such expenditure; and he cannot escape the rigors of the
        ceiling by saying that he has not incurred expenditure but big political
        party has done so."28

2.20.3          Thus, the Court believed that the object of imposing individual
expenditure limits would be frustrated if parties or other supporters were free
to spend without any limits. Nevertheless, the RPA was amended in 1974 to
nullify the effect of the above judgment by inserting an explanation to <a href="/doc/91654/" id="a_48">Section
77(1)</a> to the effect that any third party expenditure in connection with a
candidate's election shall not be deemed to be expenditure incurred or
authorised by a candidate.29

2.20.4        The constitutionality of the 1974 amendment was challenged in
P. Nalla Thampy Terah v Union of India30 on the grounds that it sanctioned
discrimination between candidates and parties based on money power, and
hence contravened <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_49">Article 14.</a> Rejecting this contention, albeit reluctantly, the
Supreme Court held that it was not for the court to lay down policies in

</p>
<p id="p_65">2.20.5         Subsequently, later benches criticised this decision and the
position of law laid out in the 1974 amendment, noting that Section 123(6) of
the RPA had become "nugatory and redundant", 31 and that the practice of
parties in not maintaining accounts of donations and expenses incurred in
regard a candidate's election made it to difficult to determine "whose money
was actually spent through the hands of the party".32 Eventually in the seminal
case of Common Cause, a <a href="/doc/1707158/" id="a_54">Registered Society v. Union of India</a>, 33 the
Supreme Court reversed the burden of proof on the candidate claiming the
benefit of the exception created by the Explanation to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_55">Section 77</a>, holding that
even when expenses are claimed by a party, the (rebuttable) presumption
shall be that they have been incurred or authorised by the candidate. The
Court noted:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        "The expenditure (including that for which the candidate is seeking
        protection under Explanation I to Section 77 of R.P. Act) in connection
        with the election of a candidate - to the knowledge of the candidate or
        his election agent - shall be presumed to have been authorised by the
        candidate or his election agent. It shall, however, be open to the
        candidate to rebut the presumption in accordance with law....."34

2.20.6        Finally, owing to much criticism of the Explanation appended to
<a href="/doc/91654/" id="a_56">Section 77(1)</a> by the 1974 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_57">Amendment Act</a>, the said Explanation was deleted
by the Election and <a href="/doc/6594/" id="a_58">Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act</a> 2003 and replaced
with the current Explanation, referred to above. Outside spending by parties
and independent supporters must now be reported by the candidate, and
counted towards the expenditure ceiling.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">2.20.7         Thus, the current position is that the expenditure incurred by (a)
the leaders of political party on account of travel by air or by any other means
of transport for propagating the party's programme and (b) the political parties
or their supporters for generally propagating the party's programme shall not
be deemed to be expenditure in connection with the election incurred or
authorised by a candidate of that political party under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_59">Section 77</a>, RPA.

for disqualification up to a period of three years under Section 10A of the

done,35 that a mere failure to maintain correct accounts is not in and of itself a
corrupt practice under <a href="/doc/124987/" id="a_60">Section 123(6)</a>, provided the prescribed limit of
expenditure is not exceeded. While discussing the relevance of these
provisions in maintaining "absolute purity in elections", the Supreme Court in
Ashok Shankarrao Chavan noted as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     "....Even the explanation to Sub-section (1) to <a href="/doc/677119/" id="a_61">Section 123</a> makes it clear
     that incurring of election expenses and the maintenance of account of
     those expenses are not an empty formality but the very purpose of
     stipulating such restrictions and directions under <a href="/doc/91654/" id="a_62">Section 77(1)</a> and (3)
     read along with <a href="/doc/1961804/" id="a_63">Section 78</a> explains the mandate to maintain absolute
     purity in elections by the contesting candidates. This is required in order to
     ensure that the process of the election is not sullied by resorting to
     unethical means while incurring election expenses." 36

2.21.2        Further, the Supreme Court in PUCL v Union of India 37
endorsed the recommendations of the NCRWC's Report, 38 which had
highlighted the need for stronger disclosure and auditing norms observing:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">         "4.14.3. ....The Commission recommends that the political parties as

         candidate should submit an audited statement of expenses under
         specific heads. EC should devise specific formats for filing such

<p id="p_105"> Penalties

2.24.12       The Electoral Commission has certain supervisory, enforcement
and investigatory powers under the PPERA that allows it to check that funding
is derived from permissible sources; to issue notice to a person/organisation
to produce any books, documents or records for its inspection.
</p>
<p id="p_106">2.24.13       Schedule 20 of the PPERA lists the various penalties, which
provides for instance a fine or one year imprisonment for being indicted for
making false statements to auditor; or a level 5 fine (maximum £5,000) for
summary conviction for failing to deliver proper statements of account, or
within time. The Electoral Commission's Enforcement Policy prescribes the
varying nature of penalties in detail providing for fines ranging from £250-
£5,000 for prescribed contraventions and £250-£20,000 for certain offences
triable by a Magistrate or in a Crown's Court. Apart from this, it can issue a
compliance notice, a restoration notice, a stop notice, or an enforcement
undertaking.55

2.24.14         Courts can also order forfeiture, if the Commission applies for
the same in a civil process. The forfeited amount will be equal to the donation
value that was accepted impermissibly or from an unidentifiable source or was
concealed in a statutory report. The Commission will request a court-ordered
forfeiture in these cases if it cannot agree on a voluntary settlement and it
believes it is in public interest to do so.56

2.24.15      Finally, the Commission lacks the power to impose criminal
sanctions, although it may refer a breach for criminal investigation and
prosecution under certain circumstances.

donations up to €1000 can be made in cash. While small donations and party
membership dues are tax deductible since 1967, pursuant to a Supreme
Court order in 1994, corporate donations are not deductible.58 Further, <a href="/doc/501652/" id="a_100">section

more than €500 to political parties are also prohibited.
</p>
<p id="p_112">2.25.4        The law is silent on donations to individual candidates, although
it seems permissible (even foreign donations to candidates do not seem to be
prohibited). In any event, while there are parliamentary rules governing
disclosure in such cases, donations to individual candidates does not seem as
important given that <a href="/doc/213557/" id="a_102">section 25(1)</a> requires candidates to turn over the

Federal Election Campaign Act's (hereinafter "FECA") individual expenditure
limit on the grounds that it curtailed the quantum of free speech, and hence
violated the First Amendment rights of the candidates. As the Court noted:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">        "A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on
        political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the
        quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed,
        the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.
        This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in
        today's mass society requires the expenditure of money".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_123">It must be noted, however, that when Presidential candidates are publicly
funded, an upper limit to that expenditure is constitutional.
</p>
<p id="p_124">2.25.14       Independent third party expenditures in the US are not subject
to any limit - corporations and unions may incur such expenditure. These
refer to any communications that expressly advocate the winning or defeat of
any party, without being requested or suggested to do so by any party or
agents or political committee to do so.62

Contribution

2.25.15      In 2010, in Citizens United v FEC,63 the Court continued the line
of reasoning followed in Buckley and proceeded to strike down any limit on
independent expenditures by corporations, associations, and labour unions in

60 LOC Germany, supra note 58.

</p><p id="p_126">62 FECA, How General Election Funding Works, &lt; http://www.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm&gt;.
63 553 US 310 (2010). As per the ruling, corporations and unions can now spend money, for

instance via advertisements, supporting or denouncing individual candidates, even though the
ban on direct corporate contributions remained.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                                                         25</span>
<p id="p_127"> federal elections citing the free speech clause. However, the ban on direct
corporate contributions remained unaffected. Justice Stevens who delivered
the dissenting opinion in this case made the observation that the bench in
Buckley had recognised the possibility of its judgement being misused and
had left open a window to impose regulations on the grounds of curbing
corruption. This ruling has been criticised for allowing special interest groups
to influence the election campaigns through unbridled spending, while
undermining the efforts of ordinary citizens making modest contributions to
support the candidates of their choice.
</p>
<p id="p_128">2.25.16       After Buckley, a distinction was drawn between election
contribution and election spending. In other words, the different limits that are
imposed in each state on the amount of contribution that an individual,
company, union etc. can make, stood intact after this decision. However, with
the 2014 decision in McCutcheon v. FEC, 64 this distinction between
contribution and spending was blurred, and the Supreme Court struck down
the biennial upper limit to the total amount any individual could contribute to
federal candidates and national parties. According to the Court, these
aggregate limits restricting how much money a donor may contribute to
candidates for federal office, political parties, and PACs do not further the
government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, although they
seriously restrict participation in the democratic process. Hence, the First
Amendment was said to have been violated, with the Court noting that, "Any
regulation must instead target what we have called 'quid pro quo' corruption
or its appearance."65

2.25.17       Thus, after McCutcheon, there are no overall limits on aggregate
contributions by an individual to candidates and political parties. Apart from
this, the ban on direct corporate contribution stands and there are limits on
individual contributions to a single candidate or a Political Action Committee
("PACs").
</p>
<p id="p_129">Disclosure

2.25.18       The FECA mandates the disclosure of all sources and spending
of funding for candidate, party committees and PACs.66 Under <a href="/doc/1966061/" id="a_114">Section 432</a> of
the Act, a treasurer is mandatorily appointed for every party, and all

64 134 S. Ct. 1434 (2014).
</p><p id="p_130">65 The Supreme Court's rationale in McCutcheon v FEC, 134 S. Ct. 1434 (2014) was that
aggregate limits restricting how much money a donor may contribute to candidates for federal
office, political parties, and PACs do not further the government's interest in preventing quid
pro quo corruption, although they seriously restrict participation in the democratic process.
Hence, the First Amendment was said to have been violated, with the Court noting that, "Any

and file a report with the FEC.
</p>
<p id="p_133">2.25.19       There are also disclosure norms in place even for independent
expenditures - a disclaimer is required to identify who paid for communication
and financing must be disclosed to the public. The reports must be quarterly
when aggregate is greater than $250 per election, 48-hour reports between
the beginning of the year and twenty days prior to the election when the
aggregate is greater than or equal to $10,000. Within 20 days before the
election, 24 hours reports must be given when the aggregate is greater than
or equal to $1000. Electioneering communications are also subject to
disclosure norms if the costs of disbursement exceed $10,000.67

2.25.20      Disclosure norms are different for different categories of 'political
committees', which play a supremely important role in US elections. The
terms refers to any committee or association of people who receive total
contributions or makes net expenditure in excess of $10,000 during a
calendar year or any local committee of a political party which makes certain
kinds of expenditure and receives contributions in aggregate excess of $5,000
in a year. Section 434 of the FECA lays down the reporting requirements for
various such committees, such as the authorized political party committees,
unauthorized committees, personal contributions of the candidate etc., each
being required to be filed under different norms.

<p id="p_134">2.25.21       When reports are filed with the FEC, however, they must contain

Expenses

2.26.28        The Philippines Omnibus Election Code of 1985 regulates the
expenditure by parties and candidates. Section 1 of the Code sets the ceiling
for political parties at 5 pesos per voter in each constituency where the party
is fielding a candidate. Further candidate expenditure is also limited, with
presidential and vice-presidential candidates being permitted to spend 10
pesos per registered voter; and for other candidates, the limit is 3 pesos, with
an additional 5 pesos per voter for independent candidates.90

Contribution

2.26.29       Political parties or candidates cannot accept donations from
corporates; foreign interests; anonymous donors and other financial
institutions, educational institutions receiving state support and
officials/employees of the Civil Service or Armed Forces.91

Disclosure

2.26.30        Section 15 of the Manila Resolution and sections 106-107 of the
Omnibus Code requires the candidates or the treasurers of the political
parties to submit a statement setting out in detail the amounts of contribution
received, the date of receipt, the name and address of the donors and a
record of their expenses and obligations. Records of contributions are to be
kept for three years, failing which it will be considered prima facie evidence of
violation of the provisions of the law. The identity of donors is required to be

2.27.1          Although there are legal provisions limiting election expenditure
for candidates and governing the disclosure of contributions by companies to
political parties, the same is not properly regulated, either due to loopholes in
the law, or improper enforcement.
</p><p id="p_184">2.27.2       This is evident from the 2001 Consultation Paper of the NCRWC
on Electoral Reforms, which estimates that actual campaign expenditure by
candidates is "in the range of about twenty to thirty times the said limits."93 In
fact, one of the major concerns regarding expenditure and contribution
regulation is that the apparently low ceiling of candidate expenditure
increases the demand for black money cash contributions and drives

2.27.3        Interestingly however, the Association of Democratic Reforms
(hereinafter "ADR") in its election expenses analysis for the Lok Sabha 2009
elections found that on average, the Members of Parliament declared election
expenditures of 59% of the total expenses limit.95 Of the 6753 candidates (of
a total of 8028 candidates) whose summary statements of expenses were
available, only four candidates exceeded the ceiling and only 30 spent up to
90% of the expenditure limit.96 On the other hand, 1066 candidates declared
election expenses of less than Rs. 20,000 and 197 declared expenses less
than Rs. 10,000.97 Given the distortion between the reported and estimated
candidate expenditure, increasing the expenditure limits further (from the
2014 increase) might not necessarily provide an answer.
</p>
<p id="p_186">2.27.4         Additionally, in their analysis on the sources of funding for
political parties, ADR found that more than 75% of parties' sources are
unknown, while donations over Rs. 20,000 comprise only 9% of parties'

<p id="p_189"> 2.27.5         To try and remedy the situation, the ECI's transparency
guidelines, effective from 1st October, 2014 state that no income tax
deductions are permissible for cash contributions to political parties by an
individual or a company under<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_152"> s. 80GGB</a> and <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_153">80GGC</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_154">IT Act</a> and that all cash
donations should be duly accounted in the account books. Further, parties are
stipulated to maintain names and addresses of all donors, specifically those
donating during public rallies (except petty sums and hundi/bucket
collections).99

2.27.6        Therefore, there is clearly under reporting of election
expenditure and opacity of political contribution. Part of the explanation lies in
the lacunae in the law, and part in black money and poor enforcement. To
this, we now turn.
</p>
<pre id="pre_7">(ii)      Legal lacunae

2.27.7       There are various loopholes in the laws regarding election
</pre><p id="p_190">expenditure, contribution and disclosure. First, and most importantly, despite
the Election and <a href="/doc/6594/" id="a_155">Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act</a> 2003, the subject of
regulation under Section 77 of the RPA only covers individual "candidates",
and not on political parties. This is evident from the stipulation requiring "every
candidate" (or his electoral agent) to keep a separate account of the
expenditure which has been "incurred or authorized by him" between the date
of nomination and declaration. Consequently, political parties and candidate
supporters are allowed unlimited expenditure in propagating the party
program, as long as no specific candidate is favoured.100

2.27.8         The implications of the wording of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_156">Section 77(1)</a> are evident in
the ECI guidelines on expenditure allocation in the General Observers
Handbook. The ECI has categorised the advertisements published by political
parties in the following three categories:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">       (i) "Expenditure on general party propaganda seeking support for the
             party and its candidates in general, but, without any reference to any
             particular candidate or any particular class/group of candidates.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">       (ii) Expenditure incurred by the party, in advertisements etc., directly
             seeking support and / or vote for any particular candidate or group of
             candidates.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">       (iii) Expenditure incurred by the party, which can be related to the
             expenditure for promoting the prospects of any particular candidate or
             group of candidates."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_192"> 2.27.9       According to the ECI, the first case will not be included in the
candidate's expenditure limits under Section 77(1) of the RPA, while the
second and third cases shall be included in the expenditure incurred or
authorised by the candidates or their election agents.101

2.27.10       Second, clever accounting can allow parties to attribute large
amounts of expenditure to their "leaders" and hence, avail of the exception
under the Explanation to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_157">Section 77</a>. For instance, the ECI states that when
leaders of a political party travel to and from their constituency to other
constituencies as star campaigners, the expenditure on their travel would fall
within the exempted category.102 As the above break down of expenditures for
the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections reveal, expenditure incurred on vehicle usage
and transport comprise the largest proportion of a candidate's declared
expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_193">2.27.11      Third, the scope of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_158">Section 77(1)</a> is very narrow and applies only
from the date of nomination to the date of declaration and thus any
expenditure incurred in the remaining period is exempt from any limit or
regulation.
</p>
<p id="p_194">2.27.12        Fourth, regarding political contribution, the Rs. 20,000 disclosure
limit can be easily evaded by writing multiple cheques below Rs. 20,000 each,
or giving the money in cash. Nor is the profit-linked contribution limit of 7.5% a
significant restriction for large companies. As per Gowda and Sridharan while
the law creates incentives for disclosure vide tax exemptions, it can be
outweighed by the disincentive created by the loss of anonymity, especially
given that in many instances big donors support multiple parties, or change
their support, and do not want this information to be disclosed for fear of
reprisal.103

2.27.13       Fifth, the authorisation of corporate contribution requires a
resolution to be passed to such effect at the meeting of the Board of Directors
under <a href="/doc/1870567/" id="a_159">Section 182(1)</a> of the Companies Act, 2013. The empowerment of a
small group to decide how to use the funds of a company for political
purposes, instead of involving the vast numbers of shareholders (being the
actual owners of the company) has also been criticised.104 Britain follows such

 a shareholder approach where British companies require shareholder
approval before they can make any political contribution or incur any political
expenditure.105

2.27.14         Finally, disclosure norms need to be strengthened. As we have
seen, the ECI's transparency guidelines do not have statutory authority and
there is no legal consequence for non-compliance. Further, unlike many of the
countries discussion in the previous section, political parties and candidates
file their returns with the ECI, without putting up the information online (on the
ECI's website) or making it easily available for public inspection (barring an
RTI). This is essential to bring about transparency in the public domain and to
let the voters know the donors, contributions and expenditures of the parties
and candidates. Moreover, in many cases such as compliance with section
29C of the RPA (regulating political party disclosure) the only penalty for non-
compliance is losing the income tax exemption. This is not a significant
enough deterrent to parties.
</p>
<p id="p_196">2.27.15       Despite the various legal lacunae, electoral reform is possible
and will not be impeded by free speech claims as in the United States, evident
in the Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions. In India, <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_160">Article 19(1)</a> of the
Constitution only extends to citizens and natural persons, and corporations
have not been considered citizens with free speech rights,106which can only
be exercised by shareholders. 107 Thus, corporations do not have a right to
make a political contribution as part of their exercise of free speech rights,
especially given the non-involvement of shareholders in this decision making
process. Apart from that, countervailing interests of equality, anti-corruption,
and public morality will provide a constitutional basis for any election finance
reform.

<p id="p_201"> regulation on election expenditure should be amended to extend from the
date of notification of the elections to the date of declaration of results, given
that many candidates file their nominations only on the last date of filing, to
prevent the application of <a href="/doc/1641543/" id="a_163">section 77</a> limiting their expenses. Campaigning
commences before or at least once the ECI announces the date of elections,
and the filing of nominations is often viewed only as a formality.
</p>
<p id="p_202">2.28.2        Although the UK system of covering both the pre-candidacy
long-campaign period, namely a certain specified time, such as a year, before
the date of nomination; and the short-campaign period, namely from the date
of nomination to the declaration of results is desirable, it may not be feasible
in India. Unlike the UK, India is a much larger and more diverse country,
which would make the task of determining what constitutes election expenses
in the pre-candidacy period, and then regulating it, difficult. Instead, an
amendment to <a href="/doc/1641543/" id="a_164">section 77</a> extending its scope as suggested above, may be a
better mid-way solution and a more practical alternative.
</p>
<p id="p_203">2.28.3           Furthermore, Section 77 of the RPA only regulates the election
expenses of candidates. Political parties are free to spend any amount as
long as it is for the general party propaganda, and not towards an
independent candidate. Thus, there is no ceiling on party expenditure. It is
recommended that the law on this point does not change, namely that there
are no caps on party expenditure under the RPA given that it would be very
difficult to fix an actual, viable limit of such a cap and then implement such a
cap. In any event, as the experience with <a href="/doc/91654/" id="a_165">section 77(1)</a> discussed above
reveals, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, on average candidates showed
election expenditures of 59% of the total expenses limit. There is no reason
why the same phenomenon of under-reporting will not transpire amongst
parties.
</p>
<p id="p_204">2.28.4         Placing legislative ceilings on party expenditure or contributions
will not automatically solve the problem, especially without putting in place a
viable alternative of complete state funding of elections (which in itself is next
to impossible right now). Our previous experience in prohibiting corporate
donations in 1969 did not lead to a reduction in corporate donations. Instead,
in the absence of any alternative model for raising funds, it greatly increased
illegal, under the table and black money donations.
</p>
<p id="p_205">2.28.5        Although the problem of black money and under-reporting will
remain under the existing regime of no caps on individual contribution and
party expenses, it has to be tackled through a stricter implementation of the
anti-corruption laws and RTI and improved disclosure norms. It might be
desirable to regularly re-examine the 7.5% profit cap on company's

 contributions in light of the intended rationale, since the former can become a
meaningless limit in the context of big companies.
</p>
<p id="p_206">2.28.6       On a separate note, the authorisation of corporate contribution
through a resolution passed at the meeting of the Board of Directors under
<a href="/doc/1870567/" id="a_166">Section 182(1)</a> of the Companies Act, 2013 should be amended to empower a
larger group of people, such as the company's shareholders, in deciding how
to use the funds of a company for political purposes. This has been done in
the United Kingdom as well. <a href="/doc/1870567/" id="a_167">Section 182(1)</a> should be amended to this effect.
</p>
<p id="p_207">(b) On Disclosure

2.28.7       Disclosure is at the heart of public supervision of political finance
and requires strict implementation of the provisions of the RPA, the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_168">IT Act</a>, the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_169">Company Act</a>, and the ECI transparency guidelines, effective from 1st October
2014, bearing No. 76/PPEMS/Transparency/2013 dated 29th August, 2014
and 19th November 2014, which need to be given statutory backing. This is
especially important given the Commission's recommendations that the
current absence of expenditure caps for parties and contributions remain
unchanged.
</p>
<p id="p_208">2.28.8         The primary provision governing disclosure of election expenses
for candidates in the RPA is <a href="/doc/1961804/" id="a_170">Section 78</a> and Rules 86-90 of the Election
Rules. A new section, <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_171">section 77A</a> needs to be inserted (similar to the
comparative practices referred above) to provide for candidates disclosing (a)
any individual contributions received by them and (b) any contribution by the
political party from the date of notification of elections, regardless of whether
the donation is in cash, cheque, or in kind.
</p>
<p id="p_209">2.28.9       Similarly, <a href="/doc/1961804/" id="a_172">Section 78</a> should also be amended in light of the
proposed amendment to <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_173">section 77A</a> above, and the reference to more than
one returned candidate should be removed.
</p>
<p id="p_210">2.28.10       The primary provision governing disclosure for political parties in
the RPA is <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_174">Section 29C</a> and Rule 85B, which requires political parties to
report contributions only in excess of Rs. 20,000 and the ECI's transparency
guidelines which stipulate that all cash contributions be duly accounted for. As
the abovementioned analysis by ADR on the sources of political funding for
parties reveals, more than 75% of parties sources of funds are unknown while
only 9% of their funding is said to comprise donations over Rs. 20,000.
</p>
<p id="p_211">2.28.11        Evidently, writing multiple cheques below Rs. 20,000 each can
easily evade this Rs. 20,000 disclosure limit (and even otherwise, the non-
deductibility of income tax does not serve as a sufficient deterrent). Even


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                                               41</span>
 otherwise, donor incentives created by tax exemptions do not always
outweigh the disincentive caused by the loss of anonymity, especially in a
situation where donors or companies or trusts donate to multiple parties.
Hence, it is imperative to require the disclosure of all contribution amounts,
subject to a cap of Rs. 20 crore or 20 per cent of the total contribution,
whichever is lesser as discussed below, whether in cash or cheque or kind.
Further, the limit should apply to contributions given cumulatively by a person
or company throughout the year. Even if these measures are unable to stem
the flow of black money, it is hoped they will improve transparency and make
the process of evasion more difficult.
</p>
<p id="p_212">2.28.12       Further, parties claim that part of this 75% unaccounted funding
comes from small donors contributing amounts such as Rs. 50 or Rs. 100,
making it difficult to keep account of the same. Similarly, hundi or bucket
collections at public rallies are also said to form part of parties' funding
corpus, and are also not disclosed on grounds of practical difficulty. However,
such levels of anonymity are used as means of avoiding disclosure.
</p>
<p id="p_213">2.28.13       While the Commission agrees that there are undoubtedly cases
where parties collect a part of their funding from anonymous small donors and
hundi/bucket collections at public rallies, the anonymity should be limited. The
Commission suggests that only up to Rs. twenty crore or twenty per cent of
the total contribution of a political party's entire collection (whether
cash/cheque), whichever is lesser, can be anonymous. Apart from this, the
details and amounts of all donations and donors (including PAN cards,
wherever applicable) need to be disclosed by political parties, regardless of
their source or amount.
</p>
<p id="p_214">2.28.14       Additionally, the auditing provisions should be enforced across
all the levels of political parties, including the national, regional, local, and
sub-local levels. It is pertinent to note that the Law Commission had
recommended the insertion of a new <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_175">Section 78A</a> in its 170 th Report in 1999
on the "Maintenance, audit, publication of accounts by political parties". As per
the proposed <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_176">Section 78A(1)</a>:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">       "Each recognised political party shall maintain accounts clearly and
       fully disclosing the sources of all amounts received by it and clearly
       and fully disclosing the expenditure incurred by it. The accounts shall
       be maintained according to the financial year. Within nine months of
       each financial year, each recognised political party shall submit its
       accounts, duly audited by an accountant (as defined in the
       Explanation below sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/864575/" id="a_177">section 288</a> of the Income-tax

       shall publish the said accounts in accordance with such general
       directions as may be issued by the Election Commission in this


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                              42</span>

       they shall also be entitled to obtain copies of such accounts or any
       part thereof in accordance with such instructions as the Election
       Commission may issue in that behalf."108

2.28.15        This is similar to ECI's auditing and accounting guidelines
stating that all books of accounts need to be audited and certified by qualified,
practicing Chartered Accountants annually, with a copy of the Auditor's
Report. The Commission recommends inserting a new <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_178">section 29C</a> (replacing
the current provision), along these lines, to require parties to maintain and
submit audited accounts annually.

<p id="p_215">2.28.16        Finally, separate provisions should be inserted, along the lines
of the comparative practice discussed above, requiring:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_216">(c) On Penalties

2.28.17        Currently, penal provisions for candidates are governed by
<a href="/doc/1186128/" id="a_184">section 10A</a>, RPA which provides for disqualification, up to a period of three
years, for failure to lodge accounts of election expenses. The period of
disqualification should be increased up to five years, and should apply to
contribution reports under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_185">section 77A</a> as well, so that a defaulting candidate
may be ineligible to contest at least the next general elections normally held
after five years.

<p id="p_218"> 2.28.18      With respect to political parties, the ECI's transparency

black money, this does not serve as a true deterrent and the penalty needs to
include more than just non-deductibility of tax.
</p>
<p id="p_219">2.28.19      Similarly, the penalty of non-deductibility of tax under section
29C of the RPA r/w <a href="/doc/1554173/" id="a_189">section 13A</a> of the IT Act for parties which do not maintain
the names and addresses of all donors (donating above Rs. 20,000) as per
Form 24A of the Election Rules is not stringent enough and may be flouted.
While Section 10A of the RPA disqualifies candidates for a failure to lodge an
account of election expenses, similar strict provisions are not applicable to
parties. The Law Commission had recommended the insertion of a new
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_190">Section 78A(2)</a> in its 170th Report on penalties for non-compliance:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "(2) A political party which does not comply with any of the

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      If such default continues beyond the period of 60 days, the Election

      deem appropriate besides initiating criminal prosecution as provided
      under law."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_220">2.28.20      The Commission endorses these proposed sub-sections with
certain modifications: first, the penalty for non-compliance should be
increased from Rs. 10,000 daily to Rs. 25,000 daily; secondly, the default
period before the ECI may de-recognise the party be extended to 90 days;
third, the penalty for filing false information should be stipulated up to a

<p id="p_222">(d) On electoral trusts

2.28.22         <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_194">The IT Act</a> has been amended to provide for tax relief on
donations to the electoral trusts, setup for the sole purpose of making
donations to political parties and as discussed above, the ECI regulates
electoral trusts as well through its "Electoral Trust Companies" scheme
notified on 10th December 2013. However, there is no disclosure provision
under the RPA corresponding to the changes in the income tax laws.
Additionally, the only penalty prescribed non-submission of an annual report
of contributions to the ECI as per the prescribed format (detailing the names
and addresses of donors and donations given to parties), before the due date
of filing of tax returns is that "adverse notice shall be taken" of the failure to
comply with the instructions. 110 Thus, a new Chapter IVB pertaining to the
'Regulation of Electoral Trusts' should be introduced, to provide for the
regulation of electoral trusts with appropriate penal provisions for enforcement
in case of default, along the lines of the proposed amendments above.

<p id="p_306">F. State Funding of Elections

2.29.1         In many countries around the world, the role of big money in
elections (and the associated charges of bribing, capture, lobbying, and
institutional corruption) has sought to be reduced through public funding of
elections. In India too, the idea of state funding has been proposed to reduce
the unending increase in the cost of elections (and create a more level playing
field) and to curb corruption and the influence of black money. Nevertheless,
despite similar proposals in India, there is currently no direct public funding of
elections.
</p>
<p id="p_307">2.29.2        However, the 2003 Amendment to the RPA introduced Sections
39A of the RPA to provide for partial in-kind subsidy in the form of allocation
of equitable sharing of airtime on cable television networks and other
electronic media (based on past performance); and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_239">Sections 78A</a>, and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_240">78B</a> for
the free supply of copies of electoral rolls and certain other items. It is
pertinent to note that no rules for operationalization for the sharing of airtime
on private media have been finalised under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_241">Section 39A</a>. 111 On 14th March
2014, the ECI issued an order bearing No. 437/TVs/2014(LS) to extend the
scheme of equitable time sharing through the Prasar Bharti Corporation,
namely Doordarshan and All India Radio for the forthcoming General
Elections to the recognised six National parties and 47 State parties and not
to independent candidates.112

<p id="p_309"> 2.29.3       Such legislative provisions are a consequence of our history of
reform proposals on state funding of elections, which are described in the
section below.
</p>
<pre id="pre_10">(i)    History of reform proposals

2.29.4         The first committee to deal with the issue of public funding was
</pre><p id="p_310">the Dinesh Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms in 1990, which
advocated for partial state funding of elections in the form of limited in-kind
support for vehicle fuel (which is a primary campaign expense); rental charges
for microphones; issuance of voter identity slips; and additional copies of
electoral rolls.113

2.29.5        In 1993, the Confederation of Indian Industries constituted a
Task Force that recommended that elections be funded in effect, through a
tax on the industry. This would involve the funds to be raised either through a
cess on excise duty, or through corporate contributions to an election fund
pool managed by the State, which would then be distributed via a pre-decided
formula based on vote and seat share.114

2.29.6         The 1998 Indrajit Gupta Committee Report on State Funding of
Elections endorsed state funding of elections, seeing "full justification
constitutional, legal as well as on ground of public interest" in order to
establish a fair playing field for parties with less money power. The Committee
envisaged a phased introduction of public funding, given the economic
conditions of the country in 1998, beginning with in-kind state subsidies (and
no cash) such as rent-free office space, free telephone facilities, electoral
rolls' copies, loudspeakers, specified quantities of fuel, food packets, and
airtime (both on state and private media). Gradually, the Committee
envisioned a transition to full state funding, along with monetary provision via
the creation of a central-governed Election Fund, whose funding would be
provided by the Centre and the states together. However, the Committee
excluded independent candidates from the benefits of state funding and
required parties to submit audited accounts and tax returns to avail the
benefits.115

2.29.7     This was followed soon after by the Report of the Law
Commission in 1999 on the Reform of Electoral Laws, which endorsed the

<p id="p_313"> ideas of the Indrajit Gupta Committee Report on partial state funding, as a first
step towards total funding given that the latter was not "feasible" in light of the
"prevailing economic conditions". However, the Commission clarified that
given that the underlying premise of state funding was the elimination of the
influence of money power, corporate funding and black money support, it was:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">       "... absolutely essential before the idea of state funding (whether partial or
       total) is resorted, the provisions suggested in this report relating to political
       parties (including the provisions ensuring internal democracy, internal
       structures) and maintenance of accounts, their auditing and submission to
       Election Commission are implemented.....The state funding, without the
       aforesaid pre-conditions, would merely become another                 source of
       funds for the political parties and candidates at the cost of public
       exchequer."116

2.29.8        In 2001, the NCRWC concurred with the 1999 Law Commission
report that the question of permitting state funding "should not even arise"
</blockquote><p id="p_314">without:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">          "an effective systemic acceptance of full audit of party funds including a
          full audit of campaign funds, deletion of explanation 1 to <a href="/doc/106237339/" id="a_242">section 77(1)</a>
          of the Representation of People Act 1951, a fool proof mechanism to
          deter expenditure violations, and until the government is convinced that
          these improvements have been institutionalised and are no longer
          being breached." 117
2.29.9        To do so otherwise, would simply add to the burden on the
Exchequer and taxpayers without any public or systematic benefit. The
NCRWC's views were premised on the failure of the existing mechanisms of
partial or indirect state funding in reducing campaign expenditure and the
need to bring in transparency mechanisms first.118

2.29.10        Similarly, the ARC's 2007 Report on "Ethics in Governance" also
recommended partial state funding of elections to reduce the scope of
"illegitimate and unnecessary funding" of elections expenses.119

</p><p id="p_324">(iii)      Recommendations

2.30.1        A quick perusal of the recommendations of various committees
on state funding of elections and comparative provisions makes it clear that
complete public funding of elections or political parties in India is not a
practical option; instead, indirect state subsidy is a better alternative for
various reasons provided below.
</p>
<p id="p_325">2.30.2        First, prevailing economic conditions make it impossible for
complete state funding of elections. Full funding should prohibit candidates
and parties from accessing alternative sources of money both during election
campaigns and in the inter-election period. If full funding is a seen as a
replacement for the pervasiveness of big money in elections, then it will have
to be substantial enough to stop the prevalence of black money. Given the
amount being spent on elections today, and the alternative use of money on
poverty reduction, health, education, food etc.; it seems highly unlikely that
the centre can provide such money.
</p>
<p id="p_326">2.30.3        Second, for similar reasons of financial burdens, monetary
constraints, and weak enforcement, a system of matching grants as in
Germany and the United Kingdom are not possible. Corporate grants are
often enormous and hence will be difficult to match, while a lot of big donors
give money in black, and hence will only to serve to increase the amount of
total funding available with parties.
</p>



<p id="p_327">125   Ibid., at 118, 123.
</p><p id="p_328">126   Ibid., at 209.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                                                                        57</span>
<p id="p_329"> 2.30.4        Third, currently, there is no clear picture on the cost of financing
elections given the weak disclosure of expenditure by political parties and
contributions by corporates and big donors. A system of complete monetary
state support will work only if it replaces the actual demand for money in
election campaigns and day-to-day administration of political parties. Hence
any state support has to be in kind support, and not in cash because unless
the current system satisfies the total requirement of parties, monetary support
will only serve to increase party spending and invite uninterested or
opportunistic candidates and parties.
</p>
<p id="p_330">2.30.5          Fourth, as the Law Commission Report in 1999 and the
NCRWC Report in 2001 acknowledge, reforms on state funding of election
have to be preceded by campaign finance reform; improvement in
transparency, disclosure and audit provisions; decriminalisation of politics;
and the introduction of inner party democracy. Funding parties (instead of
candidates) with little internal democracy will only strengthen the power of the
leadership and the benefits of public funding might not extend to the rank and
file of the party.127

2.30.6         Fifth, there are various associated problems with state funding
such as the possible undermining of the independence of the parties due to
their financial reliance on the exchequer, and can be especially problematic
for new parties. 128 Even otherwise, the distribution of public money may
reduce party incentives to maintain their social base and generate funds
through political mobilisation.129 Moreover, as the comparative table shows, in
most countries subsidies are determined on the basis of past performance or
current representation, and thus automatically discourage new (and weaker)
parties. In case of current representation, money will have to be given upfront
and subsequently, overpaid parties will have to reimburse the State, while
underpaid parties will be reimbursed by the state after the results.130

2.30.7       Finally, public funding of elections, including existing provisions
on partial in-kind funding only extends to registered parties and hence
excludes independent candidates, whilst simultaneously encouraging frivolous
candidatures, with the sole intention of gaining access to public funds.
</p>
<p id="p_331">2.30.8         Instead, as the Indrajit Gupta Committee noted in its 1998
report, efforts should be made to curb the costs of campaigning by limiting or
regulating the use and location of cut outs and banners; hoardings and
posters; the number of public meetings; the use of vehicles during campaigns,

</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                                                               58</span>
<p id="p_335"> and the publicity from moving vehicles. This will help reduce the cost of
elections, although it may not reduce the incentives to raise election funds
and abuse power.131

2.30.9         With respect to indirect in-kind subsidy, reference should be
made to the British practice to increase the quantum of such subsidies to
include free broadcasting time on private channels, free postage and meeting
rooms, access to public town halls, the cost of printing, and even provision of
specified quantities of fuel and food packets. Thus, by providing a "financial
floor" to parties and candidates, 132 it reduces the cost of elections, without
providing parties with liquid cash to spend in addition to their resources.
</p>
<p id="p_336">2.30.10       On the basis of the above, the following recommendations are
suggested:
</p><p id="p_337">   1. Currently, a system of complete state funding of elections or of
      matching grants, wherein the government matches the private funding
      (by donors or corporates) raised by political parties, are not feasible
      given the economic conditions and developmental problems of the
      country.
</p><p id="p_338">   2. Given the high cost of elections and the improbability of being able to
      replace the actual demand for money, the existing system of giving
      indirect in-kind subsidies instead of giving money via a National
      Election Fund, should continue.
</p><p id="p_339">   3. The wording of Section 78B of the RPA permits the Central
      Government, in consultation with the ECI, to supply certain items to the
      electors or the candidates and this provision can be used to expand the
      in-kind subsidy to include free public meeting rooms, certain printing
      costs, free postage etc.
</p><p id="p_340">   4. Any reform in state funding should be preceded by reforms such as the
      decriminalisation of politics, the introduction of inner party democracy,
      electoral finance reform, transparency and audit mechanisms, and
      stricter implementation of anti-corruption laws so as to reduce the
      incentive to raise money and abuse power.

        country.
</p><p id="p_430">     2. Given the high cost of elections and the improbability of being able to
        replace the actual demand for money, the existing system of giving
        indirect in-kind subsidies instead of giving money via a National
        Election Fund, should continue.
</p><p id="p_431">     3. The wording of Section 78B of the RPA permits the Central
        Government, in consultation with the ECI, to supply certain items to the
        electors or the candidates and this provision can be used to expand the
        in-kind subsidy to include free public meeting rooms, certain printing
        costs, free postage etc.
</p><p id="p_432">     4. Any reform in state funding should be preceded by reforms such as the
        decriminalisation of politics, the introduction of inner party democracy,
        electoral finance reform, transparency and audit mechanisms, and
        stricter implementation of anti-corruption laws so as to reduce the
        incentive to raise money and abuse power.

      REGULATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND INNER PARTY
                       DEMOCRACY

3.1           Democratic theory can be thought of to include accounts of both
procedural and substantive democracy. Procedural democracy can be said to
refer to the practice of universal adult franchise, periodic elections, secret
ballot, while substantive democracy can be said to refer to the internal
democratic functioning of the parties, which purportedly represent the people.
This section deals with the internal democratic functioning of parties, and the
question of how parties should function and regulate themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_434">3.2          The NCRWC in its Report on Electoral Processes and Political
Parties appropriately recognised that "no electoral reforms can be effective
without reforms in the political party system" and it recognised the following
areas of immediate concern here:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">          1. "Structural and organisational reforms - party organisations -
             National, State and local levels - inner party democracy - regular
             party elections, recruitment of party cadres, socialization,
             development and training, research, thinking and policy planning
             activities of the party.</blockquote>
<p id="p_435">          2. Party system and governance - Mechanisms to make parties viable
             instruments of good governance
</p><p id="p_436">          3. Institutionalization of political parties - need for a comprehensive
             legislation to regulate party activities, criteria for registration as a
             national or State party - de-recognition of parties".133

3.3           Of primary relevance in this chapter, is the first concern
regarding the regulation of the practice of political parties in terms of internal
elections, recruitment of party cadres, and development and training activities.
At the very outset, it is important to note the distinction between the regulation
of party practice and party ideology as components of internal and inner party
democracy. The section begins with reviewing the history of various
committee reports.
</p>
<p id="p_437">A. History of Reform Proposals

3.4           The 1999 Law Commission Report strongly recommended the
introduction of a regulatory framework governing the internal structures and
inner democracy of parties, financial transparency, and accountability before
attempting state funding of elections. The 170th Report recommended the
insertion of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_291">Sections 11A</a>-I in the RPA dealing with the "Organisation of

133   NCRWC Report, supra note 13.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                                                                  69</span>
<p id="p_438"> Political Parties and matters incidental thereto" on the premise that a political
party "cannot be a dictatorship internally, and democratic in its functioning
outside."134

3.5       Apart from the concerns articulated earlier, the NCRWC
recommended:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">          "The rules and by-laws of the parties seeking registration should
          include provisions for: (a) A declaration of adherence to democratic
          values and norms of the Constitution in their inner party
          organisations,"135

3.6           The ARC's 2008 Ethics and Governance report also alluded to
the importance of inner party democracy when it noted that corruption is
caused by over-centralisation since "the more remotely power is exercised
from the people, the greater is the distance between authority and
accountability."136

3.7           In 2011, a draft Political Parties (Registration and Regulation of
Affairs, etc.) Act, 2011 was prepared under the guidance of Justice
Venkatachalaih and submitted to the Law Ministry. <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_292">Section 6</a> of the draft Act
envisaged the creation of an Executive Committees for every political party,
whose members would be elected by members of the local committees of the
State units of the party, and who themselves would elect the office-bearers of
the party from amongst themselves (without accepting any nominations). The
Executive Committee was also empowered to elect candidates for contesting
Parliamentary and State, having due regard to the recommendations made by
the State and District units of the constituency. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_293">The Act</a> further provided for all
decisions of the Executive and local committees to be taken on the basis of a
simple majority vote with secret ballots.137

3.8           Thus, a perusal of the above reports makes clear that internal
democracy includes provisions governing internal elections, candidate
selection, secret ballots, and registration and deregistration of parties.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_439">B. Laws Regulating Internal Democracy

3.9           Currently, there is no express provision for internal democratic
regulation of political parties in India and the only governing law is provided by
Section 29A of the RP Act, which provides for registration of political parties

specific provision "that the association or body shall bear true faith and

Registration of Political Parties under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_295">Section 29A</a>", states that the party
application should be accompanied, inter alia, by the following
documents/information:

       "(i) Party Constitution drawn on following lines:
<p id="p_444">       Article IV: Organs of the Party (Organizational Structure): Powers and
       Functions of each of these organs (Decision making power should
       reflect democratic spirit - no veto power)
       Method of appointment (and terms) of members to each of these
       organs (Not more than 1/3rd members can be nominated; Tenure
       should be fixed not exceeding 5 years; Periodic elections within 5 years
       maximum)

       Article V: Office-bearers of the Party: Powers and functions of each of
       these office-bearers (Decision making power should reflect democratic
       spirit - no veto power)
       Method of appointment (and terms) of each of these office-bearers
       (Should be elected; Not more than 1/3rd can be nominated; Fixed
       tenure not exceeding 5 years for everyone; Periodic elections within 5
       years maximum)

</p><p id="p_445">       (v) There should be a specific provision in the rules/Constitution of the
       party regarding internal democracy in the party, organisational
       elections at different levels, mode of such elections and the periodicity
       of such elections, term of office of the office-bearers and powers and
       duties of the office-bearers of the party, and the various representative
       bodies of the party (such as Executive Committee, Council etc.)

       (xxi) The applicant party must ensure in its constitution itself vide a
       specific clause in the party constitution that party will hold periodic
       (Period to be specified in constitution but at least once in 4 years) and
       regular election to all positions of office-bearers and organs of the
       party." [Emphasis supplied]138

3.11           Unfortunately, the aforesaid guidelines are silent on candidate
selection, apply only to the registration of new parties, and do not regulate the
internal functioning of already registered parties. Moreover, the ECI's power to

<p id="p_446"> require parties to hold regular internal elections for office bearers, and
candidate selection is compromised in the absence of any penal provisions.
The Supreme Court in Indian National Congress (I) v Institute of Social
Welfare 139 made it clear that neither Section 29A of the RP Act, nor the
provisions of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order,
1968 empowered the ECI to de-register parties on the grounds of violating the
Constitution or breaching the undertaking given to it at the time of registration.
</p>
<p id="p_447">3.12            Consequently, there is no mechanism to review a party's
practice against the principles enshrined in the Constitution or against the
requirements of the ECI's Guidelines and Application Format for the
Registration of Political Parties under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_297">Section 29A</a>. A party can only be de-
registered if its registration was obtained by fraud; if it is declared illegal by the
Central Government; or if a party amends its internal Constitution and notified
the ECI that it can no longer abide by the Indian Constitution.140 Moreover,
there is no power of de-registration if parties having registered under section
29A of the RPA continue to avail of tax benefits under <a href="/doc/1554173/" id="a_298">section 13A</a> of the IT
Act, without contesting elections. The RPA thus needs to be amended to
empower the ECI to act.
</p>
<p id="p_448">3.13           Even otherwise, these situations only deal with cases of de-
registration, and not disbarment of any party from contesting elections. It is
clear that any party can contest elections, even if their Constitution
contravenes the provisions and ideals of the Constitution or does not provide
for internal elections. The need for reform is thus evident, and it is useful at
this stage to briefly examine the law and practice in countries in Western
Europe, which have tried to regulate practice and/or ideology.

put to action. This power to declare parties unconstitutional has been
exercised twice by the Constitutional court to ban the neo-Nazi Socialist
Imperial Party (SRP) in 1952 and the German Communist Party (KPD) in
1956. In the SRP decision, the Court rejected the parties' defence that its
proposed form of government was compatible with liberal democratic order,
noting that there was not even passive assent to democratic principles.
Further, the finding of unconstitutionality implied that sitting party members
would lose their seat as:

<blockquote id="blockquote_59">       "[W]hen by a judgment of the Constitutional Court a political party's
       ideas are found to fall short of the prerequisites for participation in the
       formation of the popular political will, the mere dissolution of the party's
       organizational apparatus, which was meant to further these goals,
       cannot truly implement the court's judgment. Rather, it is the intent of
       the Court's sentence to exclude the ideas themselves from the process
       of the formation of the political will." [Emphasis supplied]142

3.14.4         In the KPD decision, the party defended its constitutionality by
arguing that <a href="/doc/314102/" id="a_302">Article 21(2)</a> was unconstitutional for violating free speech and
association recognised in the Basic Law and that the party's ideology could
not be properly subject to a court's review. However, the Constitutional Court
reiterated its reasoning from the SRP decision, that it could constitutionally
deny the advancement of an idea that violate the principle of individual dignity,
even if such an idea had popular support. It stated:

             constitutionally guaranteed." 143

3.14.5        Thus, there appears to be pervasive state control on the internal
regulation of political parties, for fear that the parties could "turn the 'popular
will' away from inviolable constitutional values". 144 However, the same has
been exercised infrequently (only in two cases), although there are current

<p id="p_467">D. Recommendations

3.17.1        Introducing internal democracy and transparency within political
parties is important to promote financial and electoral accountability, reduce
corruption, and improve democratic functioning of the country as a whole. As
the Law Commission in its 170th report recognised, "whether by design or by
omission, our Constitution does not provide for the constitution and working of
the political parties, though they are at the heart of a parliamentary
democracy."
</p>
<p id="p_468">3.17.2         While the RP Act does not permit the regulation of the
functioning or ideology of the parties, the ECI's Guidelines and Application
Format for the Registration of Political Parties under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_314">Section 29A</a> only
prescribe provisions for internal accountability and not candidate selection.
Even so, these provisions do not expressly apply to existing parties, are not
backed by penal provisions, and cannot bar parties from contesting elections.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court in Indian National Congress (I) v Institute of
Social Welfare has made it clear that the ECI currently lacks the power to de-
register a party under Section 29A of the RP Act. Thus any changes need to
be introduced legislatively. The power of de-registration should also extend to
cases where registered parties avail the benefits of income tax exemption
under <a href="/doc/1554173/" id="a_315">section 13A</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_316">IT Act</a>, but have not contested any Parliamentary or State
elections in ten years consecutive years.
</p>
<p id="p_469">3.17.3          Although it is open for India to follow Germany/Portugal or
Spain's example, it is recommended that any powers to the ECI should
extend to the regulation of action and not ideology, given the complex socio-
religious-political fabric of the country, its diversity, and secular principles. The

      the draft Political Parties (Registration and Regulation of Affairs) Act to
      require parties to insert a specific provision in their memorandum to
      "shun violence for political gains, and avoid discrimination or distinction
      based on race, caste, creed, language or place of residence". Thus,
      the amended <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_317">section 29A(5)</a> reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_473">      "29A.--(5) The application under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied

        FROM FIRST PAST THE POST TO PROPORTIONAL
                     REPRESENTATION

       A. The Current System and Its Alternatives
4.1             While multiple electoral systems exist across the world,
traditionally, the debate has centred around the merits of the 'first-past-the-
</blockquote><p id="p_488">post-system' (hereinafter "FPTP") vis-à-vis variants of the proportional
representation system.149

4.2           The FPTP system, followed in Lok Sabha elections, is regarded
as one of the simplest forms of electoral systems, where each voter has a
single vote, and where a candidate wins if he receives the highest number of
votes in a constituency.150

4.3           The system of proportional representation has many variants,
one of the most common being the list system. In the list system, political
parties present lists of candidates in advance, who are awarded seats in
proportion to their party's vote share, usually with some minimum prescribed
thresholds.
</p>
<p id="p_489">4.4            Another variant, the method of the single transferable vote, is
followed for elections to the Rajya Sabha. In this system, the electoral college,
comprising of MPs and MLAs, rank candidates in order of preference. Their
vote is allotted to their first preference, and if no one emerges with a majority,
the least voted candidate is removed from consideration and the second
choices of those who voted for him are taken into consideration. This process
continues till a winner with a majority emerges.151

4.5           During the drafting of the Constitution, various systems of
proportional representation were considered, but the FPTP system was
eventually adopted to avoid fragmented legislatures and to facilitate the
formation of stable governments.152 In the years since, certain criticisms have
consistently arisen regarding the working of the FPTP system, which has led
to a re-evaluation of the merits of the proportional representation system. This

<p id="p_492"> section will look at the arguments advanced for and against the alteration of
the electoral system in India.</p><pre id="pre_11">

         B. The Merits and Demerits of the FPTP System
 (i)     Simplicity
4.6.1         The most significant advantage of the FPTP system is its
</pre><p id="p_493">uncomplicated nature. The FPTP is the simplest form of the plurality/majority
system, using single-member districts and candidate-centred voting. 153
Moreover, the FPTP system allows voters to choose between people as well
as parties, with voters having the opportunity to assess the performance of a
candidate rather than having to accept a list of candidates presented by a
party, as under the list system.154

4.6.2        This system, however, is thought to result in an increase in
election expenditure, since every candidate is required to reach out to the
electors on an individual as well as a party basis.155

</p><p id="p_494"> (ii)      Stability

4.7.1         The FPTP system has been the hallmark of stability in the
electoral system of India. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_322">RC Poudyal v. Union of
India</a> 156 had categorised the FPTP system as possessing 'the merit of
preponderance of decisiveness over representativeness'. The FPTP system
presents the advantage of producing a majority government at a general
election by being decisive, simple and familiar to the electorate. 157 This, at
least in theory, assures stable terms for the party in power, with the requisite
numbers in the House to ensure implementation of its policies. This also
means better accountability for decision-making in the Parliament, since this
system makes it easier for voters to identify whom to vote or not vote for in

<p id="p_499"> is commonly a discrepancy in the vote share and seat share in results, where
votes given to smaller parties are 'wasted' since they do not gain a voice in
the legislature. What this often translates into is that the FPTP system, which
boasts of the fact that it provides a majoritarian (and hence more democratic)
government, is itself not able to adequately uphold majoritarianism in a multi-
party system, since the winning candidate wins only about 20-30% of the
votes.159

4.8.2         Examples abound from Lok Sabha and State Assembly
elections, where parties enjoying significant vote shares have failed to
translate the same into seats.160 For example, the Indian National Congress
won only about 49.10% of the total vote share in the 1984 General Elections
to the Lok Sabha, but had a sweeping majority of 405 out of 515 seats in the
House. In the elections to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1996, the
AIADMK polled 21.47% votes, but could secure only four (1.71%) seats in the
Assembly.161

4.8.3         Smaller parties, when they have a broad base across
constituencies, rather than a concentrated following in a few constituencies,
may fail to win even a single seat even if their vote share is significant.
</p>
<p id="p_500">4.8.4          This also means that slight changes in the vote share cause
dramatic changes in the number of parliamentary seats won, causing the
Indian electorate to be characterised as one that decisively swings in one
direction or the other.
</p>
<p id="p_501">4.8.5          On the other hand, while representativeness of political parties
is not ensured in the FPTP system, it does encourage political parties
themselves to have more broad-based participation. Moreover, it ensures that
there is a link between a constituency and its representative in the legislature,
and incentivises representatives to serve their constituents well. Further,
smaller districts are more likely to comprise of common interests, and the
small size also facilitates better delineation of these regional interests through
increased movements at the grass-root level, which ensure that
representatives interact more closely with the constituents, at least in
theory. 162 This might, however, not hold true for districts with large

         C. Merits and Demerits of Proportional Representation
</p><p id="p_504"> (i)     Simplicity

4.9    Proportional representation undoubtedly falls second in competition
with the FPTP system in terms of simplicity in voting, but it scores higher in
terms of convenience during campaign. Candidates can simply focus pointed
attention on defined groups to appeal to, and consequently, the problems of
campaign financing do not feature as prominently in the process.165

</p><p id="p_505"> (ii)    Stability
4.10         Because parties are granted seats in accordance with their vote
share, numerous parties get seats in the legislature in the proportional
representation system, without any party gaining a majority. This detracts
from the stability of the system. Coalition government becomes inevitable,
with challenges to such governments also becoming frequent. This is also
why the Constituent Assembly decided that proportional representation would
not be suited to the Parliamentary form of government that our Constitution
lays down. In the Constituent Assembly Debate on 4th January 1949, Dr. BR
Ambedkar noted that:166
      "Proportional representation is not suited to the form of
      government which this Constitution lays down....in the House
      where there is a Parliamentary system of government, you must
      necessarily have a party which is in majority and which is prepared
      to support the government. One of the disadvantages of
      proportional representation is the fragmentation of the legislature
      into a number of small groups. Proportional representation would
      not permit a stable government to remain in office, because
      Parliament would be so divided into so many small groups that
      every time anything happened which displeased certain groups in
      Parliament, they would, on that occasion, withdraw their support
      from the Government, with the result that the Government losing
      the support of certain groups and units, would fall to pieces. Our
      future government must do one thing, namely, it must maintain a
      stable government and maintain law and order."

<p id="p_508"> Challenges of this sort are likely to become even more prominent in
cases of legislative actions that require more than a mere simple
majority to be carried out, such as constitutional amendments.167

</p><p id="p_509"> (iii) Representativeness
4.11.1        Proportional representation, as the name suggests, tries to
ensure that the election results are as proportional as possible, by curbing the
inconsistency between the share of seats and votes. It ensures that smaller
parties get representation in the legislature, particularly when they have a
broad base across constituencies. It also encourages new parties to emerge
and more women and minorities to contest for political power.168
4.11.2         Proportional representation, particularly the single transferable
vote variant of it, also ensures that voters do not feel encumbered by tactical
voting strategies in the worry that their vote might go 'waste'. In that sense,
proportional representation ensures honesty in the election process both from
the side of the candidate, who can choose their ideological commitments
freely, and from that of the voter, who can vote freely.169
4.11.3         One potential drawback of this system is that the relationship
between a voter and the candidate may dilute, for the candidate may now be
seen as representing the party and not the constituency. The other way of
looking at this is that a constituent could approach any representative of their
choice in case of a grievance, which plays out as an advantage of this
system.170
4.11.4       Detractors of the list system of proportional representation point
out, however, that while the method ensures that more political parties are
represented, it concentrates power within a political party, in the hands of the
leaders who decide on the list of candidates.
</p>

<p id="p_510">       D. The List System in Germany
4.12          After the Second World War, Germany adopted a new electoral
system, which has been characterised as a 'personalised proportional
system'. In this, the German parliament (Bundestag) has a minimum of 598
seats. Each voter has two votes, the first being given to a particular candidate
in one of the 299 single-member constituencies. The second vote is a party
vote, given to a party list at the federal state level. Candidates are allowed to
compete in single-member districts as well as simultaneously for the party list.

<p id="p_514"> districts are elected directly. The second vote determines how many
representatives will be sent from each party to the Bundestag, in proportion to
the share of votes.171
4.14           Only parties obtaining more than 5% of the votes at the national
level or, alternatively, having three members elected directly in the single-
member constituencies, are considered in the national allocation of list
proportional representation seats.172
4.15          This ensures both a close relationship between voters and their
representatives through the direct election route, while ensuring
representation of smaller parties. The hybrid model also helps ensure stability,
even in a coalition government.173 While Germany enjoys a stable model of
proportional representation, other countries following the system, such as Italy
have experienced turbulent and unstable coalition governments with frequent
dissolutions of its Parliament resulting in more than 28 governments in the
past four decades.174


        E. Recommendations of Past Reports

</p><p id="p_515">(i)     Report of the ECI on the fifth General Elections in India (1971-72)
4.16           The 1972 Report of the Election Commission also considered
the merits of the proportional representation system, particularly by taking a
look at how it operates in other countries. It took note of the fact that few
populous countries have adopted a pure version of the proportional
representation system - at best, a hybrid version of FPTP and proportional
representation was followed, such as in Germany. It listed the many
disadvantages of the proportional representation system - that it led to a
multiplicity of political parties, increase in the power of the bureaucracy and
the party leaders, and its complexity. It therefore came to the conclusion that
neither the list system nor any other version of proportional representation
was suitable for India.

</p><p id="p_519"> (ii)       Chief Election Commissioner Shakdher's proposal
4.17           In 1977, however, the proposal to introduce the proportional
representation system to Lok Sabha elections in some form was reconsidered
by then Chief Election Commissioner SL Shakdher who suggested that a
hybrid system be adopted, whereby half the seats in the Lok Sabha would be
filled by direct elections under the FPTP system, while the other half be filled
by political parties in proportion to their vote share.175 This proposal did not
outline the method of determination of seats which would not be represented
through direct elections, and how the disparity between the two types of seats
would be addressed.
</p>

<pre id="pre_13">(iii)      170th Report of the Law Commission
4.18.1      This issue was next discussed at length in the Law
</pre><p id="p_520">Commission's 170th Report on the Reform of Electoral Laws (May 1999). It
considered the list system of proportional representation, as prevalent in
Germany, as a possible alternative to the FPTP system. The conclusion that it
reached was that while the FPTP system could not be abandoned outright, it
could be combined with a proportional representation system.
4.18.2         Specifically, the 170th Report recommended that while the
existing 543 seats of the Lok Sabha continue to be filled through direct
elections, the number of seats in the Lok Sabha be increased by an additional
25%, or 136 seats, which are filled by proportional representation following
the list system. A similar expansion should take place in the State Assemblies
as well. This was essentially a modification of the Shakhder proposal.
4.18.3         However, if no minimum thresholds are prescribed to filter the
parties that can nominate members to the list (under the list system),
numerous small parties and fringe groups would eventually gain entry into the
Parliament. To address concerns regarding the proliferation of political
parties, the 170th Report additionally recommended that a new provision
should be made in the RPA to the effect that any political party which obtains
less than 5% of the total valid votes cast in the country (in the case of
Parliament) and in the concerned State (in the case of a Legislative
Assembly) shall not be allowed any representation in the Lok Sabha or in the
concerned Legislative Assembly, as the case may be, either through the
direct election or the proportional representation system. This means that
even if a candidate wins a seat from that political party, that candidate will not
be entitled to that seat. Thresholds such as these are commonly prescribed in
countries following the hybrid FPTP and proportional representation system,
such as Germany. However, the 170th Report does not detail the
consequences of this rule - whether it would necessitate re-election or

<p id="p_521"> whether such seats would be automatically redistributed to parties with more
than 5% vote share.
</p><p id="p_522">4.18.4        Further, while the provision seems well intentioned, the
imposition of a quota can have the effect of creating more problems than it
would solve. If a 5% quota is prescribed, only a few parties would fulfil the
criteria, undoing the purpose of introducing the proportional representation
system. Imposition of such a quota would result in the list system falling in
favour of the larger national parties. The voting patterns in India have been
such that the larger national parties receive a substantial proportion of the
votes (especially during the Lok Sabha elections). Hence, it would be
relatively easier for them to cross the 5% mark while the same may not be
true for the smaller/regional political parties.
</p><p id="p_523">4.18.5         This is evident from an analysis of the results of the 2009 Lok
Sabha elections. Only the four major national parties, viz., the Indian National
Congress (INC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Bahujan Samaj Party
(BSP) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), would have crossed
the quota of 5%. This became even more pronounced in the 2014 Lok Sabha
elections, where only the BJP and the INC crossed the 5% mark, at 31% and
19.3% respectively, with the third being the BSP at 4.1%.176 Hence, it is not
sufficient to argue that the list system would ensure representation from
regional parties by ensuring their presence in Parliament till the specifics of
the list system are clarified.
</p><p id="p_524">4.18.6        To tackle this, state-wise quotas can be imposed but that would
complicate the system to a large extent. This raises questions of the viability
of introducing an inherently complicated system in place of the FPTP system
which, despite its many criticisms, is currently a fairly stable process. Hence,
simply a list system envisaging the imposition of arbitrary quotas cannot be
adopted for the entire strength of the Parliament/Assembly. This needs to be
done in parallel to the existing FPTP system.
</p><p id="p_525">        F. Recommendations
4.19.1         As the discussion above has demonstrated, both electoral
systems come with their own merits and demerits - proportional
representation theoretically being more representative, while the FPTP
system being more stable. It is also clear, from the experience of other
countries that any changes in India's electoral system will have to follow a
hybrid pattern combining elements of both direct and indirect elections. This,
in turn will necessitate an increase in the number of seats in the Lok Sabha,
which raises concerns regarding its effective functioning.

                       ANTI DEFECTION LAW IN INDIA

A.      Introduction

5.1             Originally, the Constitution of India carried no reference to
</pre><p id="p_527">political parties and their existence. However, the existence of political parties
is explicit in the nature of the democratic form of Government that our country
has adopted.177 India is now a federalised multi-party system.
</p>
<p id="p_528">5.2            The emergence of a large number of political parties within the
Indian electoral landscape was accompanied by increasing defections. In fact,
nearly 438 defections occurred within the period between March 1967 and
February 1968.178 The malaise of defection resulted in an increase in political
corruption and instability of governments. Principally, frequent defections
made a mockery of the party system and made the electoral system
vulnerable to frequent and unnecessary elections which inevitably would cost
a significant amount to the exchequer. Defections revealed the inner state of
party politics which was fraught with division, fragmentation and
factionalism.179

5.3           The increase in the number of defecting legislators between
1967 and 1969 necessitated the framing of an adequate anti-defection law.
The mid-sixties witnessed numerous instances of elected representatives
leaving the parties on whose ticket they were elected, to join the opposition
parties. Hence, the need for an anti-defection law became increasingly urgent.
The Committee on Defections, under the Chairmanship of then Home
Minister, Mr. YB Chavan submitted its report in January 1969 where it noted
that there were multiple acts of defections by the same person(s) and also,
indifference on the part of defectors to political proprieties, constituency
preference and public opinion.180 Even though the Committee could not reach
an agreed conclusion in the matter of disqualifying a defector from continuing
to be a Member of Parliament/State Legislature, legislative proposals to usher
in an anti-defection law soon followed. Based on the recommendations of the
Committee, the Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Bill, 1973 and the
Constitution (Forty-eighth Amendment) Bill, 1979 were introduced in the Lok
Sabha. These legislative attempts towards framing an anti-defection law

<p id="p_530"> contemplated an amendment to the Constitution with a view to disqualifying a
defector from his continued membership of the legislature.181 However, while
the former Bill lapsed due to dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the latter was
opposed at the stage of introduction itself and was withdrawn by the leave of
the House.
</p>
<p id="p_531">5.4             Finally, after the general elections in December 1984, the
Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha
in January 1985. The object of this anti-defection law was to curb the evil of
political defections motivated by the lure of office or other similar
considerations that endanger the foundations of our democracy. 182 Pursuant
to this ideal, the amendment inserted the Tenth Schedule into the Constitution
in order to curb the evil of political defections. The 52nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_324">Amendment Act</a>, 1985
also amended Articles 101, 102, 190 and 191 of the Constitution regarding
vacation of seats and disqualification from membership of Parliament and the
State Legislatures.
</p>
<p id="p_532">5.5             The purpose of the Tenth Schedule is to prevent the breach of
faith of the electorate. Where a constituency returns a candidate to the
Legislature, it does so on considerations based on the ideologies of the
political party he represents and it is only logical that where the candidate,
after being elected, leaves that party or acts contrary to its policies, he should
be recalled for betrayal of the faith of the electorate. 183 Essentially, the
provisions in the Tenth Schedule give recognition to the role of political parties
in the political process.184

5.6            Paragraph 2(1) of the Tenth Schedule provides that a member
of Parliament or State Legislature belonging to any political party shall be
disqualified for continuing as such member, if he:

<pre id="pre_15">B.      Exceptions to the Law on Defection

5.8           Mere insertion of the Tenth Schedule did not mark an end to the
</pre><p id="p_537">problems arising out of defection. One of the primary reasons for the
ineffectiveness of the Tenth Schedule was the provision on 'split'. The 170 th
Report of the Law Commission made the following observation about the
Tenth Schedule:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">        "The experience of the country with the Tenth Schedule since its
        introduction has not been happy. It has led to innumerable abuses and
        undesirable practices. While the idea of disqualifications on the basis of
        defection was a right one, the provision relating to 'split' has been
        abused beyond recall."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_538">5.9            Paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule originally contained an
exception for disqualification on the ground of defection of members in the
case of split in the party to which they belonged, provided their strength was
not less than one-third of the members of their legislature party in the House.
The intention behind inserting this provision in the Tenth Schedule was the
need to provide for such floor-crossing on the basis of honest dissent. 185
However, it was noticed that splits were being engineered for the purpose of
Paragraph 3 by indulging in the kind of practices which the Tenth Schedule
sought to prevent. The Tenth Schedule was criticised for effectively allowing
bulk defections while declaring individual defections as illegal.186

5.10           The Supreme Court tried to impose strict standards for proving a
split for the purpose of Paragraph 3 by saying that mere making of a claim
would be insufficient, prima facie proof of a split in a political party is
necessary to be produced before the Speaker.187 The case of <a href="/doc/1611925/" id="a_327">Jagjit Singh v.
State of Haryana188</a> was one such instance where the Supreme Court found
that no split had occurred in the Haryana unit of the Republican Party of India

<p id="p_541"> but the claim of split was only made as an afterthought to escape defection
under Paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_542">5.11          The most scathing indictment of the anti-defection law came
across during the open hearings conducted by former Speaker Mr. Shivraj
Patil in his decision delivered on June 1, 1993 in the case of a split in the
Janata Dal. The Speaker criticised the Tenth Schedule for having been
drafted in haste, because of which it is defective and full of lacunae.189 The
Speaker also noted that splits were basically unprincipled defections which
were allowed to go unchecked, and which would cause the entire electoral
system to lose its legitimacy and become dysfunctional.190

5.12          Against this background, the Goswami Committee Report in
May 1990, the 170th Report of the Law Commission in May 1999 as well as
the NCRWC in April 2002 recommended omission of Paragraph 3 of the
Tenth Schedule.191 The need to strengthen the law in this regard led to the
Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003, which omitted Paragraph 3
altogether from the Tenth Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_543">5.13        Pursuant to this Amendment, the Fourth Report of the Second
ARC on Ethics in Governance noted that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_83">       "The 91st Amendment to the Constitution was enacted in 2003 to
       tighten the anti-defection provisions of the Tenth Schedule, enacted
       earlier in 1985. The Amendment makes it mandatory for all those
       switching political sides - whether singly or in groups - to resign their
       legislative membership. They now have to seek re-election if they
       defect and cannot continue in office by engineering a 'split' of one-third
       of members, or in the guise of a 'continuing split of a party'."

under Paragraph 4 of the Tenth Schedule. A party shall be deemed to have
merged with another party if not less than two-thirds of the members of the
legislature party concerned have agreed to such merger. If such merger takes
place, those who do not agree to such merger and opt to function as a
separate group in the House are also saved from disqualification, irrespective
of their numerical strength.
</p>
<p id="p_549">5.16          The 170th Report of the Law Commission had recommended
deletion of Paragraph 4 as well (along with Paragraph 3) in the 'interest of
maintenance of proper political standards in the House and also to minimise
the complications arising on that account.'193 However, the 91st Amendment
(or any other) did not delete the provision on merger and it continues as an
exception to the law on disqualification upon defection.
</p>
<p id="p_550">5.17          As opposed to instances of split, various mergers of political
parties have been legitimately recognised by the Speakers in recent years.194
The requirement that two-thirds of the members of the legislature party need
to consent to a merger for it to be considered legitimate is a sufficient
safeguard which has prevented the misuse of Paragraph 4. Hence, in the
present Report, the Law Commission does not make any recommendation
with regard to amendments to Paragraph 4.

<p id="p_551">C.      Procedure under Paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule

</p><p id="p_552">i)      The role of the Speaker in deciding petitions under the Tenth
        Schedule

5.18.1         It is necessary that the decisions taken by the deciding authority
under the Tenth Schedule are viewed as impartial and untainted by political
considerations. Currently, under Paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule, any
question as to whether a member of a House has become subject to
disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is referred to the Chairman/Speaker
of the House. While the decision of the Chairman/Speaker can be judicially
reviewed on various grounds, the presence of Paragraph 6 has generated
widespread controversy.
</p>
<p id="p_553">5.18.2         <a href="/doc/542383/" id="a_331">In Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu</a>, 195 the constitutionality of the
Tenth Schedule was challenged on the ground that the investiture of
adjudicatory functions in the Chairman/Speakers creates the apprehension of
political bias. It was contended that an independent, fair and impartial

<p id="p_555"> machinery for resolution of electoral disputes is an essential and important
aspect of democracy and that the same would be vitiated by vesting the
adjudicatory function in the Speaker. In response to this contention, the
Supreme Court held that the Chairman/Speakers hold a pivotal position in the
scheme of Parliamentary democracy and it would be inappropriate to express
distrust in the high office of the Speaker, merely because some of the
Speakers are alleged to have discharged their functions in a manner not
befitting the great traditions of their high office. Hence, immense confidence
was invested in the high position that the Speaker enjoys within the
constitutional scheme. Regardless of this, Courts have imposed safeguards to
ensure that the Speaker/Chairman does not act in an arbitrary manner. As a
necessary safeguard, the decision of the Speaker is subject to review on the
grounds of mala fides, non-compliance with the rules of natural justice and
perversity, among others.
</p>
<p id="p_556">5.18.3         However, due regard should be had to the minority view
expressed in Kihota Hollohan. The minority held that the Speaker being
dependent on continuous support of the majority in the House, he does not
satisfy the requirement of an independent adjudicating authority and his
choice as the sole arbitrator in the matter violates an essential attribute of the
basic feature. 196 Not surprisingly, decisions of Speakers with regard to
disqualification on the ground of defection have been challenged in various
instances for being biased and partial. For instance, in <a href="/doc/1801522/" id="a_332">Mayawati v.
Markandeya Chand and Ors</a>, 197 the Speaker's decision was challenged as
being perverse because the Speaker unduly delayed the proceedings under
the disqualification petition. While the Court refused to set aside the order of
the Speaker in this case, legal challenges like these erode the confidence
posed in the office of the Speaker. <a href="/doc/862234/" id="a_333">In D. Sudhakar v. DN Jeevaraju and
Ors</a>.198, the impugned order of the Speaker was held to be vitiated by mala
fides because the disqualification petition was decided by him in haste and
revealed a partisan attitude in his approach. The Court observed that the
Speaker's decision is subject to judicial review under Articles 32, 226 and 136
as the Speaker discharges quasi-judicial functions when acting under
Paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_557">5.18.4       The Supreme Court in Balchandra L. Jarkiholi and Ors. v. BS

Yeddyurappa also affirmed that the Speaker functions in a quasi-judicial
capacity, which makes orders passed by him subject to judicial review. In this
case, the Speaker was held to have not taken into consideration rules of
evidence while acting on the disqualification petition, and to have acted in

<p id="p_560"> haste and in violation of the principles of natural justice. The Court said that
the Speaker acted in 'hot haste' while disposing off the disqualification
petition, even though there was no conceivable reason for the Speaker to
have taken up the matter in such hurry.
</p>
<p id="p_561">5.18.5         These instances show that even though Paragraph 6 gives
finality to the Chairman/Speaker's decision, there is ample scope for his
decision to be reviewed. The decision of the Speaker is not immune from
challenge before the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution.200

</p><p id="p_562">ii)    History of reform proposals

5.19.1        Without disregard to the high office of the Speaker,
apprehensions regarding the partisan nature of the Speakers' decisions have
been a cause for concern. Former Speaker Mr. Shivraj Patil himself in his
decision of June 1, 1993 (referred above) duly noted:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_85">       "Since Speakers in India are, after all, party members, they should not
       be burdened with the job of pronouncing on the membership of their
       fellow members. Whatever they decide, motives would be imputed to
       them."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_563">5.19.2        It would be unrealistic to expect a Speaker to completely abjure
all party considerations while deciding on matters under the Tenth
Schedule.201 The Dinesh Goswami Committee Report recommended that the
anti-defection law should be changed insofar as

       "the power of deciding the legal issue of disqualification should not be
       left to the Speaker or Chairman of the House, but to the President or
       the Governor, as the case maybe who shall act on the advice of the
       Election Commission, to whom the question should be referred for
       determination as in the case of any other post-election disqualification
       of a Member."202

5.19.3        The 170th Report of the Law Commission also recommended
that the decision on the question of disqualification on the ground of defection
should be entrusted to the President and the Governor, as the case may be,
who shall render their decision in accordance with the opinion of the Election
Commission. Furthermore, the Election Commission, in its Report on
Proposed Electoral Reforms (2004) also observed:

<blockquote id="blockquote_86">            "All political parties are aware of some of the decisions of the Hon'ble
           Speakers, leading to controversies and further litigations in courts of
           law. The Commission sees substance in the (above) suggestion that
           the legal issues of disqualifications under the Tenth Schedule should
           also be left to the President and the Governors of the States
           concerned, as in the case of all other post-election disqualifications of
           sitting MPs, MLAs and MLCs, under Articles 103 and 192 of the
           Constitution. In the case of disqualifications under the Tenth Schedule
           also, the President or the Governor may act on the opinion given by the
           Election Commission."203

5.19.4         Consequently, the Election Commission proposed that in a
manner similar to other cases of post-election disqualification of sitting MPs,
MLAs, and MLCs under Articles 103 and 192 of the Constitution,
disqualification on the ground of defection should also be left to the President
and Governors of States. The President or the Governor may act on the
opinion furnished by the Election Commission.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_566">5.19.5         The Election Commission recommended that it would give its
opinion to the President/Governor in the matters of post-election
disqualification after giving full opportunity of being heard to the parties
concerned. One of the grounds for the Election Commission to have made
such recommendation was that if decisions are rendered by the
President/Governor, on the opinion of the Commission, it would receive more
respect and acceptability from the common people.204

5.19.6       The Election Commission's recommendation was also endorsed
by the Ethics in Governance Report.205 The NCRWC also recommended that
the power to decide on questions as to disqualification on the ground of
defection should vest in the Election Commission instead of the Chairman or
the Speaker of the House concerned. 206 The NCRWC made this
recommendation for the reason that

           "Some Speakers have tended to act in a partisan manner and without
           proper appreciation - deliberate or otherwise - of the provisions of the
           Tenth Schedule."207

5.19.7        The proposal to vest the power to decide on disqualification
petitions on the ground of defection assume importance for the office of the

          people of outstanding ability and impartiality. Without meaning any
          disrespect for any particular Speaker in the country, but only going by
          some events of the recent past, certain questions have been raised
          about the confidence in the matter of impartiality on some issues
          having political overtones which are decided by the Speaker in his
          capacity as a Tribunal."
</p>
<p id="p_571">5.19.8         This can be understood to mean that if the power to decide
disqualification petitions made under the Tenth Schedule is vested with the
President/Governor, the Speaker's office would be insulated from the reach of
constitutional challenges of the kind put forth in Kihota Hollohan.
</p>

         STRENGTHENING THE OFFICE OF THE ELECTION
                  COMMISSION OF INDIA

      A. Constitutional Protection of all the Members of the ECI

6.1           The ECI is an independent, constitutional body, which has been
vested with the powers of superintendence, direction and control of the
preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all Parliamentary and
State elections and elections to the office of the President and Vice President
vide <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_337">Article 324(1)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_578">6.2            <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_338">Article 324(2)</a> stipulates that the ECI shall comprise of the CEC
and "such number of other Election Commissioners, if any, as the President
may from time to time fix." By an order dated 1st October 1993, the President
has fixed the number of Election Commissioners as two, until further orders.
There is all round consensus, evident from the Goswami Committee's Report
in 1990;209 the ECI's 1998 letter;210 and its 2004 proposed reforms that the
number of Election Commissioners should remain at two to ensure the
"smooth and effective functioning" of the ECI. Their stated rationale is that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_92">        "The three-member body is very effective in dealing with the complex
        situations that arise in the course of superintending, directing and
        controlling the electoral process, and allows for quick responses to
        developments in the field that arise from time to time and require
        immediate solution. Increasing the size of this body beyond the existing
        three-member body would, in the considered opinion of the
        Commission, hamper the expeditious manner in which it has
        necessarily to act for conducting the elections peacefully and in a free
        and fair manner".211

6.3          <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_339">Article 324(5)</a> of the Constitution is intended to ensure the
independence of the ECI and free it from external, political interference and
thus expressly provides that the removal of the CEC from office shall be on
"like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court".
</blockquote><p id="p_579">Nevertheless, a similar impeachment procedure is not prescribed for the other
Election Commissioners under <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_340">Article 324(5</a>), and they are treated on par with
the Regional Commissioners. Instead <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_341">Article 324(5)</a> stipulates that subject to
any Parliamentary law, the office tenure of the Election and Regional
Commissioners shall be determined by the President and that they cannot be
removed except on the CEC's recommendation.

<p id="p_582"> 6.4           The ECI in its 2004 Report expressly opined that the current
wording of <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_342">Article 324(5)</a> was "inadequate" and required an amendment to
bring the removal procedures of Election Commissioners on par with the
CEC, and thus to provide them with the "same protection and safeguard[s]" as
the CEC.212 The proposed amendment by the Background Paper on Electoral
Reforms prepared by the Legislative Department of the Law Ministry in 2010
is along the same lines.
</p>
<p id="p_583">6.5           Equating the removal procedures of the two Election
Commissioners with that of the CEC is also in line with the legislative intent of
the Parliament. In 1991, the Parliament enacted the Chief Election
Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act
whereby the retirement age of the CEC was fixed at 65 years, with a salary
and other perquisites equal to that of a Supreme Court judge; whereas that of
the other Election Commissioners was fixed at 62 years with benefits
equivalent to a High Court judge. However, in 1993, the above Act was
amended and the CEC and other Election Commissioners were placed on par
on matters of retirement age, salaries and other benefits.213 <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_343">Section 10</a> of the
Act also provided for all three members to have an equal say in the decision
making process, with any difference in opinion being resolved "according to
the opinion of the majority."
</p>
<p id="p_584">6.6        Commenting on this Act, the Supreme Court in T.N. Seshan,
CEC v Union of India214 held that the CEC was not superior to the Election
Commissioners stating:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">       "As pointed out earlier, the scheme of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_344">Article 324</a> clearly envisages a
       multi-member body comprising the CEC and the ECs. The RCs may be
       appointed to assist the Commission. If that be so the ECs cannot be
       put on par with the RCs. As already pointed out, ECs form part of the
       Election Commission unlike the RCs. Their role is, therefore, higher
       than that of RCs. If they form part of the Commission it stands to
       reason to hold that they must have a say in decision-making. If the
       CEC is considered to be a superior in the sense that his word is final,
       he would render the ECs non-functional or ornamental. Such an
       intention is difficult to cull out from <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_345">Article 324</a> nor can we attribute it to
       the Constitution-makers. We must reject the argument that the ECs'
       function is only to tender advise to the CEC." [Emphasis supplied]

6.7         It is thus clear that the CEC is at the same position as the other
Election Commissioners and only functions as a first amongst equals.

<p id="p_588"> Moreover, the Election Commissioners are clearly superior to the Regional
Commissioners and <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_346">Article 324(5)</a> should be amended to reflect that. Given
that the removal (impeachment) procedure of the judges of the High Court
and Supreme Court is also the same, the benefit of the CEC's removal
procedures under <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_347">Article 324(5)</a> should also be extended to the other Election

</p>
<p id="p_589">6.8           The Law Commission thus, relying on the Court's observations
in the Seshan's judgment, and for the reasons aforementioned reiterates and
endorses the ECI's proposal to extend the same protection under the
Constitution in the matter of removability from office to the Election
Commissioners as is available to the CEC. Thus, the second proviso in <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_348">Article
324(5)</a> after the words "Chief Election Commissioner", the words "and any
other Election Commissioner" should be added. In the third proviso, the words

<p id="p_591">      B. Appointment of the Election Commissioners and the CEC

</p><p id="p_592"> (i)      Appointment process

6.10.1        The power to appointment the CEC and the Election
Commissioners lies with the President vide <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_350">Article 324(2)</a> of the Constitution,
which states that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_96">          "The Election Commission shall consist of the Chief Election
          Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners, if
          any, as the President may from time to time fix and the appointment of
          the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners
          shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by
          Parliament, be made by the President."
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                                                              101</span>
<p id="p_593"> 6.10.2         Although the issue of appointments was discussed in the
Constituent Assembly and a suggestion was floated to make the
appointments subject to confirmation by a two-thirds majority, in a joint
session of the Parliament, it was rejected.215 Consequently, <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_351">Article 324(2)</a> left
it open for the Parliament to legislate on the issue.
</p>
<p id="p_594">6.10.3       The Goswami Committee in 1990 recommended a change to
the appointment process, suggesting that the CEC should be appointed by
the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of
the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. In turn, the CEC should be additionally
consulted on the question of appointment of the other Election
Commissioners and the entire consultation process should have statutory
backing.216

6.10.4         This was followed by the introduction of the Constitution
(Seventieth Amendment) Bull 1990, which was introduced in the Rajya Sabha
on 30th May 1990 providing that the CEC would be appointed by the President
after consultation with the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the
Lok Sabha, and the Leader of the Opposition (or the leader of the largest
party) in the Lok Sabha. The CEC was further made a part of the consultative
process in the appointment of the Election Commissioners. However, on 13 th
June 1994, the Government moved a motion to withdraw the Bill, which was
finally withdrawn with the leave of the Rajya Sabha on the same day. 217

6.10.5         Consequently, in the absence of any Parliamentary law
governing the appointment issue, the Election Commissioners are appointed
by the government of the day, without pursuing any consultation process. This
practice has been described as requiring the Law Ministry to get the file
approved by the Prime Minister, who then recommends a name to the
President. 218 Thus, there is no concept of collegium and no involvement of
the opposition.
</p>
<p id="p_595">6.10.6        The Commissioners are appointed for a six year period, or up to
the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier. Further, there are no prescribed
qualifications for their appointment, although convention dictates that only
senior (serving or retired) civil servants, of the rank of the Cabinet Secretary
or Secretary to the Government of India or an equivalent rank, will be
appointed. The Supreme Court in Bhagwati Prashad Dixit Ghorewala v Rajiv
Gandhi219 rejected the contention that the CEC should possess qualifications

<p id="p_600"> similar to that of a Supreme Court judge, despite being placed on par with
them in terms of the removal process.
</p>
<p id="p_601"> (ii)   Comparative practices

6.11.1        An examination of comparative practices is instructive. In South
Africa, the Independent Electoral Commission comprises of five members,
including one judge. They are appointed by the President on the
recommendations of the National Assembly, following nominations by a
National Assembly inter-party committee, which receives a list of at least eight
candidates. This list of (at least) eight nominees is recommended by the
Selection Committee, which has four members being, the President of the
Constitutional Court; a representative of the Human Rights Commission and
the Commission on Gender Equality each; and the Public Prosecutor.220

6.11.2      In Ghana too, the seven member Election Commission is
appointed by the President on the advice of the Council of State, with the
Chairman and two Deputy Chairmen having permanent tenure.221

6.11.3       In Canada, the Chief Electoral Officer of "Elections Canada" is
appointed by a House of Commons resolution for a non-renewable ten-year
term, and to protect their independence from the government, he/she reports
directly to Parliament. 222 In the United States, the six Federal Election
Commissioners are appointed by the President with the advise and consent of
the Senate. The Commissioners can be members of a political party, although
not more than three Commissioners can be members of the same party. 223

6.11.4        In all these cases thus, it is clear that the appointment of the
Election Commissioners or the electoral officers is a consultative process
involving the Executive/Legislature/other independent bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_602"> (iii) Recommendations

6.12.1        Given the importance of maintaining the neutrality of the ECI
and to shield the CEC and Election Commissioners from executive
interference, it is imperative that the appointment of Election Commissioners
becomes a consultative process.

<p id="p_605"> 6.12.2         To this end, the Commission adapts the Goswami Committee's
proposal with certain modifications. First, the appointment of all the Election
Commissioners (including the CEC) should be made by the President in
consultation with a three-member collegium or selection committee, consisting
of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha (or the
leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha in terms of numerical
strength) and the Chief Justice of India. The Commission considers the
inclusion of the Prime Minister is important as a representative of the current
government.
</p>
<p id="p_606">6.12.3       Second, the elevation of an Election Commissioner should be
on the basis of seniority, unless the three member collegium/committee, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, finds such Commissioner unfit.
</p>
<p id="p_607">6.12.4       Such amendments are in consonance with the appointment

          opposition of the Government in the House of the People.
</p>
<p id="p_615">      C. Permanent, Independent Secretariat of the ECI

6.13          Currently the ECI has a separate secretariat of its own, with the
service conditions of its officers and staff being regulated by the rules made
by the President under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_358">Article 309</a> of the Constitution, similar to other
departments and ministries of the Government of India in connection with
union matters. Officers at the higher level, such as the level of deputy election
commissioner are normally appointed on a tenure basis on deputation from
the national civil services. Lower level officers are permanent officers in the
ECI's secretariat, from its own ranks.224

6.14            To further strengthen the independence of the secretariat,
consonant with the intention of the framers of the Constitution, the Goswami
Committee in 1990 recommended that the ECI should have an independent
secretariat, along the lines of the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha secretariats
provided in <a href="/doc/816923/" id="a_359">Article 98(2</a>), which permits the Parliament to regulate the
recruitment and service conditions of persons appointed to the secretarial
staff in either House of Parliament.225

6.15        To give effect to the Goswami Committee's recommendation,
the government introduced the Constitution (Seventieth Amendment) Bill,
1990 in the Rajya Sabha on 30th May, 1990. However, the government
subsequently withdrew the Bill in 1993 in view of the changed composition of
the ECI on having become a multi-member body (pursuant to the Election
Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and
Transaction of Business) Act, 1991) and their belief that the Constitution

<p id="p_617"> Amendment Bill needed some amendments to reflect this change.226 The Bill
was never re-introduced.
</p>
<p id="p_618">6.16           The ECI relied on these two developments in 2004 to
recommend the introduction of an independent Secretariat, which would be
"vital" to the ECI's functioning, noting that its independence would be further
strengthened if its Secretariat was insulated from Executive interference on
the issues of appointments, promotions etc., along the lines of the
Secretariats of the Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha, Registries of the Supreme
Court and High Courts, etc.227

6.17         The Background Paper on Electoral Reforms prepared by the
Legislative Department of the Law Ministry in 2010 reiterated these
recommendations.
</p>
<p id="p_619">6.18           It is of paramount importance to ensure that the ECI, entrusted
with the task of conducting elections throughout the country, be "fully
insulated" 228 from political pressure or Executive interference to maintain the
purity of elections, inherent in a democratic process. The ECI, the Goswami
Committee and others are unanimous in their view that the ECI should have a
permanent, independent secretariat to ensure its continued functioning as an
independent, constitutional authority. The government too, has signified its in-
principle approval with the introduction of the Constitution (Seventieth
Amendment) Bill, 1990, which was withdrawn only with a view to re-introduce
a more comprehensive Bill.
</p>
<p id="p_620">Recommendation

6.19         Thus, the Law Commission recommends the insertion of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_360">Article

             PAID NEWS AND POLITICAL ADVERTISING


A. Introduction

7.1          Paid news, both generally and during election campaigns, is a
widespread and pervasive phenomenon today. The scale of the problem is
demonstrated by the fact that, according to the ECI, in the assembly elections
held in the period 2011-2013 alone, there have been 1987 cases where a
notice for paid news has been issued to the candidates and 1727 cases
where the practice of paid news has been confirmed.229

7.2            The phenomena of paid news and its cognate, political
advertising being presented as news, cannot be seen in isolation. They are
integral to the ways in which the news industry, both print and electronic, has
developed over last few decades. There has been a significant shift in the way
media business is carried out. Media is growingly seen as a revenue
generation model by almost all leading media houses. Traditionally, the two
pillars of media, namely advertisements and editorial content, have been
handled separately. The sustenance of any media house was dependent on
the credibility of information circulated through news. Revenue driven news or
editorial content was traditionally seen as damaging credibility of media
houses. Therefore, though revenue generation through advertisements
remained important, it certainly was not the priority of media houses.
However, in recent times, the compulsions of revenue generation to run the
newspapers and other media, have led to the growing importance of
advertisements in the running of media houses.230

7.3            Another important development has been the internal change in
the relation between advertisements and editorial wings of media. Mr. P.
Sainath (former Rural Affairs Editor, The Hindu) suggests that the spread of
the phenomenon of paid news can be attributed to the change in the
employment model of journalists. 231 This new model of employment applied
by several media conglomerates curtailed the collective bargaining position of
journalists. This led to the concentration of power in the management wing of

<p id="p_631"> media houses and significantly curtailed the independence of journalists. 232
Further, it also weakened the editorial wing of the media as journalists were
now controlled by management instead of editors.233 Therefore, the needs of
commercialisation and the requirement of revenue bolstered the
advertisement/management wing of media houses over the editorial wing. 234
With managers becoming more influential in the selection and presentation of
news, the importance of news started getting determined by the revenues that
would be generated.235

7.4            It must also be noted that while - as the above arguments
suggest - paid news is widespread through the Indian media, it is by no
means suggested that every newspaper or media entity is involved in the
dissemination of paid news. In fact, journalists and newspapers have
themselves, at times, strongly criticised the practice of paid news. However it
is a fact that news driven by consideration, or advertisements thinly disguised
in the form of news, have grown exponentially over last few decades in the
arena of electoral politics. This part looks at the issues of paid news and
political advertising specifically in this context. It does not suggest systemic
reforms for media regulation in general, as that issue is being examined
separately by the Law Commission and will form part of a distinct and holistic
report on the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_632">7.5           At a Consultation on Media Law, held by the Law Commission,
which sought responses from media entities, journalists and Law School,
there was a detailed examination of the issues. Respondents included the
Press Council of India, the News Broadcasters Association, the Delhi Union of
Journalists, Times Internet Limited, Mr. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, National
Law School of India University, National University of Juridical Sciences, and
so on. Eleven Respondents out of fifteen suggested making paid news an
offence under the <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_362">Representation of the People Act</a>. There were numerous
suggestions pertaining to defining the offence, the nature of the offence,
standards and burdens of proof, and so on. From the basis of wide
consultations held by the Law Commission, it is clear that there is a general
consensus, among the relevant stakeholders, in regulating the phenomenon
of paid news.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                                                                        110</span>
<p id="p_636"> Sampath, highlighted the problem of paid news. According to him, the
problem had become particularly acute during the 2009 elections, when
several prominent journalists approached the EC about paid news. Mr.
Sampath further noted that the present legal framework did not deem paid
news to be an offence, and that therefore, it was inadequate to deal with the
problem. Consequently, the only option before the EC was to treat paid news
as part of undisclosed expenditures, which it was doing. Naturally, this was a
round-about and unnecessary procedure, and ought to be changed.
</p>
<p id="p_637">7.7          Consequently, this Part is divided into seven section. First, it
looks at the definitional aspects of paid news and political advertisements.
Second, it describes the ways in which the practices of paid news and
disguised political advertising are prevalent in electoral coverage by the print
and electronic media. Third, it analyses the current legal regime regulating
such practices including seminal judicial decisions. Fourth, it considers
recommendations made by previous committees and commissions on the
subject of paid news. Fifth, it highlights the key constitutional issues
surrounding regulation of paid news. Sixth, it describes the way paid news is
being regulated in other jurisdictions. Finally, it suggests legal reform to
gradually weed out the scourge of paid news from the electoral system.
</p>

<p id="p_638">B. Paid News and Political Advertising: Defining The Phenomena

7.8          Political advertising is constituted by activities, which relate to
promoting an electoral candidate or a political party or a policy proposed by a
particular party, in order to appeal to the public. At its core, political
advertising does not exclusively relate to elections, political parties or
candidates. Advertising on other issues, which reflect important societal
debates, such as human rights, environmental issues, welfare schemes etc.,
and is generally in the nature of political propaganda or pursues political ends,
may be construed as political advertising.236

7.9            Legitimate political advertisements indicate the identity of the
sender or the speaker of the communication. This confirms that the
communicated piece is an advertisement. Such speech is not sought to be
constrained excessively since it promotes political ideas and reflects the
ideologies and policy goals of a party, while ensuring that the viewers are
aware that the content is not merely informational but also promotional. Under
the Indian Constitution, speech of this kind is admittedly within the protection
of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_363">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.237

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">                                                                              111</span>
<p id="p_640"> 7.10           On the other hand, there is no categorical legal definition of paid
news. Paid news has been defined by the Sub-committee of the Press
Council of India (hereinafter "PCI report") as "any news or analysis appearing
in any media (Print &amp; Electronic) for a price in cash or kind as consideration."
The definition given by PCI report was also adopted by the 47 th report of
Standing Committee on Information and Technology of the Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting (hereinafter "SCIT report"). The ECI Handbook
distinguishes between paid news and paid content and suggests that the
latter must be unambiguously marked as 'paid advertisement'. Therefore,
political advertisement will be one which is not presented in the garb of news
or editorial content, but is clearly discernible as an advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_641">7.11          Paid News therefore, is a promotional feature in the guise of an
informative and meritorious piece of news. Further, paid news is
communicated as any regular news content which is based on the labour
invested in news finding and the merit of the author/speaker.
</p>
<p id="p_642">7.12           This demarcation between paid news and political advertising is
significant. News reporting is supposed to be objective and neutral. Print and
electronic media controls information dissemination which also affects the
voters' decision. It is very important that the neutrality of the news object is not
distorted by monetary considerations. Therefore, it is crucial that the
distinction between advertisement and news is easily discernible to the
reader. If paid content is presented as news, it harms the election structure at
multiple levels. Apart from the deception of voters, the funds paid by
candidates for paid news also help them hide the expenditure incurred by
them, unlike in advertising, which can be publicly scrutinised.
</p>

<p id="p_643">C. Issues and Problems with Paid News and Political Advertising


7.13           A free and fair election is the cornerstone of any democracy.
While free elections are determined by the absence of intimidation and
coercion, a functioning secret ballot, and an enforceable right of universal
adult suffrage, the concept of a "fair election" - while equally important - is
more difficult to capture. Democracies the world over have recognised that
"fairness" requires, in some sense, a level playing field. This means that the
influence of money in corrupting the electoral process ought to be mitigated.
In India, this is achieved by statutory norms governing election expenditures.
In this context, it is important to note that in recent times, political advertising
has also witnessed the involvement of several Public Relations firms. The
expenses incurred for hiring these firms are likely to go much beyond the
statutory expenditure limits. This makes elections very uneven towards those




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                                                                               112</span>
 who can get extensive funding and can incur the costs of political advertising,
and adversely impacts the fairness of elections.
</p>
<p id="p_644">7.14          Political advertising raises several serious issues with respect to
expenditure limits, truth or falsity of the claims, and the possible defamatory
effects of advertisements. Some of the legal challenges posed by paid news
and political advertising were manifest in the case of <a href="/doc/808119/" id="a_364">Ashok Chavan v.
Madhavrao Kinhalkar238</a> where Ashok Chavan did not include the expenditure
on paid news and advertisement in his election expenses. Due to the absence
of a legal regime regulating these practices, the legitimacy of paid news itself
was not under contention. Instead, the contention was that he did not include
the expenses on paid news in his lodged account of expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_645">7.15         Political advertising serves a very important function of informing
public. However, it increases the role of financial assistance in election
campaigning and also incentivises the candidates to distort their election
expenditure details. Furthermore, the problem is not just with respect to the
information which is expressly shown as advertisement. The nexus between
money and political journalism is manifest not only in the form of expensive
advertisements but also in the form of paid editorial or news content.
</p>
<p id="p_646">7.16           In India, the most visible manifestation of the phenomenon of
paid news in the electoral scene is in the form of several "packages" offered
by the media houses to the candidates. Packages comprise exclusive stories,
front page, negative coverage for opponent etc. Several media organisations
have accepted money from politicians to provide favourable coverage. The
ECI's estimation of the worth of paid news market is Rs. 500 Crore. 239
However, the phenomenon is widespread and takes various forms of
undesirable nexus of candidates and media. In 2014 Lok Sabha Elections
itself, around 700 cases of paid news were detected.240 This section explores
some of the ways in which paid news is being practiced.
</p>
<p id="p_647">7.17          The coverage is sold in the name of a "package" which is
offered in proportion to the money the interested party is willing to pay. 241 On
an average, each candidate hires two employees to write news stories about
him which are printed without editing and sought to be passed off as
independent editorial content. 242 The newspapers exaggerate the winning

<p id="p_650"> chances of the candidates and the support they are getting from the public.
However, there is no credit line to these news items and the font used is often
different from the other news items.243

7.18           Candidates pay huge amounts of money in a 'package' deal for
cooked up favourable information to create a false atmosphere for influencing
electorate. 244 A package generally comprises rate cards for coverage of
specific political activities during the campaign. For example, there are
different rate cards for covering campaign speeches, covering door to door
campaign, showing skewed survey results etc.245 Channels and newspapers
have stated that they were not willing to provide air-time to a candidate's
campaign unless he is willing to pay the amount the channel demands. 246The
phenomenon of paid news not just involves the printing of news, but also
rejecting or delaying coverage. 247 The impact of this is twofold: first, as
discussed above, it affects the fairness of elections by tying a candidate's
prospects to his financial ability to remunerate the media for coverage. And
second, it affects the public's right to know, which is an aspect of their
constitutional right under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_365">Article 19(1)(a).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_651">7.19          The right to know - and, by extension, the right to accurate
information on the basis of which to make an informed political choice - is
severely undermined by the phenomenon of paid news and undisclosed
political advertisement. In some instances, for example, newspapers have
published conflicting news items on the same page showing the lack of
editorial consistency or control over the news items. In one such case, a news
paper published a news item in favour of one of the candidates with the
headline that a candidate is "getting the support of each and every section of
the society". On the same page, there was another news item arguing that
there will be a triangular fight in that constituency. Both these reports
appeared on the same page and were credited to a reporter of the
newspaper. 248 Furthermore, in many assembly elections, the same
newspaper has predicted the win of two opposing parties in a single state in
two different editions. For instance, the Panipat edition of Dainik Jagran
published a news item on page 9 of its edition dated October 8, 2009, that

criticised leaders of non-Congress parties, and stated that they would not be
able to make a mark in the elections because the Congress had done very
good work for every section of society. This news item added that candidates
of the Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) would not be able to harm. The
Ludhiana edition of the same newspaper, on the other hand, published a
news item in favour of the HJC on October 11, 2009, with a headline that
stated that the HJC would play the role of king or king-maker after the
elections.249

7.20           Lastly, the seriousness of these issues is exacerbated by the
magnitude to which they have become a systemic feature of elections. The
entrenched nature of such practices is demonstrated by the fact that some
candidates, in fact, thought it to be legitimate political expenditure and
included in their official expenses for the election. For instance, a candidate
had formally represented to the ECI that he had paid a newspaper to publish
favourable "news" about himself and had included the payment in his official
expenditure statement.250 The systemic and structural aspects of paid news
and political advertising are also revealed by the fact that news items have
even begun to carry names of advertising agencies. For example, the Prabhat
Khabar, a newspaper published from Ranchi, published articles praising
various candidates before the Parliamentary elections but placed the following
line on top of each such item "PK Media Marketing Initiative".251

7.21          Instances of paid news and political advertising have been
prominent enough to have attracted the attention of legal authorities, as well
as the ECI. For example, when one legislator failed to include spending on
paid news in her official poll accounts ( involving favourable coverage which
was dressed up as news in two Hindi dailies, Dainik Jaagran and Amar Ujala,
during her 2007 election), she was penalised for not reflecting it in the
expenditure. 252 The ECI also saw an involvement in these issues when,
following complaints from Prafulla Mahanta and Nagaon Nagarik Forum, a
Nagaon based NGO, The ECI officials sealed Nagaon Talks Channel, as it
was owned by Congress MLA Rockybul Hussain who was contesting from
Samguri constituency. 253 The Guwahati High Court later ordered the EC to

issued an apology and clarified to the readers that it was paid content. 255

7.22           These instances highlight the ways in which paid news and
disguised political advertisements are growing deep into the process of
democratic elections in India. The amount of money being spent on these
practices has risen at exponential levels. Appendix I mentions the number of
identified instances of paid news over last few assembly and general election.
The unethical practices of paid news and disguised political advertising have
reached the alarming level not just in a few cases of national media, but also
in the regional media.

7.23          Currently the problems of paid content identified above are
tackled in a piecemeal manner. Neither is there a blanket prohibition on paid
news, nor is there a provision exclusively dealing with political advertisement
or paid news. However, several aspects of the current statutory regime
regulating elections in India have impact on political advertisement and paid
news.

the Supreme Court 258 upheld the decision of the ECI. In September 2014,
however, through a judgment of Kait J., the Delhi High Court set aside the
ECI's Order regarding Ashok Chavan's failure to lodge his accounts, on the
ground that the Rules had not been complied with, as well as the fact that the
Commission did not frame an issue regarding the knowledge and consent of
the candidate.259 These proceedings reveal a loophole in the legal system.

to be expenditure incurred or authorised by the candidate and subject to the

stands now excludes only the expenditure incurred on the travel of leaders of

</p><p id="p_669">The requirement of lodging such accounts subjects the candidates to disclose
the advertisement expenditure. The provision does not directly deal with
political advertising or paid news. However, placing restrictions on election
expenses contributes in checking excessive political advertising.

<p id="p_670">Illegal payments in connection with an election

7.24.6           <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_370">Section 171H</a>: Illegal Payments in Connection with an Election

          "Whoever without the general or special authority in writing of a
          candidate incurs or authorises expenses on account of the holding of
          any public meeting, or upon any advertisement, circular or publication,
          or in any other way whatsoever for the purpose of promoting or
          procuring the election of such candidate, shall be punished with fine
          which may extend to five hundred rupees:
</p><p id="p_671">          Provided that if any person having incurred any such expenses not
          exceeding the amount of ten rupees without authority obtains within ten
          days from the date on which such expenses were incurred the approval
          in writing of the candidate, he shall be deemed to have incurred such
          expenses with the authority of the candidate."
</p><p id="p_672">This restriction on election expenses without the authority of the candidate
also involves "advertisement". Therefore, advertisements have to be routed
through the candidate. This is to ensure that any expenses on political
advertisements are directly counted as candidate's election expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_673">7.24.7        These provisions have been used by the courts frequently,
including in Ashok Chavan's 262 case to target the paid news phenomenon.
Though these provisions oversee expenditure incurred in such practices, they
are not sufficient for tackling the problems of paid news and political
advertising. For instance, if a candidate includes expenses of paid news, the
paid news will still not be subjected to disqualification. It only controls
excessive expenditure, not the practices of paid news and disguised political
advertisements.

<pre id="pre_17">(ii)      Disclosure provisions

7.25.1        Section 127A of the RPA imposes certain disclosure
</pre><p id="p_674">requirements on printing pamphlets, posters etc. These should bear names
and addresses of the printer and the publisher. In order to enforce the
requirement, it also mandates a declaration as to the identity of the publisher
thereof, signed by him and attested by two persons to whom he is personally

<p id="p_675"> known. Furthermore, the printer is also obligated to send one copy of the
document along with one copy of the declaration to the mentioned authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_676">7.25.2        <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_371">Section 127A</a> defines "Election pamphlet or poster" as "any
printed pamphlet, hand-bill or other document distributed for the purpose of
promoting or prejudicing the election of a candidate or group of candidates or
any placard or poster having reference to an election, but does not include
any hand-bill, placard or poster merely announcing the date, time, place and
other particulars of an election meeting or routine instructions to election
agents or workers"
</p>
<p id="p_677">7.25.3       The section imposes duties of disclosure on both
candidates/agents and printers/publishers. It does not expressly mention
newspapers and only mentions specific stationery that the candidates use for
election campaign. However, as per the instructions of the Commission
issued on 08.06.2010263 and 16.10.2007264, printing "other documents" for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_372">section 127A265</a> includes any paid content published. Failure on
part of any party to make such disclosures invites punishment with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which
may extend to two thousand rupees, or with both. However, it does not qualify
as a ground for disqualification.
</p>
<p id="p_678">7.25.4        The disclosure provisions are not sufficient to tackle the
practices of paid news and disguised political advertising. This is because the
provision itself is not sufficient to cover advertisements in newspapers or
electronic media. Such practices have only been targeted through ad-hoc
instructions of ECI. Specific disclosure norms with respect to advertisements
in newspaper and electronic media are required for clarity and certainty.

issued by the National Broadcasting Standards Authority 272 , the news
channels are required to disclose any political affiliations, either towards a

particular party or candidate, news broadcasters have a duty to be impartial.

guidelines and not binding in nature.

<p id="p_688">(v)    Media Certification and Monitoring Committee ("MCMC")

7.28.1         Due to the existence of multiple bodies like Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting, PCI, ECI, various self regulatory bodies, etc.,
there is lack of clarity with regard to specific authority which would be the final
authority in deciding a case of irregularity in this regard. Therefore, the PCI
Report suggested a separate body to be set-up for monitoring paid news.
</p>
<p id="p_689">7.28.2         The ECI also adopted the recommendation given by the PCI
Report to establish district level committees for monitoring paid news.273The
MCMC has officers from the Ministry of I&amp;B and State Department of Personal
Relations. The Expenditure Observer is duty-bound to inform to the MCMC of
all instances of suspected Paid News on the same day as brought to his
notice independently by any source. The political party or candidate shall
have to submit the details of expenditure on the telecast or broadcast in
electronic media and print media. If the MCMC finds that any advertisement
has been made in TV, Radio, Cable Network, FM Channel, in favour of any
candidate without proper permission, they shall inform the Returning Officer
(RO) immediately. The RO accordingly shall serve a notice upon the
defaulting candidate. If the impugned paid news has not been accounted for
in the election expense account, the RO will issue notice to the candidate with
regard to the incidents of paid news in consultation with the Expenditure
Observer for not showing the expenditure on such publication.274

7.29          The Commission also passed a direction that six months before
the due date of expiry of Lok Sabha or the State/UT Legislative Assembly, as
the case may be, a list of television channels/radio channels/newspapers, and
their standard rate cards shall be obtained by the CEOs and forwarded to the
Commission for inclusion of notional expenditure based on standard rate
cards in their election expenses account, in case the candidate has not
submitted the documents of actual expenses. However, the implementation of
this directive is very difficult given the scale of newspapers published
throughout India and the varying rates of advertisements of the newspapers.
Even if the Commission obtains the rate cards, it will be difficult to identify the
instances of paid news or disguised political advertising.
</p>
<p id="p_692">(vii) Is paid news "undue influence"?
</p>

<p id="p_693">Undue influence as an electoral offence

         <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_374">Section 171C</a> (a):
</p>
<p id="p_694">         "Whoever voluntarily interferes or attempts to interfere with the free
         exercise of any electoral right commits the offence of undue influence
         at an election."
</p>
<p id="p_695">7.30.1         "Electoral right", as per <a href="/doc/1428563/" id="a_375">section 171A</a> of the IPC, "means the
right of a person to stand, or not to stand as, or to withdraw from being, a
candidate or to vote or refrain from voting at any election." Therefore,
interference with the free exercise of electoral right would involve the right of
the other candidates to stand and right of the voters to vote. <a href="/doc/1628718/" id="a_376">In Ram Dial v.
Sant Lal</a> 276 , the Supreme Court held that to determine 'undue influence',
actual effect produced is not material. Furthermore, in <a href="/doc/648662/" id="a_377">Baburao Patel v. Dr.
Zakir Hussain</a> 277 , the court further laid down a list of activities that will be
excluded from the purview of 'undue influence' including canvassing by
ministers for their party candidates, issuing a party whip to vote for certain
candidate in Rajya Sabha, Presidential or Vice Presidential elections.

<p id="p_696">7.30.2       <a href="/doc/746830/" id="a_378">In Shiv Kirpal Singh v. VV Giri</a> 278 , the court held that undue

<p id="p_700"> stage when a voter goes through a mental process deciding which candidate
to vote for. Further, it also involves "mental process of weighing the merits
and demerits of the candidates to make his choice"279. The act need not be
authorized by any candidate. The undue influence can be practiced even by a
third party completely unconnected with the candidate.
</p>
<p id="p_701">7.30.3        Arguably, paid news might come within the meaning of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_379">section
171(c)(a)</a>. This is because, by masquerading as objective analysis or
reporting, paid news might well provide a wrong impression to voters, who will
be wrongly influenced by content that they mistakenly believe to be objective
and neutral. However, because the provision is open-ended, and not confined
to specific practices, its applicability to paid news is doubtful, and depends
upon the interpretation courts might place upon it. In any event, it will not
cover political advertisements marked as such, because any influence they
might exercise, will not be "undue".
</p>
<p id="p_702">Undue influence as corrupt practice

7.30.4          <a href="/doc/70252546/" id="a_380">Section 123</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951
states:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_108">          <a href="/doc/124987/" id="a_381">Section 123(2)</a>: "Undue influence, that is to say, any direct or indirect
          interference or attempt to interfere on the part of the candidate or his
          agents, or of any other person with the consent of the candidate or his
          election agent, with the free exercise of any electoral right."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_703">7.30.5         The only difference between this provision and in <a href="/doc/293432/" id="a_382">section 171C</a>
of the IPC is that of consequence. While conviction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_383">section 171C</a> leads
to punishment or fine, the consequence of <a href="/doc/124987/" id="a_384">section 123(2)</a> is disqualification.
Though undue influence may cover some instances of paid news and
disguised political advertising, it is a determination contingent on proof
adduced which might be difficult to obtain. Thus the provision does not
provide a direct solution to prohibit and regulate paid news and disguised
political advertising respectively.

management and the editorial staff in media companies. The independence of
the editor should be maintained and safeguarded. It also seeks to provide
right of reply to the candidates: "Press is not expected to indulge in
canvassing of a particular candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of
reply to the other candidate/party." In order to operationalise these reform
suggestions, the committee also recommended the constitution of district level
committees for scrutiny of Paid News during the periods of election.

7.32.1         The Sub-committee has recommended an amendment to the

news for furthering the prospect of election of any candidate or for
prejudicially affecting the prospect of election of any candidate be made an
electoral offence under chapter-III of Part-VII of the RP Act with punishment of
a minimum of two years imprisonment. The issue is pending with the
Government of India.281

7.32.2        It also suggested that the act of publishing a news item in
exchange for consideration should be included as a 'corrupt practice' under
Section 123 of the RPA. Further, it should be made an electoral offence
separately, so that it not only disqualifies the candidates, but also subjects
them, the journalists and media-houses to penal consequences.
</p>
<p id="p_710">7.32.3        Furthermore, Section 127A of the RPA may be suitably
amended, adding a new sub-section to the effect that in the case of any
advertisements/election matter for or against any political party or candidate in
print media, during the election period, the name and address of the publisher
should be given along with the matter/advertisement.

 prospect of election of any candidate or for prejudicially affecting the prospect
of election of any candidate be made an electoral offence under Chapter III of
Part VII of the Act with a punishment of a minimum of two years

following guidelines ought to be kept in mind:
</p>
<p id="p_712">   1. Identical articles with photographs and headlines appearing in
      competing publications carrying by-lines of different authors around the
      same time;
</p><p id="p_713">   2. On the same page of specific newspapers, articles praising competing
      candidates, claiming that both are likely to win the same elections;

      every section of the society and that he would win elections from the
      constituency;

      is ready to create history in the state/constituency but not carrying any
      news item related to this headline;

      marginalized the electoral prospects of the other party/candidate in the
      state with each and every sentence of the news item in favour of the
      party/candidate;
</p><p id="p_718">   7. There are instances of fixed size news items, each say a length of 125-

</p><p id="p_719">   8. In specific newspapers, multiple font types and multiple drop case
      styles are noticed within the same page of a single newspaper. This
      happens because, from the layouts to the fonts and photographs,

7.33.2        The Parliamentary Standing Committee acknowledged that the
issue of paid news is a product of foul play between the electoral candidates
and the media houses. 283 The Committee has, inter alia, found the existing
regulatory set-up dealing with paid news inadequate. Describing the voluntary

<p id="p_723"> self-regulatory bodies like the News Broadcasting Standards Authority
(NBSA) and Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) as an 'eye
wash', the Committee also found the punitive powers of statutory regulators
like the PCI and Electronic Media Monitoring Centre (EMMC) to be
inadequate. Expressing concern that the lack of restriction on ownership
across media segments (print, radio, TV or internet) or between content and
distribution could give rise to monopolistic practices, the Committee has urged
the Authority to present its recommendations and the Ministry to take
conclusive action on those recommendations on a priority basis.
</p>
<p id="p_724">7.33.3       The Standing Committee also noted that unlike in print media, in
case of electronic media, there is no regulatory body. It suggested
coordination with News Broadcaster Association to develop a mechanism to
keep a check on Paid News in electronic media. The committee also affirmed
some of the suggestions already made by the PCI Report.
</p>
<p id="p_725">Recommendations by TRAI

7.33.4        TRAI, in August 2014, provided a set of recommendations
pertaining to media ownership wherein it emphasized that paid news should
be defined comprehensively and a framework should be established for
examining complaints and taking punitive action against the defaulting media
entities. It noted that there is little doubt that an institutional response
addressing both substantive and procedural issues including evidentiary rules
is needed to curb the menace.284

7.33.5        It strongly recommended that entities related to political bodies,
religious bodies, urban local governing bodies, Panchayati Raj, other publicly
funded bodies, and Central and State Government ministries, departments,
companies, undertakings, joint ventures, and government-funded entities and
affiliates be barred from entering into broadcasting and TV channel
distribution sectors. 285 Further, it also suggested that the Press Council of
India must be fully empowered to adjudicate the complaints of "paid news'
and give final judgments in the matter.

below.
</p>
<p id="p_729">7.35        Three questions need to be asked in order to ascertain if Right
to Freedom of Speech and Expression is violated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">          (i) Whether paid news and political advertising are protected under

<blockquote id="blockquote_110">          (ii) Whether the restriction is in the interests of the sovereignty and

          court, defamation or incitement to an offence?

<p id="p_730">Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression [<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_388">Art. 19(1)(a)]

7.36</a>         In Jununa Prasad Mukhariya v Lacchi Ram, 286 the Supreme
Court held that regulation of election speech does not raise any <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_389">Article
19(1)(a)</a> concerns. Rejecting a challenge to speech-restricting provisions of
the RPA (<a href="/doc/124987/" id="a_390">Sections 123(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/1477992/" id="a_391">124(5)</a>), the Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_112">          "The right to stand as a candidate and contest an election is not a
          common law right. It is a special right created by statute and can only
          be exercised on the conditions laid down by the statute. The
          Fundamental Rights Chapter has no bearing on a right like this created
          by statute. The appellants have no fundamental right to be elected
          members of Parliament. If. they want that they must observe the rules.
          If they prefer to exercise their right of free speech outside these rules,
          the impugned sections do not stop them."

<p id="p_731">7.37           Although the Court has, in subsequent cases, subjected
provisions of the RP Act to <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_392">Article 19(1)(a)</a> scrutiny, it has done so while
affirming the core holding of Jumuna Prasad. 287 Therefore, insofar as
prohibition of paid news and regulation of political advertising is accomplished
through the RP Act, in the form of prescriptions upon the conduct of
candidates, it will not raise any constitutional concerns.

<p id="p_732">7.38           Assuming that <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_393">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is prima facie applicable to the
regulation of paid news and political advertising, the following two questions
arise: do paid news and political advertising fall within the constitutional
protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_394">Article 19(1)(a)?</a> And if so, is legal regulation justified under
<a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_395">Article 19(2)?</a>

<p id="p_735"> 7.39           One way of understanding political advertisement is as a form of
commercial speech. Since the issuer pays for newspaper space, in order to
extol his product, there is little to separate political advertising from
commercial advertising simpliciter. The constitution on commercial speech is
very clear. Although, in Hamdard Dawakhana v Union of India288, the Court
excluded commercial speech from the protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_397">Article 19(1)(a</a>), this
general position was overturned in Tata Press v MTNL. 289 However, while
holding that commercial speech was protected by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_398">Article 19(1)(a</a>), the Court
also held that " commercial speech" which is deceptive, unfair, misleading and
untruthful would be hit by <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_399">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution and can be
regulated/prohibited by the State." This makes it clear that disclosure
requirements for political advertisements, which are designed to ensure that
the advertisements are not deceptive, misleading or untruthful, would pass
constitutional muster.
</p>
<p id="p_736">7.40           What of the prohibition of paid news altogether? It is important to
note that in Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government
of India. v. Cricket Association of Bengal 290 , the Supreme Court of India
observed, "one-sided information, disinformation, misinformation and non-
information, all equally create an uninformed citizenry". The significance of
free and fair information specially for the electoral process was also observed
in PUCL by the Supreme Court. The availability of proper and relevant
information about the candidate fosters and promotes the freedom of speech
and expression both from the point of view of imparting and receiving the
information.291Lastly, in <a href="/doc/921638/" id="a_400">Union of India v. Motion Picture Association</a> 292, the
Supreme Court held that a requirement compelling cinemas to showcase
short documentaries before the start of films was justified, since it furthered
the democratic purpose of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_401">Article 19(1)(a</a>), i.e., spreading information and
awareness. The conclusion that flows from these cases is that the central
meaning of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_402">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is the connection between the freedom of speech
and the democratic process, which is to be achieved by using the freedom of
speech as a method of spreading awareness and information among the
electorate. Paid news quintessentially distorts this process. Consequently, the
prohibition of paid news is unlikely to run into any <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_403">Article 19(1)(a)</a> hurdles,
because it does not fall within the protection of the constitutional right to
freedom of speech and expression (<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_404">Article 19(1)(a)).</a>

<p id="p_741"> G. A Comparative Perspective

7.41          The international practices regulating political advertisements
mainly involve several measures like banning all political advertisements
(U.K.), duty of media to give reasonable opportunity to publish to all political
parties, mandatory disclosure requirements etc. This section elaborates on
the modalities and validity of such restrictions in various jurisdictions.
</p>
<pre id="pre_19">(i)    The United Kingdom

7.42           In the UK, all paid political advertising is banned from television
</pre><p id="p_742">and radio. The ECHR held that the ban imposed by the UK was compatible
with the Convention. 293 This prohibition extends not only to political
candidates and parties, but also to any advertisement which aims to influence
public opinion on a matter of public controversy. 294 It also maintains strict
restrictions on printing and publishing by third parties during campaigns. Prior
to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, 2000 (PPERA), no
political party could accept more than £5 as they were regarded as election
expense. In Bowman v. United Kingdom295the ECHR decided that the limit of
£5 was contrary to the right of freedom of expression contained in <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_405">Article 10</a> of
the European Convention on Human Rights. As of now, <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_406">Section 79</a> and
Schedule 9 of PPERA allow every national party a spending limit of £30,000
per constituency in a general election for the House of Commons. The
Broadcasting Act, 1990 incorporated the practice of broadcasters letting out
airtime for party political broadcasts. 296 <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_407">Sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/1524688/" id="a_408">107</a> of the Act
provides for procurement of licenses to carry political broadcasts from the ITC
and the rules to carry out the broadcasts within permissible limits.297

</p><p id="p_743">(ii)   Australia

7.43          The Commonwealth Electoral Act, 1918 of Australia mandates
disclosure provisions for any "electoral advertisement, handbill, pamphlet,
poster or notice" containing "electoral matter". 298 The Australian law also
prescribes a 'Blackout Period' during which broadcasters must not display any
material containing electoral matter which is intended or is likely to affect the

 voters. 299 The Broadcasters Services Act, 1992 provides that where any
election matter is broadcasted during an election period by a broadcaster, that
broadcaster must give all the parties contesting the election a reasonable
opportunity to have election matter broadcasted during the election period.300
It further provides that for ensuring equal access, free broadcasting is not
required.301 However, it treats the editorial content and advertisement at the
same footing. Therefore, there is no separate regulation on Paid News in
Australia.
</p>
<p id="p_747">(iii)   Canada

7.44           In Canada, while election advertising is permitted, the
regulations are laid down with respect to adequate disclosure. Section 320 of
Canada Election Act, 2000 provides that the material must be authorized by
the candidate or his official agent and the same must be mentioned in the
material being transmitted. 302 Sections 6 and 8 of the Radio Regulations,
1986and Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987respectively provide that
during an election period, a licensee shall be allocated time for the
broadcasting of programs, advertisements or announcements of a partisan
political character on an equitable basis to all accredited political parties and
rival candidates represented in the election or referendum.
</p>
<p id="p_748">(iv)    ECHR standards on permissibility of such restrictions

7.45.1         Political advertising is the exercise of freedom of speech
expression. Restrictions on paid political advertising limit such freedom.303In
VgT v. Switzerland, 304 the ECHR held that the ban on political broadcasts
infringed the right to freedom of expression, but did concede that a prohibition
could be compatible with such freedom in some circumstances if it met a
'pressing social need'.305

7.45.2        The Human Rights Council in its 26th session306 reaffirmed the
view held by the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance suggesting
that while paid political advertising is permissible, private media outlets should
be required to charge the same rates to all the parties and candidates without

out advertisements which read: "We need your vote on 15th September! Vote
for the Pensioners Party." However, the ECHR in 1995 held that there was a
lack of reasonable nexus between the restriction and the object sought from
the regulation.308

7.45.3         Political advertisement denies equal or fair access to direct
broadcasting as every candidate should have fair access regardless of the
state of their campaign finance. 309 The ECHR in Murphy has held "no
advertisement shall be broadcast which is directed towards any religious or
political end or which has any relation to an industrial dispute."310

7.45.4        In Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom, 311 the
ECHR, upheld the validity of a ban imposed by the BACC (Broadcast
Advertising Clearance Centre) on broadcasting appellant's piece and drew
attention to the political nature of ADI's objectives, which as such prohibited
the broadcasting of the advertisement under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_412">Section 321(2)</a> which disqualifies
advertisement remotely promoting any political objective. It further stated that
the ban imposed was not in contravention to <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_413">Article 10</a> of the European
Convention on Human Rights. The ECHR upheld the validity of the ban on
two grounds: (i) the aim of preventing distortion of public debate by the
highest spender is legitimate, and (ii) there is a reasonable nexus between the
object sought and the measure employed.
</p>
<p id="p_753">(v)     US standards on permissibility of restrictions

7.46.1          In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court of the U.S., invalidated
the provisions of Federal Campaign Act which dealt with ceiling limits on
electoral expenditures and deemed it unconstitutional.312 The Buckley ruling
settled that expenditures by a non-candidate that are "controlled by or
coordinated with the candidate and his campaign" may be treated as indirect
contributions subject to Federal Election Campaign Act's source and amount
limitations.313 Section 214 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of

 2002 extends the same rule to expenditures coordinated with a national,
State, or local committee of a political party. In 2007, the Supreme Court of
the United States held that an advertisement included express advocacy or its
functional equivalent "if the ad is susceptible to no reasonable interpretation
other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate."314

7.46.2        Section 201 of the BCRA provides for a mandatory disclosure of
electioneering communications.315 It carves out an exception for independent
expenditures and communications which solely promotes a debate or forum.
The Supreme Court has time and again upheld the validity of this provision
and in Citizens United, the Court held that disclosure is the least restrictive
means.316


H. Recommendations

7.47           The recommendations pertain to three aspects: first, introducing
definitions of paid news and political advertising; second, laying down the
consequences attached to those indulging in such practices, and third, the
institution that should exercise the powers of imposing such consequences.
</p>
<pre id="pre_20">(i)      Definitions:

7.48.1         Two definitions need to be introduced: 'paying for news' and
'political advertisement'.

'Paying for news'

7.48.2         A vast majority of surveyed suggestions have agreed with the
</pre><p id="p_757">definition of 'paid news' provided by the PCI Report, i.e. paid news is "any
news or analysis appearing in any media (Print &amp; Electronic) for a price in
cash or kind as consideration."
</p>
<p id="p_758">7.48.3     While this definition strikes an optimal balance between wide
coverage and particular targeting, we believe that four changes are
necessary:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_113">      a. Since an offence is sought to be created, the definition should be
         modified such that it defines the transitive verb 'paying for news' rather
         than the adjective-noun 'paid news'.

<p id="p_760">    b. It should be made clear that for the definition to be met, the payment is
      made to the media house by the person seeking publication or telecast
      of a particular piece of news or analysis relating to elections and not
      vice-versa. This is because media houses often pay opinion
      columnists, talk show guests and other occasional contributors,
      remuneration in cash or kind for sharing their opinions. Payments such
      as these should not be covered by the definition of 'paying for news'.
</p>
<p id="p_761">   c. By way of abundant caution, advertisements that follow all disclosure
      requirements and other legal preconditions should be specifically
      excluded from this definition since they would not fall within the ambit
      of 'news or analysis'.
</p>
<p id="p_762">   d. The offence should exclude official publications by registered or
      recognised political parties or any news or electronic media house
      owned by a political party and disclosed as such. This is because of
      two reasons: First, in such cases, political parties may themselves be
      funding the salaries of journalists working for these media publications
      and that is not the key target of the offence of paying for news; Second,
      the key issue in such cases is disclosure as the public must have a
      right to know who the owners of the said publication are. To avail of
      this exclusion, political parties must themselves own the said media
      house. [This exclusion will appear in the section creating the
      substantive offence and not the definition section.]

7.48.4       Accordingly, a new <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_414">Section 2(ea)</a> should be introduced.
<a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_415">Section 2(ea)</a> will read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_114">      "(ea) "paying for news" means directly or indirectly paying for any news
      or analysis relating to any election under this Act appearing in
      electronic media or print media (print, radio, television and all other
      electronic) for a price in cash or kind as consideration to any such
      media, entity, person employed therein or connected thereto in any
      manner, but not including political advertisements as defined under this
      law;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_115">      EXPLANATION:- for the purpose of this clause the expression
      "electronic media" and "print media" shall have the meanings assigned
      in clauses (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_416">section 126(a)</a>;"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_763">7.48.5         At the same time, an analogous definition should be introduced
for 'receiving payment for news'. Thus a new section, <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_417">Section 2(ha)</a> should be
introduced, which will read as follows:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_174">                                                                           133</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_116">         "2(ha). "receiving payment for news" means any media entity, person
        employed therein or connected thereto in any manner, directly or
        indirectly receiving payment for any news or analysis relating to any
        election under this Act, not including political advertisements as defined
        under this Act."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_764">'Political advertisement'

7.48.6         Given that the constitutional rationale of prohibiting paid news is
to preserve the right to know of electors, it is pursuant to the same rationale
that political advertisements should be regulated. The purpose of such
regulation is so that political advertisements are clearly understood as paid-for
publications and cannot successfully be disguised as objective, accurate
news. Such advertisement should not qualify as 'paid news' as long as it is
properly disclosed as a political advertisement. To this end, what counts as a
'political advertisement' must be defined. The general definition of
'advertisement' is found in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_418"> the Code</a> of Self-Regulation for Advertising
published by the Advertising Standards Council of India.317 This needs to be
built upon in the context of political advertisements.
</p>
<p id="p_765">7.48.7          Thus, a new <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_419">section 2(eb)</a> will be introduced which will read as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">        "2(eb). "political advertisement" means any advertisement paid for by
        any political party, candidate of a political party, any other person
        contesting an election, or any other person connected therewith or
        associated thereto, carrying necessary disclosures as notified by the
        Election Commission in this regard."
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_21">(ii)    Electoral offence


7.49.1        Paying for news is a practice that affects free and fair elections.
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_118">It affects the electors' right to know and also skews elections in favour of
those who possess economic wherewithal. There are also several attendant
negative consequences in terms of vitiating the atmosphere in which elections
are conducted. It is thus imperative that paying for news be made an electoral
offence as well as receiving payment for it. Consequently, we recommend the
introduction of a new <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_420">Section 127B</a> for this purpose. <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_421">Section 127</a> B will read
as follows:
</blockquote>


<p id="p_766">317 'Advertisement' is defined as 'a paid-for communication, addressed to the public or a
section of it, the purpose of which is to influence the opinions or behaviour of those to whom it
is addressed...'


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_175">                                                                                            134</span>
        "127B. Paying for, and receiving payment for news

       (1) Any person who is found paying for news, or receiving payment for
           news shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may
           extend to three years, and with fine, which may extend to twenty-
           five lakh rupees.
</p><p id="p_767">       (2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to payments made

           or controlled by them.
</p>
<p id="p_768">       (3) To avail of the exemption under sub-section (2) all registered
           political parties must disclose their interests in any publication in the
           form and manner notified by the ECI in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_769">       (4) An attempt to commit an act punishable under sub-section (1) shall
           be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to two
           years, or with fine, which may extend to ten lakh rupees, or with
           both.

<p id="p_770">       (5) No court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under this
           section unless there is a complaint made by order of, or under
           authority from, the ECI or the Chief Electoral Officer of the State
           concerned."
</p>
<p id="p_771">7.49.2       Not only will the incorporation of this electoral offence make
paying for news penal, the stringent punishment will ensure that if the
candidate himself is found guilty, then, in all likelihood, he will be disqualified
pursuant to Section 8(3) of the RPA. A provision similar to the suggested
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_422">Section 126-D</a> should also be incorporated in the event that it is an offence
committed by a company.
</p>
<p id="p_772">(iii) Corrupt practice

7.50          It is also essential that an election be liable to be declared void
by the High Court if it is found that paid news has vitiated it. For this purpose,
in accordance with Section 100 of the RP Act, it is necessary to make paying
for news a 'corrupt practice' under Section 123 of the RP Act. As
demonstrated above, there is an arguable case that paying for news
constitutes 'undue influence' for the purpose of Section 123(2) of the RP Act.
However it requires evidence to be adduced which might be difficult to obtain.
To remove any difficulty in this regard, a presumption must be established by
law that paying for news would constitute 'undue influence'. Thus we
recommend the introduction of <a href="/doc/124987/" id="a_423">Section 123(2)(a)(iii)</a> which will read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_773">"(iii) pays for news"
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_176">                                                                               135</span>
<p id="p_774"> This is an addition to a provision which already deems certain acts to
constitute 'undue influence' and achieves the object with minimum legislative
amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_775">(iv)      Disclosure for political advertisements


7.51.1 As demonstrated above, currently guidelines for disclosure of political
advertisements are scattered and non-uniform. In order to curb the practice of
disguised political advertisement, disclosure provisions should be made
mandatory for all forms of media. The purpose of disclosure is two fold: (a) to
help the public identify the nature of the content (paid content or editorial
content), and (b) to keep the track of transactions between the candidates and
the media. Therefore, the extent to which the disclosure is being sought
should serve these purposes. For example, the content should carry in bold
letters "This content is sponsored" or "This is an advertisement". Further, it
should use style including fonts etc. in a way that it can be clearly
distinguished from news. This form should contain the details of the sponsor
of the content. This should be made applicable to all political advertising. A
failure to adhere to this requirement should be considered an electoral
offence.
</p>
<p id="p_776">7.51.2          However, much of the disclosure requirement is a question of
detail that is best left to the discretion of the ECI. It would be unwise for a law
to lay down the specifics of disclosure which might need to evolve over time
and be dynamic across different media. Accordingly, the Commission
recommends the introduction of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_424">Section 127C</a> in the RPA which will read as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_119">       "127C. Non-disclosure of interest in political advertising

          (1) Any political advertisement in any media shall carry a disclosure to
              this effect in the form and manner notified by the ECI in this regard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">          (2) Any person who contravenes the provision of sub-section (1) shall
              be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six
              months or fine which may extend to five lakh rupees, or both."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_777">7.51.3         A provision similar to the suggested <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_425">Section 126D</a> discussed in
the next chapter should also be incorporated as <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_426">section 127D</a> in the event that
it is an offence committed by a company.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_121">          "127D. Offences by companies.-- (1) Where an offence under

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_125"> (i)    Development of opinion polls in India

8.1            Pre-election opinion polls and exit polls have become a regular
feature in the last one and half decades within the Indian electoral landscape.
</blockquote><p id="p_781">Opinion polls are conducted by polling agencies and disseminated widely by
the electronic and print media. 318 With the advent of a large number of
television channels and newspapers, the race to conduct election surveys and
publishing them as quickly as possible has become the norm.319 Opinion polls
of large scale samples conducted during the 1980s became important
indicators of overall popular issues and sentiments. 320 The significance of
opinion polls has continued through the 1990s and thereafter. The increase in
the number of opinion polls was accompanied by attempts at regulation,
which will be looked at in this section.
</p>
<p id="p_782"> (ii)   1998 opinion poll guidelines
8.2.1        The earliest attempt to regulate opinion polls was made in 1998
when the ECI took an overall view of the situation and issued an order on
11thJanuary 1998 laying down "Guidelines for Publication and Dissemination
of Results of Opinion Polls/Exit Polls", including government-controlled
electronic media, in connection with the conduct of opinion polls and exit polls
by them. This was done in the wake of impending general elections to the
House of the People and to the Legislative Assemblies of Gujarat, Himachal
Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura.321

8.2.2           The said guidelines prohibited publication or dissemination, in
any manner whatsoever, of the result of any opinion poll conducted at any
time, in or by any print or electronic media, after 5:00 p.m., forty-eight hours
before the commencement of the first day of poll for the aforesaid elections,
till the closing of poll in all States and Union territories. More specifically, the
concerned guideline mandated that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_126">       "No result of any opinion poll conducted at any time shall be
      published, publicised or disseminated, in any manner
      whatsoever, in or by any print or electronic media, after 1700
      hours on February 14, 1998 (February 16, 1998 being the first
      day of poll for the aforesaid general elections) and till after the
      closing of poll in all States and Union territories, i.e., 1700 hours
      on March 7, 1998."322

8.2.3 Almost simultaneously, the Press Council of India ('PCI') also
examined the issue of dissemination of results of opinion polls and exit polls
and formulated certain guidelines for the press and the print media. The crux
of the PCI recommendations was that newspapers should not allow their
forum to be used for distortions and manipulations of the elections and should
not allow themselves to be exploited at the hands of interested parties.323

8.2.4 Consequently, the PCI mandated that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_127">      "No newspaper shall publish exit-poll surveys, however genuine
      they may be, till the last of the poll is over."324

The PCI issued such a guideline primarily because poll dates during an
election are staggered. Hence, the media may end up carrying exit-poll
surveys of the polls already held which would be likely to influence the voters
where the polling is yet to commence.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_785"> (iii) Challenge to the guidelines of the ECI

8.3.1 However, the guidelines issued by the ECI witnessed a vehement
protest from the electronic and print media. Media houses primarily contended
that these guidelines infringed their fundamental right of speech and
expression and also, their right of information under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_428">Article 19(1)(a).</a> 325
Constitutionally, this right could only be curtailed by a law which was within
the purview of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_429">Article 19(2).</a> The guidelines of the EC were not law made by
Parliament but only an executive instruction which could not curtail anyone's

</p>
<p id="p_790">8.3.2         However, the issue regarding the validity of the ECI guidelines
arose again during the elections to the House of the People and to the
Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka,
Maharashtra and Sikkim held in September-October 1999. The Times of India
Group of Newspapers, as well as certain other newspapers refused to
observe the guidelines issued by the ECI. 330 Consequently, the ECI
approached the Supreme Court for a direction against the Times of India
Group to abide by the Commission's guidelines. Owing to the important
constitutional issues involved in this matter, the Supreme Court referred this
matter to a Constitution bench. The said bench expressed serious doubts
about the constitutional validity of the impugned guidelines infringing the
fundamental rights of the media houses. The Supreme Court also expressed
surprise at how such guidelines could be enforced by the EC in the absence
of any statutory sanction. 331 Consequently, the approach of the Supreme
Court prompted the EC to withdraw its guidelines on 14 th September 1999.332
Such withdrawal meant that there were no restrictions on the conduct of
opinion polls and exit polls or on the dissemination of results of these polls
during the general elections to the House of the People and certain legislative
assemblies held in September-October 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_791"> (iv) Important developments in 2004

8.4.1         The vacuum with regard to guidelines on the publication and
dissemination of results of opinion polls persisted till 2004. To arrive at a
decision by consensus prior to the general elections to the House of the
People that year, the EC convened a meeting of all political parties on 6thApril
2004, to deliberate on the issue of opinion polls and exit polls. The view of the
majority of the political parties was that conducting opinion polls and
publishing the results thereof should not be allowed from the date of issue of
statutory notification calling the election till the completion of the poll. The
suggestion that emerged out of the all-party meet was that in a multi-phased

and publishing the results of opinion polls should be for the entire period
starting from the date of notification of the first phase of election and until the
completion of the poll in the last phase.333A similar view was also voiced for
exit polls, and all parties were of the view that in a multi-phased election,
results of exit polls should not be allowed to be published until the completion
of the poll in the last phase. The EC thereafter recommended to the Ministry
of Law and Justice that there should be a specific provision in the
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_435">Representation of the People Act</a>, 1951 ('RP Act, 1951'), prohibiting
publication and dissemination of the results of exit polls and opinion polls
during the period mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_795">8.4.2         Upon receiving the aforesaid recommendation from the EC, the
Ministry of Law and Justice sought the opinion of the then Attorney General of
India, Mr. Soli Sorabjee in this regard. Mr. Sorabjee was of the view that
prohibiting the publication of opinion polls and exit polls would constitute a
breach of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_436">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. Mr. Sorabjee opined that such
prohibition would specifically violate the public's right to know, which has been
held by the Supreme Court to be part of the freedom of speech 334 . He
suggested that certain guidelines could be laid down to provide that while
disseminating results of poll surveys, the agency concerned should provide
the public with sufficient information, such as the:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">         (a) Name of the political party or organisation which
             commissioned the survey;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_129">         (b) Identity of the organisation conducting the survey and the
             methodology employed;

<p id="p_796">8.4.3          Most importantly, Mr. Sorabjee pointed out that the EC, in
exercise of its plenary powers under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_437">Article 324</a> of the Constitution, can issue
directions requiring the media to comply with the guidelines. One of the
significant takeaways from Mr. Sorabjee's opinion was that it did not
contemplate an outright ban on the publication and dissemination of opinion
polls, but regulation by means of guidelines issued by the EC in this regard.

furtherance of which the views of these parties were sought.340 The dominant
view that came across from the views put forth by various political parties was
that opinion polls should not be published or disseminated during the period
starting from the date of notification till the completion of elections. 341 While
the EC's attempt in this direction is laudable, it does not address concerns as
to how such regulation of opinion polls should be carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_813">    B. Issues with Current Regulations

</p><p id="p_814">    (i) Effects on the purity of the electoral process

8.8           Legitimate apprehensions regarding the effect of opinion polls
on the purity of the electoral process justify regulation of the same. Among
these are concerns about the accuracy of opinion polls. There are a number
of instances where election results predicted by such polls turned out to be
incorrect, by a large margin. For instance, poll predictions based on election
surveys during the general elections in 2004 went completely haywire for
most of the polling agencies. 342 In 2004, almost all the polls conducted by
media houses predicted that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would
be able to retain power at the centre, which eventually did not happen. This
raised questions about the polls being biased, or incorrect in some measure.
Questions regarding certain specific problems with opinion polls have always
existed, some of them being:
</p>
<p id="p_815">    (ii) Potential of opinion polls to influence voters

8.9.1        The central justification for the regulation of opinion polls is the
preservation of the sanctity and integrity of the electoral process. Concerns on
this count arise on the grounds that opinion polls are able to influence
electoral behaviour and distort electoral outcomes.
</p>
<p id="p_816">8.9.2       This influence on electoral behaviour can take two forms,
assuming that opinion polls are properly conducted.343 Both are predicated on

<p id="p_820"> the understanding that the dissemination of social research will alter the
original situation so that it is impossible to accurately predict outcomes. First,
there is the possibility that a bandwagon or contagion effect could result. This
refers to the case where information predicting the victory of a candidate
could lead to votes being switched in his or her favour and away from other
candidates. Second, there is the underdog effect. This refers to voters
switching to favour candidates not predicted to win, so that the prediction or
appearance of success undermines the actual outcome.
</p>
<p id="p_821">8.9.3        There is no clear empirical evidence to precisely demonstrate
the degree to which these effects play out among the Indian electorate, or
even to establish that such effects do operate. Even in jurisdictions (such as
the United States 344 , Canada 345 , Germany 346 and the United Kingdom 347 )
where studies have been undertaken, there is no authoritative understanding
on how much influence opinion polls have on electoral behaviour.
</p>
<p id="p_822">8.9.4         On the other hand, an argument against opinion polls has been
that information from opinion polls confuses voters, or as said by the EC,
'would be a deleterious intrusion into the mind of the voter' 348 . It is also
believed that information from opinion polls may affect voters' perceptions of
the chances that various parties may have of winning and consequently, by
affecting voters' expectations about the outcome of an election, polls may
affect the vote.349 However, certain studies by political scientists suggest that
holding a lead in an opinion poll generally earns an electoral candidate no
more than a 4%-5% lead among undecided voters.350 In fact, opinion polls
published extremely close to the day of polling do not affect public opinion to a
large extent because only a small percentage of voters remain undecided by
then. 351 However, this is not to say that opinion polls do not influence the

</p>
<p id="p_826">    (iii) Independence of polling agencies
8.10 The independence of the agencies/organisations is threatened by the
possibility of opinion polls being manipulated to favour certain political parties,
or through bias in choosing sample sizes. Apprehensions against opinion
polls arose, for example, in February 2014, when a sting operation by a Hindi
news channel claimed that numerous poll agencies were willing to manipulate
their poll projections by increasing their margin of error by a certain
percentage of points, in favour of certain specific parties. 352Notwithstanding
the effect such manipulations may have on the voting patterns of citizens, it
does shake the confidence of the people in the findings of such opinion polls.
More importantly, for a first-past-the-post system like ours, this can spell
drastic changes in election results and hence, the need for regulation of
opinion polls should be urgently addressed.
</p>
<p id="p_827">    (iv) Issue of robustness in findings

8.11.1         Statistically, opinion polls are often presented as point
estimation, pinpointing a fixed number of seats won by a party. 353 However,
these polls are actually representing estimation with a given degree of
error.354 Essentially, they represent interval estimation, a range of seats for
every political party, and not the exact number of seats that a party would win.
This important fact is generally not made known to the voters. Having
knowledge of the fact of the margin of error in the findings of opinion polls
would make for more informed voters. While the findings of opinion polls in
India are largely considered to be fallible, psephologists believe that crucial
factors such as choosing the optimum sample size, sample design and the
representativeness of the sample can ensure some level of accuracy. 355

8.11.2       It has been argued that a few instances of manipulation, in
whatever manner they exist, do not make a case for an outright ban. Instead,
they call for better regulation of opinion polls, in a manner that will be
recommended in Part 6. As mentioned earlier as well, a total prohibition on
publication and dissemination of results of opinion polls may amount to an
infringement of the right under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_455">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. An analysis

<p id="p_830"> of the manner in which opinion polls are statutorily regulated in other
jurisdictions can provide some insights into how suitable amendments can be
made to the RP Act, 1951 to regulate the same in India.
</p>
<p id="p_831">      C. Regulation in Other Countries

8.12           The ECI's guidelines of 1998 refer to the position in a number of
jurisdictions, noting that a number of "advanced democracies" have placed
restrictions on the conduct of opinion polls. 356 In particular, the guidelines
noted that Canada, France, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia have imposed certain restrictions. 357 Some jurisdictions do not
impose any restrictions on the publication of opinion or exit polls. These states
include United States and Australia.
</p>
<p id="p_832">8.13           A number of jurisdictions do, however, regulate opinion polls.
The practice of ensuring a cooling off period before voting commences has
been a feature of a number of democracies, including Canada, France and
Italy. 358 Where such provisions were struck down by courts, an important
consideration related to the proportionality of the measure and its compatibility
with the freedom of expression. The position in some jurisdictions has been
discussed below, which can provide some guidance for regulation of the
conduct of opinion polls in India:

Ban

8.18          While regulation of the publication of the results of opinion polls
is an urgent necessity, a complete ban on the same would be constitutionally
impermissible. Any restrictions, to whatever degree, on the conduct of public
opinion polls would necessarily implicate the fundamental right to freedom of
speech and expression. At a general level, the idea of deliberative democracy
would require that decisions of public importance, including voting, be

attempt to contribute to this deliberation.
</p>
<p id="p_854">8.19          Outright bans on either the conduct or the publication and
dissemination of exit polls would be entirely inconsistent with existing
constitutional standards, as Mr. Soli Sorabjee concluded in his opinion in
2004. 367 Wholesale bans on opinion polls would not fall within any of the
grounds listed under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_466">Article 19(2</a>), or qualify as a reasonable restriction. As a
result, while measures to improve the quality of information supplied to voters
could be seen as furthering the right under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_467">Article 19(1)(a</a>), they must do so
while balancing this interest with the right to free expression of those
conducting and/or disseminating opinion polls.
</p>
<p id="p_855">8.20          Former Attorney General of India, Mr. Ashok Desai furnished an
opinion on 13th June 2014 on the proposed amendment of Section 126(1)(b)
of the RP Act, 1951. Notably, Mr. Desai acknowledged that that in a
staggered, multi-phased election, it would not be possible to blank out the
electioneering news in a State going to poll when another State is not, nor
would it be desirable to do so.368 Television broadcasts have a national reach
and are not contained within the boundaries of a particular constituency. Mr.
Desai pointedly mentioned in his opinion that while a direct electoral appeal
cannot be made during the proscribed period in the constituency going to poll,
there is nothing to prevent the media broadcast elsewhere being received in
that very constituency and about the very parties who are contesting in that
area.369 Hence, an outright ban on dissemination of election matter would not
be practicable, keeping in view the reach of electronic as well as print media
in contemporary times.
</p>
<p id="p_856">8.21           The issue of whether opinion polls require regulation engages
the right to freedom of speech and expression in two important ways. First,
those conducting opinion polls do so in exercise of their rights to free speech
under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_468">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Any regulation would need to acknowledge this right.
Second, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that a general right to know is
an element of the right to freedom of speech.370 Also the Supreme Court has
recognized, in <a href="/doc/182927551/" id="a_469">Union of India v. Association</a> for Democratic Reforms 371, that
voters have a right to information concerning matters that would be relevant to
their choices at the ballot. Regulation would have to be targeted at ensuring
that a real and effective voters' right to information is secured.

<p id="p_860"> 8.22           Regulation of opinion polls also concerns the freedom of the
press, which may not be recognised as a separate freedom, but is folded into
the freedom of speech and expression.372 The freedom of the press serves
the larger purpose of the right of the people to be informed of a broad
spectrum of facts, views and opinions. 373 Opinion polls assist the media in
indicating contemporary concerns and attitudes among the public while also
giving feedback to the media on the state of public opinion at a given point in
time.374 Some guidelines, such as those issued by the PCI and NBSA, already
exist for the regulation of opinion polls. The time is now ripe for statutory
regulation of the conduct of opinion polls by means of an amendment to the
RP Act, 1951. Significantly, there is no empirical evidence as to how much
opinion polls impact the actual voting pattern.375 Hence, an outright ban on the
conduct of opinion polls does not stand justified. Appropriate amendments
need to be inserted within the RP Act, 1951, in a manner specified
hereinafter.

<pre id="pre_23">E.     Approach to Amendments

8.23           The Law Commission believes that any amendments to the RP
</pre><p id="p_861">Act, 1951 with respect to opinion polls must ensure adequate regard to the
public's right to access all relevant information concerning elections. Certain
principles may be duly considered before recommending statutory
amendments to regulate opinion polls. Mr. Ashok Desai's main concern in his
opinion referred to in Part 4 was that to what extent a television broadcast
about the election could be subject to certain prohibition. Mr. Desai's opinion
assumes importance for the Law Commission because it examines the
contours of <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_473">Section 126(1)(b)</a>, currently the only provision regulating opinion
polls, and the duration for which a prohibition can be imposed on display of
'election matter'.376

8.24          Mr. Desai opines that in considering <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_474">Section 126</a>, it is necessary
to balance two contending principles - the right to free and fair elections along
with the freedom of speech. Since it is a penal provision, it should be strictly
construed in light of the reality of elections in India. Mr. Desai concluded his
opinion on <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_475">Section 126</a> with the view that,

<p id="p_864">8.25          To ensure the independence of the agencies conducting such
polls, and to ensure that their findings raise confidence among the voters,
their credentials should be known to the public. Following the Canadian
example, the organisation conducting or sponsoring the opinion poll/survey
should also transmit its own details along with the results of the opinion polls.
This would facilitate the public to know the source of such findings and would
evoke confidence in the results.
</p>
<p id="p_865">8.26           Apart from the details of the organisation conducting the survey,
the results should also include other particulars, such as size of the sample
surveyed, sampling method adopted, population from which the sample size
was chosen, etc. This will ensure robustness of the findings of the opinion
polls. It has been established that opinion polls, irrespective of the manner in
which they are conducted, will always have a certain margin of error. This fact
should be made known to the public. Whether published in print media or
disseminated through electronic media, findings of opinion polls should
always carry a disclaimer that such findings are only predictions which would
necessarily have a certain margin of error. This would help ensure that the
public is not misled by the results of opinion polls.

<pre id="pre_24">F.     Recommendations

(i)    Expand scope of Section 126 of the RPA, 1951
8.27.1        Currently, as discussed above in Part 1 of this Chapter, the ban

other similar apparatus'. Since this Section is also used to limit the broadcast
of opinion polls and other similar content, the ban applies only to opinion polls
in the electronic and not the print media.
</p>
<p id="p_867">8.27.2       This anomaly in the applicability in the law relating to publication
of election matter must be rectified, particularly in an age where digital and

used in conducting the opinion polls and third, that the public is made

                              COMPULSORY VOTING

9.1            Provisions regarding voting have been enshrined in the RP Act
and the Indian Constitution, and describe the exercise as a 'right', instead of a
'duty'. Thus, s. 62 of the RP Act expressly talks about the "right to vote" and<a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_484"> s.
79(d)</a> clarifies that the "electoral right" of the voter includes the right to "vote or
refrain from voting at an election." Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_485">Article 326</a> of the Constitution,
while specifying that elections to the Parliament and the Legislative
Assemblies be conducted on the basis of adult suffrage, states that, "every
person who is a citizen of India... shall be entitled to be registered as a voter
at any such election." The characterisation of the decision to vote as a right,
instead of a duty, has received judicial support.377 For instance, in PUCL v
Union of India, the Supreme Court expressly clarified that the right to vote is a
"pure and simple statutory right."378

9.2            It is thus clear that the decision to vote is considered an exercise
of such a right, and is not a duty prescribed under Part IVA of the Constitution
on Fundamental Duties. However, compulsory voting refers to the practice of
making voting a duty - by requiring citizens of a country to partake in the
electoral process, whether by obliging them to vote or mark their attendance
at the polling place. It has been introduced in some parts of world, both in well
established and newly emerging democracies, with a bid to increase
participation in the democratic process. Recently, on 9 th November 2014,
Gujarat Governor Sri O.P. Kohli gave his assent to the Gujarat Local
Authorities Laws Bill, 2009, thus paving the way for introduction of compulsory
voting in India.
</p>
<p id="p_882">A. Compulsory Voting in India: History and Context

9.3             Compulsory voting was first considered by the Parliament in
1950 during the enactment of the RP Act. Nevertheless, citing practical
difficulties in implementation, it was rejected (led by members such as Dr.
B.R. Ambedkar).
</p>
<p id="p_883">9.4          Then the Dinesh Goswami Committee in 1990 considered the
question of making "voting compulsory" to increase voter turnouts. However,

377 In Lily Thomas v Speaker, Lok Sabha, (1993) 4 SCC 234, the Supreme Court held that
that "right to vote means right to exercise the right in favour of or against the motion or
resolution. Such a right implies right to remain neutral as well." In PUCL v Union of India,
(2003) 4 SCC 399, the Supreme Court stated, "The right to vote for the candidate of one's
choice is of the essence of democratic polity."

<p id="p_885"> the Committee rejected the idea based on "the practical difficulties involved in
its implementation".379

on Electoral Reforms again considered, and rejected the proposal for
compulsory voting, noting that it would "not be feasible or advisable at present
... [given that] in our situation, there may be several management and legal
enforceability problems and difficult questions of penalty for not voting."380

9.6            The Tarkunde Committee noted that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_168">       "We have seriously considered the desirability of making it compulsory
       for voters to cast their votes in these elections. It appears to us that
       compulsory voting may be resented by the voters and may on balance
       prove counter-productive. It is desirable that compliance with the duty
       to cast one's vote should be brought about by persuasion and political
       education, rather than compulsion. Moreover, the implementation of a
       law of compulsory voting is likely to be very difficult and may lead to
       abuse".381

9.7             Pursuant to this, the issue of compulsory voting was discussed
in Parliament in 2004 and 2009, when two Private Members Bill introduced a
bill to that effect. In 2004, Mr. B.S. Rawat introduced the Compulsory Voting
Bill, 2004 "to provide for compulsory voting by the electorate in the country
and for matters connected therewith, be taken into consideration."382 The Bill
was defeated by citing various arguments, inter alia, the coercive nature of the
provision; respecting the active decision of some voters to not engage with
the democratic process; the inability to reach the polling booths; personal
circumstances; and the difficulty of implementation. 383 In 2009, Mr. J.P.
</blockquote><p id="p_886">Agarwal tabled another bill on compulsory voting, requiring the State to
concomitantly provide polling booths at convenient locations and making
special arrangements for elderly, disabled, and pregnant voters.384 However,
the then Law Minister Mr. Moily cautioned against such a move observing that
it was coercive; difficult for the government to implement; and ignorant of
causes of non-voting such as illness, preoccupation, and use of force by
political parties. The Bill was later withdrawn.385

disconnect electricity and water supplies and levy fines on the defaulting

<p id="p_892">9.12.1        Arend Lijphart in his influential 1997 essay made two strong
arguments in favour of compulsory voting as a response to the "unequal
electoral participation" in America. These involved the effect of compulsory
voting in countering voter apathy by increasing turnout and in making the
electorate more politically aware and engaged.387 The underlying assumption

<p id="p_893"> here is that compulsory voting will result in increased voting and
consequently, more informed political participation and debate.
</p>
<p id="p_894">Increase in voter turnouts

9.12.2         On the first argument, it is relatively clear that compulsory voting
results in an increased turnout, with different studies pointing to an increase
between 7 to 17 percentage points. 388 A comprehensive cross-country
Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (hereinafter "IDEA") Study
reveals that the difference in voter turnouts between the 28 countries with
compulsory voting provisions on their statute books (regardless of
enforcement levels) and the 171 countries without such provisions is
7.37%.389

9.12.3        Nevertheless, an increase in participation is a direct corollary of
the severity and strict enforcement of sanctions. Studies have found that
levels of abstention in compulsory voting regimes are highest when the
quantum/type of penalty and the likelihood of its enforcement are high. 390
There are two major impediments arising from this penalty-enforcement
conundrum in the replication of such high levels of turnout in India - the
imposition of a heavy penalty, and being likely to enforce it.
</p>
<p id="p_895">9.12.4        The first is concerned with the determining the type of penalty.
The current law is silent on the form of sanction, and clearly leaves such
determination to the government. Consequently, it is unclear whether the
penalty will amount to unnecessary coercion (as the "inhumane" suggestion
before the Supreme Court in 2009 to cut off electricity and water supplies) or
merely an informal sanction. Examples of the former are found in Peru, where
defaulters cannot access certain government goods and services; Bolivia,
where they are not entitled to receive their salaries for three months; and
Belgium, where non-voters find it difficult to get a job in the public sector.391

<p id="p_897"> 9.12.5         Although currently unspecified, the penalties under discussion
include being disenfranchised; along with the possible denial of BPL cards,
driving licenses, passports, and other services. 392 Such measures are
extreme and will disproportionately and adversely affect the poor or
marginalised in India. The solution to non-voting as McMillan points out
"cannot be to remove people from the electoral process." 393 In fact, an
unintended consequence of such a measure is the disincentive on "qualified
voters" (which is yet undefined) from registering themselves on the voter
registration lists. Moreover, instead of specifying the penalty in the law, the
criminalisation of non-voting has been left to delegated legislation. This vests
great powers with the State, which can use it as a potential tool for
harassment. 394 Conversely, if the penalty amounts to informal sanction - a
mere slap on the wrist - then it will not act as a deterrent or have the desired
effect.
</p>
<p id="p_898">9.12.6         The second concern deals with the difficulty in implementation -
a concern voiced in various committee reports (Dinesh Goswami, National
Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution), Parliamentary
proceedings and Supreme Court decisions. Implementation (at a subsequent
national level) involves the Election Commission making the more than 800
million eligible voters aware of the new law making voting compulsory. The
Commission has to then expend time and resources in sending notices to
each of the non-voters, conduct hearings, and subsequently impose and
implement the stipulated penalties. Former Chief Election Commissioner S.Y.
Qureshi, terming the implementation "practically impossible", cautioned
against adding to the caseload of the already overburdened judicial system.
395 There are additional concerns regarding the registration process and faulty

electoral rolls - voters lists often have defects and have names missing, a fact
mentioned in the Parliamentary debates concerning Mr. J.P. Agarwal's
proposed Bill.396

<p id="p_903"> Improvement in the quality of political participation and debate

9.12.7        As the above section shows, compulsory voting might not have
an equivalent increase in voter turnout as much in India as other countries.
More importantly however, even guaranteeing higher voter turnout does not
guarantee greater voter participation, as understood in its true, substantive
sense. Many studies have shown that the "second order" effects of
compulsory voting, measured in terms of better civic engagement; increased
political knowledge and interest; and improved quality of participation, do not
follow the more-evident "first order" effects of greater turnout. 397

9.12.8          Thus, Engelen and Hooghe in their 2007 analysis of Belgian
election data concluded that compulsory voting did not produce any
"knowledge effects" amongst those who "voted to avoid sanction."398 Similarly,
an experiment in the 2007 Quebec provincial elections, where compulsory
voting was enforced through financial sanctions saw "little evidence of second
order effects".399 The researchers concluded, "though a sufficient motivator for
getting an uninformed voter to the polls, avoiding foregoing money cannot be
assumed to be a sufficient motivator for getting him or her to learn more about
politics". 400 Such a conclusion is supported by a 2007 study of British and
Australian voters, which found that Australian voters were not better informed
than their British counterparts about their political system, despite being
required by law to vote.401

9.12.9        Interestingly, although the Australian example is widely cited as
a successful model of compulsory voting, it has witnessed a high level (to the
tune of 1-3%) of "donkey voting", which occurs when apathetic voters simply
choose the first name on a ballot.402

 9.12.10     Thus, Kelley and McAllister in their 1984 study attributed the
donkey effect to giving an advantage of 1.3 percentage points to Australian
candidates with a surname in the first third of the alphabet; whereas, such
effects were not visible in the British elections, where there was no

<p id="p_907"> compulsory voting.403 Concerns about donkey voting led to the introduction of
random, instead of alphabetical, ballot ordering from 1984 in the Australian
House of Representatives elections.
</p>
<p id="p_908">9.12.11        To conclude, there is no evidence that individuals will seek out
more information in a bid to fulfil their voting obligations; and compulsory
voting will not necessarily improve the quality of civic engagement.
</p>
<p id="p_909">(ii)    Equality: Does compulsory voting ensure the enfranchisement of
        the weaker classes?
</p>
<p id="p_910">9.13           The participation argument for compulsory voting has an
associated equality dimension to it. The argument proceeds on the
assumption that voter apathy is more prevalent amongst the weaker,
marginalised socio-economic class and thus compulsory voting will ensure
that their voices get heard. Thus, compulsory voting was justified in Canada
"for boosting electoral turnout amongst the weakest in society"; 404 and in
Belgium "to avoid upper class citizens putting pressure on uneducated or poor
citizens not to vote in the elections". 405 However, such arguments are not
applicable in India, where it is the rich, who often do not exercise their voting
rights, and whose turnout is often lower than the poor.406

</p><p id="p_911">(iii)   Democracy:      Does    compulsory    voting    increase    the
        'representativeness' of the government or is it constitutionally
        untenable?
</p>
<p id="p_912">9.14.1        The democratic argument is premised on a substantive notion of
democracy where the elected government is truly representative of (all) the
people, and not just a "self-selecting few". Thus compulsory voting is seen as
increasing the "democratic degree" of elected assemblies.407

9.14.2      While democratic representativeness is a laudable goal,
compulsory voting is not the appropriate means of achieving it. Very simply,

<p id="p_914"> the government cannot "force-feed" democracy 408 by compelling people to
vote, because doing so violates the cornerstone of democracy and our
Constitution, which is freedom and individual choice. First, <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_486">Article 326</a> of the
Constitution makes it very clear that every citizen "shall be entitled to be
registered as a voter at any such election", thereby providing citizens with an
option of not registering themselves as voters. This is buttressed by ss. 62
and 79(d) of the RP Act that expressly talk about the "electoral right" of a
person as including the right to "vote or refrain from voting at an election". The
Supreme Court also talks about the "right" to vote,409 noting that, "the right to
vote for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of democratic
polity."410

9.14.3         Secondly, as the absence of the right to vote in the Fundamental
Duties prescribed in Part IVA make clear, the Constitution does cast any
"duty" on citizens. This is especially important given the government's failure
to act on the recommendations of Justice Verma's Committee Report of 1998
and the NCRWC's Report on Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles, and
Fundamental Duties to amend Part IVA, <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_487">Article 51-A</a> to include "duty to vote at
elections, actively participate in the democratic process of governance and to
pay taxes."411 At most voting can be considered a civic duty of every citizen;
but, to enforce it compulsorily is against the principles of an individual liberty.
</p>
<p id="p_915">9.14.4          Thirdly, compulsory voting violates the freedom of expression
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_488">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has
repeatedly recognised that there is a "fine distinction... between the right to
vote and the freedom of voting as a species of freedom of expression."412
Whereas the right to vote is a statutory right conferred only on the fulfilment of
certain criteria, the actual act of voting ("freedom of voting") is a manifestation
of the freedom of expression.413 Similarly, the Court in the NOTA judgment
clarified that, "a positive 'right not to vote' is a part of expression of a voter in a
parliamentary democracy and it has to be recognized and given effect to in
the same manner as 'right to vote'".414

<p id="p_919"> 9.14.5          The Supreme Court and other government functionaries have
recognised that voters' refrain from voting on account of various factors such
as the poor quality of candidates in the fray; 415 the opportunity cost of
foregoing a daily wage, or the forced homelessness due to riots or natural
disasters;416 the absence of an enabling environment due to problems with
electoral identity cards, and the difficulty in reaching the polling stations.417 In
such cases, "the decision taken by a voter after verifying the credentials of the
candidate either to vote or not is his right of expression under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_489">Article 19(1)(a)</a>
of the Constitution."418 Thus, coercing citizens to be involved in the democratic
process contravenes their freedom of expression, while also reeking of
"illiberalism".419

9.14.6         Finally, political science perspectives on the complexity of
democracies argue that democracies need to accommodate dissent and
diversity of views. This includes the option of disengagement, namely "rights
to abstain, to withhold assent, to refrain from making a statement or from
participating" if people believe "voting is mistaken, undesirable, unnecessary
or immoral."420

</p><p id="p_920">(iv)    Legitimacy: Does compulsory voting increase the legitimacy of
        elected governments?
</p>
<p id="p_921">9.15.1         The legitimacy argument is connected to the democracy
argument above and posits that elected governments have a stronger
mandate, and hence, greater legitimacy, when more people (or the entire
population) comes out to vote. A corollary of greater participation and political
engagement is the increased accountability of elected representatives, which
only serves to strengthen the government's responsiveness, and thus
legitimacy.421

415 PUCL 2013, at para 37 states, "A voter may refrain from voting at an election for several
reasons including the reason that he does no consider any of the candidates in the field
worthy of his vote."

<p id="p_926"> 9.15.2         Nevertheless, such an argument (erroneously) assumes that
increased participation results in increased political engagement and that
voters will responsibly exercise their new duty to vote. As the "donkey voting"
phenomenon in Australia illustrates, compulsory voting can mask electoral
apathy and create an "illusion of participation",422 whereas legitimacy depends
on a genuine desire to engage with the system.
</p>
<p id="p_927">(v)         Other arguments for and against compulsory voting

9.16.1        Some other arguments espousing compulsory voting highlight
the improvement in public awareness and financial benefits because
resources generally utilised in convincing people to vote are instead focussed
on campaigning on substantive issues. Such opinions fail to consider the cost
of raising awareness about a change in the law and the heavy cost of
implementing (registration, sending notices, conducting show-cause hearings,
adjudicating, and appeals) and enforcing (based on the yet-undefined penalty)
compulsory voting provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_928">9.16.2         More importantly, however, they fail to consider that compulsory
voting hides the problem (and reasons) for voter disengagement, instead of
confronting it. Various courts and committees have alluded to the causes for
voter disillusionment (discussed above), and the need to focus on education
and awareness campaigns that emphasise the importance of voting as a civic
duty. As the then Law Minister of State, Mr. K. Venkatapathy noted while
arguing against Mr. Rawat's Compulsory Voting Bill in Parliament in 2003:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_169">            "... such a participation [in the democratic process] should better come
            out from the people voluntarily rather than by coercion or allurements.
            A sense of duty in this regard should inform the people on their own
            and it is this sense of duty which should be the motivating factor in
            impelling people to turn up at the polling stations in larger numbers."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_929">9.16.3        Instead of seeking a quick fix, or an ornamental change in the
law, politicians should pursue a strong reform agenda focusing on
decriminalisation of politics; inner party democracy; campaign finance reform,
including the removal of black money; and introducing accountability of
elected representatives. Thus, instead of seeking persuasion by compulsion,
the government should seek persuasion by education and action.

<p id="p_931"> 9.16.4        Interestingly, many have suggested incentive schemes such as
tax rebates or financial benefits 423 to boost electoral participation as an
alternative to criminalising non-voting. Besides being financially burdensome
and hard to administer, introducing money in the voting calculus
fundamentally changes the nature of the right to vote, and the civic duty of
voting. As Michael Sandel persuasively argues money "crowds out" and
erodes important non-market norms of democratic participation and common
good, which should guide our decision to vote. 424

9.16.5        This section has analysed the arguments in favour of and
against compulsory voting to conclude that the latter outweigh the former.
Why then is it common in some parts of the world? The next section analyses
compulsory voting from a comparative perspective to conclude that the
phenomenon is not as pervasive as it appears and international models will
not work in India.

<pre id="pre_25">C.      Compulsory Voting: A Comparative Perspective

9.17           Compulsory voting is currently present in the statute books in 28
</pre><p id="p_932">countries, 425 although such a figure does not give a true picture of the level of
enforcement, which is even lower. Thus, most studies estimate that around 14
countries current enforce compulsory voting provisions. These include many
small countries such as Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Nauru, and one
canton in Switzerland; and others such as Australia, Brazil, Ecuador,
Singapore, Peru, and Uruguay.426 In fact, Dr. Lisa Hill and Jonathon Louth talk
about how the list of countries currently enforcing compulsory voting is
reduced to six, if limited to those with a "history of well-established democratic
norms". 427

9.18 Nor does the 28 countries figure indicate the trend towards which
countries globally are moving. For instance, the fact that both Italy (1993) and
the Netherlands (1967) have abolished compulsory voting; and others such as
Liechtenstein and Greece have moved from a strict to a not-strict or non-
enforcement of compulsory voting laws respectively has lead IDEA to
question:

might help push electoral turnout up."

        "Is compulsory voting a dying phenomenon" in western Europe?
<p id="p_937">       Perhaps in a few years it will only be kept as a 'ghost' in countries'
       constitutions, without any intention to enforce it."428

9.19            Most recently, Fiji abandoned compulsory voting in 2014, Chile
in 2012, and Austria (the last remaining Tyrol district) abolished it in 2004.
Others such as Egypt, Greece, Mexico, Paraguay, and Thailand have stopped
enforcing it.429 When Netherlands abolished compulsory voting in 1967, it did
so citing three reasons - first, the right to vote was a right, which every citizen
could decide whether to exercise or not. Secondly, sanctions against
defaulters were hard to effectively enforce in practice; and finally, tasking
parties with the responsibility of attracting voters would ensure that the
resultant turn out was a better reflection of voters' interest and engagement
with politics.430

9.20           Amongst the countries still enforcing compulsory voting
provisions, most (excluding Australia where defaulters pay a fine) impose
strict penalties. Thus, in Peru, voters must carry their stamped voting card to
obtain certain goods and social services from some public offices.431

9.21          In Brazil, failure to vote results in the imposition of a fine. Failure
to pay the fine however, entitles the State to impose a range of sanctions
including being prohibited from applying for any public position; from receiving
a salary from a public post; from sitting certain professional exams; and from
obtaining a passport, identity card, certain types of loans, and teaching
licenses in public educational institutions432

9.22           In Belgium, failure to vote in four elections within 15 years
results in the disenfranchisement for ten years. But even apart from that, non-
voters might find it difficult to get jobs in the public sector; or if they are civil
servants, be disentitled to any promotion.433

9.23          As discussed above, penalising non-voters by penalising their
poverty (such as in Brazil for failure to pay the fine) or restricting their access
to government services and benefits (such as in Belgium and Peru) are
extremely harsh measures and will not work in the Indian context, with its vast
poverty and unemployment. Conversely, if the fine is too low, then it will only
affect the poor and not change the behaviour of the rich, who do constitute a

                             ELECTION PETITIONS

      A. History

10.1           <a href="/doc/34511/" id="a_490">Article 329(b)</a> of the Constitution provides for the election
petition to be presented to the authority prescribed by law.
</p>
<p id="p_945">10.2           Initially, <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_491">Article 324(1)</a> of the Constitution specified that ECI shall
be vested with the authority for appointing election tribunals to decide
election-related disputes. Consequently, section 81 of the RPA required all
election petitions to be presented to the ECI, which had the power under
<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_492">section 86</a> to appoint election tribunals. In 1956, the composition of these
tribunals was changed from three members, comprising sitting or retired
district judges or advocates with 10 years standing to a single member, being
a sitting or retired district judge. Nevertheless, the ECI found this system
ineffective, given the inordinate delay in the trial of election petitions, caused
partly due to the regular challenge of the tribunals' interlocutory orders before
the High Courts vide Articles 226-227, and sometimes even before the
Supreme Court.434

10.3           This led to the amendment of <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_493">Article 324(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_494">sections 81</a> and
<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_495">86</a>, RPA by the Constitution (Nineteenth Amendment) Act, 1966 and the
<a href="/doc/192048/" id="a_496">Representation of People (Amendment) Act</a>, 1966 respectively to remove the
ECI's jurisdiction to hear election petitions and vest it with (ordinarily) a single
judge of the High Court435 vide the newly inserted <a href="/doc/436750/" id="a_497">section 80A</a>, RPA. The aim
was to expedite the disposal of election petitions, as is evident from <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_498">section
86(7)</a>, which envisages an endeavour to conclude the trial within six months.
<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_499">Section 86</a> provides that the Chief Justice will refer the election petition
presented before the High Court to the judge or one of the judges assigned by
them for the 'trial' of election petitions. Although in 1975 the Constitution was
further amended to insert <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_500">Article 329A</a> to stipulate that election petitions
relating to the Prime Minister or the Lok Sabha Speaker would be filed before
the ECI and tried by a special authority consisting of a sitting Supreme Court
judge, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_501">Article 329A</a> was deleted in 1978.436

Ishaque, 10 ELR 216 on the issue of interlocutory challenge and <a href="/doc/34511/" id="a_502">Article 329(b).</a>
435 In Krishnan Gopal v Prakash Chandra, AIR 1974 SC 209, the Supreme Court held that a

retired High Court judge, requested by the Chief Justice of the High Court to serve as judge
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_503">Article 224A</a>, and whose appointment was consented to by the President, could also
hear election petitions. However, the Supreme Court expressed a preference for a permanent
judge of the High Court.

<p id="p_947">       B. Formalistic Nature of the Current Procedure of Filing a
         Petition

10.4           Unfortunately, the filing and trial of election petitions remains a
very formalistic procedure and moreover, differs amongst High Courts. The
matter is made worse because some states, such as Maharashtra and Goa,
have a common High Court; whereas some High Courts have different
benches in the same State. Additionally, different High Courts have different
rules prescribing the bench to which the election petition can be filed -
whether the Principal Seat of the High Court, or the bench within whose
exclusive jurisdiction the particular contested election was conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_948">10.5            For instance, Mendiratta in his book talks about how an election
petition filed before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court relating to
an election in Rae Bareli (which fell under the principal seat of the High
Court's jurisdiction) was dismissed as being non-maintainable because it was
not filed in constituency in which the election was conducted, namely Rae
Bareli. Moreover, even the application for transferring the petition to Rae
Bareli was dismissed as non-maintainable because of the exclusive
jurisdiction of both benches and the expiry of the limitation period. 437
Conversely, in Madhya Pradesh for instance, all election petitions are to be
filed before the principal Bench in Jabalpur. Consequently, the Gwalior Bench
of the High Court returned an election petition filed challenging an election in
Gwalior; and when the petition was filed the next day before the principal
Bench in Jabalpur, it was dismissed as being time-barred. The Supreme
Court upheld this decision.438

10.6          The time limit within which an election petition has to be
presented under <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_504">section 81(1)</a>, RPA is 45 days and the petition need not be
presented only to a judge in open court. It can also be presented to the
administrative or ministerial staff of the High Court on the same day. 439
Nevertheless, any delay in presenting the petition will result in its summary
dismissal vide <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_505">section 86</a>,<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_506">440</a> unless the limitation period expires during the
vacation time of the Court. 441 In fact, the High Courts do not have the

 discretion, ordinarily accorded to them vide <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_507">section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, to
condone the delay in filing the petition. This ruling was premised on the idea
that the RPA is a self-contained code to which the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_508">Limitation
Act</a> do not apply.442

10.7           Regular rules of impleading proper parties do not apply to
election petitions under the RPA. The Supreme Court in Jyoti Basu v Debi
Ghosal443 rejected the petitioner's impleadment of Jyoti Basu for his alleged
collusion with the returned candidate to commit certain corrupt practices on
the ground<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_509"> ss. 82</a> and <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_510">86(4)</a> only permitted candidates as respondents to an
election petition. The Court's rationale was that the concept of proper parties
"is and must remain alien to an election dispute" under the RPA because such
disputes must be confined between the petitioner and candidates of elections.
Thus, any person, including the ECI or other election authorities, even if
proper parties, cannot be joined as respondents.444

10.8         On the other hand, non-joinder of a candidate who is a
necessary party to the election petitions will result in its summary dismissal
vide <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_511">section 86(1)</a> and the provisions of the CPC, permitting the subsequent
impleadment of parties, cannot be used as a curative method. Thus, once
there is a non-joinder of a necessary party, the election petition cannot be
amended in any manner to remedy the defect. 445 This rule applies even when
there is an allegation of corrupt practice against a candidate who has not
been joined in the petition as required by <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_512">section 82(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_513">446</a> regardless of
whether the respondent(s) have condoned this non-compliance or have failed
or been delayed in pointing out this defect.447

10.9         <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_514">Section 86(1)</a>, RPA also statutorily obliges the High Court to
summarily dismiss an improperly presented election petition (the rules of
which vary according to each High Court) under <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_515">sections 81</a> or 82. Election
petitions have to be presented by the petitioner personally and cannot be
presented by or through their advocates. 448 Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_516">section 81(3)</a>
necessitates each petition to be accompanied by as many copies as there are

had issued a notification declaring that it would remain open to hear election petitions in the
summer.

election petition, or at the very least within the stipulated 45 days to avoid
summary dismissal under <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_517">section 86</a>. In Satya Narain v Dhuja Ram, 449 the
Deputy Registrar of the High Court gave the petitioner certain time, which
went beyond the limitation period, to file the required number of copies of his
petition. However, despite filing the additional copies within the time limit
prescribed by the Deputy Registrar, the High Court, and subsequently the
Supreme Court dismissed the election petition in limine, ruling that the Deputy
Registrar lacked the requisite authority to grant time. In addition, <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_518">section 81(3)</a>
requires the petitioner to attest each copy of the election petition under their
own signature as a true copy. Any signature by the petitioner's advocate,
instead of the petitioner, results in the in limine dismissal of the election
petition. 450 Similarly, having served a copy of the election petition to the
respondent with one extra page than was presented before the High Court,
the same cannot be subsequently rectified and results in the in limine
dismissal of the petition.451 Subsequently however, the Supreme Court has
relaxed the rigid compliance with <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_519">section 81(3)</a> noting that some defects in the
supply of true copies, such as the absence of stamp/seal/signature or
attestation by the notary, are curable.452

10.10          Section 86 of the RPA also obliges the High Court to summarily
dismiss an election petition for non-compliance with <a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_520">section 117</a>'s requirement
of a security deposit of Rs. 2000. The High Court is not permitted to reduce or
dispense with the amount of the deposit.453 Nor does <a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_521">section 117</a> statutorily
permit the Court to grant an extension, as it deems reasonable, to give the
petitioner enough time to collect the requisite Rs. 2000 as security for costs to
ensure compliance.

<p id="p_966"> it finds that the High Court has improperly or (gravely) erroneously appraised
or appreciated the evidence,456 thus requiring the apex Court to correct the
injustice.457

10.12         The statutory right to appeal was introduced pursuant to the
1966 amendment to the RPA. Before that, the decision of the election tribunal
was final and conclusive under<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_526"> s. 105</a>, RPA, although in 1956, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_527">section 116A</a>
was introduced to allow appeals to High Courts.458 The position today is that a
Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court can only be filed against the
High Court's interlocutory, 459 and not its final order. 460 Additionally, the
Supreme Court can summarily dismiss an election appeal, although such
powers should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.461 Ordinarily
though, the appeal is treated as a matter of right. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_528">Section 116A(2)</a> also
specifies a limitation period of 30 days, although the Supreme Court may
condone the delay in filing the appeal if "if it is satisfied that the appellant had
sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period."
</p>
<p id="p_967">10.13          Section 116B of the RPA provides for a stay of the operation of
the order of the High Court under appeal. In Indira Gandhi v Raj Narain,462 the
Supreme Court clarified the permissible conditions of stay, when it suspended
the disqualification imposed upon the appellant as a consequence of the High
Court's order vide <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_529">section 8A</a>; and permitted her to sign the Parliamentary
Register, and attend the Lok Sabha's sessions on the condition that she
would not participate in the House's proceedings nor vote nor draw
remuneration in her capacity as MP. However, for all other purposes, the
appellant was to remain an MP.463


      D. Drawbacks in the Present System

10.14         There are three primary drawbacks in the current system of filing
election petitions, namely the non-uniform and formalistic procedure for
presenting the petition, the inordinate delay in the trial of the election petition,

"Independently of the restrictions under para III on her Membership of the Lok Sabha, her
rights as Prime Minister or Minister, so long as she fills that office, to speak in and otherwiseto
take part in the proceedings of either House of Parliament or a joint sitting of the Houses

<p id="p_971"> and the system of appeals on any question of law or fact that renders an
appeal almost automatic.
</p>
<p id="p_972">10.15          First, the current procedure of filing election petitions differs
amongst various High Courts - it varies from requiring the petitioner to file the
petition before the Principal Seat of the High Court or the bench within whose
exclusive jurisdiction the particular contested election was conducted. This
issue is particular to those states, which share a common High Court (such as
Maharashtra and Goa) and those Courts that have different benches, such as
Tamil Nadu. The difference in procedures was brought out above, by citing
the examples of the Allahabad and Madhya Pradesh High Courts from
Mendiratta's book. This is sought to be remedied by amending<a href="/doc/436750/" id="a_530"> s. 80A</a>, RPA to
provide that in such instances, the election petition shall be filed before the
Principal Seat of the relevant High Court, while retaining the High Courts'
existing discretion to decide to shift the hearing to another bench in the
interests of justice or convenience.
</p>
<p id="p_973">10.16         Secondly, on the parties to the petition,<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_531"> s. 82</a> currently requires a
petitioner, who is claiming a declaration that they or any other candidate had
been duly elected, to implead all the contesting candidates in the petition.
However, to implead those candidates who had lost their security deposits,
and hence, have no chance of being declared duly elected, only constitutes a
waste of time and resources of both the petition and these candidates. Hence,
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_532">section 82</a> on the parties to the petition should be amended to reflect this
concern.
</p>
<p id="p_974">10.17          Thirdly, the final formalistic nature in the trial of the election
petition is evident in<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_533"> s. 86</a>'s mandate to summarily dismiss the election petition
for non-compliance with the provisions of<a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_534"> s. 117</a>, RPA on the security of costs.
The rationale behind summary dismissal for non-compliance with the forty-five
day time limit under<a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_535"> s. 81</a> and the requisite number of copies under<a href="/doc/330065/" id="a_536"> s. 83</a> is to
ensure speedy trial and disposal of the petition. For instance, until the
petitioner does not submit as many copies of the petition as respondents, as
required under<a href="/doc/330065/" id="a_537"> s. 83</a>, the High Court is unable to issue notice to these
respondents and hence trial cannot commence. Similarly, granting unfettered
discretion to extend the time period beyond the stipulated the forty-five day
time limit to file the election petition under<a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_538"> s. 81</a> can lead to interminable
delays. However, unlike these instances, the election trial can continue even if
the petitioner delays in filing the security for costs. Therefore,<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_539"> s. 86</a> should not
permit a summary dismissal on those grounds and instead<a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_540"> s. 117</a> should be
amended to allow the Court to grant an extension of time, as it deems
reasonable, to comply with<a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_541"> s. 117</a> and dismiss the petition only on the failure
to deposit the security for costs within this extended period. However, it is
pertinent to note that currently<a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_542"> s. 117</a> provides only for a deposit of Rs. 2000,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_216">                                                                               175</span>
 which is too low and has not been amended since 1996. Hence, the deposit
amount should also increase to Rs. 10,000 in line with inflation.
</p>
<p id="p_975">10.18        Fourthly, currently election petitions are inordinately delayed, a
fact recognised by the 4th ARC Report on Ethics, which stated that "such
petitions remain pending for years and in the meanwhile, even the full term of
the house expires thus rendering the election petition infructuous."464

10.19           To understand the extent of delay in the conclusion of trial, it is
instructive to look at some facts and figures. The dissolution of the 15 th Lok
Sabha in February 2014 rendered infructuous 25 election petitions that were
pending before the High Court challenging the poll victories of many MPs. 465
These petitions, required to be filed within 45 days of the election results
under<a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_543"> s. 81</a>, RPA, and endeavoured to be tried as expeditiously as possible,
within six months under<a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_544"> s. 86(7)</a>, were in fact pending for nearly five years.
Nevertheless, based on RTIs filed with the ECI, the Economic Times reported
that of the 110 election petitions filed after the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections,
none had been decided within six months. In at least 21 petitions, the trial was
concluded only after three years. The Economic Times also found that in
many cases, the appeal was stalled in the Supreme Court, thus denying the
petitioner efficacious relief.466

10.20       The NCRWC in its 2001 presented the following table regarding
the pendency and disposal of election petitions:467

10.21         Part of the problem lies in the continuous adjournments sought
</pre><p id="p_978">(despite the stipulations in <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_545">section 86(6)</a>, RPA), the low priority accorded by
the High Court in conducting and concluding the entire trial, and the almost
automatic appeal (on both questions of fact and law) and stay application filed
against a High Court's interim or final order. This results in cases such as
Sushma Swaraj's, whose 2009 Lok Sabha election was challenged by Raj
Kumar Patel. Ms. Swaraj subsequently challenged the maintainability of the
petition, and it took the High Court approximate four years to reject Ms.
Swaraj's application in December 2013. Pursuant to this, she filed an interim
application (an SLP) before the Supreme Court, 468 which was finally
dismissed as being infructuous because of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in
May 2014. 469 Similarly, Congress MLA, P. Veldurai's election to the Tamil
Nadu Assembly (Cheranmahadevi constituency) in 2006 was set aside by the
Supreme Court in 2011, five years later when he was campaigning for the
next assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.470

10.22          These instances and the above facts reveal how inordinate
delays defeat the purpose of filing an election petition to challenge the poll
victory of the returned candidate. This in turn renders the right to vote illusory
when election petitions, the only remedial mechanism provided to the ordinary
voter against corrupt practices, are decided or dismissed after a majority or
the entire assembly/parliamentary period has passed. Such a delay is
detrimental to democracy, undermines the faith of the people in the electoral

<p id="p_980"> and judicial process and therefore, requires courts to give election petitions
absolute priority. However, the Goswami Committee's proposal for ad hoc
judges to clear the backlog does not address the underlying causes for delay
and hence is not preferable.
</p>
<p id="p_981">10.23          One method of achieving this could be through an amendment
to the law requiring strict abidance with the six-month stipulation in the RPA
and to set up a permanent "election bench" to only deal with election petitions,
a modification of the British 'election court' system described below. The delay
is also partly a result of the overburdening of judges with other work, and the
pressure caused by the pendency, which results in High Court judges
reducing the priority in conducting election trials, since they take time and
effort. Similar recommendations were made to constitute "special courts" or
"election benches" designated for election petitions in the High Court by the
NCRWC; 471 "special tribunals" under <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_546">Article 323B</a> comprising a High Court
judge and a senior civil servant were recommended by the 4 th ARC.472 The
Goswami Committee on the other hand endorsed the appointment of ad hoc
judges to relieve the regular judges from their normal duty so as to entrust
them with the hearing of the election petitions.473 Moreover, similar to the Law
Commission's recommendations to ensure expedited disposal under the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_547">Arbitration Act</a> and the Commercial Courts Act in its 246th and 253rd Report
respectively, the RPA should be amended to provide for daily hearings,
minimum adjournments, time limits for filing written statements and case
management.
</p>
<p id="p_982">10.24           In this context, it may be mentioned here that the Supreme
Court of India, in a judgment pronounced on 27 February 2015, in the matter
of <a href="/doc/111378360/" id="a_548">Mohd. Akbar vs. Ashok Sahu &amp; Ors</a> 474 deemed it desirable to have
dedicated Benches created by the Chief Justice of each High Court to deal
with the election petitions exclusively. As the tenure of the members of the
Parliament and Legislative Assemblies are relatively short, the Supreme Court
felt it desirable that the disputes relating to election are resolved as early as
possible. The Supreme Court attributed various reasons for this, such as:

<p id="p_986">                undesirable. Such continuance affords an opportunity to such a
               member to take part in the law making process affecting the
               destinies of the people.
</p><p id="p_987">       (ii)    Even from the point of view of the contesting candidates, unless
               the rights and the obligations are decided within a reasonable
               time, the adjudication and the consequences of the adjudication
               may eventually remain on paper without any tangible effect
               insofar as the participation of such parties in the legislative
               process.
</p>
<p id="p_988">       13.    However, we are sad to state that invariably the resolution of
       election disputes in this country takes unacceptably long periods in
       most of the cases. Very rarely an election dispute gets resolved during
       the tenure of the declared candidate reducing the adjudicatory process
       into a mockery of justice. Such delay coupled with a right of appeal to
       this Court makes the whole process of adjudication a task in a good
       number of cases. The reasons are many, we will only mention few:
</p>
<pre id="pre_27">       (i)     .....
       (ii)    .....
</pre><p id="p_989">       (iii)   The absence of dedicated Benches in the High Court for
               resolution of the election disputes is another factor which
               contributes enormously to the delay in the adjudicatory process."
</p>
<p id="p_990">10.25          Fifthly, on a related note, while efforts at reducing delay focus on
expediting trial, there is no regulation of the time limit within which courts have
to pass an order after the conclusion of arguments. This is no different in the
RPA and thus, for the first time, the Law Commission is recommending such a
time limit.
</p>
<p id="p_991">10.26           Sixthly, the delay in the conclusion of trial extends to the delay
caused by the inevitable filing of appeal in the Supreme Court, both as a
regular appeal on fact and law provided under<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_549"> s. 116A</a> and an interlocutory
appeal filed as an SLP. The order of the High Court is subsequently stayed,
permitting the returned candidate to remain an MP/MLA subject to certain
restrictions. In many cases as noticed above, the petition finally becomes
infructuous with the dissolution of the Parliament or Legislative Assembly.
Hence,<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_550"> s. 116A</a> has to be amended to remove any appeal on fact, and to
remove the unfettered discretion of the courts in accepting an appeal filed
after limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_992">10.27         Finally, it is difficult to reform the current system of election trials
unless there is adequate information available on the extent of the problem -

       E. Comparative Practices

10.28        The IDEA Institute has developed a set of guidelines on the
conduct and challenge of elections reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_170">         "The legal framework should provide that every voter, candidate and political
          party has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent electoral body or
          court when an infringement of electoral rights is alleged to have occurred.
         The law must require that the appropriate electoral body or court render a
          prompt decision to avoid the aggrieved party losing his or her electoral right.
         The law must provide a right of appeal to an appropriate higher level of
          electoral body or court with authority to review and exercise final jurisdiction
          in the matter. The decision of the court of last resort must be issued promptly.</blockquote>
<p id="p_993">         The legal framework should provide for timely deadlines for the consideration
          and determination of a complaint and the communication of the decision to
          the complainant."475

10.29          The Venice Commission or the European Commission for
Democracy through Law is another international body dealing with
constitutional law, including election related procedures. More specifically, it is
the independent consultative body of the Commission of Europe with
independent experts as members. Item II.3.3 of the Venice Commission's
Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters stipulates the primary principles
governing the process for filing an election petition to challenge an election, or
for failure to comply with the electoral law. On the question of challenge,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_551"> the
Code</a> states:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_171">          "If the electoral law provisions are to be more than just words on a
          page, failure to comply with the electoral law must be open to
          challenge before an appeal body. This applies in particular to the
          election results .... There are two possible solutions:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_172">                appeals may be heard by the ordinary courts, a special court or
                  the constitutional court;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_173">                appeals may be heard by an electoral commission... the
                  commissions are highly specialised whereas the courts tend to
                  be less experienced with regard to electoral issues. As a
                  precautionary measure, however, it is desirable that there
                  should be some form of judicial supervision in place, making the
                  higher commission the first appeal level and the competent court
                  the second."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_174">10.30         The Code further emphasises the importance of keeping the
time limits to lodge appeals and issue rulings as short as possible, keeping
the procedure simple, eliminating formalism to "avoid decisions of

<p id="p_994"> inadmissibility", granting wide standing, clearly specifying the jurisdiction of
different courts/tribunals and the appeal powers.476

10.31         Finally, the third international body regulating the resolution of
election disputes is the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights
(hereinafter "ODIHR"), the specialist institution in the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe dealing with election matters and election
observations. In its Resolving Election Disputes report, the ODHIR makes the
following observations with respect to the prompt resolution of disputes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_175">       "Considering that the conduct of an election requires prompt decisions
       and actions within a pre-determined timeframe, the procedures
       governing election disputes should differ from those provided for
       general civil disputes. This could be reflected in shorter deadlines and
       a single appeal process, which can be justified so long as sufficient
       time is provided to file complaints and appeals... For each phase or
       facet of the electoral process (such as voter registration or the validity
       of the candidatures), the electoral law should expressly and
       systematically set deadlines for filing complaints and appeals by which
       either the courts or the electoral bodies must reach a decision."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_995">10.32        ODIHR lays down a time period of two months to determine all
complaints and appeals because of its emphasis on ensuring that election
outcomes are not delayed and recognises the ability to challenge election
outcomes as an arguably integral part of the right to free elections under
<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_552">Article 3</a> of the First Protocol to the ECHR. 477 The ODIHR in addition
delineates certain general principles along the lines articulated above.
</p>
<p id="p_996">10.33         Apart from these international principles, it in instructive to look
at the system in a similar parliamentary democracy, namely the United
Kingdom. Election disputes in the UK are resolved by an election petition
process before an election court, which comprises two judges of the Queen's
Bench Division, who are on rota for the trial of parliamentary election petitions.
The election court has the same jurisdiction, power and authority as the High
Court; it conducts a full trial, including determining the prevalence of corrupt
practices, concluding with a certified determination to the Speaker of the

</p>
<p id="p_998">10.34          The procedure for challenging an election in the UK differs from
India in the following significant aspects:479

         "The election court is not a "standing" court or a division of the High
          Court permanently in existence. Instead it is a temporary court (usually)
          constituted in the constituency where the particular election was
          conducted, 480 and once it has concluded its task of deciding the
          petition, the election court cannot revisit or add to its decision
          subsequently. 481
         The returning officer is deemed to be a respondent to the election
          petition if the administration of the election is under question, although
          they are not allowed to bring a petition.482
         The Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division fixes security for
          costs, although usually the initial cost of bringing a parliamentary
          election petition is over £5,000.483
         The election petition must be filed within 21 days of the date of return,
          although there is "limited power to extend [this] time" period.484 Similar
          to India, courts have regarded compliance with time limits, formal
          requirements and security for costs as "mandatory", with no discretion
          to extend time (under the Civil Procedure Rules) or relax the
          requirements even under exceptional circumstances.485 Nevertheless,
          in a case concerning the extension of time under the Election Petition
          Rules (instead of the 1983 RPA), the High Court granted the same
          citing the disproportionate relation of mandatory time limits to the
          legitimate aim of securing speedy redress of election disputes.486

<p id="p_1003">          No appeal can be filed on a question of fact, although questions of law
          can be appealed via a "special case" to the High Court.487 A judicial
          review is also available for any error in law.488
         The election court has a mixture of inquisitorial (it can call and examine
          witnesses unilaterally) and quasi-criminal (the role of the Director of
          Public Prosecutions and the court's duty to report corrupt or illegal
          practices) characteristics."
</p>
<p id="p_1004">10.35         In a bid to simply and expedite the process of challenging the
electoral process or alleging that candidates committed electoral offences,
which can take up to two years to decide, 489 the UK Election Commission
assessed the election challenge procedure on two grounds - accessibility and
transparency; and the proceedings - promptness, sanctions, and appeal.
Along with the Law Commission, it has made the following recommendations:
</p>
<p id="p_1005">On accessibility and transparency,490

         Locus standi should be granted widely to facilitate the challenge of
          election outcomes and the UK RPA, 1983 should be amended to clarify
          the grounds of challenge and the scope of the election court's
          jurisdiction.491
         Challenge procedures should be simplified and a formalistic approach,
          rendering election petitions inadmissible for procedural errors, should
          be avoided.
</p><p id="p_1006">         The cost of challenging an election should be none, or should be kept
          to a minimum to prevent deterring citizens from filing election petitions.
         A clear, coherent, consistent, and uniform body of law across different
          elections should govern the resolution of election disputes.
         The challenge process should be transparent and easy to understand.
         Citing the Election Commission's call for simpler and more accessible
          process of challenging elections, the Law Commission has criticised
          the "strict formality and general complexity of election petitions [that]
          constitute a high bar to access to the courts." It has further suggested
          that petitions should only be filed if they affect the outcome of the
          election.492

The proceedings - promptness, sanctions, and appeal493

<p id="p_1011">          A decision on the challenge should ideally be given within two months,
          subject to exceptional circumstances.
</p><p id="p_1012">         In the event of a successful challenge, appropriate sanctions such as
          annulment of election results and holding fresh elections should be
          permissibly authorised.
</p><p id="p_1013">         Instead of the current provision only permitting the filing of a judicial
          review, the electoral law should provide a statutory right to appeal to a
          body capable of reviewing and exercising final jurisdiction in the matter.
          The appeal should be decided promptly.
</p><p id="p_1014">         There should be a clear demarcation of the jurisdiction of the courts
          based on the type of case being heard.
</p>
<p id="p_1015">10.36           In the United States, the system is vastly different, and
contested election and recount rules vary by States, election types, criteria
and procedures such as standing, procedures, grounds, and security
deposits.494 Further, Article I, Section 5 of the US Constitution states that that
each House shall be the judge of its own elections, returns, and qualifications
of members. Thus, the House is entitled to judge contested elections involving
its seats, and is not bound by agreement of the parties or decisions of state
tribunals, with its determination as to the right to the seat being final and non-
justiciable. 495 At the federal level, election disputes are governed by the
Federal Contested Elections Act, 1969, 2 USC §§ 381 that lays down the
procedure by which defeated candidates may have their claim to the seat be
adjudicated by the House.

                    NOTA AND THE RIGHT TO REJECT

      A. History and Context Leading Up to the Supreme Court's
         Decision in the NOTA Case

11.1            The proposal to introduce negative voting to reject all the
candidates if voters found them unsuitable was first discussed by the Law
Commission in its 170th Report in 1999, as part of its "alternative method of
election" where candidates would only be declared elected if they obtained
50%+1 of all the valid votes cast. Although agreeable with the 50%+1 idea, on
which negative voting was predicated, 496 the Commission citing practical
difficulties did not issue any final recommendations on the topic of negative
voting.
</p>
<p id="p_1052">11.2           The ECI supported the similar introduction of a negative vote,
first in 2001, under James Lyngdoh as the CEC, and then in 2004 under T.S.
Krishnamurthy, in its proposed electoral reforms report. The ECI was
concerned that the introduction of EVMs and the implementation of Rule 49O
of the Election Rules had made it impossible to protect the secrecy of voting
for those who wanted to abstain. Consequently, they proposed a legislative
amendment to Rules 22 and 49B of the Election Rules to introduce "NOTA"
as an option.497 The Background Paper on Electoral Reforms prepared by the
Legislative Department of the Law Ministry in 2010 also favoured the
introduction of negative voting, unlike the NCRWC that found it either
"impracticable or unnecessary."498

11.3          Given the inaction on the government's part, the People's Union
for Civil Liberties filed a PIL on this issue in 2004. In 2013 thereafter, the
Supreme Court struck down Rules 41(2) &amp;(3) and 49O of the Election Rules
as being ultra vires section 128 of the RPA and <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_571">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the
Constitution to the extent they violated the secrecy of voting.499 Citing <a href="/doc/1415706/" id="a_572">section
128</a>, RPA and Rules 39(1), 41, 49M and 49O of the Election Rules, the Court

496 "The requirement of 50%+1 of the vote can be implemented without implementing the idea
of negative vote simultaneously, though the idea of negative vote, as explained in the working
paper, cannot be implemented without implementing the idea of 50%+1 vote." LCI, 170th
Report, supra note 108, at para 9.29.

49-O undoubtedly violates that requirement"
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_231">                                                                                         190</span>
<p id="p_1055"> noted that the "secrecy of casting vote is duly recognised and is necessary for
strengthening democracy" to maintain the purity of elections.500 Consequently,
given that the right to vote and the right not to vote had been statutorily
recognised, the Court held that secrecy had to be maintained regardless of
whether voters decide to cast or not cast their votes. The Court also relied on
international principles governing the right to secrecy as an integral part of
voting and free elections under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_573">Article 21(3)</a> of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_574">Article 25(b)</a> of the ICCPR. It therefore ruled that voters
should have the option of rejecting all candidates who were standing for
elections in their constituency and directed the ECI to include the option of
NOTA in all Electronic Voting Machines.
</p>
<p id="p_1056">11.4           The premise of the Supreme Court's decision was that secrecy
of voting is crucial to maintain the purity of the electoral system.
Consequently, introducing NOTA, by guaranteeing the secrecy in casting a
negative or neutral vote, would increase public participation in the electoral
process, which is fundamental to the "strength of democracy." Given that
democracy is "all about choice" and voting constitutes its very "essence", non-
participation in the election can cause "frustration and disinterest". Thus, the
apex Court opined that NOTA would empower the people, thereby
accelerating effective political participation, since people could abstain and
register their discontent (with the low quality of candidates) without fear of
reprisal; simultaneously, it would foster the purity of the election process by
eventually compelling parties to field better candidates, thereby improving the
current situation.
</p>
<p id="p_1057">11.5           However, as former CEC, S.Y. Qureshi points out, NOTA is not
the same as the right to reject. He gives an example where even if there are
99 votes cast in favour of NOTA, out of a total 100, the candidate who got
only vote will be declared the winner, for having obtained the most number of
valid votes. 501 The ECI issued a similar clarification that no re-elections will be
called based on a cumulative reading of Rule 64(a) of the Election Rules and
<a href="/doc/1670041/" id="a_575">sections 53(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1818074/" id="a_576">65</a>, RPA. 502 This is because the stated reason for ECI's
demanding the introduction of NOTA was apparently to ensure the secrecy to
the voter casting a negative vote and to prevent a bogus vote in their place;
the right to reject did not figure in their original demands.503 This is evident in

500 PUCL v Union of India, (2013) 10 SCC 1, [26]. The Court relied on its previous decisions in
Kuldip Nayar v Union of India, (2006) 7 SCC 1 and S. Raghbir Singh Gill v S. Gurcharan
Singh Tohra, (1980) Supp SCC 53.

<p id="p_1060"> the Court's judgment - in terms of its emphasis on secrecy described above
and the lack of any discussion on the right to reject, which was not prayed for
by PUCL. Instead, the Court focused on how it hoped that NOTA would
eventually pressurise parties to field sound candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_1061">11.6           While some such as Mr. KK Venugopal and ADR supported the
introduction of NOTA and pushed for extending it to include the right to reject,
others such as Mr. Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. SY Qureshi, and Former Secretary-
General of the Lok Sabha, Subhash Kashyap believed that the Court was too
optimistic in thinking that NOTA would lead to cleaner politics.504 In any event,
in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, 1.1% of the total votes polled, or just less
than 60 lakh votes were cast in favour of NOTA, although NOTA was not the
most favoured option in any constituency.505

      B. Comparative Practices

11.7          With the exception of Columbia, very few countries accept the
right to reject principle. For instance, Nevada in the US 506 and Manitoba,
Ontario, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Yukon in Canada although recognising a
NOTA-like option, do not let it influence the election results by counting the
votes separately507 or treating them as spoilt ballots. 508 In fact, in the 2014
gubernatorial elections in Nevada, the Democratic nominee Robert Goodman
was elected in his primary, despite polling second after their "none of these
candidates" option.509

11.8         In Europe, the position is not different. Thus, Spanish law
permits voters to validly submit envelopes without ballot papers, which are
counted and declared as "blank votes"510 or "votos en blanco". Although they

representation system, even a majority of blank votes do not necessitate re-
elections. Similarly, in France and Italy, a blank vote is recorded separately
from a void vote, although there is no official space on the ballot.511

11.9          In Sweden, blank ballot papers permit voters to register their
protest secretly. Although the votes are considered invalid, they are counted
and reported separately from other forms of spoilt or invalid votes. Thus, there
is no concept of right to reject. In 2014, Russia re-introduced the "against all"
option on the ballot.512

11.10          Moving on to South America, Brazil with its compulsory voting
provisions recognises both, blank or white votes (voto em branco) that are
conscious sign of protest, and void or null votes (voto nulu) that are spoilt.
However, neither is considered valid or counted for election results'
purposes. 513 <a href="/doc/1085831/" id="a_581">Article 77(2)</a> of the Brazilian Constitution stipulates that only
candidates winning a majority of valid votes, excluding blank and invalid
votes, will be elected. The Superior Electoral Court in Brazil has clarified that,
"despite an ongoing myth, even in the event that half of votes cast are
deemed invalid, such circumstances cannot render an election null and
void."514

11.11        Columbia is an exception to the above trend, wherein if the
blank vote gets a majority (50%+1), the election needs to be repeated (only
once more) and the earlier candidates in the invalidated election cannot stand
again.515

<p id="p_1068">11.13         Good governance, which is purportedly the motivating factor

provisions only count and declare the number of such votes, instead of
factoring it in the final election results.

extension of the NOTA principle to introduce a right to reject the candidate

polled in favour of the NOTA option. However, the issue might be
reconsidered again in the future.

                                 RIGHT TO RECALL

A. History and Context

12.1         The right to recall (hereinafter "RTR") is one of the facets of
direct democracy that refers to a process whereby an electorate is able to
recall an elected representative for under-performance, corruption, or
mismanagement while still in office, by filing a petition that triggers a re-
election usually after a particular percentage of people sign the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_1073">12.2          Currently, provisions for RTR are prescribed for local elections
in Chhattisgarh,517 Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra and there
are demands for introducing this system at the state and parliamentary level.
However, proponents of RTR have not detailed the governing procedural
framework, namely the percentage of electors needed to sign the petition; the
grounds for initiating recall, or indeed whether any grounds are necessary; the
minimum period, if any, after which recall can be initiated; nor specified the
authority competent to decide whether to commence the recall based on the
satisfaction of certain pre-conditions.518 Other questions such as determining
whether voters who did not vote in the original election can initiate a recall,
whether there can be repeated recall petitions, and whether the recall
representative is disqualified from standing in the bye-elections from that or
any constituency also require consensus.519

12.3          The NCRWC in its 2001 report did not favour the introduction of
RTR finding it either "impracticable or unnecessary." 520

B. Analysing the Arguments For and Against the RTR

12.4          The arguments supporting the RTR primarily emphasise the
importance of direct democracy in holding elected representatives to account
by requiring them to seek post-election approval of their electorates. By
providing a tool to dissatisfied citizens to rectify their mistake through "de-
election" of their representatives, RTR serves to deter their under-
performance, mis-management, corruption, or apathy. Supporters also point

absence of any continuing monitoring or accountability mechanism, RTR is an
important step forward. Simply put, the damage to democratic institutions
should be curtailed through democratic mechanisms and the RTR provides a
"democratic disincentive" for poor performance and abuse of office.521

12.5           Another strand of the argument in favour of RTR is the
consequent improvement in public trust in governance, insofar as many
politicians will deliver good performances and reduce instances of corruption
under threat of recall. Introducing the RTR may also deter candidates from
spending excess amounts during their campaign, for a fear of being recalled.
An incidental benefit is that it will result in voters continually monitoring and
assessing political performance in a bid to determine whether they want to
exercise their RTR.522

12.6           Against these arguments, opponents of RTR refer to various
principled and practical objections. First, RTR can lead to an "excess of
democracy",523 wherein the threat of recall undermines the independence of
the elected representatives - they will either pander to the majoritarian
preferences and prejudices at the expense of safeguarding minority interests
in passing populist measures. Alternatively, they will resort to a "clientelist
distribution of patronage", whereby the elected representatives will use fear or
favour to ensure that they are not recalled.524 In both cases, short-term gains
and instant results will be preferred over long-term, unpopular although
beneficial policies. The legislative wisdom in enshrining a five-year Lok Sabha
or Vidhan Sabha term was premised on the need for time to draft and
implement good policies and to ensure stability. RTR threatens to challenge
that inasmuch as it incentivises representatives to focus on local, constituency
issues instead of larger public interest issues.525 As former Attorney General
of India, Mr. Soli Sorabjee points out, recall "subjects the elected member to
the supervision and control of his constituency. That would impair the free and
independent discharge of his function"526

12.7           Relatedly, as former CEC, S.Y. Qureshi notes the RTR can lead
to greater instability and chaos, with various attempts being made by vested
interests (either other political parties or opponents within the same party) to
trigger the RTR on the smallest of issues and as soon as will be

 permissible.527 Given this considerable uncertainty and tool for (mis)use by
losing candidates, legislators will shift their focus from policy formulation to
saving their constituency seat at all costs.
</p>
<p id="p_1080">12.8          Further, as Mr. Sorabjee observes, recall is fraught with serious
consequences for the representative being recalled - for instance, will (and
should) the MP/MLA be given an opportunity to be heard, in consonance with
the principles of natural justice, and to respond to the allegations in the recall
petition. Or which body should be empowered to determine whether the
alleged grounds in the petition, assuming that the RTR law provides for the
specification of such grounds, are justified or not - the civil courts, the ECI or
any other authority?528

12.9          More importantly, debates on the RTR ignore the larger issues
of political reform such as decriminalisation, curtailing money in politics,
internal democracy, and increased public awareness necessary to improve
the quality of representation. Progress in these areas may eventually make
the demand for RTR redundant.
</p>
<p id="p_1081">12.10           The biggest practical challenge in implementing RTR has been
articulated by the Mr. S.Y. Qureshi who points out that populated state and
parliamentary constituencies in India (unlike in Switzerland or even the US)
will result in a large number of signatures required to initiate a recall petition,
going into lakhs. Not only will the ECI have to verify the authenticity of every
single signature to prevent fraud, it will also have to determine whether the
signatures are genuine and consensual or obtained via fraud or coercion.529
Thus, introducing the RTR might have unintended effects in increasing
corruption and the use of money and influence if representatives liable to be
recalled try and ensure that a recall petition is not initiated against them.
</p>
<p id="p_1082">12.11         Moreover, there is still the question of implementation and the
expenditure of time and monetary resources cost in conducting regular bye-
elections, supplemented by the fear of election fatigue.530

12.12         On the possibility of misuse, there is a fear that the RTR will be
used by dominant caste members to harass lower caste elected
representatives. Thus, Vinod Bhanu points to the Chhattisgarh experience
where one of the recalled presidents was an independent candidate, who
claimed that the BJP and the Congress councillors allied together to initiate
the recall process. Bhanu notes that this has to be seen in the larger context
of allegations of political bias and misusing the provisions for recall. 531

<p id="p_1086"> Hindustan Times, after surveying the experience in several states, reported
some case studies on the functioning of the RTR. Pertinently, it gave the
example of Dewangarh, a hamlet in Patiala in Punjab, which was reserved as
a Scheduled Caste constituency in 2008. A brick kiln worker, Jaswinder
Singh, was elected as the sarpanch, although the majority of the village's
residents, who were members of the affluent Jat-Sikh community, did not
welcome this. Consequently, during the first half of his five-year term, his
other four colleagues - the panchs - did not attend a single panchayat
meeting, and thereafter, exercised the RTR to remove Singh (Section 19 of
the Punjab Panchayat Act, 1994 permits the panchs to remove a sarpanch
after the completion of half the term, by moving a no-confidence motion
against him). This was viewed by many as a tool for the influential against the
weak and the poor.532

12.13         The RTR, as it is usually applied, is especially dangerous and
liable to misuse in India that follows the first past the post system, where most
winning candidates do not have the support and trust of 50% of their
electorate in the first place. The RTR, which (mostly) requires the support of
50% of the electorate to remove the representative, can thus theoretically be
used to recall most elected representatives in India. This is because any recall
referendum or vote only consists of two options: 'yes' and 'no', or as in
Chhattisgarh an occupied and a vacant seat.
</p>
<p id="p_1087">C. Comparative Practices
12.14          In the U.S., 19 states allow the recall of elected state
representatives, although there have only been two successful recall
gubernatorial attempts - in North Dakota in 1921 and California in 2003.533
The process varies across states, but broadly requires an application be filed
to circulate a recall petition, following which the petition is circulated. The
petition has to be signed by a specific number of people within a specified
time and then submitted to the election officials for verification of signatures.
After that, recall election is held.
</p>
<p id="p_1088">12.15          In 11 of the 19 states, any registered voter (regardless of
whether they voted in the original election) can initiate the recall process for
any reason and no specific grounds for recall are needed. In fact, the National
Conference of State Legislatures in the US notes, "often, the reasons are
political."534

<p id="p_1089"> 12.16         Canada provides for the RTR for members of the Legislative
Assembly only in British Columbia vide the Recall and Initiative Act 1995.
Here, the Chief Electoral Officer is mandated to decide the validity of the
signed recall petition, which can be submitted on any grounds after 18
months. If the petition meets the requirements of the Act, a bye-election is
conducted within 90 days. Pertinently, of the 24 recall applications approved
since 1995, only one has succeeded in collecting enough signatures, although
it had to be stopped because the concerned MLA resigned. Thus, no bye-
election has ever been conducted.535

12.17          Switzerland recognises the RTR in six of its 26 cantons,
although not at the federal level. The required number of signatures in the
recall petition does not seem to based on a percentage of the electorate and
is instead a fixed number, example 1000 in Schaffhauses and 15,000 in
Ticino. The last successful recall attempt was in November 2003.536

12.18          Venezuela is the only country to have a constitutional RTR,
since its introduction into Venezuelan law in 1999 under the new
Constitution's <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_584">Article 72.</a> The RTR can also be applied against the Head of
State, and was in fact used against President Hugo Chavez, who survived a
recall election with 60% of the vote.537

12.19          The UK is the latest country to introduce the RTR through its
Recall of MP's Bill 2014-15 introduced in the House of Commons on 11th
September 2014, three years after its first draft Bill was introduced in
December 2011 as a response to the MP's expense crisis in 2009.538 The Bill
outlines two circumstances that trigger the recall - first, a sentence for less
than one year of an MP convicted of an offence (given that any sentence over
a year leads to disqualification); and second, when the "House of Commons
orders the suspension of the MP for at least 21 sitting days--or at least 28
calendar days if the motion is not expressed in terms of sitting days." The
recall petition needs to be signed by 10% of the electorate, following which
the seat will be vacated and bye-elections held, where the recalled MP can
contest again.

                 TOTALISER FOR COUNTING OF VOTES

13.1           In 2008, the ECI vide letter dated 21.11.2008 to the Secretary,
</pre><p id="p_1093">Ministry of Law and Justice, recommended amending the Election Rules to
provide for the use of a totaliser for the counting of votes recorded in EVMs at
elections. As per the ECI's suggestion, the results of votes polled in a group of
14 EVMs (hence, in 14 polling stations) would be calculated and announced
together, in a change from the current practice of counting votes by each
polling station.539 This is based on technological constraints.
13.2           The underlying rationale behind the ECI's proposal was that the
current system revealed the voting trends in each polling station, thus leaving
the voters in that vicinity open to harassment, intimidation and post-election
victimisation. Prior to the introduction of EVMs, ballot papers could be mixed,
wherever it was considered "absolutely necessary" under Rule 59A of the
Election Rules in light of "apprehend[ed] intimidation and victimisation of
electors" However, EVMs do not permit this. Using a totaliser would increase
the secrecy of votes during counting, thus preventing the disclosure of voting
patterns and countering fears of intimidation and victimisation.
</p>
<p id="p_1094">13.3            A totaliser would also help in situations such as witnessed in the
2014 Lok Sabha elections in Hoshangabad, where an EVM at the Mokalvada
polling station in Sohagpur area malfunctioned just minutes before voting was
to conclude at 6 pm. A lone voter, who arrived at the polling station at 5:50 pm
then had to cast their vote in a newly installed EVM. The ECI issued a
clarification that this single vote had to be counted, even if it compromised on
the voter's secrecy and instead stated that one way of dealing with such
situations in the future is the introduction of a totaliser machine to count the
votes recorded on several EVMs contemporaneously.540

13.4         Although the ECI's proposal was referred to a Parliamentary
Committee in 2009, no action was taken on it. In August 2014, the ECI moved
the Law Ministry on this issue again.541 Subsequently in September 2014, the
Supreme Court in a PIL in Yogesh Gupta v ECI542 issued directions to the
government to issue to clarify why no steps were taken pursuant to the ECI's
2008 proposals. Noting that the issue had been referred to the Law

<p id="p_1095"> Commission for consideration, the three-judge bench of the Court asked the
government what concrete steps it had taken on the ECI's suggestions of
using a totaliser to prevent (or reduce) instances of intimidation or
victimisation. 543 In its latest order on 16th January, the Court records the
Government's submission that it would seek the views of the Law
Commission, and the submission of an interim report on the issue.
</p>
<p id="p_1096">13.5            The ECI's proposal has also been supported in the Background
Paper on Electoral Reforms prepared by the Legislative Department of the
Law Ministry in 2010.544 Moreover, as the ECI has itself clarified, a "totaliser"
has already been developed by EVM manufacturers to connect several
control units at a time to indicate the total number of votes polled and
recorded in the specified number of polling stations.545 Thus, administratively
it is not difficult to collect information about the number of votes polled by
each candidate for a whole group of polling stations, thus hiding the pattern of
voting in each individual booth.
</p>
<p id="p_1097">13.6           For all these reasons, the Law Commission reiterates and
endorses the ECI's suggestion for introducing a totaliser for the counting of
votes recorded in EVMs. Similar to the existing Rule 59A, the Commission
proposes to amend Rule 66A to empower the ECI to decide when, and in
which constituency and polling booths, to employ a totaliser, after taking into
consideration the context of the elections and any threats of intimidation or
victimisation.
</p>

Law Commission recommends that:

             RESTRICTION ON GOVERNMENT SPONSORED
                        ADVERTISEMENTS


14.1           Item VII(iv) of the Model Code of Conduct for the Guidance of
Political Parties and Candidates proscribes the issuance of advertisements at
the cost of public exchequer during election period, for the prospects of the
party in power. This is to prevent the Union or State Governments from using
public funds to release advertisements purportedly for the information of the
public, but with a view to influencing the electorate on the eve of elections.
However, the Model Code of Conduct only comes into force from the date of
announcement of the elections and all public (government) spending on
advertisements prior to that is completely unregulated. The operationalisation
of the Model Code of Conduct nevertheless, creates a false dichotomy
because the actual announcement of a date for the elections is a technical
point - political parties are well aware of the impending elections long before
the ECI officially notifies the dates. The party in power is thus uniquely
positioned to issue government sponsored advertisements that highlights its
achievements, giving it an undue advantage over other parties and
candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_1103">14.2          Keeping this in mind, in 2004, the ECI recommended a ban on
advertisements "in any manner" of the achievements of the incumbent
government for six months prior to the date of expiry of the term of the House
to prevent the misuse of public funds. Moreover, in cases of premature
dissolution, the ECI's scheme would come into place from the date of
dissolution    of   the    House.     An    exception    was    provided    for
"advertisements/dissemination of information on poverty alleviation and health
related scheme." Apart from this, the ECI recommended that the name or
symbol of the political party should not appear in any banners or hoardings in
public places depicting the government's achievements. The ECI's proposal
found support in the Background Paper on Electoral Reforms prepared by the
Legislative Department of the Law Ministry in 2010.546

14.3         The Law Commission supports and reiterates the general thrust
of the ECI's proposal of regulating and restricting government sponsored
advertisements prior to elections to maintain the purity of elections, prevent
the use of public money for partisan interests, and ensure that no party or
candidate gets an undue advantage over another in the spirit of free and fair

546   Background paper, supra note 230, at para 6.4.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_244">                                                                           203</span>
<p id="p_1104"> elections. The six-month period for the proposed ban is premised on the ECI's
powers under the proviso to ss. 14(2) and 15(2) of the RPA to issue a
notification for the conduct of the general elections to the Lok Sabha or the
State Legislative Assembly within six months prior to the date of expiration of
the Lok Sabha or the Assembly. An amendment in the law will reflect the
concerns sought to be tackled in the Model Code of Conduct and will ensure
regulation in the period prior to the announcement of the elections, thus
improving democracy, human rights and good governance.
</p>
<p id="p_1105">14.4           Such an amendment is also consonant with the recently
released Guidelines on Content Regulation of Government Advertising of a
three-member committee comprising Professor N.R. Madhav Menon, former
Lok Sabha secretary general T.K. Vishwanathan and present Solicitor
General Mr. Ranjit Kumar, and appointed by the Supreme Court to examine
the misuse of public funds in government advertisements. The Committee
sought to prevent the "arbitrary use" of the taxpayers' money to project
political personalities/governments/parties without attendant public interest,
and to promote private interests, by banning or severely restricting
government advertisements that glorify political personalities or the ruling
party, particularly on the eve of elections. Thus, it recommended that
government advertisements be politically neutral and avoid photographs of
political leaders, and only if it is essential then the photographs of the Prime
Minister/Chief Minister or President/Governor be used. It also endorsed the
ECI's suggestions on the "severe" restrictions on government advertisements
six months prior to elections.547 The guidelines are meant to apply till they are
superseded by a validly enacted law, and the Law Commission's
recommendations will help achieve that.
</p>
<p id="p_1106">14.5          Further, the exception the advertisements regarding poverty
alleviation and health related schemes should not carry any names or
photographs of the leaders, in line with the Supreme Court-appointed
committee's guidelines. It is imperative that any such legislative amendment
should apply to all forms of print and electronic media and to banners and
hoardings in public places.

14.6         For these purposes, the Law Commission recommends the

  RESTRICTION ON THE NUMBER OF SEATS FROM WHICH A
               CANDIDATE MAY CONTEST

15.1           Section 33(7) of the RPA permits a candidate to contest any
election (parliamentary, assembly, biennial council, or bye-elections) from up
to two constituencies, presumably to accord greater flexibility to candidates
and increase their chances of winning a seat. Sub-section (7) was introduced
through a 1996 amendment, prior to which there was no bar on the number of
constituencies from which a candidate could contest; although the
amendment did not explain the rationale for restricting the number to two.
</blockquote><p id="p_1109">However, <a href="/doc/1628473/" id="a_585">section 70</a>, RPA stipulates that a candidate can hold only one seat
at a time, regardless of whether they have been elected to more than one
seat. Thus, if a candidate wins from two seats, <a href="/doc/1628473/" id="a_586">section 70</a> necessitates an
unnecessary bye-election at the cost of the exchequer, effort of the ECI, and
harassment of the electorate that has to vote again (which might reduced turn
out due to election fatigue). Moreover, the cost of conducting a bye-election
should not be underestimated. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the ECI
estimates that approximately Rs. 10 crore will be spent on each constituency,
and bye-elections will probably cost more given the absence of any
economies of scale.548

15.2         Given that a candidate cannot hold two seats at the same time,
the Law Commission agrees with the ECI's 2004 proposal that the RPA
should be amended to provide that a person cannot contest from more than
one seat at a time.549 This proposal has also been endorsed by the Goswami
Committee in 1990, the 170th Law Commission Report in 1999, and the
Background Paper on Electoral Reforms prepared by the Legislative
Department of the Law Ministry in 2010.550

15.3         However, the Commission does not endorse the ECI's alternate
proposal to require winning candidates to deposit an appropriate amount of
money (to the tune of Rs. 5 lakhs for Assembly and Rs. 10 lakhs for
Parliamentary elections) being the expenditure for conducting the elections.
Such a proposal does not correct the peculiarity in the law - the exercise of
conducting bye-elections will still consume the ECI's time and effort;

                         INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES
      A. Previous Suggestions
16.1          The question of independent candidates is often connected with
the issue of fragmented voting and instability in the electoral system. The
170th Law Commission report dealt with the issue and concluded, "the time is
now ripe for debarring independent candidates from contesting Lok Sabha
elections." Similarly, the NCRWC recommended the "discouragement" of
independent candidates, who are often "dummy" candidates or defectors from
their party or those denied party tickets.551 The rationale for permitting only
those with "political standing" to contest was premised on the abysmal
performance of independents in the 1998 general elections where, as the
Indrajit Gupta Committee Report noted, of the 1900 contesting independent
candidates, only 6 (0.65%) won while 885 (47%) lost their deposits.552

16.2           The underlying basis for such views stems from the perceived
"non-seriousness" of "some" of the independent candidates, as can be seen
from the example cited in the 170th Law Commission Report. 553 They talk
about the case of BJP leader Mr. V.K. Malhotra, against whom quite a few
persons, with the same name "V.K. Malhotra", stood as independent
candidates in the Lok Sabha election in a bid to confuse voters and "mislead
the masses". The Commission's proposed alternative was that any interested
potential candidate "can always form a political party" to contest the elections,
although such party would be required to poll at least 5% of the total valid
votes. This was to ensure that the banning of independents did not contribute
to a proliferation of parties.554 Consequently, the Commission recommended
the insertion of a new sub-section (1) to existing <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_589">sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_590">5</a>, RPA to the
effect that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_191">        "Only the political parties registered with the Election Commission
        under <a href="/doc/1054987/" id="a_591">section 11(4)</a> shall be entitled to put forward candidates to fill a
        seat in the House of the People [or Legislative Assembly]"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1124">16.3          The NCRWC's alternative proposal to discourage non-serious or
"dummy" candidates is to only permit candidates with a "track record" to
contest elections, namely if the candidates had won any local election or had
been nominated by at least twenty elected members of Panchayats,
Municipalities, or other local bodies. Additionally, independent candidates who
fail to garner at least 5% of the total valid votes polled, should not be

<p id="p_1128">16.4          The ECI in a bid to discourage "non-serious candidate who poll
a negligible number of votes" requested an amendment to <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_592">section 34</a>, RPA for

10,000 for Assembly elections; and (b) empowering them to prescribe the
security deposit before every general election.
</p><p id="p_1130">      B. Comparative Practices
16.5           In the European countries, independent candidates are allowed
to contest in those countries that do not have the party-list system of
proportional representation. Thus, thirteen countries allow independents to
contests in national Parliamentary elections and include Bulgaria, Cyprus,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania,
Malta, Romania, and the United Kingdom. These countries follow different
voting models, which comprise of majority/plurality voting in single-member
districts (France, UK); a single transferable vote system (Ireland, Malta); and
mixed-member systems, combining single-member districts with multi-
member districts (Germany, Greece).
</p>
<p id="p_1131">16.6          However, countries such as Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain
that have closed-list systems, do not allow independent candidates.556

16.7          Moreover, the requirements that an independent candidate must
fulfil before being eligible to stand do not seem to be very onerous. In
countries such as France and the UK, there is no requirement for independent
candidates to get signatures endorsing their candidature during nomination; in
five countries including Germany and Ireland, independents have to present
nomination signatures whereas party candidates do not; and in four countries
such as Greece and Hungary, both independents and parties require
nomination signatures before they are eligible. 557 In Ireland, a monetary
deposit is an alternative to the signature requirement - an independent
candidate has to either provide signatures of 30 electors, or deposit €500 with
the nomination.

<p id="p_1132">      C. Recommendations
16.8         The current Law Commission agrees with its previous views
expressed in the 170th Report and the NCRWC and ECI's proposals for a
number of reasons.

<p id="p_1135"> 16.9         First, without doubt there is a proliferation of dummy and non-
serious candidates in elections. Apart from the figures cited in the 170 th
Report, the success rate of independent candidates remains extremely low -
a mere 0.53%.558 In 2014, 3,182 independent candidates contested the Lok
Sabha elections and only 3 won seats.559

16.10        Second, even the Supreme Court has weighed in on this issue
in <a href="/doc/1384660/" id="a_593">Dhartipakar Madan Lal Agarwal v. Rajiv Gandhi560</a> and recommended that
Parliament devise ways "to meet the onslaught" of such non-serious
independent candidates. The court expressed its concerns, saying:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_192">       "Some independent individuals contest election genuinely and some of
       them have succeeded also but experience has shown that a large
       number of independent candidates contest the election for the mere
       sake of contesting, with a view to make out grounds for challenging the
       election. Presence of a number of independent candidates results in
       confusion, for the millions of the illiterate and ignorant electors who
       exercise their electoral right on the basis of 'symbols' printed on the
       ballot papers. The presence of large number of independent
       candidates makes the ballot paper of unmanageable size and ordinary
       elector is confused in the election booth while exercising his franchise.
       This leads to confusion."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1136">16.11         Third, the Commission agrees with the ECI's views given in the
context of increasing the security deposit, that a proliferation of candidates
puts "unnecessary and avoidable stress" in election management and
increases security, law and order, and election administration expenditure.561

16.12         Fourth, proposals to discourage non-serious candidates have
envisaged increasing the security deposits required under <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_594">section 34</a>, RPA.
However, even the 2009 amendment to the RPA increased the deposit from
Rs. 10,000 in Parliamentary and Rs. 5,000 in Assembly elections to only Rs.
25,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively (the amount being halved for candidates
belonging to SC/ST categories in both cases). Since many independents are
defectors from their political parties, such an amount is not substantial enough
to dissuade them or serve as an effect deterrent from standing, especially in
the Assembly Elections. Moreover, the power to increase in security deposits
does not lie with the ECI, and instead vests with the government which has

increased only in 1996 (before which it was Rs. 500 for Lok Sabha and Rs.
250 for Assembly elections).
</p>
<p id="p_1138">16.13          Further, given that the RPA currently does not empower the ECI
to frame rules under <a href="/doc/1042901/" id="a_596">section 169</a> or prescribe the cap on election expenditure
by an individual candidate under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_597">section 77</a> and Rule 90 of the Election Rules,
the Law Commission does not recommend amending <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_598">section 34</a> to vest such
power with the ECI. As with <a href="/doc/1042901/" id="a_599">section 169</a>, RPA, the Central Government
should prescribe the security deposit by legislative amendment notification in
the official gazette, after consulting with the ECI.
</p>
<p id="p_1139">16.14        Fifth, there exists a practice of independent candidates standing
with the same name as candidates from recognised political parties, and this
can cause a real confusion in the minds of the public, which might only look at
the name of the candidate instead of the party symbol.
</p>
<p id="p_1140">16.15         Finally, proposals put forth in its earlier 170th Report and in the
NCRWC's Final Report that independents can always form a political party to
contest elections if they want is correct inasmuch as it is cognizant of the fact
that the process of forming a party under the Election Symbols (Reservation
and Allotment) Order, 1968 and registering it under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_600">section 29A</a>, RPA is not
difficult.
</p>
<p id="p_1141">16.16         For all these reasons, the Law Commission endorses the
debarring of independent candidates, although it does not endorse an
amendment of <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_601">section 34</a> to empower the ECI to fix the security deposit
before every general election. Thus, a proviso should be added after sub-
clause (d) of section 4 of the RPA stating:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_193">       "Provided that only the political parties registered with the Election
       Commission under sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_602">section 29A</a> shall be entitled to

  PREPARATION AND USE OF COMMON ELECTORAL ROLLS

17.1           <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_605">Article 324(1)</a> of the Constitution empowers the ECI to, inter alia,
supervise, direct, and control the preparation and revision of electoral rolls for
all the elections to Parliament and State Legislatures, which it does under the
RPA. Similarly, as per <a href="/doc/1331638/" id="a_606">Article 243K</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_607">243ZA</a> and the relevant State laws,
the State Election Commission supervises, directs, and controls the
preparation and revision of electoral rolls for elections to the local bodies.
</blockquote><p id="p_1143">However, the practice between the two is not always coordinated, as per the
following observations in the Background Paper on Electoral Reforms
prepared by the Legislative Department of the Law Ministry in 2010:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_196">          "...while some states have coordinated their electoral rolls with those
          prepared by the Election Commission, there are still some states that
          significantly modify them. Some states even have different qualifying
          dates for the State rolls from the Election Commission rolls..."562

17.2           The ECI has adopted a similar stance noting that State laws
have dealt with the issue of electoral rolls for local elections in three different
ways - (a) the electoral rolls prepared by the ECI are used as the basis for the
preparation and revision of rolls for local body elections; (b) the ECI's electoral
rolls are used in toto for the local body elections; and (c) the ECI's
parliamentary and assembly rolls are used as a draft for local elections, and
are subject to further changes in the form of inclusions and exclusions. In fact,
in some cases, the qualifying dates for the Parliamentary/Assembly rolls and
local body rolls also differ.563

17.3          As the Background Paper and the ECI's 2004 reform proposal
further note, such non-uniformity of practice amongst States causes
duplication of essentially the same task between two different agencies,
thereby duplicating the effort and the expenditure. This is especially true
inasmuch as in most cases, the preparation and revision of rolls for both types
of elections is entrusted to the same machinery at the field level. Further, it
increases confusion amongst the voters, since they may find their names
present in one roll, but absent in another.

use of Parliamentary and Assembly rolls to be used in local body elections
through a "cut and paste" method,564 with the requisite modifications based on
the wards or polling areas of the local bodies. For instance, s. 7E of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 deals with the preparation and revision of
electoral rolls and provides that:

22.11.1999 to the Prime Minister has argued for the inclusion of common
electoral rolls on the grounds of national interest in saving time, effort, and
expenditure; reducing duplication or work and confusion amongst voters; and
the fact that it would not pose "any problems to the electoral machinery in the
field as it is the same at the ground level." The ECI relied on the fact that in an
attempt to reduce (conduct of) election expenditure, various common items of
polling materials such as ballot boxes were already being used in all three
Parliament, Assembly, and local body elections.

electoral rolls will require an amendment in the State laws pertaining to the
conduct of local body elections, the Central Government should write to the
various States in this regard. We hope that the States will consider amending
their laws based on the suggestions of the ECI and the Law Commission.

  SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
              Below is a summary of conclusions and recommendations of the
Commission on various issues discussed in the report. The amendments to
the Constitution, RPA, Election Rules and any other laws have been made in
track changes in the Annexure appended to this Report.
</p>
<p id="p_1151">      18.1    Election Finance

              The Law Commission has proposed wide ranging reforms on
the issue of candidate expenditure limits; disclosure obligations of individual
candidates and political parties; and penalties imposable on political parties;
as well as examining the issue of state funding of elections.
</p>
<p id="p_1152">   a. Section 77 of the RPA, regulating the election expenses incurred or
      authorized by candidates or their election agents, currently extends
      from the date of nomination to the date of declaration of results. This
      period should be extended by amending <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_608">section 77(1)</a> to apply from the
      date of notification of the elections to the date of declaration of results.
</p><p id="p_1153">                                                                   [Para 2.31(a)1]
   b. <a href="/doc/1870567/" id="a_609">Section 182(1)</a> of the Companies Act, 2013 should be amended to
      require the passing of the resolution authorising the contribution from
      the company's funds to a political party at the company's Annual
      General Meeting (AGM) instead of its Board of Directors.
</p><p id="p_1154">                                                               [Para 2.31(a)2]
   c. The existing disclosure obligations of individual candidates are limited
      to maintaining an account of electoral expenses under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_610">sections 77</a> and
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_611">78</a>, RPA. This is sought to be amended by inserting a new <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_612">section 77A</a>
      to require candidates or their election agents to maintain an account
      and disclose the particulars (names, addresses and PAN card numbers
      of donors and amounts contributed) of

         i.   any individual contribution received by them from any person or
              company, not being a Government company and
        ii.   any contribution by the political party from the date of notification
              of elections, which have to be made by the party by a crossed
              account payee cheque or draft or bank transfer.

 d. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_613">Section 78</a> should be amended in light of the proposed amendment to

f. Political parties should be required to maintain and submit annual
   accounts, duly audited by a qualified and practicing chartered
   accountant from a panel of such accountants maintained for the
   purpose by the Comptroller and Auditor General, to the ECI every
   financial year. These accounts will fully and clearly disclose all the
   amounts received by the party and the expenditure incurred by it. The
   ECI will then upload these accounts online or keep them on file for
   public inspection on payment of fee.

g. Disclosure provisions governing political parties has been substantially
   recast, with the existing 29C being deleted and replaced by a new
   <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_617">section 29D</a> requiring all parties to:

j. The disqualification of a candidate for a failure to lodge an account of
   election expenses and contributions reports under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_622">section 77</a> and
   proposed 77A should be extended from the current three period up to a
   five year period, so that a defaulting candidate may be ineligible to
   contest at least the next elections.

k. Express penalties, apart from losing tax benefits, should be imposed
   on political parties vide <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_623">section 29G</a> for the non-compliance with the
   disclosure provisions of proposed section 29D of the RPA. This should
   include a daily fine of Rs. 25,000 for each day of non-compliance, with
   the possibility of de-registration if the default continues beyond 90
   days. Further, ECI may levy a fine of up to Rs. 50 lakhs if its finds any
   particulars in the party's statements as having been falsified.

m. A new Part IVB, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_627">section 29I</a> should be inserted to the RPA dealing with
   the "Regulation of Electoral Trusts", and detailing provisions pertaining
   to their entitlement to accept contributions, disclosure obligations, and
   penal provisions (apart from losing income tax exemptions) so that the
   RPA can be amended in line with the changes already made to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_628">IT

n. The Commission does not consider a system of complete state funding
   of elections or matching grants to be feasible, given the current
   conditions of the country. Instead, it supports the existing system of
   indirect in-kind subsidies, with section 78B of the RPA being possibly
   amended in the future to expand these subsidies.

   18.2 Regulation of Political Parties and Inner Party Democracy

a. The Commission recommends amending sub-section (5) of section
   29A of the RPA requiring that the accompanying memorandum/rules/
   regulations with the party's application under sub-section (1). This
   accompanying document, by whatever name it is called, should also

   b. A new Chapter IVC should be inserted dealing with the "Regulation of
      Political Parties" and incorporating the Commission's previous
      recommendations in its 170th Report with certain modifications. Thus,
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_629">sections 29J</a> to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_630">29Q</a> will deal with internal democracy, party
      Constitutions, party organisation, internal elections, candidate
      selection, voting procedures, and the ECI's power to de-register a party
      in certain cases of non-compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_1172">   c. Another section, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_631">section 29R</a> should be inserted in the same Part,
      providing for the de-registration of a political party for failure to contest
      Parliamentary or State elections for ten consecutive years.
</p><p id="p_1173">                                                                   [Para 3.17.4, 2]
      18.3 Proportional Representation

18.3.1         It is clear that both the electoral systems come with their own
merits and demerits - proportional representation theoretically being more
representative, while the FPTP system being more stable It is also clear, from
the experience of other countries that any changes in India's electoral system
will have to follow a hybrid pattern combining elements of both direct and
indirect elections. This, in turn will necessitate an increase in the number of
seats in the Lok Sabha, which raises concerns regarding its effective
functioning.

18.3.2        As a result, the Law Commission recommends that the findings
           th
of the 170 Law Commission Report on the proportional system may be
examined by the Government to determine whether its proposals can be
made workable in India at present.

       18.4 Anti Defection Law in India

             The Law Commission recommends a suitable amendment to the
Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which shall have the effect of vesting the
power to decide on questions of disqualification on the ground of defection
with the President or the Governor, as the case may be, (instead of the
Speaker or the Chairman), who shall act on the advice of the ECI. This would
help preserve the integrity of the Speaker's office.

       18.5   Strengthening the office of the Election Commission of
             India

              The ECI should be strengthened by first,           giving equal
constitutional protection to all members of the Commission      in matters of
removability; second, making the appointment process of          the Election
Commissioners and the CEC consultative; and third, creating     a permanent,
independent Secretariat for the ECI.
</p>
<p id="p_1177">   a. <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_632">Article 324(5)</a> of the Constitution should be amended to equate the
      removal procedures of the two Election Commissioners with that of the
      Chief Election Commissioner. Thus, equal constitutional protection
      should be given to all members of the ECI in matters of removability
      from office.

   b. The appointment of all the Election Commissioners, including the CEC,
      should be made by the President in consultation with a three-member
      collegium or selection committee, consisting of the Prime Minister; the
      Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha (or the leader of the largest
      opposition party in the Lok Sabha in terms of numerical strength); and
      the Chief Justice of India. Elevation of an Election Commissioner
      should be on the basis of seniority, unless the three member
      collegium/committee, for reasons to be recorded in writing, finds such
      Commissioner unfit. Amendments should be made in the Election
      Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and
      Transaction of Business) Act, 1991 to reflect this.

   c. A new sub-clause (2A) should be added to <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_633">Article 324</a> of the
      Constitution to provide for a separate independent and permanent
      Secretariat for the ECI along the lines of the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha
      Secretariats under <a href="/doc/817281/" id="a_634">Article 98</a> of the Constitution. This will further
      improve the independence of the ECI.

      18.6 Paid News and Political Advertisements

       The issue of paid news and political advertisements should be
regulated in the RPA in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_1181">   a. The definitions of "paying for news", "receiving payment for news" and
      "political advertisement" should be inserted in section 2 of the RPA.
</p><p id="p_1182">                                                         [Para 7.48.4 &amp; 7.48.5]

    b. The consequences attached to those indulging in such practices
      should be delineated by creating
         i.  an electoral offence of "paying for news" / "receiving payment for
             news" in a newly inserted section 127B of the RPA - Not only
             will the incorporation of this electoral offence make paying for
             news / receiving payment for news penal, the stringent
             punishment will ensure that if the candidate themselves are
             found guilty, then, in all likelihood, they will be disqualified
             pursuant to section 8(3) of the RPA;

        ii.  a corrupt practice of paying for news under newly inserted sub-
</p><p id="p_1184">             clause (iii) in section 123(2)(a) of the RPA.
</p><p id="p_1185">                                                                       [Para 7.50]
   c. In order to curb the practice of disguised political advertisement,
      disclosure provisions should be made mandatory for all forms of media.
      The purpose of disclosure is two fold; first, to help the public identify
      the nature of the content (paid content or editorial content); and
      second, to keep the track of transactions between the candidates and
      the media. Thus, a new <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_635">section 127C</a> should be inserted in the RPA to
      deal with the non-disclosure of interests in political advertising. The ECI
      can regulate the specifics of the disclosure required.

      18.7 Opinion Polls

       Section 126(1)(b) of the RPA, which prohibits the display of any
election matter forty-eight hours before polling begins, is limited to display by
means of "cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus"; and does not
deal with the independence and robustness of the opinion polls themselves.

      print media and <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_636">section 126(1)(b)</a> should be amended to prevent the

   b. <a href="/doc/562280/" id="a_637">Section 126(1)(b)</a> should also provide for cognizance being taken only

   c. The regulation of opinion polls is necessary to ensure that first, the
      credentials of the organisations conducting the poll is made known to
      the public; second, the public has a chance to assess the validity of the
      methods used in conducting the opinion polls; and third, the public is

        18.8 Compulsory Voting

                The Law Commission does not recommend the introduction of
compulsory voting in India and in fact, believes it to be highly undesirable for a
variety of reasons described above such as being undemocratic, illegitimate,
expensive, unable to improve quality political participation and awareness,
and difficult to implement.

       18.9 Election Petitions

             Wide-ranging reforms have been suggested to Part VI of the
RPA dealing with "disputes regarding elections" and the proposed
amendments have been drafted in the annexure appended to this Report.
These include, inter alia:
</p>
<p id="p_1192">   a. The introduction of one or more "election benches" in each High Court,
      designated so by the Chief Justice of the particular High Court,
      exercising jurisdiction over all election disputes under the RPA. A
      single Judge shall ordinarily exercise such jurisdiction, although the
      Chief Justice can assign more judges, if they so desire.
</p>
<p id="p_1193">   b. The procedure for presenting election petitions should be made simpler
      and less formalistic by:
</p><p id="p_1194">         i.  requiring election petitions to be ordinarily filed in the Principal
             seat of the relevant High Court, although this can be shifted to
             another bench or place in the interest of justice;
</p><p id="p_1195">        ii.  removing requirement of impleading those candidates who have
             lost their security deposit as respondents to an election petition,
             if the petitioner makes an additional declaration that he himself
             or any candidate has been duly elected; and
       iii.  removing non-compliance with <a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_640">section 117</a>'s stipulation of
             security for costs as a ground for summarily dismissal under
             <a href="/doc/909931/" id="a_641">section 86</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_1196">   c.    The trial of election petitions by the election bench of the High Court
        should be expedited by providing for
           i.   daily trial;
</p><p id="p_1197">          ii.  minimising adjournments, with the possibility of imposing
               exemplary costs;
</p><p id="p_1198">         iii.  a time limit of 45 days to file a written statement, with a further
               extension of 15 days, after which such right shall be forfeited;
</p>

<p id="p_1199">    d. The trial should be concluded within six months from the date of
      presentation of the petition; otherwise, a report should be sent to the
      Chief Justice of the High Court explaining the reasons for the delay.
</p>
<p id="p_1200">   e. The election bench of the High Court should pass its order under
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_642">section 98</a> within ninety days from the conclusion of arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_1201">   f. A new provision, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_643">section 98A</a>, should be inserted pertaining to the
      collection of data (such as the number of election petitions filed and
      pending, the status of each petition, the names of the parties, and
      designated election bench) by the High Court and uploading it on its
      website. The ECI has been mandated to prepare an annual report after
      compiling such data from all the High Courts across the country.
</p>
<p id="p_1202">   g. Appeals to the Supreme Court should now only be on the basis of a
      question of law, instead of the earlier provision permitting questions of
      fact or law as grounds for appeal. This appeal should be filed within 30
      days of the High Court's order, although an extension of a maximum of
      30 more days can be granted, with nothing thereafter. The Supreme
      Court should try and conclude the appeal within three months from the
      date of appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_1203">   h. The security for costs has been increased from the existing Rs. 2000 to
      Rs. 10,000, although <a href="/doc/912769/" id="a_644">section 117</a> has been amended to empower the
      election bench of the High Court to grant an extension of time, as
      considered reasonable, to deposit this new security amount.

      18.10 NOTA and the Right to Reject
        The Law Commission currently rejects the extension of the NOTA
principle to introduce a right to reject the candidate and invalidate the election
in cases where a majority of the votes have been polled in favour of the NOTA
option. This is premised on the fact that, first, the underlying premise of the
Supreme Court's decision in NOTA was the importance of safeguarding the
right to secrecy, and this secrecy rationale does not pre-empt the right to
reject. Second, good governance, the motivating factor behind the right to
reject, can be successfully achieved by bringing about changes in political
horizontal accountability, inner party democracy, and decriminalisation.
However, the issue might be reconsidered again in the future.

        18.11 The Right to Recall

       The Law Commission is not in favour of introducing the right to recall in
any form because it can lead to an excess of democracy, undermines the
independence of the elected candidates, ignores minority interests, increases
instability and chaos, increases chances of misuse and abuse, is difficult and

 expensive to implement in practice, especially given that India follows the first
past the post system.
</p><p id="p_1206">                                                                    [Para 12.20]
       18.12 Totaliser for Counting of Votes

18.12.1       The Commission reiterates and endorses the ECI's suggestion
for introducing a totaliser for the counting of votes recorded in electronic
voting machines to prevent the harassment of voters in areas where voting
trends in each polling station can be determined. Prior to the introduction of
EVMs, ballot papers could be mixed under Rule 59A of the Election Rules,
although this was not permitted for EVMs. Using a totaliser would increase the
secrecy of votes during counting, thus preventing the disclosure of voting
patterns and countering fears of intimidation and victimisation.
</p>
<p id="p_1207">18.12.2      Thus, similar to the existing Rule 59A, the Commission
proposes to amend Rule 66A to empower the ECI to decide when, and in
which constituency and polling booths, to employ a totaliser, after taking into
consideration various factors and the overall context of the elections.
</p><p id="p_1208">                                                                     [Para 13.7]
      18.13 Restriction on Government Sponsored Advertisements

18.13.1      The Commission recommends regulating and restricting
government sponsored advertisements six months prior to the date of expiry
of the House/Assembly to maintain the purity of elections; prevent the use of
public money for partisan interests of, inter alia, highlighting the government's
achievements; and ensure that the ruling party or candidate does not get an
undue advantage over another in the spirit of free and fair elections.
</p>
<p id="p_1209">18.13.2        This can be achieved by inserting a new Chapter VIIB in Part V
of the RPA prohibiting State/Central government sponsored advertisements in
the print or electronic media or by way of banners and hoarders, six months
prior to date of expiry of the term of the Lok Sabha/Vidhan Sabha. However,
an exception has been carved out for advertisements highlighting the
government's poverty alleviation programmes or any health related schemes
                                                                  [Para 14.6]

       18.14 Restriction on the Number of Seats from which a Candidate
             May Contest

     The Commission recommends an amendment of section 33(7) of the
RPA, which permits a candidate to contest any election (parliamentary,
assembly, biennial council, or bye-elections) from up to two constituencies. In
view of the expenditure of time and effort; election fatigue; and the

          harassment caused to the voters, <a href="/doc/1670053/" id="a_645">section 33(7)</a> should be amended to permit
         candidates to stand from only one constituency.

               18.15 Independent Candidates

                 The Law Commission recommends that independent candidates be
         disbarred from contesting elections because the current regime allows a
         proliferation of independents, who are mostly dummy/non-serious candidates
         or those who stand (with the same name) only to increase the voters'
         confusion. Thus, sections 4 and 5 of the RPA should be amended to provide
         for only political parties registered with the ECI under <a href="/doc/1054987/" id="a_646">section 11(4)</a> to contest
         Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha elections.

                18.16 Preparation and Use of Common Electoral Rolls

                The Law Commission endorses the ECI's suggestions regarding the
         introduction of common electoral rolls for Parliamentary, Assembly and local
         body elections. However, given that introducing common electoral rolls will
         require an amendment in the State laws pertaining to the conduct of local
         body elections, the Central Government should write to the various States in
         this regard. We hope that the States will consider amending their laws based
         on the suggestions of the ECI and the Law Commission.
