                         was merely to extend, enlarge and prolong the
                         existing lease/settlement and therefore the
                         respondents could not have modified the terms

</p>
<p id="p_12">                   3. It is not in dispute that vide a written agreement

         dated 13.04.2015, rights for mining the sand in accordance with

         the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1972 (hereinafter

         referred to as the Rules) stood accorded to the petitioner. The

         grant, which is commonly termed as settlement, was for a period

         of five years commencing from the calendar year 2015 up to

         2019. The settlement amount for these five calendar years, as

         stipulated in the agreement, reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                           &quot;Settlement amount of calendar year, 2015 is

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                        Settlement amount of calendar year, 2017 will
                 be 120% of calendar year 2016 settlement amount.

<p id="p_13">                   4. This agreement did not contain any condition

         entitling the petitioner for either extension or renewal. It is also

         not in dispute that the grant, by virtue of Rule 34 of the Rules

         can be renewed on the application being filed by the lessee. But

         even this was not done.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                       5. It is also not in dispute that the matter with regard to

         the issue of mining of sand in the area in issue, though in an

         unrelated matter, was pending consideration, before Hon&#x27;ble the

         Apex Court. In this backdrop, the State could not take any steps

         for auctioning the sand Ghats or grant any fresh mining lease.
</p>
<p id="p_15">         Our attention is also invited to the fact that such action was

         prompted also on account of the pendency of the matter before

         the National Green Tribunal. Resultantly, the State, took a

         policy decision whereby the existing lessees were allowed to

         continue, by way of an extension, with the mining operation of

         the minor mineral, i.e., the sand, on certain terms and

         conditions. The notification and communication in this regard

         as contained in Annexures 8 and 9, which read as under:-

<p id="p_26">                    8. It is argued that the decision of the State Government

         (Annexure- 8) is in the nature of an extension and not renewal

         of a fresh lease and, as such, extension cannot be at variance

         with the terms of the original grant.

<p id="p_27">                    9. In support, learned counsel for the petitioner places

         reliance on paragraph 14 of a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex

         Court in Provash Chandra Dalui v. Bisawanath Banerjee,
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3203 of 2021 dt.14-12-2021

         1989 Supp (1) SCC 487 which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                 &quot;14. It is pertinent to note that the word used is
                 &quot;extension&quot; and not &quot;renewal&quot;. To extend means to
                 enlarge, expand, lengthen, prolong to carry out further
                 than its original limit. Extension, according to Black&#x27;s
                 Law Dictionary, means enlargement of the main body
                 addition of something smaller than that to which it is
                 attached; to lengthen or prolong. Thus extension
                 ordinarily implies the continued existence of something
                 to be extended. The distinction between &quot;extension&quot;
                 and &quot;renewal&quot; is chiefly that in the case of renewal, a
                 new lease is required, while in the case of extension the
                 same lease continues in force during additional period
                 by the performance of the stipulate act. In other words,
                 the word &quot;extension&quot; when used in its proper and usual
                 sense in connection with a lease means a prolongation
                 of the lease. Construction of this stipulation in the lease
                 in the above manner will also be consistent when the
                 lease is taken as a whole....&quot;</blockquote>

<p id="p_28">                10. Learned counsel for the petitioner further relies on a

         Ors. v. Nirmalaben S. Mehta and Ors</a>., (2016) 9 SCC 240,

         (supra).

<p id="p_30">                    12. The instant petition was filed only on 29th January,

         2021, much after the petitioner accepted the terms and

         extension flows only from the decision taken by the State,

         Annexure-8, reproduced supra. Neither from the agreement nor

         from the Rules. It was open for him to have either accepted or

         rejected the terms of extension. He could have conveniently

         handed over the site back to the State, had the terms not been

         acceptable to him. Conveniently, he continued with the mining

         operation and after reaping benefits in terms of the Cabinet

         decision, as an afterthought, has now filed the present petition

         and the act being nothing short of dishonesty.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                   13. In our considered view, petitioner is bound by the

         terms and conditions of the decision of the State Government

         (Annexure 8). He has not only impliedly accepted the change in

         terms but has also taken considerable action in furtherance

         thereof. <a href="/doc/1911494/" id="a_3">Section 8</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 reads as

                 consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be

                 offeree, yet it does not mean that an acceptance always
                 has to be given in so many words. Under certain
                 circumstances, offeree&#x27;s silence, coupled with his conduct,
                 which takes the form of a positive act, may constitute an
                 acceptance--an agreement sub silentio. Therefore, the
                 terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not
                 only by their words but also by their conduct.&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                         &quot;The appeal arises out of a writ petition, and it
                   is well settled that when a petitioner invokes the

                   the Constitution, it is open to the High Court to
                   consider whether, in the exercise of its undoubted
                   discretionary jurisdiction, it should decline relief to
                   such petitioner if the grant of relief would defeat the
                   interests of justice. The Court always has power to
                   refuse relief where the petitioner seeks to invoke its
                   writ jurisdiction in order to secure a dishonest
                   advantage or perpetuate an unjust gain. This is a
                   case where the High Court was fully justified in
                   refusing relief.&quot;</blockquote>

<p id="p_36">                   17. Rule 77 (2) clearly            empowers the State

         Government to grant a mining lease or settlement on terms and

         conditions other than those prescribed in the Rules and,

         therefore, a grant which is outside the stipulated condition, as in

         the present case, is permitted so long as the reasons for doing so

         are recorded in writing.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                   18. In the instant case, only on account of the pendency

         of proceedings before the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court as also the

         National Green Tribunal, the State could not take any decision

         for putting the settlement to auction under the Rules. It is under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          11/15</span>




         these peculiar circumstances that the State, left with no option,

         came out with a policy of granting continuance of the mining

         operations, subject to payment of certain amount. Under the

         original lease, the lessee was entitled to pay an enhanced

         amount of rupees 120% of the previous calendar year, whereas

         under the policy in question, he is required to pay 150%. The

         enhancement by 30%, in our considered view, cannot be said to

         be grossly disproportionate or on the higher side.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                   19. The petitioner has relied on a decision of the

         Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in              <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_6">Central Inland Water Transport

         Corporation Limited v. Brojo Nath Ganguly &amp; Ors</a>., (1986)

         3 SCC 156 to make a case for the decision of the State

         Government as being against public policy. We find it prudent

         to reproduce below relevant portion, clarifying what such a

         finding would entail.
</p>
                     &quot;76. Under which head would an unconscionable bargain fall?
<p id="p_39">                  If it falls under the head of undue influence, it would be voidable
                  but if it falls under the head of being opposed to public policy, it
                  would be void. No case of the type before us appears to have fallen
                  for decision under the law of contracts before any court in India
                  nor has any case on all fours of a court in any other country been
                  pointed out to us. The word &quot;unconscionable&quot; is defined in
                  the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edn., Vol. II, p. 2288,
                  when used with reference to actions etc. as &quot;showing no regard for
                  conscience; irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable&quot;. An
                  unconscionable bargain would, therefore, be one which is
 Patna High Court CWJC No.3203 of 2021 dt.14-12-2021
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12/15</span>




                  irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.
</p><p id="p_40">                     77. Although certain types of contracts were illegal or void, as
                  the case may be, at common law, for instance, those contrary to
                  public policy or to commit a legal wrong such as a crime or a tort,
                  the general rule was of freedom of contract. This rule was given
                  full play in the nineteenth century on the ground that the parties
                  were the best judges of their own interests, and if they freely and
                  voluntarily entered into a contract, the only function of the court
                  was to enforce it. It was considered immaterial that one party was
                  economically in a stronger bargaining position than the other; and
                  if such a party introduced qualifications and exceptions to his
                  liability in clauses which are today known as &quot;exemption clauses&quot;
                  and the other party accepted them, then full effect would be given
                  to what the parties agreed. Equity, however, interfered in many
                  cases of harsh or unconscionable bargains, such as, in the law
                  relating to penalties, forfeitures and mortgages. It also interfered to
                  set aside harsh or unconscionable contracts for salvage services
                  rendered to a vessel in distress, or unconscionable contracts with
                  expectant heirs in which a person, usually a money lender, gave
                  ready cash to the heir in return for the property which he expects
                  to inherit and thus to get such property at a gross undervalue. It
                  also interfered with harsh or unconscionable contracts entered into
                  with poor and ignorant persons who had not received independent
                  advice (See Chitty on Contracts, 25th Edn., Vol. I, paras 4 and
</p><p id="p_41">                  516).
</p><p id="p_42">                     &quot;93. The normal rule of Common Law has been that a party
                  who seeks to enforce an agreement which is opposed to public
                  policy will be non-suited. The case of A. Schroeder Music
                  Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay [(1974) 1 WLR 1308] however,
                  establishes that where a contract is vitiated as being contrary to
                  public policy, the party adversely affected by it can sue to have it
                  declared void. The case may be different where the purpose of the
                  contract is illegal or immoral. <a href="/doc/1409676/" id="a_7">In Kedar Nath Motani v. Prahlad

                            &quot;The correct position in law, in our opinion, is that what
                    one has to see is whether the illegality goes so much to the root
                    of the matter that the plaintiff cannot bring his action without
                    relying upon the illegal transaction into which he had entered. If
                    the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated by Williston and the
                    plaintiff is not required to rest his case upon that illegality, then
                    public policy demands that the defendant should not be allowed
                    to take advantage of the position. A strict view, of course, must
                    be taken of the plaintiff&#x27;s conduct, and he should not be allowed
                    to circumvent the illegality by resorting to some subterfuge or by
                    misstating the facts. If, however, the matter is clear and the
                    illegality is not required to be pleaded or proved as part of the
                    cause of action and the plaintiff recanted before the illegal
                    purpose was achieved, then, unless it be of such a gross nature as
                    to outrage the conscience of the court, the plea of the defendant
                    should not prevail.&quot;
</p><p id="p_43">                            The types of contracts to which the principle formulated
                    by us above applies are not contracts which are tainted with
                    illegality but are contracts which contain terms which are so
                    unfair and unreasonable that they shock the conscience of the
                    court. They are opposed to public policy and require to be
                    adjudged void.&quot;

         cannot be any issue of unjust enrichment by the State or the

         State being in a superior dominating position as is so argued

         before us. There is nothing on record to support the contention

         of the learned counsel for the petitioner.

         Government (Annexure 8) is against public interest for it would

         enhance the retail price of the sand. This contention only merits

         rejection, more so, in view of absence of any grievance vented

         out by the retailer. Also it being a policy decision taken by the

         State which cannot be said to be arbitrary, capricious, illegal or

         unreasonable.

<p id="p_47">                   22. The petitioner&#x27;s case, in the considered view of this

         Court, does not meet the threshold set out in the Brojo Nath

         Ganguly (supra), is within the confines of the power of the

         State Government as per the Rule 77(2) of the 2019 Rules and

         does not violate public policy in any manner.

<p id="p_49">                   24. Hence, we do not find any reason to interfere with

         the decision of the State Government dated 27.12.2019

         (Annexure-8)            and         the      communication   dated

         27.12.2019(Annexure-9), inter alia, the conduct of the

         petitioner in terms of the delay in approaching this Court

         precludes him from doing so after having taken full advantage

         of the very mining lease of which, the price he seeks to

         challenge.
