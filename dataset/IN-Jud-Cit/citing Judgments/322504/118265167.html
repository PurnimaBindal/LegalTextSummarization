Date of Judgment &amp; Order                  : 03.02.2012

                         JUDGMENT &amp; ORDER

</pre><p id="p_26">      Because the fact that the issues, raised in this set of three writ

petitions, are common in nature, all these three writ petitions, based

on substantially similar facts, have been heard together for the

purpose of final disposal, on the request made by learned counsel for

the parties concerned, and are, therefore, being disposed of, now, by

this common judgment and order.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">2.    Let me, first, set out the facts of the three writ petitions:


WP(C) No. 144 of 2011:
</p>
<p id="p_29">      The case of the petitioner is, in brief, thus:
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      (i) The respondent No. 3, namely, District Education Officer,

West Tripura, Zonal Office, Agartala, issued a notification, in a local

daily, on 09-01-2011, inviting applications for admission of 120 boys,

through lottery, in the nursery stage of Uma Kanta Academy (English

Medium)    School,   Agartala,       clearly   stating,   in   the   notification

aforementioned, that out of the total number of 120 seats, 20 seats

were reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC), 37 seats were reserved for



WP(C) Nos. 144 of 2011, 195/11 &amp; 205 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                       Page No. 5</span>

Scheduled    Tribes     (ST),   2   seats    were   reserved    for   Physically

Handicapped (PH) persons and remaining 61 seats were earmarked for

unreserved (UR) candidates. Pursuant to the advertisement, the

petitioner submitted a duly filled up form for admission of his son into

the said school.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">      (ii) The lottery was conducted on 24-02-2011. But before the

commencement       of   the     lottery,   the   school   authorities   verbally

announced that two seats had been reduced from the UR quota and

the said two seats had been added to the quota of the PH persons,

raising thereby the quota of seats, for PH persons, from 2 to 4.


</p><p id="p_34">      (iii) On the conclusion of the lottery, 59 UR candidates were

selected for admission and 30 UR candidates were kept in waiting list.

The name of the petitioner's son figured at Sl. No. 14 in the waiting list

of the UR category. For not taking admission of one UR candidate, one

candidate from the waiting list of the UR category was admitted into

the school. Consequently, the name of the petitioner's son, now,

appears at Sl. No. 13 of the waiting list of candidates of UR categories.

Similarly, after selecting 20 SC candidates for admission, 30 SC

candidates were kept in the waiting list.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">      (iv) As far as the candidates belonging to ST are concerned,

though there were 37 seats, which had been kept reserved for them in

terms of the notification, dated 09-01-2011, aforementioned, only 11

candidates from the ST came to be admitted against the said quote of

</p><p id="p_37">37. However, for filling up 27 vacant seats, which were meant for the

candidates belonging to ST and 3 vacant seats, kept reserved for PH

persons, respondent No. 3 issued another notification on 10-02-2011.

Pursuant to the notification, dated 10-02-2011, only 12 candidates

were admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">      (v) Thereafter, respondent No. 3 issued yet another notification,

dated 19-03-2011, stating to the effect that 17 vacant seats, meant for

candidates of ST, would be filled up from the waiting list of the

candidates of SC category. Aggrieved by the notification, dated 19-03-

2011, whereby respondent No. 3 made available 17 vacant seats,

which were meant for ST to be filled up from the waiting list of the

candidates belonging to the SC, the writ petition, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India, has been filed, impugning the notification,

dated 19-03-2011, aforementioned and seeking appropriate reliefs, the

writ petitioners' contention being that in the face of the scheme of

reservation in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

(Reservation of vacancies in Services and posts) Act, 1991 (in short,

'the SC and ST Reservation Act'), it is legally impermissible for the

State to allow the vacant seats, originally, kept reserved for the

candidates of ST, to be filled up by candidates belonging to SC by

invoking exchange method; whereas the said seats, according to the

writ petitioners, ought to be filled up on the basis of merit.

Reservation Act'), it is legally impermissible for the State to allow the

vacant seats, originally, kept reserved for the candidates of ST, to be

filled up by candidates belonging to SC by invoking exchange method;

whereas the said seats, according to the writ petitioners, ought to be

filled up on the basis of merit.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">3.    Resisting the writ petitions, the respondents have contended to

the effect, inter alia, that by office memorandum, dated 12.05.1995,

issued   by   the   Department     of   Welfare   for   Scheduled   Castes,

Government of Tripura, when it had been provided that in case of non-

availability of eligible SC candidates or ST candidates against their

reserved quota of seats, the seats may be exchanged between the

available SC &amp; ST candidates, it is perfectly legal and legitimate, on

the part of the Government, to allow the filling up of vacant seats,

which were, originally, meant for ST, by the wait listed candidates

belonging to the SC, particularly, when similar memorandum was

issued, on 04.03.1996, by the Department of Welfare for Scheduled

Tribes, Government of Tripura, wherein it was specifically provided

that in case of non-availability of SC/ST candidates even by exchange

method, the unfilled reserved seats if any, may be distributed amongst

the eligible UR candidates subject to the condition that the reserved

seats are carried forward to the next academic year for distribution

amongst the eligible SC/ST candidates of that year.


</p><p id="p_59">4.    Further case of the respondents is that under the office

memorandum, issued, on 12-01-2005, by the Directorate of Welfare

for Scheduled Castes and OBC, Government of Tripura, it had been

provided that if required number of SC/ST candidates are not

available, seats may be exchanged between SCs &amp; STs. For example,

if required number of ST candidates is not available, the ST reserved

seats may be filled up by SC candidates and vice-versa. If both SC &amp;

ST candidates are not available, the reserved seats may be filled up by

unreserved category of candidates with the prior approval of the

Director for Welfare of Scheduled Castes and OBC or the Director for

Welfare of Scheduled Castes, as the case may be.


</p><p id="p_60">5.    I have heard Mr. Somik Deb, learned counsel for the petitioners

in the three writ petitions, and Mr. AK Bhowmik, learned Senior

counsel, appearing for the private respondents. I have also heard Mr.

DP Kundu, learned Advocate General, Tripura, assisted by Ms. R

Guha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of State respondents in

WP(C) No. 144 of 2011, and Mr. S Chakraborty, learned Government

</p><p id="p_62">6.    The core issue, in this set of writ petitions, is: whether the

unfilled seats, which were kept reserved for candidates of Scheduled

Tribes, in a school, in the State of Tripura, can be legally filled up from

the waiting list of candidates of Scheduled Caste by applying exchange

method ?
</p>
<p id="p_63">7.    Presenting the case, on behalf of the petitioners, Mr. Somik Deb,

learned counsel, has taken me extensively through various provisions

of the Tripura Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Reservation

Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred to as the 'SC and ST Reservation Act'),

more particularly, Sections 5 and 16 thereof, to show that Section 5

provides 17% reservation for Scheduled Castes and 31% reservation

for Scheduled Tribes in the admission of students to educational

institutions and the Government has the power to review, from time to

time, the implementation of the reservation policy and take adequate

measures including increase of percentage of reservation. The SC and

ST Reservation Act does not permit, according to Mr. Deb, filling up of

unfilled seats of one reserved category by the candidates of the other

reserved category.
</p>
<p id="p_64">8.    In other words, what Mr. Deb, learned counsel, has contended is

that exchange method is not perceived by the SC and ST Reservation

Act and, hence, in the present case, the unfilled seats, which were,

otherwise, kept reserved for the candidates of Scheduled Tribes,

cannot be filled up from the waiting list of candidates belonging to

Scheduled Castes and such seats, according to Mr. Deb, can be filled

up on the basis of merit alone. In support of his submission, Mr. Deb

places reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court, in <a href="/doc/1347921/" id="a_4">Jagdish

Singh v. Punjab Engineering College</a>, reported in (2009) 7 SCC 300,

and <a href="/doc/814552/" id="a_5">MRF Ltd. V. Mahohar Rarrikar and others</a>, reported in (2010)

</p><p id="p_66">9.    It is pointed out by Mr. Deb, learned counsel, that in order to

sustain their recourse to exchange method, the respondents rely on

three Memoranda, dated 12.05.1995, 12.01.2005 and 04.03.1996.

These Memoranda have been issued, further points out Mr. Deb, by

the Director, Directorate for Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Other

Backward Classes (in short, 'OBC'), Tripura, and these Memoranda do

not have the approval of the Cabinet and cannot, therefore, be relied

upon by the State respondents as the policy of the State Government

or as an executive decision of the State Government in terms of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_7">Article

162</a> or 166 of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_67">

</p><p id="p_68">10.   The SC and ST Reservation Act, according to Mr. Deb, does not

empower the Director, Directorate for the Welfare of Scheduled Castes

and OBC, to issue any order, memorandum or notification and, hence,

the memoranda aforementioned suffer from the vice of lack of

jurisdiction, particularly, when the memoranda clearly indicate that

the decision to apply exchange method was taken by the Scheduled

Castes Welfare Advisory Committee and not by the State Government.

Mr. Somik Deb points out that the second memorandum, dated

12.01.2005, only reiterates what is contained in the Memorandum,

dated 12.05.1995 and, as far as the third memorandum, dated

04.03.1996, is concerned, the same has been issued by the Joint

Secretary to the Government of Tripura, but none of the three

memoranda shows, contends Mr. Deb, that they are policy decisions

of the State Government, having approval of the Cabinet, and these

memoranda cannot, therefore, be regarded as decisions of the

Government of Tripura in terms of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_8">Article 162</a> nor have these

memoranda been authenticated and issued in the name of the

Governor of Tripura in consonance with <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_9">Article 166</a> of the Constitution

of India.
</p>
<p id="p_69">11.   Mr. Deb has also drawn attention of this Court to Section 16 of

the SC and ST Reservation Act and contended that this Section has an

overriding effect on the laws, rules, regulations and orders, which run

contrary to the scheme of the SC and ST Reservation Act and, in the

face of the provisions, embodied in Section 16, the provisions of the SC

and ST Reservation Act, contends Mr. Deb, must be taken to have

superseded the exchange method, which had been provided for earlier

in the three memoranda aforementioned.          In no way, therefore,

submits Mr. Deb, the State respondents can take resort to exchange

method and fill up the unfilled seats, kept reserved for Scheduled Tribe

candidates, by the waitlisted candidates of Scheduled castes.



</p><p id="p_70">12.   Though Mr. Deb has contended, as already indicated above, that

the three memoranda aforementioned stand superseded by Section 16

of the SC and ST Reservation Act as they run counter to the provisions

embodied in Section 16, Mr. Deb has, nevertheless, relied upon the

decisions, in <a href="/doc/82473/" id="a_10">Shanti Sports Club and another v. Union of India and

others</a>, reported in (2009) 15 SCC 705, <a href="/doc/814552/" id="a_11">MRF Limited v. Manohar

petitioners, Mr. D. P. Kundu, learned Advocate General, Tripura, who

appears on behalf of the State respondents, in WP(C) 114/2011, has,

first, pointed out that the Constitutional validity of the SC and ST

Reservation Act and the Rules, framed thereunder, are not under

challenge in the writ petitions.   The petitioners, also points out Mr.

Kundu, have not challenged the validity of the Memoranda, which the

State respondents have relied upon to sustain their decision to resort

<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_18">Article 46</a> and the Preamble of the Constitution, the learned Advocate

General has submitted that the Constitution and the laws, in force,

require the State to make provisions for economic and social

advancement of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The SC

and ST Reservation Act, submits the learned Advocate General, has

been enacted to reserve seats for the candidates of Scheduled Castes

and Scheduled Tribes, in educational institutions too, for their

educational, social and economic advancement. Fundamental Rights

and the Directive Principles together constitute, points out Mr. Kundu,

the conscience of the Constitution. In support of his submission, that

Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles, when combined

together, constitute the conscience of the Constitution, Mr. Kundu has

placed reliance upon the case of <a href="/doc/978175/" id="a_19">V. Markendeya v. State of A.P</a>.,

<p id="p_73">15.   It is also submitted by Mr. Kundu that being a beneficial

legislation, the statute, i.e., the SC and ST Reservation Act, should

receive liberal construction from the Court with a view of ensuring

effective implementation of the legislative intent.   At the same time,

Mr. Kundu also points out, that whenever such beneficial legislation

has a scheme of its own, the Court cannot travel beyond the scheme of

the legislation and extend the scope of the statute to anyone on the

pretext of extending the statutory benefit to those, who are not covered

been covered by the SC and ST Reservation Act, the children of the

writ petitioners cannot be given the benefit of the SC and ST

respondents are concerned, they are, according to learned Advocate

General, within the ambit of their power in relying upon the policy

decision of the State Government, as evidenced by the three

memoranda         aforementioned,   which,   undoubtedly,        provide     for

exchange method so far as the admission of the Scheduled Caste and

which the State respondents seek to give to the SCs, are in keeping

with the scheme of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_29">Article 15(4)</a> inasmuch as special provisions need

not necessarily be made by legislation and can, therefore, be made,

contends Mr. Bhowmik, by executive instructions as have been done

in the present case.

</p><p id="p_78">19.   Referring to, and relying upon, a decision of a Division Bench of

The State of Tripura</a> and 4 others), decided on 22-04-1985, Mr.

of <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_31">R. Chitralekha &amp; Venkatesubba Reddy -vs- State of Mysore and

and would not vitiate the executive decision and that by an executive

Mr. Somik Deb, learned counsel, has submitted that though <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_34">Article

15(4)</a> permits the State to make special provisions for advancement of,

amongst others, SC and ST, the State cannot make provisions for

reservations, in favour of the SC and ST, so far as admissions, in

educational institutions, are concerned, by taking recourse to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_35">Article

15(4)</a> inasmuch as such a reservation can, now, be made, contends

Mr. Deb, by resorting to Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_36">Article 15;</a> but this clause makes

it clear, points out Mr. Deb, that the reservation has to be made 'by

law'.

<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">23.     In the present case, according to Mr. Deb, there is no 'law'

recourse to exchange method. This apart, by referring to Rule 13(5)

Rules, 1992 (in short, 'the Rules of 1992'), Mr. Deb submits that Rule

13(5) makes provisions for carrying forward of the reserved posts, in

Government services, in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

Tribes and Rule 8(8) makes provisions for exchange method for filling

up unreserved seats so far as recruitments to Government services are

concerned; whereas no such provisions for carrying forward or

exchange method have been made, points out Mr. Deb, in the SC and

admission into educational institutions.

of the SC and ST Reservation Act and/or the Rules framed thereunder,

such a decision cannot survive, because Section 16 has overriding

effect on all the laws, which run contrary thereto and there need not,

necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_95">
</p><p id="p_96">28.      What, therefore, can be deduced from <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_48">Article 15(5)</a> is that the

State cannot make special provisions for reservation of seats, in favour

of SC or ST, so far as admissions to educational institutions are

concerned, except by making 'law', as envisaged by <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_49">Article 15(5).</a>


</p><p id="p_97">29.      What also needs to be noted is that while <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_50">Article 15(4)</a> enables

the State to make special provisions for advancement of any socially

and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled

Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_51">Article 15(5)</a> makes it clear that the

special provisions, in so far as the same relate to admissions in

educational institutions, the same cannot be made except by means of

'law'.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">30.      It is time to point out that, while interpreting an Article of the

Constitution, which makes an enabling provision resulting into

negation of the equality clause enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_52">Article 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_53">Article 15(1</a>),

enabling provision deserves strict construction so that none derives

benefit by defeating the guarantee of equality.


</p><p id="p_100">31.   One can also not lose sight of the fact that there is nothing on

record to show that the memoranda, which the respondents rely upon,

were a result of the decision taken by the Cabinet or any authority,

authorized in this behalf, in terms of the Rules of Executive Business

of the State Government and in tune with <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_56">Article 166(3)</a> of the

Constitution of India.     It is undisputable that an administrative

instruction is not a law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_57">Article 13</a> of the

Constitution (<a href="/doc/198954261/" id="a_58">See Dwarka Nath Tewari and others v. State of Bihar</a>

</p><p id="p_101">32.   Whether the 'law', which <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_61">Article 15(5)</a> speaks of, has to be a

legislation or it can be a decision, in terms of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_62">Article 162</a> read with

<a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_63">Article 166</a>, is not material in the present case, because there is

already a piece of legislation covering the field, in the State of Tripura,

inasmuch as the SC and ST Reservation Act had, originally, provided

for reservation in favour of SC and ST so far as recruitment to State

Government services were concerned. Consequently, even the relevant

rules, namely, the Rules of 1992, originally, made provisions so far as

recruitments to Government services were concerned and it was on

introduction of Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_64">Article 15</a> by the Constitution (Ninety-

third) <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_65">Amendment Act</a>, 2005 (which came into effect on 20-01-2006),

that the provisions for reservation, in favour of SC and ST, in matters

of admission in educational institution were made by <a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_66">Section 5</a> with

effect on 14-02-2006.
</p>
<p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">33.   Thus, the provisions, for reservation, under the SC and ST

Reservation Act, in favour of SC and ST, in matters of their admission

into educational institutions, have been made by deriving strength

from <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_68">Article 15(5)</a> and, that too, with effect from 14.02.2006. <a href="/doc/1905325/" id="a_69">Section 5</a>

reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "5. Reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
      Tribes in educational Institutions, in selection of students
      for higher studies and in selection of candidates and in-
      service personnel for higher studies and training:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            (a) There shall be seventeen percent reservation for the
      Scheduled Castes and thirty-one percent reservation for the

      for higher studies or training;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            Provided that the State Government may, from time to time,
      review the implementation of the reservation policy and take
      adequate    measures     including   increase   of   percentage     of
      reservation as mentioned in Sub-Section (a) above;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            (b) The candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes and
      the Scheduled Tribes who qualify for selection on merit, shall be
      included in the general list and not against the reserved quota."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_105">34.   From a careful reading of <a href="/doc/1905325/" id="a_70">Section 5</a>, what becomes evident is

that <a href="/doc/1905325/" id="a_71">Section 5</a> makes provisions for reservation to the extent of 17% in

favour of SC and to the extent of 31% in favour of ST in matters of

admission of students to educational institutions making it further

clear that the candidates belonging to SC and ST, who qualify for

selection on merit, shall be included in the general list and not against

reserved quota. There is, admittedly, no provisions, in the SC and ST


WP(C) Nos. 144 of 2011, 195/11 &amp; 205 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                             Page No. 24</span>

<a href="/doc/755257/" id="a_72">Reservation Act</a> and/or the Rules framed thereunder, for carrying

forward the unfilled reserved seats nor is there any provisions for

taking resort to exchange method meaning thereby that the seats,

which are left vacant due to non-availability of candidates, belonging

to ST, cannot be filled up by the candidates of SC and vice-versa. In

short, there is absolutely no provision made, in <a href="/doc/1187668/" id="a_73">Section 5</a>, allowing the

unfilled seats of any of the reserved categories to be filled up by the

other reserved category.
</p>
<p id="p_106">35.   Contrary to the above scheme of the SC and ST Reservation Act

in respect of admission to educational institutions, Rule 13(5) make

not only provisions for maintenance of roster, but also makes it clear

by the proviso appended thereto that the rule of carrying forward shall

not apply to the case of admissions to educational institutions. This

apart, Rule 8(8) makes provisions for exchange method to be applied in

matters of recruitments; but no such provision has been made as far

as admissions to educational institutions are concerned.


</p><p id="p_107">36.   The scheme of the SC and ST Reservation Act, therefore, is that

when the seats, meant to be kept reserved for SC and ST, are left

vacant, the same shall have to be filled up irrespective of castes and

on the basis of merit alone. When the scheme of the SC and ST

Reservation Act is to fill up the vacant seats, on merit, in a case of

present nature, there cannot be any policy decision of the State

Government, in the form of the memoranda, which the respondents

are relying upon, defeating the scheme of the sovereign legislation. If

the provisions of the memoranda are given effect to, it would,

undoubtedly, negate and defeat the scheme of the sovereign legislation

(i.e., SC and ST Reservation Act), which is wholly impermissible in law.

In a case of the present nature, the reference made by Mr. Deb,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                 Page No. 25</span>

learned counsel, to the case of <a href="/doc/1347921/" id="a_74">Jagdish Singh v. Punjab Engineering

College</a>, reported in (2009) 7 SCC 300, is not wholly misplaced

inasmuch as it has observed, in Jagdish Singh (supra), at paragraph

3, as under:
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               "3. We are told that in many of the Central educational
       institutions the seats, which are to be filled up by OBC
       candidates, are still remaining vacant.       These institutions may
       endeavour to fill up these vacant seats by other eligible students
       at the earliest i.e. at least by the end of October, 2008, observing
       inter se merit of the candidates. All other rules and regulations
       regarding admissions shall be strictly followed. The application is
       disposed of accordingly."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_109">37.    It may also be pointed out that the decision, in Jagdish Singh

(supra), has been followed, as rightly submitted by Mr. Deb, in P.V.

Indiresan (2) v. Union of India and others, reported in (2011) 8 SCC

</p><p id="p_110">441.


</p><p id="p_111">38.    There can be no doubt, as laid down by the Supreme Court, in

<a href="/doc/1438539/" id="a_75">Regional Director, ESI Corpn. V. Ramanuja Match Industries</a>,

reported in (1985) 1 SCC 218, that beneficial legislation should

receive   liberal   construction   with   a   view   to   ensuring   effective

implementation of legislative intent, but wherever such beneficial

legislation has a scheme of its own, the Court cannot travel beyond the

scheme and extend the scope of the statute on the pretext of extending

the statutory benefit to those, who are not covered by the scheme.

What can be gathered from the decision, in Ramanuja Match

Industries (supra), is that the scheme of beneficial legislation has to

be respected and cannot be allowed to be overridden by anyone, far

less the State, because the State is free to make amendment of the


WP(C) Nos. 144 of 2011, 195/11 &amp; 205 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                 Page No. 26</span>

scheme of the beneficial legislation so long as the amendments are in

tune with the Constitutional scheme.           A beneficial legislation must

receive a liberal construction so as to promote its object.


</p><p id="p_112">39.   In V. Markendeya v. State of A. P., reported in (1989) 3 SCC

191, the Court has clarified that the provisions, contained in the

Chapter of Directive Principles of State Policy, cannot be enforced by

Courts, although the principles, contained therein, are fundamental in

nature for governance of our country and, while considering the

question of enforcement of fundamental rights, it is open to the Court

to be guided by the Directive Principles to ensure that, while doing

justice, the principles, contained therein, are maintained.


</p><p id="p_113">40.   The learned Advocate General is correct, when he places reliance

on the case of V. Markendeya (supra), and submits that fundamental

rights and the Directive Principles together constitute the conscience

of the Constitution and that the Constitution aims at bringing about a

synthesis between fundamental rights and Directive Principles of State

Policy by giving to the former a place of pride and to the latter a place

of permanence.      Fundamental rights and the Directive Principles of

State Policy not only form core of the Constitution, but also constitute

its true conscience and without faithfully implementing the Directive

Principles, it is not possible to achieve the welfare State contemplated

by the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_114">
</p><p id="p_115">41.   Coupled with the above, <a href="/doc/689885/" id="a_76">Section 16</a>, which gives to the scheme

of the SC and ST Reservation Act overriding power, reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            "16. Act to override other laws. Save as expressly
      provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act and the rules made
      there-under      shall   have   effect     notwithstanding   anything

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                              Page No. 27</span>

       inconsistent therewith contained in any other law, rules,
       regulations or orders for the time being in force or any decree or
       order of any Court or other authority."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_116">42.    From a bare reading of the provisions embodied in <a href="/doc/689885/" id="a_77">Section 16</a>,

what becomes transparent is that the provisions of the SC and ST

Reservation Act and the Rules made thereunder shall override any

other law, rules, regulations and order made or passed by any other

authority. When the memoranda, relied upon by the respondents, seek

to override the scheme of the SC and ST Reservation Act by providing

exchange method, the same must be taken to have been overridden by

<a href="/doc/689885/" id="a_78">Section 16</a> and the memoranda aforementioned and cannot, therefore,

be allowed to prevail upon the scheme of the SC and ST Reservation

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_117">
</p><p id="p_118">43.    In the backdrop of the respective cases, set out by the parties

concerned, and the submissions, made on their behalf, let me point

out, as has been rightly done by the learned Advocate General, that

<a href="/doc/1805662/" id="a_79">Section 2(d)</a> defines Educational institutions to mean, inter alia, any

school, and this shows that, as far as the schools, in question, are

concerned, these schools fall within the ambit of the SC and ST

Reservation Act. The fact that the schools fall within the ambit of the

SC and ST Reservation Act is, in fact, not in dispute.

</p><p id="p_119">44.    In the face of the above scheme of the SC and ST Reservation

Act, when one refers to the decisions, in Ramanuja Match Industries

(supra), Bombay Anand Bhavan Restaurant (supra), Edukanti

Kistamma (supra), Revanasiddappa (supra) and Nidip Textile

Processors (supra), which the learned Advocate General has relied

upon, it becomes abundantly clear that though the SC and ST

Reservation Act is a beneficial legislation, it has its own scheme of


WP(C) Nos. 144 of 2011, 195/11 &amp; 205 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                Page No. 28</span>

reservation and the Court cannot travel beyond the scheme of the SC

and ST Reservation Act and thereby extend the scope of the statute. It

is necessary, therefore, that when the SC and ST Reservation Act does

not allow filling up of unfilled seats of one reserved category by

another reserved category, the Court does not allow deviation from the

scheme of the SC and ST Reservation Act by such exchange method, as

is sought to be resorted to by the State respondents, in the present

case.
</p>
<p id="p_120">45.     As regards the learned Advocate General's contention, that the

benefit of the SC and ST Reservation Act cannot be extended to the

candidates of the general category, such as, the present petitioners'

children, suffice it to point out that reservation is an exception to the

fundamental right of non-discrimination.          <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_80">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_81">15</a> of the

Constitution,    when    combined     together,    guarantee   equality   of

treatment to everyone irrespective of their caste in the matter of

admission in educational institutions.      However, <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_82">Article 15(4</a>), read

with <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_83">Article 15(5</a>), empower the State to make special provisions for

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for their advancement and it

is by taking recourse to the Constitutional provisions, enshrined in

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_84">Article 15(5</a>), that reservations, in favour of Scheduled Castes and the

Scheduled Tribes, have been made, in the present case, in the form of

SC and ST Reservation Act. Consequently, it is for the State to show

that the 'law', which it has made, permits exchange method; or else,

the children of the petitioners are, as of right, entitled to claim

admission in the schools, in question.
</p>
<p id="p_121">46.     As the respondents failed, and failed miserably, to show that it is

permissible, under the scheme of the sovereign legislation, i.e., SC and

ST Reservation Act, to resort to exchange method and thereby allow


WP(C) Nos. 144 of 2011, 195/11 &amp; 205 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                  Page No. 29</span>

admission of the candidates of Scheduled Castes in the seats, which

have been left vacant, from the reserved quota of the Scheduled Tribe

candidates, there can be no escape from the conclusion, and this

Court unhesitatingly holds, that the children of the writ petitioners

are, under the law, entitled to be admitted into the schools, in

question, in terms of the prayers made in this regard.

</p><p id="p_122">47.   Because of what have been discussed and pointed out above, all

the   three   writ   petitions   are   hereby   allowed.   The    impugned

Notifications, dated 19.03.2011, and 25.04.2011, are hereby set aside

Nos. 3 and 4, with regard to allowing the candidates belonging to
