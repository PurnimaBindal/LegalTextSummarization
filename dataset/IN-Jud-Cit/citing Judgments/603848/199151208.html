                Dated this the 7th day of July, 2017

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This is an application filed by the petitioner invoking <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section

9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (for short 'the

Act') seeking an interim measure before commencement of the

arbitral proceedings. Initially, the registry has noted      a defect

with respect to the request made by the petitioner before this

Court to secure an interim measure under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Act,

1996, especially as per the agreement, the place of arbitration is

designated in Singapore. The said question was considered by

this Court and passed an order dated 20.2.2017, after hearing

rival parties, whereby it is held that, as provided under sub

section (2) of <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> of the Act it is evident that, subject to an

agreement to the contrary the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_5">Section 9</a>

shall apply to international commercial arbitration, even if the

place of arbitration is outside India, if an arbitral award made/to

be made in such place is enforceable and recognized under

provisions of Part II of Act, 1996. It is also found that the

agreement     specifically provides,    the   agreement     shall  be

construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of India

and shall be subject to the courts of Thiruvananthapuram,

Kerala State and therefore, the application is maintainable

before this Court under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_6">Section 9</a> of the Act, 1996, which has

become final.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    Material facts for the disposal of ICA are as follows:-

On 27.11.2001 a memorandum of understanding is entered into

by and between the petitioner and the respondent for the

marketing, sale and distribution, and possible manufacturing of

Female condom (hereinafter referred to as FC1), in India in four

distinct phases. At the outset it is stated that, the petitioner is a

company incorporated in the United Kingdom. While so, on

23.8.2003 a Distribution Agreement was signed between the

petitioner and the respondent. As per the said agreement,

petitioner      appointed  the    respondent    as   its   exclusive

independent marketer and distributor in the prescribed territory

for FC1. As per the Marketing Agreement all the confidential

information and other Intellectual property was owned solely

and exclusively by the petitioner and would remain the

exclusive property of the petitioner, and the respondent have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

no right, title or interest in or to any of the confidential

information.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    On 3.3.2006 the petitioner and the respondent

entered into another memorandum of understanding noting that

the petitioner had developed a nitrile based female condom

(hereinafter referred to as FC2), having similar features to the

FC1 and the parties agreed to promptly enter into discussion

and subject to the result of the same, negotiate a formal

agreement        to  include a  non-disclosure  of   confidential

information clause. The manufacture of FC2 in India was to be

conducted in two phases - Phase 1          related to the part,

manufacturing        of FC2 in India, which included inspection,

lubrication and packaging and Phase 2 related to the respondent

undertaking manufacturing of FC2 in India as per the

requirement of local and global demand for regions and

countries agreed on.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.    On 10.10.2006 parties again entered into an interim

agreement, whereby petitioner agreed to provide the required

machinery/equipment on loan basis as well as to provide

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

necessary training at the petitioner's facilities to employees of

respondent and right to sell the product manufactured during

the training period in advance to the parties concluding a

mutually acceptable Interim Agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    On 29.5.2008, to bring into effect the 2006 MOU and

the interim agreement, petitioner and respondent executed the

manufacturing        agreement. As    per    the    manufacturing

agreement, respondent had decided to set up a manufacturing

unit at Plot No.16/A1 possessed by the respondent at Cochin

Special Economic Zone, Kochi for manufacturing FC2. For the

purpose of setting up the manufacturing unit at Economic Zone,

petitioner agreed to provide the required machinery/equipment

and necessary training to the employees of the respondent.

According to the petitioner, by virtue of the manufacturing

agreement, petitioner granted the exclusive right and license to

use its Intellectual property to the respondent. Petitioner was

the sole owner of the Intellectual property licensed to the

respondent. Such Intellectual Property included the know-how ,

technical data and processes including inter alia blue prints,

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                5</span>

specifications, formulae, descriptions of processes, designs, and

other forms of recorded information and other tangible things

relating to such data. That apart it is stated, the respondent

was barred under the Manufacturing Agreement, to assign,

transfer, sublicense, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise permit,

authorise, dispose of or encumber the right to use or any use or

any part of the Intellectual Property including the trade mark,

drawings, copy right or the technical know-how owned by the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    On 6.10.2009, E-mails were sent by and between

parties discussing the possibility of a further licensing

agreement to increase the reach of the product to other

markets and exchanged draft agreement. On 2.9.2010, the

respondent issued to the petitioner a notice of an intention to

terminate       the  marketing  Agreement    as   well   as   the

manufacturing agreement on various grounds. On 16.9.2010

petitioner replied to the respondent's intention to terminate

denying the grounds stated therein. According to the petitioner,

respondent thereafter has not acted further on the course of

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>

termination. On 10th and 11th October, 2010, parties convened

a meeting and the respondent indicated the need to have a new

agreement for the distribution and manufacturing of the Female

Condom. Further, the parties jointly discussed the development

of a new generation - latex based version of FC2 in India. On

21.10.2010, the petitioner addressed an e-mail to the

respondent providing further information on the specifications

inter   alia    including information  regarding   material,  bio-

compatibility and stability of the natural rubber latex version of

FC2 proposed to be developed. On 25.2.2011, the respondent

informed the petitioner of its intention to independently work on

the natural latex based FC. On 28.4.2011, according to the

petitioner, an e-mail was forwarded by the respondent

containing a draft of the new manufacturing agreement.        On

12.5.2011 a reply was issued to the petitioner asserting that if

any proprietary contributions made by the petitioner and used

by the respondent, the same would be retained by the

petitioner. Accordingly, a clause in the draft New manufacturing

Agreement, provided by the respondent, contradicting the

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>

above understanding pointed out in the e-mail. Thereafter, on

25.9.2014, an e-mail was forwarded by the respondent to the

petitioner requesting clarifications on the way in relation to the

collaboration of the parties for the development of the Natural

Rubber Latex version of FC2. On 5.5.2015, a reply was sent by

the petitioner conveying its intension to resume the discussion

for creating a new collaboration by and between the parties,

that would resolve any issues and create a successful future for

both the companies. Thereafter, various correspondence were

made by and between the parties. However, on 6.4.2016

petitioner became aware of the respondent's manufacture of the

Natural Rubber Latex version of FC2 by way of a news article

under the brand name of "Velvet". It further became aware

that, the product title "Velvet" had been pre-qualified by the

WHO and UNFPA in March 2016 and that the respondent had

filed an Indian Patent for the product in Brazil, South Africa and

African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO). On

31.8.2016, petitioner was informed that, respondent was

awarded an international tender and respondent's export of 1.3

million units of latex based FC2 to the African countries Gambia

and Burkina Faso and Dominican Republic in the Caribbean.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.    According to the petitioner, on 9.1.2017 petitioner

issued a letter to the respondent as required by <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_7">Article 30.1</a> of

the manufacturing agreement informing the respondent that a

dispute has arisen between the parties and attempting to

amicably resolve the same.            On 17.1.2017 the respondent

replied to the letter, purporting to defence its actions based on

false and frivolous grounds. These are the facts projected by

the petitioner to secure the reliefs sought for under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_8">Section 9</a> of

the Act, 1996, which are as follows:-

claims and demands raised by the petitioner. That apart it is

contended that, an application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_9">Section 9</a> of the Act, 1996

is not maintainable before this Court since the seat of

arbitration as per the manufacturing agreement entered into by

and between the parties, shall be Singapore or such other

place/s parties shall subsequently agree upon.       Therefore in

view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_10">Article 30</a> of the agreement, Part I of

the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_11">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 is not applicable, and

this Court is not vested with jurisdiction to entertain and

adjudicate upon the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_12">Section 9</a> of the Act.

However, as pointed out earlier, a learned single Judge of this

Court has considered the said question and has held that the

application is maintainable under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_13">Section 9</a> before this Court,

and therefore, the said finding rendered by the learned single

Judge has become final in that regard.      It is also contended

that, the petitioner has no grievance and cause of action against

the respondent, and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to

secure the reliefs sought for in the application. That apart it is

contended that, the alleged grievance and cause of action of the

petitioner is under manufacturing agreement dated 29.5.2008.

However, as per a notice issued by the respondent dated

2.9.2010 in terms of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the agreement, the

manufacturing agreement dated 29.5.2008 stands terminated,

and therefore, the arbitration clause contained thereunder

cannot be invoked by the petitioner to seek any relief under

<a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_15">Section 9</a> of the Act, 1996. It is      also contended that, the

dispute or claims alleged by the petitioner on the basis of

agreement dated 29.5.2008 is barred by limitation. That apart it

is submitted, the respondent is a Government of India

Enterprises       incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_16">Companies Act</a>, 1956

having its registered office at Thiruvananthapuram. It is a multi-

manufacturing        of condom   and   other   related  products,

pharmaceutical       and   medicinal  preparations,   and   other

healthcare products and distributing them throughout the

country as well as exporting them presently to over 115

countries across the world. Respondent has vast array of

innovative products, services and social programs to meet

country's healthcare needs. It is based on the said extensive

experience, innovative technologies and ample resources

reaching across the globe, respondent's service and products

are part of the global healthcare package of International

agencies such as United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA),

United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), World

Health Organizations(WHO), Population Services International

submitted that,       the respondent is one of the         largest

manufacturer of the product mentioned above in the world. The

respondent       manufactures     and markets     vide range of

contraceptives for male and female and intra-uterine devices,

respondent have the state of the art research and development

facilities that enable it to provide highest quality of healthcare

products. Respondent has been in existence and was engaged

respondent has developed novel products like low-protein

condoms, EMILY-hormone releasing intrauterine systems, etc.,

etc.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      9.    It is submitted that, the respondent had executed an

exclusive      marketing    and    distribution agreement      and

manufacturing agreement dated 23.8.2003 and 29.5.2008,

respectively. The agreement dated 23.8.2003 relates to

appointment of the respondent as an exclusive independent

marketer and distributor solely in the territory ie., India for the

product viz., petitioner's tubular prophylactic plastic barrier

device for protection against      transfer of infectious diseases

and     against      pregnancy  during    sexual  activities.  The

manufacturing agreement relates to grant, to the respondent

an exclusive right and license to use the Intellectual Property of

the petitioner detailed in schedule B to the agreement including

identified patents, trademarks, drawings, technical information

solely in the testing, packaging and sale of the product i.e.,

nitrile  version of the FC2 as set forth in Schedule A in the

territory ie., India or any other countries mutually added to the

2.9.2010 terminated both the agreements ie., agreements

dated 23.8.2003 and 29.5.2008. After the termination of the

two agreements, admittedly, no new agreements were executed

and signed between the petitioner and the respondent, which

thus means the aforesaid agreements ceased to be valid and

inforce after termination by notice dated 2.9.2010. It is also

submitted that, the petitioner and the respondent has accepted

this fact in the subsequent meetings held between them. That

apart it is contended that, as a manufacturer of natural latex

products for the past 50 years and well versed with the

technology to make any latex based products, respondent has

developed and started manufacturing natural rubber latex

female condom using its own know-how and technology. That

apart it is stated, the design of the said product is based on

Dr.Lesse Hessel's Patent No.4,735,621 filed in 1987, which has

now expired and is in public domain. The over all design of the

product is generic in nature as in the case of the male product.

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               15</span>

The product is produced by a new improved process for

manufacturing the female version of the product which

comprises the tubular sheath and exterior bead and the

retention device. The tubular sheath is manufactured by two

stage dipping process and the exterior bead is formed by rolling

the tubular sheath, itself. No adhesive is applied for rolling and

beading       the exterior bead. Therefore, according to the

respondent, these facts would show that respondent's product is

entirely different in material formulation and process.       That

apart it is stated that, the rubber latex female product

manufactured and marketed by the respondent is not identical

to the female product manufactured by the petitioner. Yet

another contention advanced is that, the product manufactured

by the respondent is made from natural rubber latex, whereas,

the product manufactured by the petitioner is nitrile based

version. Respondent's product is manufactured using a special

formulation which provides desired modulus to the product and

increases the stiffness of the exterior bead, and the same is

free from any coagulant material and no adhesive is used in

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 16</span>

the exterior bead as in the case of petitioner's product FC2.

</p><p id="p_19">      11. That apart it is submitted that, there is also

considerable reduction in the protein level in the final product

minimising allergy associated with the use of natural rubber

latex. It is also stated that, the natural rubber latex female

product was launched in the international market in the year

2015      and      have   been   continuously   and   extensively

manufacturing and marketing the said product ever since then.

That part it is contended that, the respondent has conducted a

Freedom to Operate Search before launching product and after

ensuring that       the product does not infringe any third party

patents including that of the petitioner's product, FC2, adequate

steps were taken to market and sell it. Further respondent has

applied for patent for natural rubber latex female product in

many countries and has been granted patent in African Regional

Intellectual Property Organization countries ie., Kenya, Rwanda,

Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda etc. etc., evident from Exts R1 and

R1(b).    Therefore, according to the respondent the grant of

patents are indication of the uniqueness, differentiation of

Natural Rubber Latex female product and non- infringement of

patent held by any party including the petitioner. That part it

is stated, respondent has also filed a patent in India under the

title "An improved female condom and the process of

manufacturing the same using Natural Rubber Latex", which is

under examination stage.          Therefore, according to the

respondent, the contentions with respect to the breach of the

Intellectual Property and confidentiality clause in the agreement

executed with the petitioner are all incorrect and cannot be

sustained for the purpose of considering the application under

<a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_17">Section 9</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      12. Therefore,    according   to    the   respondent,   the

contention raised by the petitioner that respondent used the

confidential information as a spring board to jump into same

field for respondent's unjust enrichment and to the detriment of

petitioner are all incorrect. That part all the allegations and

other issues with respect to the breach of the confidentiality

provisions of the manufacturing agreement etc., are all denied

by the petitioner. That part, a predominant contention is

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  18</span>

advanced to the effect that, petitioner had provided machinery

for testing and packing of FC2 and not for manufacturing of

FC2. Petitioner had only supplied components and materials for

assembling, testing and packing of the product FC2. So also

the statement that, the technical file were handed over to the

respondent containing confidential and technical information, is

denied, and it is submitted that, technical file contained only

data/information for marketing of assembled product as well as

information       necessary, to   obtain  certification from    the

appropriate agencies. Other allegations and contentions with

respect to violation of agreements are all denied by the

respondent. Various certificates are produced to controvert the

allegations made in the petition that the product manufactured

by the respondent is much cheaper and an inferior version of

the petitioner's product. Other contentions with respect to the

use of petitioner's valuable commercial information including list

of petitioner's clients in the international market are all denied.

That apart it is submitted that, respondent is participating in the

international tenders in accordance with the norms prescribed

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                19</span>

by such authorities. The resemblance of the product, identity

and other aspects are all denied by the respondent. The

contention with respect to the equipment used by the

respondent copied by it on the basis of the equipment provided

by the petitioner under the manufacturing agreement is also

denied. The petitioner has produced Ext.R12 to belie the

contention that the machineries supplied by the petitioner are

used by the respondent, and that apart it is contended that,

the machinery for manufacturing was secured by the petitioner

through tender process. It is also stated that, the respondent is

issued with a product registration certificate by Brazilian

National Health Surveillance Agency on the basis of good

manufacturing practice approved by the said organization,

which enables the respondent to participate in the Brazilian

tender for the product in the year, 2017. Therefore, it is

contended        that, if the respondent    is  restrained  from

manufacturing and selling the latex version of the female

product it would adversely affect its business right and interest,

which will cause irreparable injury, hardship and substantial loss

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                20</span>

to the respondent. It is also stated that, if the respondent is

restrained by an order in participating in the tender it would

result in huge loss to the respondent, which cannot be

compensated in a later phase as international tender for female

product are usually released within the time frame of three

years.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      13. Yet another contention advanced by the respondent is

that, after termination of the agreement in the year, 2010 it has

ceased to test and package the product FC2 and is not using the

equipments and material supplied by the petitioner to the

respondent under the manufacturing agreement. It is also

stated, the respondent had duly informed this fact to the

petitioner. Further <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_18">Article 23</a> of the manufacturing agreement

deals with right of the petitioner for dispossession of machinery

and equipment and in view of this fact that, the relief prayed for

by the petitioner as clause 'd"        is unsustainable and the

petitioner is not entitled to get the same.

received royalty from various other organizations abroad during

the year 2011, and therefore, it is contended that the petitioner

has no manner of claim over the same. Therefore, respondent

seeks dismissal of the application.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      15. During the pendency of the above application various

documents        are produced  by    the  petitioner  along   with

agreements entered into by the respondent with various

international organizations.

<p id="p_24">      16. A reply affidavit is filed by the petitioner refuting the

allegations, claims and demands raised by the respondent. That

apart it is stated that, the documents produced by the

respondent would show that the royalties were received in the

year 2012, which evinces the fact that the manufacturing

agreement was not terminated. That apart the petitioner was

providing material to the respondent even after the purported

termination of the manufacturing agreement which clearly

reflects that the manufacturing agreement was not terminated

Additionally, the supply of the product in 2012, technical file,

information and supply of sheaths by the petitioner in 2012-

2013, contradicts the contention of the respondent that, the

manufacturing agreement was terminated and a copy of the

invoice dated 7.3.2012 is produced as Ext.P28. Other

contentions are also raised refuting the contentions raised by

the petitioner in the counter affidavit as well as in the additional

counter affidavit.

it clear that, the subject matter of the dispute revolves around

Ext.P4 manufacturing agreement entered into by and between

the parties, apart from other agreements entered into by and

between the parties as a prelude to the manufacturing

agreement. On a reading of Ext.P4 it opens with a word WHERE

AS (a) the parties have entered into a Memorandum of

Understanding dated 3rd March 2006 recording their intention to

manufacture FC2 Nitrile version of Female condom in India in

two phases. (b) the parties have subsequently held discussions

regarding implementation of the 1st Phase mentioned in the

MOU dated 3rd March 2006 i.e., setting up a facility for

manufacture of FC2 Nitrile version in India. All other clauses

recited to therein would show that, the agreement Ext.P4 was

entered into by and between the parties for the purpose of

manufacture of FC2 Nitrile version of the product in India. That

apart, it was agreed by and between the parties that pending

formulation and setting up of a joint venture company as

mentioned in the MOU dated 3.3.2006, HLL has decided to set

up a manufacturing facility in a plot at Cochin Special Economic

Zone, which would be transferred to the JVC upon its

establishment.       That apart, the "product"   is defined under

Apart from all these aspects, various datas are provided by the

latex version of FC2 is absolutely resembling the Nitrile version of

FC2.
</p>
<p id="p_38">      24. Based on the covenants contained under Ext.P4, the

predominant arguments advanced by learned senior counsel for

the petitioner is that, the respondent was never in the

manufacturing field of female condom and so far as the

technological know-how, technical and physical features, the

manufacturing process, and the details with respect to the

machineries for manufacturing are all provided by the petitioner.

It is also submitted that, as per the terms and conditions of Ext.P4

manufacturing agreement the respondent was expected to protect

the interest of the petitioner, especially, in terms of the

confidentiality clause agreed by and between the parties.   It    is

also contended that, even though the respondent was in the

manufacturing of male latex        product, the respondent never

manufactured the female condom, and therefore, the idea of

manufacturing such a product was provided by the petitioner and

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                  33</span>

therefore, the respondent has adopted a spring board jump to

capture the business in the manufacture of female product by

using Latex. It is also contended that, various discussions and

negotiations were made by and between the petitioner and the

respondent in respect of manufacture of latex version of FC2. It is

also contended that, even though it is alleged that the respondent

has terminated the manufacturing agreement as per Ext.P15 dated

2.9.2010, the same did not constitute a termination of the

agreement, but, by that notice the respondent expressed his

intention to terminate the manufacturing agreement alone, and

therefore, the contention advanced by the respondent that there is

termination of the agreement in year 2010, cannot be sustained

under law.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      25. Per       contra, learned counsel  for  the  respondent

submitted that, Ext.P4 agreement strictly confines to the

manufacture of FC2 Nitrile version in India and it has got nothing

to do with the respondent manufacturing latex version of female

condom. It is also contended that, there is no patent or trademark

for the petitioner as a sole player in the world market for

manufacturing, marketing and selling the FC2, Nitrile version. It is

also    argued      that, various   manufacturers   are   available

internationally, manufacturing the very same product. That apart it

is contended that, petitioner has not produced any evidence before

this Court, in order to establish that the product manufactured by

the respondent using latex is resembling the product manufactured

by the petitioner except a photograph as an attempt to establish

that, there is glaring similarity by and between the products

manufactured by both parties. It is also submitted that, the

products manufactured by the petitioner as well as respondent are

all internationally acclaimed products, which have got standard

designs and measurements nationally and internationally.      That

apart it is contended that, apart from the covenants contained in

Ext.P4, the schedules provided thereto deals with the nature of

machineries as well as the products supplied by the petitioner. On

a reading of Schedule A it is clear that, the machineries and

equipments provided in Schedule C is nothing, but, equipments

used for assembling and packaging of the products. Therefore

according to learned counsel for the respondent, the respondent

was engaged actually in assembling the products supplied by the

petitioner and the technical know-how with respect to the

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017

manufacture of the said products were never furnished to the

respondent. It is also contended that, the term manufacturing

employed in Ext.P4 confines only to the nature of the

manufacturing process carried out by the respondent by using the

machineries contained under Schedule C.         That apart it is

contended that, since the respondent was also a player in the field

of manufacturing of the products in question for the past more

than 50 years, they are seasoned and they have got established

technical know-how to manufacture latex version of the female

condom. It is also submitted that, the standard specifications are

accepted in the international market for these products and also

submitted that, the technical know-how       was secured by the

petitioner from Dr.Lesse Hessel.

<p id="p_40">      26. Apart from the factual circumstances put forth by

learned senior counsel for the petitioner, learned senior counsel

has relied on various judgments (1) Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/1739601/" id="a_47">John

Richard Brady v. Chemical Process Equipment P. Ltd</a> (AIR

LTD. v. SUNDIAL COMMUNICATIONS PVT. LTD &amp; ORS</a>.

[2003 Vol. 105 (3) Bom.L.R.678] to canvass the confidentiality

proposition put forth by the petitioner. The first among the

decision cited (supra) John Richard Brady, dealt with a case

in respect of permanent injunction to restrain the defendants

from infringing copyright of the plaintiffs, from passing off

defendants products as those of the plaintiffs for rendition of

accounts      etc.,  etc.  True,    after    ascertaining     the   facts

circumstances involved in the said case has held in paragraph

37 as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_41">


   "in these circumstances no opinion can be finally expressed at

   this stage on the question of infringement of copyright claimed

   by the plaintiffs in drawings of Brady by the production of the

   machines in question by the defendants, but, the plaintiffs have

   made out a strong prima facie case of infringement of their

   copyright and of strict confidentiality under which specifications,

   drawings and other technical information about the FPU were

   supplied to the defendants, which the defendants will have to

   meet at the trial of the suit".
</p>
<p id="p_42">      Therefore, it was held that the balance of convenience is

clearly infavour of the plaintiffs in granting an injunction.

media consultant        conceiving an idea of a reality Televesion

registered under a copyright and disclosed to the defendants in

confidentiality. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

the court held as follows in paragraph 38:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "The concept developed and evolved by the plaintiff is the

     result of the work done by the plaintiff upon material which

     may be available for the use of anybody but what makes it

     confidential is the fact that the plaintiff has used his brain

     and thus produced a result in the shape of a concept and

     and if defendants are allowed to show their own reality show

     based on the concept originally conceived by the plaintiff, it

     will be allowing the defendant to use that concept and to

     reap the fruit of the labour of the plaintiff. In such kind of

     cases the defendant must be placed under special disability

     in the filed to competition to ensure that he does not get an

     unfair start."
</blockquote>

</p><p id="p_45">      28. In Urmi Juvekar Chiang referred to supra, the

Bombay High Court was dealing with the ad interim relief

claimed by the plaintiff, who was a reputed script writer having

scripted various films and various Television serials.    On the

basis of breach of confidentiality by the defendants an

infringement of copyright of the plaintiff occurred and held in

paragraph 14 that "the essence of law on breach of

confidentially is that whatever the origin of it may be, is that a

person who has obtained information in confidence           is not

allowed to use it as a spring board for activities detrimental to

the person who made the confidential communication, and

spring board it remains even when all the features have been

published or can be ascertained by actual inspection by any

member of the public". Having regard to the facts therein, it

was held that, the plaintiff has made out more than seriously

arguable case in relation to the ground of breach of

confidentiality and would therefore be entitled for the ad interim

relief.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      29. The judgment in     ZEE TELEFILMS LTD. is also in

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                  39</span>

respect of original concept developed by plaintiffs which has a

striking similarity to the serial made by the defendant. Therein

also the confidentiality passed on by the plaintiffs to the

defendant was violated, which was causing serious prejudice to

the plaintiffs. There upon, after referring to the facts and

circumstances it was found that, there is interference of

unlawful exploitation of plaintiff's original concept in defendant's

TV serial and is more consonant with the materials placed on

record and all probabilities of the situation therein disclosed that

the plaintiffs business prospects and their goodwill would

seriously suffer if the confidential information of the case was

allowed to be used against them in competition with them.

Thereupon, it was held that, the plaintiffs were entitled to get

ad interim relief for violating confidentiality.

</p><p id="p_47">      30. Therefore,     the    discussion    made   above    would

significantly indicate that, the paramount contention based on

the principles of laid down by the learned senior counsel for

the petitioner is that as per Ext.P4 manufacturing agreement

confidential informations were provided to the respondents

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                  40</span>

which was grossly misused by the respondent to manufacture a

product resembling FC2 manufactured by the petitioner.

Therefore, on the sole ground of violation of confidentiality,

petitioner is entitled to get an ad interim injunction as is sought

for   in   the     application restraining the  respondent    from

manufacturing the latex version of FC2 and marketing and

selling them within India and outside India and a further

injunction restraining the respondent and their men and agents

from using the confidential information or any part thereof for

any purpose other than as provided under the manufacturing

agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_48">      31. On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent

submitted that, Ext.P4 manufacturing agreement is confining to

the agreement entered into by and between the parties for

manufacture of FC2 nitrile version, and there is no agreement

entered into by and between the parties with respect to

manufacture of latex version of FC2. As I have pointed out

earlier, during the course of the argument, learned counsel for

the respective parties have taken me through various provisions

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                41</span>

of Ext.P4 manufacturing agreement and the schedule and

annexures attached thereto. Learned counsel for the respondent

has invited my attention to Schedule C of Ext.P4 to contend and

canvass for the proposition that, the confidentiality supplied by

the petitioner confines to the assembling and packaging of the

products supplied by the petitioner. According to the petitioner,

no manner of documents or informations were passed on to the

respondent with respect to the confidentiality in respect of the

manufacturing of nitrile version of FC2, and therefore, there was

no occasion at all for the respondent to a manufacture similar

product. That apart it is strenuously contended that, the

respondent is also in the filed of manufacture of the products in

question for the past 50 years, and therefore, it cannot be said

that the respondent is an alien or stranger to the products in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      32. Evaluating the facts situations and submissions made

across the Bar, the issue remains to be considered is whether

the petitioner is entitled to the relief sought for i.e., the

injunction restraining respondent from manufacturing the latex

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                 42</span>

version of FC2 and its consequential marketing within India and

outside India. The summary of the facts discussed would show

that the covenants contained under Ext.P4 agreement           is

nothing but, with respect to manufacture of nitrile version of

FC2. In the earlier part of this judgment I have discussed with

the important covenants of Ext.P4 agreement, whereby, one

thing is clear that the agreement confined to the manufacture of

nitrile version of FC2. The annexure as well schedule appended

to Ext.P4 shows that, the manufacture referred to therein is

only with respect to nitrile version of FC2.
</p>
<p id="p_50">      33. Learned counsel for the petitioner however invited my

attention to Annexure (1) attached to Ext.P4, which is quoted

above and submitted that, the product specification is

mentioned thereunder with respect to FC2 nitrile version, and

Ext.P26 series photographs produced clearly demonstrates that

FC2 latex version is absolutely resembling the product

manufactured by the petitioner, FC2 nitrile version. Learned

counsel has also invited my attention to Ext.P25, wherein the

product specification of the respondent is recited. However, in

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                   43</span>

my considered opinion these are all ready made products

manufactured in accordance with standard specifications to

cater the needs of the people within the country, and on the

basis of international standard specification to cater the needs

of the people globally. There is no case for the petitioner that

these are products manufactured to carter the needs of each

and every individual, but, it can only be manufactured by

making standard specifications, nationally and universally. To

site an example, a ready made shirt manufactured by a

garment manufacturer is on the basis of certain standard

specifications in accordance with the shoulder or neck

measurement. True, it may not be fitting some persons exactly

in accordance with shoulder measurement vis a vis the neck

size. But, at the same time, it is convincingly clear that, the

shirt is manufactured in accordance with the standard sizes

nationally     as    well internationally. Therefore, merely by

demonstrating certain physical measurements provided under

Annexure 1 of Ext.P4, it cannot be said that there is

infringement of the product manufactured by the petitioner.

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                 44</span>

Therefore, in my considered opinion it cannot be said that,

petitioner has made out a case to injunct the respondent from

manufacturing the latex version of FC2 in the brand name 'FC2'.

More over, so far as the consideration left with the court for the

purpose of granting injunction is on the basis of prima facie

case established and balance of convenience. Here is a case

where, even though notice was issued, evident from Ext.P24

asking the petitioner to stop the manufacture and sale of

natural rubber latex version of FC2, the petitioner has not taken

any steps to resolve the disputes by and between the parties as

is threatened in Ext.P24 notice. True, that will not prohibit the

petitioner from approaching a court of law invoking <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_49">Section 9</a> of

the Arbitration Conciliation Act, because, even prior to the

initiation of the dispute resolution mechanism a party is entitled

to invoke <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_50">Section 9</a> in order to meet any specific contingencies.

However in the peculiar fact scenario vis a vis the nature of

reliefs   sought for,    petitioner   ought     to   have shown

bonafides by proceeding against the respondent, especially due

to the reason of delay ever since the issuance of Ext.P15 notice

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                               45</span>

in the year 2010. That apart, respondent is also a stake holder

in the manufacture of similar products, admittedly for the past

several decades. Moreover, presently there is no proof before

me at least to prima facie establish violation of confidentiality in

respect of manufacture of latex version of FC2, using similar

raw materials and machineries. On the contrary facts discussed

show that, issues can be unravelled by a fact finding authority

in a properly constituted proceedings. That part, I find force in

the contention advanced by learned counsel for the respondent

that, as per Ext.P15, a notice was issued by the respondent

dated 2.9.2010 intending to terminate the manufacturing

agreement dated 29.5.2008. Even though a contention is raised

to the effect that there is no actual termination since the term

employed therein is only intention to terminate, I cannot agree

with such a contention advanced by learned senior counsel for

the petitioner for the reason that, the business transactions by

and between the parties came to a halt, even though Ext.P28

documents produced by the petitioner along with the reply

affidavit allegedly shows certain invoices with respect to the

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                 46</span>

supply of raw material in 2012. However, for the past more

than 4 years, petitioner has kept quiet and the respondent was

selling his product within India and outside also. More over,

there is no convincing and significant evidence before me to

contain the proposition put forth by the petitioner that the

physical appearance as per the photographs produced, the rival

products resemble similar. As I have stated earlier, these are

all ready made products on the basis of national and

international standards.      Therefore, the said photographs

produced can never be termed to be an established evidence in

order to convince this Court even prima facie that the petitioner

is entitled to get an injunction against respondent.

</p><p id="p_51">      34. Taking into account the totality of the facts and

circumstances of the case and the principles of law laid down by

various courts       discussed above regarding infringement of

confidentiality, the facts remaining in this case are not at all

helpful to the petitioner to secure the relief sought for, there

being no prima facie case. More over, for the foregoing reason

balance of convenience is also not in favour of the petitioner to

O.P(ICA) No.1 of 2017

secure an ad interim injunction as is sought for. However, I

make it clear that, the findings made above are intended to

arrive at a conclusion with respect to the contentions advanced

by the parties and the same shall not be construed as any

expression of opinion on merits of the matter or rights and

interests of the rival parties. All the questions of facts and law

are left open, leaving the liberty of the parties to agitate in any

properly constituted legal proceedings.
