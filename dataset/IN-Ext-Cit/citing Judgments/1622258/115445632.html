</p><p id="p_2">1.      The appellant/plaintiff has assailed an order dated 08.07.2016 passed
by the learned trial court, rejecting his suit for declaration, possession,
permanent and mandatory injunction instituted against the respondent
No.1/defendant No.1 (mother), respondent No.2/defendant No.2 (brother),
respondent     No.3/defendant      No.3   (sister-in-law)   and   respondent
No.4/defendant No.4 (subsequent purchaser). The said suit has been held to
be barred under <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_1">Section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu Succession Act and rejected on
the basis of an application filed by the respondent No.4/defendant No.4
under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.

<p id="p_3"> 2.      The undisputed facts of the case are that Shri Himmat Singh, father of
the appellant and the respondent No.2, husband of the respondent No.1 and
father-in-law of the respondent No.3, was the owner of premises bearing
No.7/2 and 7/3/C in RD Ram Roop Vidya Mandir Estate, Sanjay Nagar,
Delhi. During his lifetime, Shri Himmat Singh had executed a registered
Will dated 07.03.1980.      He expired on 12.06.1999, leaving behind his
widow, the respondent No.1 and two sons, the appellant and the respondent
No.2 as his Class I heirs. Initially, the appellant/plaintiff had instituted a
simple suit for permanent and mandatory injunction against the respondents
No.1 to 3, for restraining them from transferring, selling or alienating the
suit premises. When the respondents No.1 to 3 were served with the
summons and had entered appearance in the suit, they filed a joint written
statement taking a plea that the respondent No.1/defendant No.1 had
executed a gift deed dated 15.06.2007 in respect of the suit premises in
favour of her daughter-in-law, the respondent No.3 herein who had in turn
had executed a sale deed in respect of the suit premises in favour of the
respondent No.4, M/s Ashima Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
</p><p id="p_4">3.      On gaining knowledge of the aforesaid turn of events, the
appellant/plaintiff sought leave to withdraw the said suit while reserving his
right to file a fresh suit. As a result, the present suit came to be instituted by
the appellant/plaintiff, wherein he impleaded his family members as
defendants No.1 to 3 and the purchaser of the suit premises as defendant
No.4.
</p><p id="p_5">4.      After pleadings were completed, issues were framed in the suit. At the
stage of recording of evidence, the respondent No.4 filed an application
under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, praying for rejection of the plaint on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RFA 607/2016                                                          Page 2 of 15</span>
 ground that the same was devoid of any cause of action and was also barred
by law. A reply in opposition to the said application was filed by the
appellant/plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_6">5.     On a perusal of the Will dated 7.3.1980, the learned trial court arrived
at the conclusion that the testator, Shri Himmat Singh had not placed any
express restriction on the right of the respondent No.1/defendant No.1 to
enjoy the suit premises and in such circumstances, her right to create a third
party interest therein could not be restricted or inferred by the Court.
Resultantly, the application filed by the respondent No.4/defendant No.4
was allowed and the appellant's suit was dismissed on the ground that it is
barred under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_2">Section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu Succession Act.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     The gravamen of the arguments addressed by the counsel for the
appellant is that under the Will, the deceased had bestowed a life estate in
favour of the respondent No.1 and therefore, she could neither execute a gift
deed in favour of the respondent No.3 and nor could the respondent No.3 in
turn execute a sale deed in favour of the respondent No.4 and both the
documents ought to be declared as null and void.           In support of his
argument, he has cited the following decisions:-

impugned order and submits that the appellant is trying to misinterpret the
subject Will and a bare reading thereof makes it explicit that late Shri

 Himmat Singh had bestowed the suit premises in favour of the respondent
No.1 as an absolute owner thereof and once, she was declared an absolute
owner under the Will, no restriction could be placed on her right to gift or
transfer the said property in any manner to the respondent No.3 and nor
could the right of the respondent No.3 to sell the suit premises in favour of a
third party (respondent No.4 herein), be questioned.            He seeks to
substantiate the said submission by referring to the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1545601/" id="a_6">Gopala Menon vs. Sivaraman Nair and Ors</a>. reported as
(1981) 3 SCC 586.
</p><p id="p_9">8.      Mr. Nandrajog, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent
No.4 supports the submission made by learned counsel for the respondents
No.1 to 3 and states that the respondent No.4 is a bonafide purchaser of the
suit premises, for valuable consideration and without notice.      He submits
that the gift deed in question was executed by the respondent No.1 in favour
of the respondent No.3 as long back as in the year 2007 and a sale deed was
executed by the respondent No.3 in favour of the respondent No.4 after
about four years, in the year 2011. Before purchasing the suit premises, the
respondent No.4 had undertaken due diligence by examining the chain of
title documents including the Will in question and only thereafter had it
purchased the suit premises from the respondent No.3 in good faith.
</p><p id="p_10">9.      The Court has heard the counsels for the parties and carefully perused
the records, particularly, the subject Will and the interim order dated
18.02.2012 passed by the trial court on the stay application filed by the
appellant/plaintiff in the suit, which the latter has referred to and relied
upon.

<p id="p_11"> 10.      The singular controversy raised by the appellant is that the trial court
has erred in interpreting the Will dated 07.03.1980 executed by late Shri
Himmat Singh. This Court is only concerned with the construction of the
Will and is called upon to examine as to whether the said Will has conferred
a limited estate on his widow, the respondent No.1 herein, in respect of the
suit premises, or the bequest made was an absolute one.
</p><p id="p_12">11.      The principles laid down for construction of a Will, as established in a
line of judicial pronouncements over the years were summarized by the
Supreme Court in the case of Navneet Lal alias <a href="/doc/575045/" id="a_7">Rangi vs. Gokul and Ors</a>.,
(1976) 1 SCC 630, in the following words :
</p><p id="p_13">  "8. From the earlier decisions of this Court the following
  principles, inter alia, are well established:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "(1) In construing a document whether in English or in vernacular
      the fundamental rule is to ascertain the intention from the words
      used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered; but that
      is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the
      words which have actually been employed. (<a href="/doc/1141020/" id="a_8">Ram Gopal v. Nand
      Lal</a> [AIR 1951 SC 139 : (1950) SCR 766, 772] )

      (2) In construing the language of the will the court is entitled to
      put      itself    into    the    testator's    armchair      (<a href="/doc/1719234/" id="a_9">Venkata
      Narasimha v. Parthasarathy</a> [41 IA 51, 72 : 21 IC 339 : 15 Bom
      LR 1010] ) and is bound to bear in mind also other matters than
      merely the words used. It must consider the surrounding
      circumstances, the position of the testator, his family relationship,
      the probability that he would use words in a particular sense... But
      all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the
      will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by
      that particular testator in that document. (Venkata Narasimha
      case and <a href="/doc/154566/" id="a_10">Gnanambal Ammal v. T. Raju Ayyar</a> [AIR 1951 SC 103 :
      (1950) SCR 949, 955] )


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA 607/2016                                                            Page 5 of 15</span>
       (3) The true intention of the testator has to be gathered not by
      attaching importance to isolated expressions but by reading the
      will as a whole with all its provisions and ignoring none of them
      as redundant or contradictory. (<a href="/doc/1230342/" id="a_11">Raj Bajrang Bahadur
      Singh v. Thakurain Bakhtraj Kuer</a> [AIR 1953 SC 7 : (1953) SCR
      232, 240] )

      (4) The court must accept, if possible, such construction as would
      give to every expression some effect rather than that which would
      render any of the expressions inoperative. The court will look at
      the circumstances under which the testator makes his will, such as
      the state of his property, of his family and the like. Where
      apparently conflicting dispositions can be reconciled by giving full
      effect to every word used in a document, such a construction
      should be accepted instead of a construction which would have the
      effect of cutting down the clear meaning of the words used by the
      testator. Further, where one of the two reasonable constructions
      would lead to intestacy, that should be discarded in favour of a
      construction which does not create any such hiatus. (<a href="/doc/146718/" id="a_12">Pearey
      Lal v. Rameshwar Das</a> [AIR 1963 SC 1703 : 1963 Supp (2) SCR
      834, 839, 842] )

      (5) It is one of the cardinal principles of construction of wills that
      to the extent that it is legally possible effect should be given to
      every disposition contained in the will unless the law prevents
      effect being given to it. Of course, if there are two repugnant
      provisions conferring successive interests, if the first interest
      created is valid the subsequent interest cannot take effect but a
      Court of construction will proceed to the farthest extent to avoid
      repugnancy, so that effect could be given as far as possible to
      every testamentary intention contained in the will. (<a href="/doc/231145/" id="a_13">Ramachandra

 favour of her two daughters and on their demise, devolved the same on their
female children alone, the following observations made by the Supreme
Court are instructive:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "8. The English rendition of Clause 6 of the will executed by Smt
       Kalla Jaggayyamma is as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               "(6) 2nd item tiled house situated in New Colony out of
               which eastern wing two rooms shall devolve to my
               second daughter, Chandaram Appalanarasamma and the
               western wing two rooms shall devolve upon my elder
               daughter, Chandaram Ramanamma with absolute rights
               of sale, gift, mortgage, etc., and this will come into force
               after my demise. After demise of my daughters the
               retained and remaining property shall devolve upon their
               female children only."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       9. It is evident from a plain reading of the above that the testatrix
       had bequeathed in absolute terms the property mentioned in
       Clause 6 in favour of her daughters Chandaram
       Appalanarasamma and Chandaram Ramanamma with absolute
       rights of sale, gift, mortgage, etc. That the bequest was in
       absolute terms was made abundantly clear by the use of the
       words "absolute rights of sale, gift, mortgage, etc." appearing in
       Clause 6 above. To that extent there is no difficulty. What led to a
       forensic debate at the Bar was the latter part of bequest under
       which the testatrix has attempted to regulate the devolution of the
       property in question after the demise of her daughters. The
       testatrix has desired that after the demise of her daughters the
       property vested in them would devolve upon their female heirs
       only.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       10. The question is whether the testatrix Smt Kalla
       Jaggayyamma, had made two bequests, one that vests the
       property absolutely in favour of her daughters and the other that
       purports to vest the very same property in their female offspring.
       If so whether the two bequests can be reconciled and if they

        cannot be, which one ought to prevail.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       15. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Mauleshwar
       Mani case [(2002) 2 SCC 468] where the question once again
       was whether an absolute interest created in the property by the
       testatrix in the earlier part of the will can be taken away or
       rendered ineffective by the subsequent bequest which is
       repugnant to the first bequest. Answering the question in the
       negative, this Court held that once the testator has given an
       absolute right and interest in his entire property to a devisee it is
       not open to him to further bequeath the very same property in
       favour of the second set of persons. The following passage from
       the decision in this regard is apposite: (SCC pp. 473-74,
       para 12)

           "12. In view of the aforesaid principles that once the
           testator has given an absolute right and interest in his
           entire property to a devisee it is not open to the testator
           to further bequeath the same property in favour of the
           second set of persons in the same will, a testator cannot
           create successive legatees in his will. The object behind
           is that once an absolute right is vested in the first
           devisee the testator cannot change the line of
           succession of the first devisee. Where a testator having
           conferred an absolute right on anyone, the subsequent
           bequest for the same property in favour of other persons
           would be repugnant to the first bequest in the will and
           has to be held invalid. ... We are, therefore, of the view
           that once the testator has given an absolute estate in
           favour of the first devisee it is not open to him to further
           bequeath the very same property in favour of the second
           set of persons."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       19. In Kaivelikkal Ambunhi case [(1995) 5 SCC 444] (SCC p.
       445, para 4), the Court applied the maxim „cum duo inter se
       pugnantia reperiuntur in testamento ultimum ratum est‟ which
       means that in a will if there are two inconsistent provisions the
       latter shall prevail over the earlier.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">RFA 607/2016                                                         Page 8 of 15</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">        22. It is evident from a careful reading of the provisions
       referred to above that while interpreting a will, the courts would
       as far as possible place an interpretation that would avoid any
       part of a testament becoming redundant. So also the courts will
       interpret a will to give effect to the intention of the testator as
       far as the same is possible. Having said so, we must hasten to
       add that the decisions rendered by the courts touching upon
       interpretation of the wills are seldom helpful except to the extent
       the same recognise or lay down a proposition of law of general
       application. That is so because each document has to be
       interpreted in the peculiar circumstances in which the same has
       been executed and keeping in view the language employed by
       the testator. That indeed is the requirement of <a href="/doc/1324410/" id="a_15">Section 82</a> of the
       Succession Act also inasmuch as it provides that meaning of any
       clause in a will must be collected from the entire instrument and
       all parts shall be construed with reference to each other.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       23. Coming then to the facts of the case at hand it is evident from
       a careful reading of Clause 6 of the will extracted above that the
       same makes an unequivocal and absolute bequest in favour of the
       daughters of the testatrix. The use of words like "absolute rights
       of sale, gift, mortgage, etc." employed by the testatrix make the
       intention of the testatrix abundantly clear. The learned counsel
       for the plaintiff-respondents herein also did not have any quarrel
       with the proposition that the testatrix had in no uncertain terms
       made an absolute bequest in favour of her daughters. What was
       argued by him was that the bequest so made could be treated as
       a life estate not because the testament stated so but because
       unless it is so construed the second part of Clause 6 by which the
       female offspring of the legatees would get the property cannot
       take effect. It was on that premise contended that the absolute
       estate of Smt Sadaram Appalanarasamma ought to be treated
       only as a life estate. The contention though attractive on first
       blush, does not stand closer scrutiny. We say so because the
       ultimate purpose of interpretation of any document is to discover
       and give effect to the true intention of the executor, in the present
       case the testatrix.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        24. We are not here dealing with a case where the testatrix has in
       one part of the will bequeathed the property to A while the same
       property has been bequeathed to B in another part. Had there
       been such a conflict, it may have been possible for the
       respondent-plaintiffs to argue that the latter bequest ought to
       take effect in preference to the former. We are on the contrary
       dealing with a case where the intention of the testatrix to make
       an absolute bequest in favour of her daughters is unequivocal.
       Secondly, the expression "after demise of my daughters
       the retained and remaining properties shall devolve on their
       female children only" does not stricto sensu amount to a bequest
       contrary to the one made earlier in favour of the daughters of the
       testatrix.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       25. The expression extracted above does not detract from the
       absolute nature of the bequest in favour of the daughters. All
       that the testatrix intended to achieve by the latter part of Clause
       6 was the devolution upon their female offspring all such
       property as remained available in the hands of the legatees at
       the time of their demise. There would obviously be no
       devolution of any such property upon the female offspring in
       terms of the said clause if the legatees decided to sell or gift the
       property bequeathed to them as indeed they had every right to
       do under the terms of the bequest. Seen thus, there is no real
       conflict between the absolute bequest which the first part of
       Clause 6 of the will makes and the second part of the said clause
       which deals with devolution of what and if at all anything that
       remains in the hands of the legatees.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       26. The two parts of Clause 6 operate in different spheres,
       namely, one vesting absolute title upon the legatees with rights
       to sell, gift, mortgage, etc. and the other regulating devolution
       of what may escape such sale, gift or transfer by them. The
       latter part is redundant by reason of the fact that the same was
       repugnant to the clear intention of the testatrix in making an
       absolute bequest in favour of her daughters. It could be
       redundant also because the legatees exercised their rights of

        fall to the lot of the next generation, females or otherwise. All
       told, the stipulation made in the second part of Clause 6 did not
       in the least affect the legatees being the absolute owners of the
       property bequeathed to them. The corollary would be that upon
       their demise the estate owned by them would devolve by the
       ordinary law of succession on their heirs and not in terms of the
       will executed by the testatrix."(emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_15">13.    There is no doubt that interpretation of a Will does not require any
evidence. It is for the Court to evaluate the Will on the basis of the settled
principles of construction. As held in the case of Bhura (supra), cited by
learned counsel for the appellant, it is a settled law that Courts must make all
efforts to determine the real intention of the testator by reading the Will as a
whole and give effect thereto.       Further, the construction which would
advance the intention of the testator has to be preferred and every
disposition contained in the Will, must be given effect to as far as possible,
unless the law prevents such effect being given to it. In the case of <a href="/doc/180317/" id="a_16">Radha
Sundar Dutta vs. Mohd. Jahadur Rahim and Ors</a>. reported as AIR 1959 SC
24, the Supreme Court had observed that the court is duty bound to reconcile
an apparent inconsistency in the Will and if there are two constructions of a
document, one of which will give effect to all the clauses therein, while the
other will render one or more nugatory, the former path must be adopted.
</p><p id="p_16">14.    The Court has read the Will dated 7.3.1980 executed by Shri Himmat
Singh in the light of the legal principles of construction enunciated above.
The relevant para of the Will which requires to be interpreted is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">       "...... I make Will that after my death, the above property movable and
       immovable whatsoever and wheresoever I may leave, shall go to my
       wife Smt. Kanchan Kaur Executor of Will, and after her death, shall
       got to my two sons - Surinder Singh &amp; Jasbir Kumar in equal
       shares........."
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">RFA 607/2016                                                        Page 11 of 15</span>
<p id="p_17"> 15.    On a reading of the aforesaid para of the Will, it is apparent that the
testator did not place any limitation upon the respondent No.1 with regard to
her right to enjoy the suit premises how she likes. The learned trial court has
concluded that the only interpretation that can be given to the Will is that in
the absence of any express restriction placed by the deceased on the right of
the respondent No.1 to enjoy the suit premises as she wished, which
included her right to create third party interest therein, no such restriction
could be inferred and that the provision of <a href="/doc/630942/" id="a_17">Section 14(2)</a> of the Hindu
Succession Act do not come into play and cannot be invoked to place any
restriction on her right. Relying on the provision of <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_18">Section 14(1)</a> of the
Hindu Succession Act, it was held that the respondent No.1 was well within
her right to have succeeded to the property in question as an absolute owner
and to gift the same by virtue of the gift deed dated 15.06.2007.
</p><p id="p_18">16.    This Court is inclined to concur with the aforesaid findings returned
by the learned trial court for the reason that had the deceased any intention
of bequeathing only a life estate in respect of the suit premises in favour of
his widow, the respondent No.1 herein, it would have been apparent from
the language used in the Will, which would have then prescribed a restricted
right or life estate in her favour. Meaning thereby, that the expressions used
in the Will would have been indicative of the fact that the testator had
intended to create an estate in favour of the respondent No.1 for her lifetime
or unto her death. However, the language used in the subject Will does not
point in that direction.
</p><p id="p_19">17.    From the language used in the subject Will, it is evident that the
testator had desired to devolve his movable and immovable properties in
favour of the respondent No.1, as an absolute bequest. Respondent No.1 was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">RFA 607/2016                                                        Page 12 of 15</span>
 not only a beneficiary under the Will, she was also made the executor of the
Will. The moment the deceased had declared that all his movable and
immovable properties would go to devisee, the respondent No.1, inherent in
the said declaration was his intention to bequeath an absolute interest in the
property in favour of his wife including right to sell, transfer or alienate the
same. That being the position, the second part of the relevant para of the
Will, where the testator had stated that "....... after her death, shall go to my
two sons - Surinder Singh and Jasbir Kumar in equal shares." has to be
construed to mean that if any part of the estate was available in the hands of
the legatee, then the same would devolve on her two sons in equal share. If
so interpreted, the conflict between the first part and the latter part of the
para of the Will quoted above, stands reconciled, without any repugnance.
</p><p id="p_20">18.    Even if it is assumed that the subject Will had bestowed a life estate in
favour of respondent No.1, as sought to be urged by learned counsel for the
appellant, the said life estate gets translated into an absolute estate, under
<a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_19">Section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which contemplates that
any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after
the commencement of the Act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and
not as a limited owner. The aforesaid issue is no longer res integra having
been decided by the Supreme Court in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar
&amp; Ors. vs. Idol of Sri Swaminathaswami Swaminathaswami Thirukoil &amp;
Ors., (1996) 8 SCC 525 wherein, it was held that the right acquired by a
Hindu wife/widow under a Will, is in recognition of her pre-existing right to
maintenance known under the Shastric law and in the light of the provisions
of the Hindu Adoption and <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_20">Maintenance Act</a>, 1956, it would transform into
an absolute right under <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_21">Section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu Succession Act. Thus, it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">RFA 607/2016                                                         Page 13 of 15</span>
 was held that when a Hindu husband bequeaths a life estate in a property
unto his wife, she does not get a limited ownership with life interest, but
becomes the absolute owner thereof in terms of <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_22">Section 14(1)</a> of the Hindu
Succession Act.
</p><p id="p_21">19.    Reliance placed by learned counsel for the appellant on the
observations made by the trial court in the interim order dated 18.02.2012
passed on the stay application filed by the appellant to the effect that under
the Will, the respondent No.1 had received limited and restricted rights, was
no more than a tentative finding. The said position is borne out by the fact
that while passing the order dated 18.02.2012, it was made clear that the
Court was considering a prima facie case in the context of balance of
convenience and irreparable loss and it was solely with the purpose of
preserving the suit property and avoiding multiplicity of litigation, that the
respondents/defendants were restrained from creating any third party interest
in the suit premises, till the disposal of the suit. However, a rider was placed
in the aforesaid order to the effect that the observations made therein were
not an expression on the merits of the case. Therefore, the order dated
18.2.2012 would not be of any assistance to the appellant.
</p><p id="p_22">20.    Given the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no manner of
doubt that in view of the language used by the testator in the Will dated
07.03.1980, the respondent No.1 was not bequeathed a life estate but an
absolute estate under <a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_23">Section 14(1)</a> of the Act and consequently, she was
free to deal with the suit property as she deemed fit, without any limitation
on her powers of disposition. By the same analogy, her right to execute a
gift deed in favour of the respondent No.3 cannot be questioned by the
appellant. Nor can the right of the respondent No.3 to execute a sale deed in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">RFA 607/2016                                                         Page 14 of 15</span>
 favour of the respondent No.4, be treated as without any authority. As
observed by the Supreme Court in the case of Gopala Menon (supra), the
absolute and unrestricted power to dispose of a property is a necessary
incident of an absolute estate and if an absolute grant is burdened with a
restrain on alienation, the grant is good and the condition, void.
</p><p id="p_23">21.    In view of the ratio of the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case
of Sadaram Suryanarayana (supra), and C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra), it
is held that the Will in question does not bestow a life interest on the
respondent No.3, but passes unto her an absolute bequest with a condition
that if the same is not disposed of by her in her lifetime, then whatever is
available on her demise, will devolve on her two sons, the appellant and the
respondent No.2 herein.
</p><p id="p_24">22.    Accordingly, the appeal fails. The impugned order dated 08.07.2016
is sustained. The parties are left to bear their own expenses.
