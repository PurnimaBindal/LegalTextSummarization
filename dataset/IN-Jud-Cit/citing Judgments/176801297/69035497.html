</p><p id="p_3">                  2.       It is the case of the plaintiff that the trade mark „ZIPOD‟ was
                  conceived by the plaintiff in the year 2004 and has been in use since 2007
                  in respect of cefpodoxime based antibiotic and antibacterial preparations.
                  The preparation is used to treat conditions like pneumonia, sinusitis,
                  cystitis and ear infections. The said products are available in a dry syrup
                  form, tablet and dispersible tablet. The said products have been a
                  phenomenal success and currently hold a significant market share. The
                  plaintiff is also the registered proprietor thereof under the registration
                  no.1300578 as under:</p><pre id="pre_2">

                  Rs.5,58,12,359/- and Rs.36,07,566/- respectively in the year 2007-08 to

                   sells a number of products using the trade mark ZIPOD with suffixes to
                  indicate their potency or their combination, such as ZIPOD 200, ZIPOD
                  100dt, ZIPOD 100DS, ZIPOD 50DS, ZIPOD 50DT ZIPOD CV 200 and
                  ZIPOD O. The plaintiff asserts that it has been rigorously protecting its
                  rights in the said trade mark and has been granted protection by this
                  Court in other litigations.
</p><p id="p_5">                  4.       The plaintiff is aggrieved by the adoption of the mark &quot;ZOYPOD&quot;
                  by the defendants for the pharmaceutical product containing the active
                  pharmaceutical ingredient Cefpodoxime Proxetil. The plaintiff asserts
                  that the mark is phonetically and conceptually similar to the plaintiff‟s
                  registered trade mark &quot;ZIPOD&quot; and the use of the mark &quot;ZOYPOD&quot;,
                  therefore, amounts to infringement and passing off.
</p><p id="p_6">                  5.       The plaintiff further asserts that it is only in January 2022 that it
                  gained knowledge of use of the said mark by the defendant no.1, who
                  was selling products under the mark ZOYPOD which was being used as
                  a prefix for a number of its formulations such as ZOYPOD 200,
                  ZOYPOD CV 325, ZOYPOD 100, etc.
</p><p id="p_7">                  6.       On conducting a search on the database of the Trade Marks
                  registry, the plaintiff came across the registration of the device mark


                                           bearing no.3924887 in the name of defendant no.2. The
                  plaintiff, thereafter, not only served a cease-and-desist notice on the
                  defendant no.1, but also filed an application seeking rectification of the
                  Trade Marks Register.

                   SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANTS:
</p><p id="p_9">                  7.       On the other hand, it is the case of the learned counsel for the
                  defendants that the term „POD‟ is generic in nature and is derived from
                  the common molecular name i.e., Cefpodoxime, which falls in the list of
                  International Nonproprietary Names (INN) and is used to treat bacterial
                  infections. Therefore, no one can claim an exclusive right over the same
                  or over any other mark having „POD‟ either as a prefix or suffix. In
                  support, she places reliance on the judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/118988772/" id="a_1">Sun
                  Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. v. Hetero Healthcare Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.,
                  2022 SCC OnLine Del 2580, and <a href="/doc/69416451/" id="a_2">Astrazeneca UK Limited and Ors. v.
                  Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., 2011 SCC OnLine Del
                  2669.
</p><p id="p_10">                  8.       It is further asserted that there are several applications which have
                  been filed under class 05 in the name of different business entities with
                  the term „POD‟ as a prefix or suffix, which are used to treat bacterial
                  infections. Some of them are registered and some of them are pending,
                  hence, no exclusive right to sue over the term „POD‟ can be claimed by
                  the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_11">                  9.       It is asserted that as the defendant no.2 is the registered proprietor


                  of the trade mark/label &quot;                           &quot;, suit for infringement is
                  not maintainable against the said defendant.
</p><p id="p_12">                  10.      It is further asserted that the marks of the plaintiff and the
                  defendant no.1 are entirely different- phonetically as also structurally and
                  visually. They rely on the examination report issued by the Trade Marks
                  Registry, who while examining the trade mark application of defendant

                   no.2 for registration of the above-mentioned mark, did not cite the
                  plaintiff‟s trade mark as a conflicting trade mark for raising objections
                  under <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> of the Trade Marks Act.
</p><p id="p_13">                  11.      It is asserted by the learned counsel for the defendants that the
                  defendants have been using the impugned mark since 2014, and
                  subsequently have established the defendants‟ own goodwill and
                  reputation in the said mark.
</p><p id="p_14">                  12.      The learned counsel for the defendants submits that ordinary
                  people relate to the said trade mark to the goods of the defendants on
                  account of long and continuous user since 2014, and hence, neither the
                  suit for passing off nor infringement is maintainable.
</p><p id="p_15">                  13.      The learned counsel for the defendants asserts that delay is fatal in
                  a passing off action, in so far as grant of interim injunction is concerned.
</p><p id="p_16">                  14.      The learned counsel for the defendants also asserts that since the
                  drugs in question are Schedule „H‟ drugs, they are only available on
                  prescription. In this regard, she also submitted that the packaging of the
                  said drugs is different.
</p><p id="p_17">                  15.      She also contends that the defendants used the term &quot;ZOY&quot; in
                  various        pharmaceutical   products   like   ZOYCLO-M,         ZOYBEC,
                  ZOYCLO-S, ZOYCEF, ZOYDEF, ZOYNIM, ZOYRAB, ZOYLIV,
                  ZOYCIT, ZOYPRED, etc. Therefore, the adoption of the impugned mark
                  by the defendants is bona fide.

</p><p id="p_20">                   16.      The learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that the marks of the
                  plaintiff and the defendants are phonetically similar. Moreover, the goods
                  for which they are used for are common.
</p><p id="p_21">                  17.      As far as the defense of the learned counsel for the defendants that
                  the word &quot;POD&quot; is generic and derived from the common molecular
                  name i.e. Cefpodoxime, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that
                  the same, on the face of it, is incorrect as the word &quot;POD&quot; appears only
                  in the middle of the said molecule‟s name and the use of the same cannot
                  be common to trade relating to pharmaceutical products.
</p><p id="p_22">                  18.      On the submission of the learned counsel for the defendants that
                  there are other marks that are registered with the word &quot;POD&quot;, the
                  learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that apart from the fact that the
                  said registration is irrelevant without any proof of actual usage, even
                  otherwise, in the list of marks so provided by the learned counsel for the

                   has been laid down by the Supreme Court Amritdhara Pharmacy v.
                  Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, wherein it has been held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                    &quot;7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case
                                    under our consideration. It is not disputed before us
                                    that the two names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshman-
                                    dhara&quot; are in use in respect of the same description of
                                    goods, namely a medicinal preparation for the
                                    alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal
                                    preparation will be purchased mostly by people who
                                    instead of going to a doctor wish to purchase a
                                    medicine for the quick alleviation of their suffering,
                                    both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as
                                    illiterate. As we said in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_7">Corn Products Refining

                                    968] the question has to be approached from the point
                                    of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect
                                    recollection. To such a man the overall structural and
                                    phonetic similarity-of the two names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and
                                    &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; is, in our opinion, likely to deceive
                                    or cause confusion. We must consider the overall
                                    similarity of the two composite words &quot;Amritdhara&quot;</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">                                    and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. We do not think that the
                                    learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying
                                    that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An
                                    unwary purchaser of average intelligence and
                                    imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court
                                    supposed, split the name into its component parts and
                                    consider the etymological meaning thereof or even
                                    consider the meaning of the composite words as
                                    &quot;current of nectar&quot; or &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. He
                                    would go more by the overall structural and phonetic
                                    similarity and the nature of the medicine he has
                                    previously purchased, or has been told about, or about
                                    which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to
                                    purchase. Where the trade relates to goods largely sold
                                    to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer
                                    to say that a person educated in the Hindi language
                                    would go by the etymological or ideological meaning
                                    and see the difference between &quot;current of nectar&quot; and
                                    &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of Lakshman&quot; in a
                                    literal sense has no meaning; to give it meaning one
                                    must further make the inference that the &quot;current or

                                     stream&quot; is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the
                                    Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman
                                    will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the
                                    Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he
                                    would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called
                                    ideological difference between &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and
                                    &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He would go more by the similarity
                                    of the two names in the context of the widely known
                                    medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.
</p><p id="p_32">                                    8. We agree that the use of the word &quot;dhara&quot; which
                                    literally means &quot;current or stream&quot; is not by itself
                                    decisive of the matter. What we have to consider here is
                                    the overall similarity of the composite words, having
                                    regard to the circumstance that the goods bearing the
                                    two names are medicinal preparations of the same
                                    description. We are aware that the admission of a mark
                                    is not to be refused, because unusually stupid people,
                                    &quot;fools or idiots&quot;, may be deceived. A critical
                                    comparison of the two names may disclose some points
                                    of difference, but an unwary purchaser of average
                                    intelligence and imperfect recollection would be
                                    deceived by the overall similarity of the two names
                                    having regard to the nature of the medicine he is
                                    looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he
                                    had purchased a similar medicine on a previous
                                    occasion with a similar name. The trade mark is the
                                    whole thing-the whole word has to be considered. In
                                    the case of the application to register &quot;Erectiks&quot;
                                    (opposed by the proprietors of the trade mark
                                    &quot;Erector&quot;) Farwell, J., said in William Bailey
                                    (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52 RPC 137] :
                                    &quot;I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and
                                    compare it with a part of the other word; one word
                                    must be considered as a whole and compared with the
                                    other word as a whole.... I think it is a dangerous
                                    method to adopt to divide the word up and seek to
                                    distinguish a portion of it from a portion of the other
                                    word.&quot;

                  opinion, the mark of the plaintiff &quot;ZIPOD&quot; and the mark of the
                  defendants &quot;ZOYPOD&quot; are phonetically similar.
</p><p id="p_35">                  27.      The dissimilarity in packing of the two products is not relevant as
                  the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of its work mark &quot;ZIPOD&quot;. Once
                  the mark appear to be deceptively similar and the plaintiff is a prior
                  adopter thereof, the plaintiff is entitled to protection of its mark from
                  infringement thereof in terms of Section 29(2)(b) of the Trade Mark Act,
                  1999.

                  that the mark &quot;ZOYPOD&quot; has been derived from the molecular name i.e.,
                  Cefpodoxime, also cannot be accepted. &quot;POD&quot; appears in the middle of
                  the molecule name; it is neither the opening nor the closing part and is
                  the irrelevant part of the said molecular name. The explanation given by
                  the defendants for adoption thereof, prima facie, does not appear to be
                  genuine.
</p><p id="p_37">                  29.      In Sun Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd.(supra), the Court was
                  considering the marks &quot;LETROZ&quot; and &quot;LETERO&quot;, which contains the
                  active ingredients of &quot;LETROZOLE&quot;. The Court held that by adoption of
                  initial letters of the active ingredient, no monopoly could be claimed by
                  the appellant therein.

                  from the drug &quot;MEROPENEM&quot;. The marks in both the above cited cases
                  used and contained the initial alphabets of the name of the drug, unlike in
                  the present case and, therefore, cannot come to the aid of the defendants.

                                           prevent any confusion arising from similarity of
                                           marks among medicines are required to be taken.&quot;

</p><p id="p_44">                   34.      In view of the above, the submission of the learned counsel for the
                  defendants that as the medicinal preparations in question are Schedule
                  „H‟ drugs and are only available on a prescription and, therefore, no
                  confusion is possible, is ill founded.
</p><p id="p_45">                  35.      The submission of the learned counsel for the defendants that the
                  defendants, being the registered proprietor of their mark, cannot be
                  injuncted, is also liable to be rejected. It is no longer res-integra that the
                  rights of the prior user are superior to that the registered proprietor and,
                  in case of any conflict or dispute between two registered proprietors, the
                  prior adopter of the mark would succeed. In this regard, reference may be
                  made to the judgment of this Court in Somany Ceramics Ltd. (supra).
</p><p id="p_46">                  36.      On the assertion of the defendants that there are other marks with
                  the terms &quot;POD&quot; which have been granted registration by the Registrar of
                  Trade Marks, it must be observed that the plaintiff has been prima facie
                  able to show that registration of marks starting with alphabet „Z‟, as are
                  in question in the present case are either abandoned/not renewed/refused.
                  The other marks appearing in the search report, do not appear to be
                  similar to that of the plaintiff. Therefore, the list filed by the defendants,
                  cannot come to the aid of the defendants.
</p><p id="p_47">                  37.      Even otherwise, the mere presence of such marks in the Register of
                  Trade Marks, is not evidence of their use. In this regard, I may place
                  reference on the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_12">Corn Products
                  Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd</a>., (1960) 1 SCR 968, as
                  also the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_13">Century Traders v. Roshan Lal
                  Duggar &amp; Co</a>., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50.

</p><p id="p_49">                   38.      This brings me to the submission of the learned counsel for the
                  defendants that the defendants have been using the said mark since 2014.
                  In support of this assertion, the defendants have placed certain invoices
                  on record. The invoice dated 07.07.2015 is reproduced herein:
</p>



<p id="p_50">                  39.      The said invoice reflects a GSTIN number, even though, the GST
                  regime had not been introduced on that date. The invoice is of the year
                  2015, while the GST Regime came into force in 2017. When confronted,
                  the learned counsel for the defendants stated that this may be a printing
                  error as the software had been updated by the defendants. This
                  explanation also prima facie appears to be incorrect inasmuch as the
                  previous invoice annexed by the defendants is of 01.04.2014 and the
                  subsequent invoice inter-alia is of 01.11.2016, both of which do not
                  reflect a GSTIN number. It appears that this invoice has been fabricated

                   by the defendants for the purpose of the present suit. This casts a doubt
                  on the authenticity of the other invoices as well.
</p><p id="p_51">                  40.      Even otherwise, the defendants have not disclosed the amount of
                  the sales made by them using the impugned mark nor of any
                  advertisement expenses incurred by them in promoting the said mark. It
                  has also not been explained as to why its drug does not find mention in
                  CIMS Drug Book 2019-2020 and the Indian Drug Review (IDR)
                  Compendium 2021. Therefore, at this stage, the plea of the learned
                  counsel for the defendants of the defendants using the impugned mark
                  since 2014, cannot be accepted.
</p><p id="p_52">                  41.      The submission of the learned counsel for the defendant that they
                  be permitted to use the impugned mark as they are using the prefix
                  &quot;ZOY&quot; also with respect to their other medicinal preparations, also
                  cannot be accepted. Each mark of the defendant has to be tested on its
                  own standing. Merely because the defendant uses the prefix &quot;ZOY&quot; for
                  its other medicinal preparations, it cannot be allowed to use the impugned
                  mark even though the same is found to be deceptively similar to an
                  already registered mark with prior use.
</p><p id="p_53">                  42.      Since the products in question are medicinal products, in my
                  opinion, the test to be applied needs to be far stricter than the one applied
                  to other goods, as any confusion would result in public injury.
</p><p id="p_54">                  43.      In the present case, since the defendants have not been able to
                  satisfactorily show that they are the user of the impugned mark since
                  2014, and even otherwise would be the later entrant into the market, and
                  the two marks are phonetically and visually similar, the use of the
                  impugned mark of the defendants &quot;ZOYPOD&quot; is liable to be restrained.

</p><p id="p_56">                   44.      In view of the above, I find that the plaintiff has been able to make
                  out a good prima facie case in its favour. The balance of convenience
                  also lies in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. The plaintiff
                  is likely to suffer a grave irreparable injury if the ad-interim injunction is
                  not granted.
</p><p id="p_57">                  45.       Accordingly, an ad-interim injunction is granted in favour of the
                  plaintiff and against the defendants, restraining the defendants, their
                  proprietors, principal officers, directors, servants, representatives and
                  agents or any of them from manufacturing, marketing or selling
                  pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations under the mark „ZOYPOD‟ or
                  any deceptively similar variant of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark
                  „ZIPOD‟, either as a standalone mark or as a prefix mark or in any
                  manner whatsoever amounting to an infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                  registered trademark „ZIPOD‟ or passing off their pharmaceutical
                  preparations as those of the plaintiff, during the pendency of the present
                  suit.
