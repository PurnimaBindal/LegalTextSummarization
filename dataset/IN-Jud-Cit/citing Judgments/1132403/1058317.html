 ABSORB and LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY or any other mark deceptively similar to

the plaintiff and in relation to its goods.


2.      For the purposes of disposal of the applications, the following facts are to be

noticed:


PLAINTIFF'S CASE


2.1     The plaintiff, which was incorporated on 13.10.1988, claims to be one of the

quickest growing Fast Moving Consumer Goods (in short ‗FMCG') companies in India.

The plaintiff manufactures and trades in large range of products and hence, is a proprietor

with respect to such products sold by them in India and abroad. Amongst various

businesses, the plaintiff is also in the business of manufacture and sale of edible oil

products.


2.2     The plaintiff claims that in and around January, 2001 it coined the mark ―LOW

ABSORB‖, which, over a period of time was used in relation to those products which had

the quality of absorbing ―less‖ oil. The technology involved is evidently based on an

additive used in the production of edible oil which retards the foaming of oil during the

process of frying and/or cooking. Resultantly, the additive which is essentially an anti-

foaming agent, according to the plaintiff, reduces the absorption of oil by the food stuff

during the process of frying.        The said mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ was extensively

advertised by the plaintiff.


2.3     The plaintiff has since then obtained a registration of the trade mark ―LO-SORB‖

and also ―LOSORB‖. Both registrations were obtained in class 29 which are effective

from 28.05.2001. The plaintiff further claims that each month, it sells about 17.5 lacs of

units of edible oils under the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ and ―LOSORB‖ through its 53000

outlets which are spread all over India.      The edible oil manufactured by the plaintiff is

also evidently sold in the neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan as well as some

south-eastern countries.

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                              Page 2 of 36
 2.4        The plaintiff claims that in October-November, 2005, it aired advertisements

staring the famous chef Sanjeev Kapoor to promote its goods under trade mark

―LOSORB‖. It claims that it spend nearly Rs. 1.20 crores on the said advertisement. It is

also averred that services of other super models such as Ms Noyonika Chatterjee and Ms

Indrani Dasgupta were availed of for the purposes of advertisement in 2005.            It is

specifically averred that in so far as sales figure of the edible oils sold under the mark

―LOW ABSORB‖ and ―LOSORB‖ are concerned, they have arisen from Rs 102.48

crores in the year 2001-02 to nearly Rs 515.43 crores in the year 2008-09. In the first

quarter of 2008-09, it has registered a sale revenue of around Rs 131.10 crores.        The

advertising expenditure, between the period 2005-06 to 2008-09, has arisen from Rs. 3.90

crores to Rs 9.54 crores. In sum and substance, the case of the plaintiff is that extensive

user and publicity accompanied by the high quality of its goods has resulted in the trade

mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ and ―LOWSORB‖ being extensively identified and associated

with it.


2.5        The plaintiff alleged that in August, 2009, they came across the defendant's

advertisement in respect of edible oil manufactured and sold by the defendant under the

trade mark Sundrop which was accompanied by the plaintiff's trade mark ―LOW

ABSORB‖ and ―LOWSORB‖. It is alleged that the defendant has not only adopted the

plaintiff's mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ but also suffixed the mark with the word

―TECHNOLOGY‖. A fact, that it is used as a trade mark is evident from a bare perusal

of the advertisements wherein, the expression/word ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖

are accompanied by the letters ‗TM'. It is thus alleged that by using the letters ‗TM'

along with ―LOW ABSORB‖, the defendant has made a false representation that it has

exclusive rights over the use of the said mark. It is thus averred by the plaintiff that the

defendant, by using the word ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ in relation to edible oil

manufactured by it, is seeking to trade upon, and benefit from the goodwill and reputation

attached to the plaintiff's mark ―LOW ABSORB‖.


CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                            Page 3 of 36
 2.6      According to the plaintiff, its inquiries in the market have revealed that the

defendant has been using the mark ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ since July, 2009.

In order to assert its proprietary rights over the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖, the plaintiff

issued a cease and desist notice to the defendant on 14.08.2009 which was responded to

by the defendant vide its reply dated 25.08.2009. In view of the fact that the defendant

did not comply with the demand made by the plaintiff, the present action was instituted in

court.


2.7      The plaintiff thus claims that:


(i)      the usage of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ by the defendant is a colourable

imitation of the plaintiff's registered mark ‗LOSORB'.             There is, therefore, an

infringement of the plaintiff's exclusive right to use of the trade mark ‗LOSORB' in

relation to edible oils;


(ii)     the use of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ along with the word ―TECHNOLOGY‖ is

an attempt by the defendant to mislead the trade and the public that it has firstly, rights in

the said mark, and secondly, there is an association of the goods with the plaintiff,

whereas in fact there ought to be none;


(iii)    the use of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ by the defendant without due cause seeks

to take unfair advantage and is detrimental to the distinctive character, reputation and

goodwill of the plaintiff in its registered mark ―LOSORB‖ and ―LO-SORB‖;


(iv)     the use of the trade mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ by the defendant in relation to its

goods, is calculated to deceive and cause confusion in the minds of the customers, who

may relate the defendant's goods as those originating from the plaintiff; and,


(v)      lastly, the use of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ by the defendant seeks to dilute the

plaintiff's trade mark, which is well known and, has distinctive character and reputation.

The defendant's acts amount to unfair competition.


CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                              Page 4 of 36
 2.8     In support of the fact that the defendant has recognized the plaintiff's right over

the ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖, a reference is made to the complaint lodged by

the plaintiff before the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission. In

particular, a reference is made in this regard to the order dated 23.07.2002 passed by the

Commission on an application for grant of interim injunction filed by the defendant under

Section 12 A of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter

referred to as ‗MRTP Act').


3.      DEFENDANT'S CASE


3.1     The defendant, on the other hand, has refuted the case set up by the plaintiff. It is

averred by the defendant that it has a legitimate right to use the expression ―LOW

ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ on the packaging of its sunflower oil sold under trade mark

"Sundrop". This right, it asserts on the basis that its product edible includes an anti-

foaming agent, which in turn, retards the absorption of oil during the process of frying

food stuffs.   Therefore, the use of the word ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ is

justified.


3.2     In this regard, reference is made to <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_1">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999

(hereinafter referred to as ‗Trade Mark Act') which, according to the defendant, permits

use of the words or expression which are descriptive of the character and quality of goods

and services even against the proprietor of a registered trade mark. There can be,

according to the defendant, no monopoly conferred upon the plaintiff in use of the words

―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ or the term ―LOW ABSORB‖.


3.3     The defendant has also refuted the claim of the plaintiff that it has recognized the

plaintiff as a precursor in the use of ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖. It is averred

that the technology of adding anti-foaming agent in oil to induce more absorption

properties is universally prevalent, a fact which is evident from a bare perusal of the

provisions of Rule 26A of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules 1955 (in short ‗PFA


CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 5 of 36
 Rules') framed under the <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_2">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a>, 1954 (in short the ‗PFA

Act').    In support of its claim that the only difference between the product manufactured

and sold by the plaintiff under the trade mark "Sweekar" and that of the defendant sold

under the trade mark "Sundrop" was, that at the relevant time when the proceedings

were pending before the MRTP Commission, the plaintiff had been using in the

manufacture of its product an anti-foaming agent which induced properties of low

absorption of oil whereas, the defendant's product did not include the said ingredient. In

support of its submission, reliance is placed on the affidavit of the officer of the plaintiff

filed before the MRTP Commission.


3.4      It is further stated that the defendant is using the expression ―LOW ABSORB

TECHNOLOGY‖ in a descriptive manner by making an honest declaration of the

ingredients of its product and not as a trade mark as alleged by the plaintiff.


3.5      In addition, the defendant has taken a serious objection to the fact that the plaintiff

had filed a trade mark application bearing no. 1012561 dated 28.05.2001 for registration

of its mark ―LOW ABSORB‖, which, upon a search conducted, indicates that the same

stands withdrawn.      The defendant has asserted that the said application was withdrawn

upon an examination report issued by the Trade Mark Registrar after taking into

consideration the provisions of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Trade Marks Act, wherein are contained

grounds for refusal of registration of the mark sought by an applicant. In the alternative it

is pleaded that the plaintiff has considered the mark as descriptive and hence, withdrew

the same.


3.6      The defendant has also averred that the letters ‗TM' has reference to the entire

expression/mark ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ and just not ―LOW ABSORB‖ as

is alleged by the plaintiff.       There is, therefore, according to the defendant, no

misrepresentation as alleged by the plaintiff. In any event the registered mark of the

plaintiff is ―LOSORB‖ or ―LO-SORB‖ and not ―LOW ABSORB‖. Therefore, when



CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                                Page 6 of 36
 ―LOW ABSORB‖ is accompanied by the word ―TECHNOLOGY‖ there is no chance of

misrepresentation as alleged by the plaintiff.


3.7    It is averred that the use of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ by the plaintiff in relation

to its product is descriptive of the character of the product; the trade mark being Sweekar

which is the source identifier.     It is the defendant's case that plaintiff's right in the

registered mark, if at all, can only be infringed if the impugned mark is used in a manner

so as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.

According to the defendant the use of the expression ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖

is not likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.


SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSEL


4.     In support of the case set up by the plaintiff Mr Sandeep Sethi, learned senior

counsel, instructed by Ms Anuradha Salhotra made the following submissions:


4.1    The plaintiff has obtained registration of the trade marks ―LOSORB‖ and ―LO-

SORB‖ which relates back 28.05.2001. The plaintiff has been using the term ―LOW

ABSORB‖ along with its registered marks since 2001. The defendant's use of the trade

mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ in relation to edible oil in 2009 is dishonest. The learned

counsel drew my attention to sales and revenue figures, which I have already made note

of hereinabove. Particular stress was laid on the fact that the defendant, who was a

complainant before the MRTP, had itself accepted the fact that the plaintiff had spent a

sum of nearly Rs 2.43 crores on advertisement of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ and

―LOSORB‖. It was thus contended by the learned counsel that the defendant is guilty

both, in respect of, infringement of plaintiff's registered trade mark as well as

commission of tort of passing off. In support of its case for infringement Mr Sethi

invoked the provisions of <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_4">Section 29(1)</a> read with Section 2(1)(h) of the Trade Mark Act.

For this purpose he relied upon the following judgments:




CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                            Page 7 of 36
        <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_5">Rustan &amp; Hornby vs Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. AIR 1970 SC 1649 at page
1650 para 5 and at page 1651 para 7; <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_6">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma vs Navaratna
Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a> AIR 1965 SC 980 at page 990 para 28 and <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_7">Cadila Health
Care Ltd vs Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. 2001 PTC 300 (SC) at page 310.

4.2    In so far as plaintiff's case for tort of passing off against the defendant is

concerned, Mr Sethi stressed the fact that there has been an extensive use of its un-

registered mark ―LOW ABSORB‖, which to the knowledge of the defendant had

acquired extensive goodwill. It was submitted that it is no defence available in action for

passing off that the term ―LOW ABSORB‖ is generic as long as the plaintiff is able to

show that it has acquired goodwill in the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖. He further submitted

that registration of the mark does not disentitle the plaintiff from saying the defendant for

passing off as well. For this purpose, the reliance was placed on the provisions of Section

27(2) of the Trade Mark Act, as also the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_8">N.R. Dongre vs

Whirlpool Corporation</a> 1996 (7) JT S.C. 555.


4.3    It was submitted that the plaintiff is required to prove prior user. The extent of

user is also not relevant.     Reliance for this proposition was laid on the following

judgments:


<a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_9">Century Traders vs Roshal Lal Duggar</a> AIR 1978 Del. 280 at page 259 para 14 and at
page 252-253 para 12; <a href="/doc/1138005/" id="a_10">B.K. Engineering vs U.B.H.I. Enterprises (Regd.) Lidhiana</a> AIR
1985 Del. 210 at page 219 paras 51 and 52 and at page 215 para 26 and Laxmikant V.
Patel vs Chetanbhai Shah (2002) 3 SCC 65 at page 73 para 13.

4.4    It was further contended by Mr Sethi that the defence of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_11">Section 35</a> of the Trade

Marks Act is limited only to an infringement action and that too if the use of the mark by

the defendant is bonafide and not used as a trademark. In support of this submission

reliance was placed on the following judgments:


Baume &amp; Coy Ltd vs Moore (A.H.) Ld 1958 RPC 226 at page 234 lined 16 &amp; 34 and at
page 235 line 31 and <a href="/doc/1692857/" id="a_12">Picot Limited vs Goya Limited</a> 1967 RPC 573 at page 577 line

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 8 of 36
 4.5       The learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the defence taken up by the

defendant that the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ was generic or descriptive is not a defence

available in an action for infringement of trade mark. For this purpose he relied upon the

judgment of Picot Limited (supra) at page 577 line 46 and at page 578 line 30. It was

Mr Sethi's contention that a generic mark can acquire secondary meaning. In support of

this submission reliance was placed on the following judgments:


<a href="/doc/611556/" id="a_13">Mohd. Rafiq vs Modi Sugar Mills</a> AIR 1972 Del. 46 page 47 para 6 and page 49 para

PTC 416 (Del.) at page 431 para 33, at page 432 para 35 and at page 433 para 37.


4.6       In these circumstances, it was contended by Mr Sethi that since ingredients of

both infringement and commission of tort of passing off were present, injunction ought to

be confirmed.


5.        Mr V.P. Singh, learned senior counsel, instructed by Mr Pravin Anand, on the

other hand in rebuttal made the following submissions:


5.1       The injunction in the present case ought to be vacated on the sole ground, as

noticed above, that the plaintiff had failed to disclose the fact that it had withdrawn its

application no. 1012561 dated 28.05.2001 for registration of its mark ―LOW ABSORB‖.

The non-disclosure of this information disentitles the plaintiff from grant of any equitable

relief.


5.2       The reason as to why the application was withdrawn and the material with regard

to the same is available with the plaintiff. Failure on the part of the plaintiff to disclose

the same should result in the court drawing an adverse inference. Reliance in this regard

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 9 of 36
 was placed on the judgment of <a href="/doc/1490362/" id="a_18">National Insurance vs Kusum Devi</a> 1999 ACJ 1213 and

<a href="/doc/1917909/" id="a_19">Gopal Krishanji vs Mahomed Haji</a> AIR 1968 SC 1413.


5.3    The dispute before the MRTP commission was only with respect to whether or

not the advertisement issued by the plaintiff was one which disparaged the goods of the

defendant and also made a false representation to the public that the plaintiff's product

absorbed less oil.   It had nothing to do with acceptance of the plaintiff's proprietary

rights over its un-registered mark ―LOW ABSORB‖.


5.4    The interlocutory order of the MRTP Commission accepted the right of the

plaintiff to use the expression ―LOW ABSORB‖ because its product contained the

ingredient which acted as an anti-foaming agent thereby, retarding the absorption of oil

during the process of frying food stuffs. This technology finds a reflection in Rule 62-A

of the PFA Act. Therefore, as the defendant was also using the said ingredient in the

product edible oil manufactured by it; it was entitled to convey the same to the public at

large. This right was conferred on it under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_20">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act; therefore,

since in the circumstances set out above it could only be construed as bonafide use of the

expression ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖.                 He further contended that the labels

used by both parties were completely distinct and dissimilar and, there was no possibility

of any confusion or, deception of members of the public, or trade as alleged by the

plaintiff. According to him the term ―low absorb‖ is commonly used to describe the

characters of such a product. The term being generic and in public domain the plaintiff

cannot claim monopoly over the same. It was Mr Singh's contention that both the

plaintiff and the defendant has been using the term ―LOW ABSORB‖ along with their

respective trade marks, i.e., Sweekar and Sundrop. Both for the plaintiff as well as the

defendant, the marks were descriptive of the character of their respective products. Mr

Singh stressed upon the fact that the defendant is using the impugned expression ―LOW

ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ in relation to its refined Sunflower edible oil merely in a

descriptive manner by making an honest declaration of the ingredients contained in the

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                           Page 10 of 36
 defendant's product. Mr Singh contended that the marks being could not have been

registered. In any event, mere registration does not preclude the court from taking a view

in the matter. Reliance in this regard was placed on the following judgments:


<a href="/doc/276675/" id="a_21">Lowenbrau AG &amp; Anr. vs Jagpin Breweries Ltd &amp; Anr. MIPR</a> 2009 (1) 356; SBL Ltd

2007 (35) PTC 697 (Bom.) and <a href="/doc/1413625/" id="a_24">Sant Kumar vs Ram Lakhan</a> 1999 II AD (Del.) 804.

5.5    Mr Singh further contended that in the instant case not only the trade marks, that

is, ―Sweekar‖ used by the plaintiff, and ―Sundrop‖ used by the defendant are different but

even the packaging is dissimilar.      The plaintiff cannot enforce its right over the

defendant's use of the expression ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ without filing a

separate trade mark application. Reliance in this regard was placed on <a href="/doc/1570152/" id="a_25">Indian Habitat

Centre vs Sunita Aeren MIPR</a> 2008 (2) 379.


5.6    He further contended that the plaintiff's right over the expression ‗LOSORB'

cannot extend to ―LOW ABSORB‖ which is descriptive of the goods in question. The

defendant is using the words ―LOW ABSORB‖ only by way of information by giving

prominence to its trade mark Sundrop.         The expression ‗LOSORB' and ―LOW

ABSORB‖ are distinct and dissimilar, and since packaging is also different there is no

likelihood of confusion in the minds of the general public. Reliance in this regard was

REASONS


6.     I have heard the learned counsel of the parties and also examined the case set up

by the parties. In my view, the plaintiff has attempted to support its case both on the

ground of infringement of its registered mark ‗LOSORB' and ‗LO-SORB' as also on

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                           Page 11 of 36
 ground of commission of tort of passing off by the defendant of its un-registered trade

mark ―LOW ABSORB‖.


6.1     What is come through in the arguments, is that, both the plaintiff and the

defendant as of today manufacture edible oil in which one of the additives is an anti-

foaming agent which retards the absorption of oil by food stuffs during the process of

frying. Both counsels before me have not disputed this position. Therefore, a priori the

issue which arises for consideration is: are the registered marks ‗LOSORB' and ‗LO-

SORB' prima facie valid? The statutory rights of the plaintiff under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_28">Section 29</a> of the

Trade Marks Act qua infringement of its mark are subject to the provisions of Section 28

of the Trade Mark Act. The relevant part of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_29">Section 28</a> of the Trade

Marks Act, for the sake of convenience is extracted hereinafter:


        "28. Rights conferred by registration. - (1) Subject to the other provisions of
        this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered
        proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in
        relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is
        registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in
        the manner provided by this Act."

6.2.    A bare reading of the provisions sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_30">Section 28</a> would show that

the rights conferred by registration of a mark is subject to: firstly, other provisions of the

Act, and secondly, the exclusive right conferred on the registered proprietor or permitted

user is circumscribed by the expression ‗if valid'. Similarly, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_31">Section 30</a> in particular sub-

section (2) clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_32">Section 30</a> provides that a registered mark is not infringed, where

the use is made to describe inter alia ‗kind' or ‗quality' of goods or services as the case

may be. Contra distinguish this with <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_33">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act, which provides

that in all legal proceedings relating to a registered mark the original registrations and all

subsequent assignments and transmissions shall be taken as prima facie evidence of its

validity.   This necessarily would mean that it does not foreclose a challenge to the

validity of the registration of a mark. In case of Lowenbrau AG (supra), a single Judge

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                              Page 12 of 36
 of this Court, while considering the issue as to whether the validity of the registration of a

trade mark could be considered at an interlocutory stage, observed as follows:


       "11. <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_34">Section 28</a> of the Act while referring to rights conferred on registration
       begins with the words 'registration of trade-marks shall, if valid,... 'Rights
       under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_35">Section 28</a> flow when the registration of the mark is valid.
       Registration is only prima facie evidence of its validity <a href="/doc/1961341/" id="a_36">Refer, P.M. Diesels
       Pvt. Ltd. v. Thukral Mechanical Works</a>,                34(1988) DLT 235=
       AIR1988Delhi282 . (emphasis is mine)
       12. <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_37">Section 124</a> of the Act reads:
       124. Stay of proceedings .......
       (1) xxxx
       (2) xxxx.
       (3) xxxx.
       (4) xxxx.
       (5) xxxx.
       13. A defendant can set up a defence challenging validity of registration as
       provided in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_38">Section 124</a> of the Act but the civil court trying the suit is
       mandated to stay the suit when in defence plea of invalidity of registration is
       raised, to await outcome of the rectification proceedings and if no
       proceeding is pending and the court is satisfied that the plea of invalidity is
       prima facie tenable, adjourn the case for a period of three months from the
       date of framing of the issues to enable the defendant to approach the
       authorities for rectification of the registration. Thereafter on filing of an
       application for rectification trial in the suit is to be stayed till disposal of the
       rectification proceeding (see, <a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_39">Section 124(2)</a> of the Act). Sub-section 4 of
       Section 124 states that the suit will be disposed of on the basis of the order
       passed by the authorities and the question of validity of registration will be
       binding on the court. Sub-section (5) to <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_40">Section 124</a>, however, stipulates that
       the civil Court will be competent to pass an interlocutory order even when
       procedure under Sub-<a href="/doc/890640/" id="a_41">sections 1</a> to <a href="/doc/340780/" id="a_42">4</a> is to be followed and order of the
       Registrar/authorities is awaited and the suit is stayed.
       14. In view of <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_43">Section 124(5)</a> of the Act, this Court is competent to
       adjudicate and decide the interlocutory application for injunction. While
       deciding the interlocutory application in view of language of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_44">Sections 28</a>
       and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_45">124</a> of the Act, the Court is competent to take prima facie view on the
       question of validity of registration of the mark in favour of either side.
       Merely because the mark is registered, injunction will not automatically
       follow, when validity of registration is questioned in the written
       statement/pleadings. While deciding whether injunction should be granted
       or not, a tentative view is required to be taken on the question of validity of
       registration and principles for grant of injunction applied. However, final
CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                                Page 13 of 36
        decision on validity of registration is to be taken by the authorities and not
       by the civil Court. Registration is prima facie regarded as valid but mere
       registration alone is not conclusive and is not binding on the civil court
       when the application for injunction is considered and decided. Onus,
       however, will be on the party which questions validity of registration to
       show that the registration is prima facie and tentatively bad or invalid.
       15. <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_46">Section 31</a> of the Act reads:
       <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_47">Section 31</a>. Registration to be .......
       (1) xxxx.
       (2) xxxx.
       16. The said Section has to read harmoniously with <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_48">Sections 28</a> and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_49">124</a> of
       the Act. At the stage of interim application the Court is required to examine
       question of validity. Registration is prima facie evidence of validity but not
       conclusive even at this stage. Sub-<a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_50">section 2</a> to <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_51">Section 31</a> of the Act,
       stipulates that registration of the mark will not be held to be invalid on the
       ground that the mark could not have been registered under <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_52">Section 9</a> of the
       Act except upon evidence of distinctiveness and there was failure to submit
       such evidence before the Registrar, provided evidence is filed in the legal
       proceedings to prove that the mark had acquired distinctiveness on the date
       of registration. Legal proceedings will include Suits filed by the registered
       owner of the mark against third parties. <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_53">Section 32</a> of the Act, states that if a
       mark stands registered contrary to <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_54">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act and registration is
       bad for lack of distinctiveness on the date of registration, the party can
       defend the challenge by showing that they have acquired a distinctive
       character after registration but before commencement of the legal
       proceedings. These Sections also show that question of distinctiveness can
       be examined at the stage of grant of interim injunction by the courts.
       17. <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_55">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act is reproduced below:
       9. Absolute grounds.......
       (1) xxxx
       18. Thus whether there was violation and failure to meet conditions of
       <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_56">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act, can be examined and a tentative opinion formed by
       the court for deciding the interim application." (emphasis is mine)


7.     In my view ―LOW ABSORB‖ in its various forms including the marks which are

registered by the plaintiff or otherwise as used by the defendant is in reality only

descriptive of the characteristic of the product, that is, it absorbs ‗less oil' during the

process of frying of food stuffs.    Prima facie the registration of the mark is suspect.

Therefore, in my opinion the rights that the plaintiff claims should inhere in it by virtue



CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 14 of 36
 of a registration of mark ―LOSORB‖ and ―LO-SORB‖ under the provisions of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_57">Section 29</a>

of the Trade Marks Act are prima facie not available to the plaintiff in the instant case.


8.         My view is fortified by the observations of the Supreme Court in the case of J.R.

Kapoor (supra).          In the said case, the contesting parties were using the marks

―Micronix‖ and ―Microtel‖. The Supreme Court was called upon to adjudicate as to

whether the same were deceptively similar. The Supreme Court noted that the word

micro was descriptive of the technology used. It was, according to the court, a term of

common usage over which no one party could claim monopoly.                    The following

observations of the Supreme Court in this regard being relevant are extracted

hereinbelow:


           "Further, the word „micro‟ being descriptive of the micro technology used
           for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market, no
           one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word. Anyone producing
           any product with the use of micro-chip technology would be justified in using
           the said word as a prefix to his trade name. What is further, those who are
           familiar with the use of the electronic goods know fully well and are not
           likely to be misguided or confused merely by the prefix „micro‟ in the trade
           name. Once, therefore, it is held that the word „micro‟ is a common or
           general name descriptive of the products which are sold or of the technology
           by which the products are manufactured, and the users of such products are,
           therefore, not likely to be misguided or confused by the said word, ....."

8.1        In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that there has been any infringement.

Descriptiveness and distinctiveness is a defence available against registered marks as

well.


9.         In my view, the discussion as to whether the use of the expression ―LOW

ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ by the defendant is bonafide or not is not of much

significance, once I have come to the conclusion that the expression ―Low Absorb‖ is

descriptive of the character of the product which is being manufactured and sold by both

parties.

CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                              Page 15 of 36
 10.     There can be no dispute that even a descriptive word can be used as a trade mark

provided it becomes ―well known‖ and acquires secondary distinctive meaning.                   In

support of his submission, on this aspect, Mr Sethi had relied upon the sales revenue

figures as well as the expenses incurred on advertisements to demonstrate the extensive

use of its trade mark.      He had supported this submission with the stand taken by the

defendant before the MRTP Commission that the plaintiff had expended a sum of Rs 2.43

crores on advertising. In this regard, it is pertinent to note as to what is the composition

of the rival labels.   The labels of the plaintiff and the defendant is as under:

            PLAINTIFF'S                             DEFENDANT'S




11.     The colour scheme of the plaintiff's label is red, yellow, orange and white with

―LOSORB‖ written in green, while that of the defendant is blue, yellow with ―low absorb

technology‖ written in yellow.        Therefore, what is clear is that apart from different

colour scheme and get up, the rival products are actually being sold in the market under

different trade marks; the plaintiff uses the mark ―Saffola‖ while the defendant uses the

mark ―Sundrop‖.        It cannot at this stage conclusively be said by merely looking at the

sales revenue figures and the advertisements spend that on mentioning ―LOW ABSORB‖

the plaintiff's goods come to the mind of the consumers.       There are no survey reports of

the consumers or any other evidence which would even prima facie point to the fact that


CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                               Page 16 of 36
 ―LOW ABSORB‖ has attained secondary distinctive meaning of a standard which has the

ability to source the origin of the goods to the plaintiff. At times even consumer surveys

are not persuasive evidence; much would depend on the sample chosen and the nature of

the questions asked. In this respect even the averments made by the defendant in its

application under Section 12A of the MRTP Act shed no light. For the purposes of

convenience, the relevant averments made in paragraph 10 of the said application are

extracted hereinbelow:

       "The Analyzer Report of sale of Respondent No. 3 in the last three months</pre>
<p id="p_1">       shows increase in the sales of "New Sweekar" low absorb oil. It is also
       pertinent to point out that Respondent No. 3 has spent over Rs 2,43,00,000/-
       over the false, misleading and disparaging advertising campaign in respect of
       its "New Sweekar Oil" on various T.V. channels alone."
</p><p id="p_2">12.    In my opinion, a use of the mark does not necessarily translate into the mark

obtaining secondary distinctive meaning. [<a href="/doc/172757974/" id="a_58">See Rich Products Corporation &amp; Anr. vs

Indo Nippon Food Ltd. CS(OS</a>) 246/2004 dated 19.02.2010]. This is an issue which

perhaps would more clearly come through at the stage of trial. In view of the aforesaid

discussion, I am of the opinion that prima facie there is no case made out for

infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">13.    The last issue raised was with regard to the commission of tort of passing off by

the defendant. Passing off, as is well known, is a tort of false representation calculated to

damage the goodwill of the plaintiff. It is not necessary in an action for passing off for

the plaintiff to prove that there was an intent on behalf of the defendant to deceive. The

test is of likelihood of deception and not as to whether there was any intent to deceive. A

perusal of the rival labels clearly demonstrate that except for the usage of the words

‗LOSORB TECHNOLOGYTM‖ (carried with the plaintiff's marks) and similarly, ―LOW

ABSORB TECHNOLOGYTM‖ (shown in the defendant's mark) there is no commonality

between the two. The colour scheme, the font, the trade dress and get up is completely

different. The plaintiff's label mark has a picture of a heart, while that of the defendant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 17 of 36</span>
 carries a picture of a child in an acrobatic pose. Therefore, prima facie, in my opinion,

there is no case even for passing off made out.
</p>
<p id="p_5">14.    Let me deal with the cases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff during the

course of oral arguments. Any further foray in this direction would increase the burden

of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
14.1   <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_59">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma vs Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>

AIR 1965 SC 980. The brief facts of the case were that: the respondent before the

Supreme Court carried on business in the name and style of Navratna Pharmaceutical

Laboratories. Initially the business was started in the name of Navratna Pharmacy which

was changed to Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories. Over a period of time the said

respondent came to sell its medicinal products under the trade mark ―Navratna‖ and

―Navratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories‖.      The respondent obtained registration for its

trade mark Navratna as well as that of Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories. The

appellant, on the other hand, sold its products under the trade name Navratna Kalpa

Pharmacy bearing the trade mark ―Navratna Kalpa‖.              The appellant applied for

registration of its trade mark Navratna Kalpa. This was opposed by the respondent on the

ground that the Navratna was descriptive having no distinctiveness and hence, could not

be registered. This objection of the respondent was upheld. The appellant's application

for registration of the trade mark was refused. This refusal led to the various proceedings

being filed, which ultimately culminated in two appeals being filed in the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court upheld the finding of the court of first instance, to the effect that the

word Navratna was a common word in ayurvedic phraseology and consequently, the

plaintiff could not claim an exclusive right to the use of the word by using it for products

even though this had been sold for a number of years. The court, however, proceeded to

confirm the injunction in favour of the plaintiff/respondent with respect to the trade mark

Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories on the ground of a factual finding returned of

plaintiff's user for an extensive period to an extent that the said mark came to be

exclusively associated with the goods of the plaintiff/respondent.            These being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                            Page 18 of 36</span>
 concurrent findings of fact on the issue of acquired distinctiveness the Supreme Court did

not deem it fit to disturb the injunction granted. While adjudicating upon the appeals

filed the court made some pertinent observations in paragraphs 28 and 29 at page 989 as

to the intrinsic difference between an action for infringement of the registered trade mark

and that of passing off.     The learned counsel for the plaintiff while relying upon the

judgment submitted that since it had a registration in its favour in respect of the mark

‗LOSORB' and ‗LO-SORB' the use of the defendant of the mark ‗LOW ABSORB'

resulted in the infringement of its statutory right under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_60">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks

Act. The learned counsel for the plaintiff stressed upon the fact that since the essential

features of the mark were similar both visually as well as phonetically, this court do not

have to look further and injunction should automatically follow notwithstanding the

difference in the get up and the packaging of the products manufactured by the defendant.

In my opinion two aspects stand out in judgment. First, the refusal by the Supreme Court

to overturn the finding of the court of first instance whereby, the plaintiff's claim of

exclusivity in the word Navratna was rejected on ground that it was a common word in

ayurvedic phraseology; and second, that it upheld the plaintiff's right in Navratna

Pharmaceutical Laboratories on the basis of evidence of acquired distinctiveness; such is

not the situation obtaining in the instant case.

14.2   <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_61">Ruston and Hornby Ltd vs Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. AIR 1970 SC 1649.

Briefly this was a case where the appellant-company was a registered proprietor of the

mark RUSTON. The said mark was used in relation to the internal combustion engines

sold by it.   On the other hand, the respondent, which was also in the business of

manufacture and sale of diesel internal combustion engines, traded in the said goods

under the trade mark ‗RUSTOM'.            The Supreme Court once again reiterated the

difference in the nature of an action for infringement of a trade mark and that which

pertained to passing off. The point to be noted is that eventhough the Supreme Court in

this case was dealing with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_62">Trade Marks Act</a> of 1940, the general

principles enunciated vis-à-vis infringement and passing off action would apply. The

 observations of the Supreme Court in paragraphs 6, 7 &amp; 8 being pertinent are extracted

hereinbelow:
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "6.The action for infringement is a statutory right. It is dependent upon the
       validity of the registration and subject to other restrictions laid down in
       <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_63">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_64">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_65">35</a> of the Act. On the other hand the gist of a passing off
       action is that A is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B but it is
       not necessary for to prove that A did this knowingly or with any intent to
       deceive. It is enough that the get-up of B's goods has become distinctive of
       them and that there is a probability of confusion between them and the goods
       of A. No case of actual deception nor any actual damage need be proved. At
       common law the action was not maintainable unless there had been fraud on
       A's part. In equity, however, Lord Cottenham L.C. in Millington v. Fox,
       (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr. 338 held that it was immaterial whether the defendant had
       been fraudulent or not in using the plaintiff's trade mark and granted an
       injunction accordingly. The common law courts, however, adhered to their
       view that fraud was necessary until the Judicature Acts, by fusing law and
       equity, gave the equitable rule the victory over the common law rule.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       7. The two actions, however, are closely similar in some respects. As was
       observed by the Master of the Rolls in Saville Perfumery Ltd. v. June Perfect
       Ltd. (1941) 58 R.P.C.147 at page 161.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               The Statute law relating to infringement of trade marks is based on
               the same fundamental idea as the law relating to passing-off. But it
               differs from that law in two particulars, namely (1) it is concerned
               only with one method of passing-off, namely, the use of a trade mark,
               and (2) the statutory protection is absolute in the sense that once a
               mark is shown to offend, the user of it cannot escape by showing that
               by something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his
               goods from those of the registered proprietor. Accordingly, in
               considering the question of infringement the Courts have held, and it
               is now expressly provided by the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_66">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1938, <a href="/doc/340780/" id="a_67">Section 4</a>,
               that infringement takes place not merely by exact imitation but by the
               use of a mark so nearly resembling the registered mark as to be
               likely to deceive.

restrained the defendant from infringing the plaintiff's trade mark ‗RUSTON' from using

it in connection with the engines, machinery and accessories manufactured and sold by it

this judgment that based on the similarity of rival marks court could not look to features

external to mark.    In my view the judgment is distinguishable. It did not deal with a

descriptive marks and the concomitant legal issues which arise in the instant, that is,

validity and acquired distinctiveness etc.

Briefly this is a case where both the appellant and respondent were in the business of

manufacturing pharmaceutical products. As a matter of fact both were part of the Cadila

Group. Upon restructuring of the business the assets of the erstwhile Cadila Group were

taken over both by the appellant and the respondent. The appellant had manufactured a

drug under the trade mark/brand name ‗Falcigo' which contained Artesunate used for the

treatment of cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria is commonly known as ‗Falcipharum'.

After obtaining the necessary permission from the Drugs Controller General (India) it

commenced manufacture and sale of the said drug ‗Falcigo' across the world.           The

respondent, on the other hand, also obtained permission from the Drug Controller

General (India) for treatment of falcipharum malaria. The respondent's drug contained

‗mefloquine hydrochloride'.     The respondent's drug was sold under the trade mark

dismissed the appellant's application for interim injunction.      The appeal to the High

Court met with the same result. The Supreme Court did not interfere with the decisions

of the court below and instead issued directions for expeditious disposal of the suit. In its

judgment, however, the Supreme Court while giving its reason for not interfering also set

out principles which are to be kept in mind by courts while dealing with an action for

passing off especially when they relate to cases dealing with medicinal products. It is

pertinent to note that Supreme Court in this case over-ruled its judgment in the case of

<a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_69">S.M. Dyechem Ltd vs Cadbury (India) Ltd</a>. (2000) 5 SCC 573 on the aspect with regard

to the test to be applied in a passing off action while comparing similar marks to ascertain

whether there is likelihood of deception or cause for confusion. The Supreme Court

squarely rejected the conclusion in S.M. Dyechem (supra) that the test of dissimilarity in

essential features have to be applied as against the test of similarity. The Supreme Court,

however, accepted the principle enunciated in S.M. Dyechem (supra) that in trade mark

cases, it was necessary to ascertain the comparable strength of case of either party apart

from balance of convenience. The Court laid down the test for deciding the question of

deceptive similarity in a passing off action of an unregistered trade mark. Since the test

enunciated in the judgment were also relied upon by the learned counsel for the plaintiff,

the same are extracted hereinbelow for the sake of convenience:

<p id="p_14">14.7    Baume &amp; Coy Ld. Vs Moore (A.H.) Ld. 1958 RPC 226.                  In this case the

plaintiffs who were in appeal before the Court of Appeal had sought an injunction against

the defendants seeking a restraint against infringement of their registered trade mark, and

from passing off their goods (which were watches in this case) as those originating from

the plaintiffs.    The plaintiffs' trade mark consisted of the word ‗Baume' which was

registered for watches and all other descriptions of horological instruments.            The

plaintiffs' predecessors in business had been carrying on the business of watches since

1834. The watches were manufactured for them by a firm in Switzerland and were

imported into U.K. It was admitted by the defendants that since at least 1880 the

plaintiffs' had been in the business of selling watches either directly or their predecessors

under the trade mark ‗Baume'; that said business was substantial one and from many

years substantial money had been expended on advertising. The defendant, on the other

hand, carried on business of importing watches which they sold directly to wholesalers.

In 1954 they had entered into an business arrangement with a Swiss company by the

name of Baume &amp; Mercier, Societe Anonyme, of Geneva. The plaintiffs in their action

pleaded that use of the word ‗Baume' as part of the name of watches advertised, offered

for sale and sold by the defendants constituted an infringement of plaintiff's registered

mark, and was also calculated to deceive and cause confusion amongst the traders as well

as public at large as to the origin of the goods. The Court of the first instance, while

holding that there was sufficient similarity which might result in confusion in respect of

sale of watches, dismissed the action of infringement on the ground that defendant was

entitled to protection accorded under <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_70">Section 8</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1938; and in so

far as plaintiffs' action for passing off is concerned the same was rejected on the ground

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                             Page 24 of 36</span>
 that there had been honest user by the defendant of the ―maker's own name‖. The court

of appeal while sustaining the order of the court below for dismissal of action for

infringement granted injunction on the ground of passing off.            In this context the

following observations being relevant are extracted hereinbelow:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "We first propose to consider first the issue of passing off. It is quite clear on
       the evidence, and indeed from the defendants' admission to which we have
       already referred, that the name "Baume" has, for many years past been
       associated in this country with the watches distributed by the plaintiffs. The
       questions on this part of the case would accordingly appear to be: (1) Have
       the plaintiffs established that the sale by the defendants of Baume &amp; Mercier
       watches is reasonably calculated to cause confusion in the trade and in the
       minds of the public; and (2) if so, is it a valid defence for the defendants to
       show (as they did show to the learned judge's satisfaction) that there had
       been an honest use by them of the makers' own name?....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       ....We turn, therefore, to the question whether the evidence which was called
       before the learned judge was such as to justify the view that the acts of which
       the plaintiffs complain were likely to cause deception. This is essentially a
       question of fact. In Reddaway v. Banham, which was an action to restrain
       passing off, LORD HALSBURY, L.C., said (13 R.P.C. at p. 224): (emphasis
       is mine)

       "My Lords, I believe that this case turns upon a question of fact. The question
       of law is so constantly mixed up with the various questions of fact which
       arise on an inquiry of the character in which your Lordships have been
       engaged, that it is sometimes difficult when examining former decisions to
       disentangle what is decided as fact, and what is laid down as a principle of
       law. For myself, I believe the principle of law may be very plainly stated, and
       that is that nobody has any right to represent his goods as the goods of
       somebody else.</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">       How far the use of particular words, signs or pictures does or does not come
       up to the proposition which I have enunciated in each particular case, must
       always be a question of evidence, and the more simple the phraseology, the
       more like it is to a mere description of the article sold, the greater becomes
       the difficulty of proof, but, if the proof establishes the fact, the legal
       consequence appears to follow." (emphasis is mine)

 14.8    The core issues were: whether use of the name ‗Baume' as part of trade name

could be termed on facts a honest user; and, was the use likely to cause deception in the

minds of the public. As noted by the court much would depend upon the evidence

adduced. Importantly, it held that more simple the 'phraseology' which is a mere

description of the article 'sold' the greater the difficulty of proof. A close scrutiny of

the ratio would show that the observations made, do not further the cause of the plaintiff

at least, at this stage.

this court upheld the order of the learned Single Judge in the background of the following

facts: The appellant had developed and launched in the market a product containing

‗Aspartame' an artificial sweetener. This product evidently is low in calorie and acts as a

substitute for natural sugar. The appellant's product was sold under the brand name/trade

mark ‗sugar free'. The appellant claimed that it had 74% market share in India in respect

of what it claimed was a sugar substitute market. The respondent on the other hand

adopted the trade mark ‗sugar free' in respect of frozen desserts.


14.10 To be noted this was a judgment cited both by the plaintiff as well as the

defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
14.11 The learned counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the observations of the Division

paragraph 14 at page 44:

<p id="p_19">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        "However we make it clear that if any party enters into the domain of

<p id="p_20">14.12 As against this, the defendants relied upon the observations of the Single Judge,

which was cited with approval by the Division Bench in paragraph 4(h) which reads as

follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                           Page 26 of 36</span><p id="p_21">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "Mere descriptive distinction of a trademark by a trader, irrespective of acquisition
     of secondary meaning and distinctiveness in relation to trader/appellant‟s product
     cannot entitle the appellant to preclude others from using the said expression for
     the purposes of describing the characteristic features of their products. Thus, no
     blanket injunction can be granted against the respondent from using the expression
     „Sugar Free‟ only in the descriptive and not trademark sense particularly when the
     use of such an expression is widespread in relation to food and beverages. Thus, no
     embargo can be placed on the use of expression „Sugar Free‟ by the respondent
     particularly when the respondent had prima facie satisfied the court of its bonafide
     intention to use the said expression, not as a trademark but only in descriptive and
     laudatory sense." (emphasis is mine)

14.13 It may only be observed at this stage that the Division Bench made a pertinent

observation with regard to the registration of marks which is a combination of popular

English words in paragraph 9 of its judgment. These observations being relevant are

extracted hereinbelow:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      "9. We are unable to hold that the appellant‟s trademark „Sugar Free‟ is a
      coined word; at best it is a combination of two popular English Words. The
      mere fact that the appellant‟s product cannot be directly consumed or eaten
      and merely is an additive does not detract from the descriptive nature of the
      trade mark. Once a common phrase in the English language which directly
      describes the product is adopted by a business enterprise, such adoption
      naturally entails the risk that others in the field would also be entitled to use
      such phrases provided no attempt is made to ride on the band wagon of the
      appellant‟s indubitably market leading product „Sugar Free‟.             In this
      connection, merely because the attributes of „Sugar Free‟ can be described by
      other phrases cannot detract from the common usage of the phrase „Sugar
      Free‟ as denoting products which do not contain sugar and any trader which
      adopts such mark in the market place, does so with the clear knowledge of the
      possibility of other traders also using the said mark. That is precisely the
      reason for the denial of protection to such marks by refusing registration as
      envisaged by <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_72">Section 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_73">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_74">35</a> of the Act......
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      ....Thus, it is clear that the mark or indication which serves to designate the
      quality of the goods of the appellant, which indeed the phrase „Sugar Free‟
      does, would be an absolute ground for refusal of registration of a mark unless

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                           Page 27 of 36</span>
       it has acquired a distinctive character. The expression can at best be said
      distinctive qua the artificial sweetener of the appellant and mere starting of the
      marketing of the drink „Sugar Free D‟lite‟ cannot give the appellant the right
      to claim distinctiveness in the expression „Sugar Free‟ in relation to all the
      food products."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">14.14 The emphasis of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the result would have

been different had the defendant been in the same line of business - misses in my view

true ratio of the judgment.    The observations of the Division Bench that if the rival

producers were in the same line of business the plaintiff would have a ―just cause in

seeking restraint‖ cannot be read to mean that such an order would invariably follow as

matter of right without adverting to other aspects.

<p id="p_22">14.15 Picot ltd. vs Goya Ltd. (1967) RPC 573. This was a case where the plaintiffs

were manufacturers of perfumes sold under the trade mark ‗Picot'. Each perfume was

sold with a special name attached to it such as ‗Fiesta', ‗Pagan' and ‗Suede'. The

defendants, on the other hand, sold their perfumes under the trade mark ‗Goya'.       They

advertised new kind of perfume which was named ‗Piquant'. The defendants applied for

registration of the trade mark ‗Goya Piquant'. The plaintiffs filed an action and sought an

interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing their trade mark and

from passing off their goods as those emanating from the plaintiffs.         The plaintiffs

contended before the Court that since their goods were sold through a limited number of

chemists, members of the public who wanted the plaintiffs' product ‗Picot', might end up

buying the defendants' product ‗Piquant'. The defendants, on the other hand, took the

stand that ‗Piquant' was a descriptive word used in the perfume industry. The defendant

claimed that the word was descriptive of a fragrance and hence, the plaintiff could not

have monopoly to restrain its use by the defendants. In this context certain observations

of the learned Judge are relevant, which were also relied upon by the learned counsel for

the plaintiffs and hence, are extracted hereinbelow:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">      "Then it is contended by the defendants that the word "Piquant" or "Peekant"
     or "Peekont" is a descriptive word used in the trade as descriptive of a
     fragrance; and, on the evidence, I accept the latter part of the submission. The
     plaintiff company clearly cannot complain of a rival manufacturer of perfume
     describing their products as being piquant. Mr. Aldous on behalf of the
     defendants, however, goes further and submits that, the word "piquant" being a
     descriptive word, the plaintiffs can have no monopoly to restrain its use. Since
     "piquant," being a descriptive word, so the argument runs, could not be a trade
     name or trade mark, the plaintiffs cannot have a trade mark or a monopoly of
     which the use of the word "piquant" by another trader can be an infringement.
     While I accept the premise, I am not satisfied that the conclusion follows. The
     word PICOT is not a descriptive word in relation to perfumes, and, as I have
     said, is registered as the plaintiff's mark. Under the very terms of <a href="/doc/340780/" id="a_75">section 4</a> of
     the Trade Marks Act, 1938 that mark has to be infringed by the use of a mark so
     nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course
     of trade. If, then, the word PIQUANT is being used not in a descriptive sense
     but as a mark, and if PIQUANT so used so nearly resembles PICOT as to be
     likely to deceive or cause confusion, does the fact that it is a word which has
     hitherto been used in the trade as a descriptive word deprive the plaintiffs of
     statutory protection?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     In view of the strenuous and sustained argument advanced by Mr. Aldous in
     support of the contention that that question ought to be answered in the
     affirmative, I should, I think, state shortly my conclusion upon it. In my
     judgment, if I use a descriptive word not as a description of the character or
     quality of the goods but as a mark, and that mark so nearly resembles the
     plaintiffs' mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of
     trade, there is an infringement, and, in my judgment, it matters not that the
     mark used by the defendants is one which, being a descriptive word, could not
     itself be the subject of protection....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     ....I have not forgotten the evidence of the representatives of the plaintiffs, who,
     on asking if PICOT perfume was stocked, were offered the defendants‟ product.
     They, of course, were not deceived; but, apart from this, and in the absence of
     authority, I should be most hesitant in accepting evidence regarding trap orders
     untested by cross-examination as a reasonably sure foundation on which to
     grant an interlocutory injunction. An authority has been called to my attention
     which clearly shows that evidence given by those responsible for trap orders is

      affidavit evidence, cannot, in the absence of cross-examination, be applied. Mr

      purchaser of PICOT products has been misled into purchasing the defendants‟

</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">14.16 To be noted firstly, the court rejected the plaintiffs' case for grant of injunction on

the ground that they have not been able to produce evidence to establish that there was

likelihood of deception or confusion. At the interlocutory stage the court was hesitant in

accepting evidence which was in the nature of ―trap orders‖, and consequently untested in

cross-examination.      Secondly, in this case the plaintiff's mark ‗PICOT' was not

descriptive unlike the facts obtaining in the present case. In this case the defendant's

mark ‗PIQUANT‖ was claimed as being descriptive.              Interlocutory injunction was

refused on the ground of failure on the part of plaintiff to establish that the trade or

customers were deceived.         In my opinion, the judgment does not help the cause of

revenue, the mark's reputation had transcended to India. In these circumstances, the

court came to the conclusion that a case for injunction was made out. Importantly, the

court observed that in view of the fact that the rival trade marks were identical (and not

deceptively similar) the fact that the get up and the trade dress was different would not

 make any material difference to the conclusion that a prima facie of passing off was made

out. The court amongst others relied upon the observations of the Division Bench in the

case of B.K. Engineering (supra). On facts the case is distinguishable.


14.18 Association for <a href="/doc/52661/" id="a_77">Investment Management and Research and Anr. vs the Institute

of Chartered Financial Analysis of India &amp; Anr</a>. 2006 (33) PTC 352 (Del). This was a

case where the plaintiff was seeking restraint against the defendant from using the trade

mark and/or service mark as also trade name CFA, Chartered Financial Analysis, The

Institute of Chartered Financial Analysis of India, ICFA and ICFAI or any other mark

which was deceptively similar to the said marks. In this case the court proceeded to grant

an injunction in favour of the plaintiff and rejected the argument of the defendant's

counsel that CFA was an abbreviated form of Chartered Financial Analysis which are

commonly used words found in the English dictionary displaying no uniqueness.


14.19 Two crucial facts, according to me, which prevailed with the court in coming to

this conclusion that the case for injunction was made out: first, while the defendant

claimed that the marks were descriptive; contrary to its stand it was found to have itself,

applied for registration of the mark CFA, and second, the defendants had been granted

way back in 1985 a licence from one of the plaintiffs in the suit which subsequently was

terminated.

</p><p id="p_27">257. This was a case where the appellant had carried an appeal from an order of the

Division Bench of the High Court which had reversed the injunction granted by the single

Judge. The appellant/plaintiff in the said case sold tea under what it called its umbrella

mark ‗City Tea'. The different teas sold by the appellant were traded under different

marks, one such tea was sold under the mark ‗Super Cup'. This tea, according to the

appellant, was an extra strong CTC tea. The appellant also claimed that it had been

selling tea under the trade mark ‗Super Cup' for a considerable period of time, and had

invested a large amount of money in advertising the mark. It also alleged that the

 respondent/defendant, who was also in tea business, had wrongfully used the words

‗Super Cup' in connection sale of its tea. An action for passing off was instituted against

the respondent/defendant.    The Supreme Court in appeal set aside the order of the

Division Bench, and remanded the matter back to the Division Bench for a de novo

hearing.    While doing so, the Supreme Court reiterated the following well-known

principle, that is, ―descriptive trade mark may be entitled to protection if it has assumed

secondary meaning which identifies it with a particular product or as being from a

particular source.‖ Since the Division Bench had reversed the order of the Single Judge

apparently on the ground that ‗Super Cup' was descriptive and laudatory of the goods, it

was remanded back for re-examination of the matter in the light of principle enunciated

by the Supreme Court.

14.20 <a href="/doc/1861268/" id="a_79">Madhuban Holiday Inn vs Holiday In Inc</a>. 100 (2002) DLT 306 (DB). This was

a case where the Division Bench of this court was called upon to adjudicate as to whether

the plaintiff could use the trade mark ‗Holiday Inn' along with the prefix ‗madhuban' or

‗Kapoor'.    The appellant before the court claimed that ‗Madhuban Holiday Inn' was

descriptive of the business of hotel and hence, the plaintiff/respondent could not claim

monopoly over the same. The court, however, on facts came to the conclusion that

‗Madhuban Holiday Inn' were not ‗dictionary words' they were ―coined‖ by the

respondent/plaintiff and ―were descriptive of the business of the respondent/plaintiff‖.

The court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the grant of injunction by the Single Judge.

The Division Bench specifically found that the use of the word ‗Holiday Inn' by the

appellant/defendants was ―ex facie fraudulent and malafide from the very inception‖.

The plaintiff relies upon the judgment to contend that its mark ‗LOSORB' and ‗LO-

SORB' are coined words. Whether by removing the alphabet ‗W' by itself would make it

a coined or a fancy or an arbitrary mark is open to grave doubt. Assuming it were so, the

defendant is perhaps entitled to say and more certainly so at the interlocutory stage, that

its mark is descriptive of the character of the goods sold by it notwithstanding its attempt

to treat as a trade mark. What is peculiar about this case is that the plaintiff also seeks

unsuccessful attempt at registration.

plaintiffs in this case to sought an injunction against the defendants from using the mark

‗Scrabulous' in respect of a board game, which was being marketed by them for several

decades under the trade mark ‗Scrabble'. To be noted in this case the learned Single

Judge, while deciding the interlocutory application, rejected prima facie the plaintiff's

claim for copyright. However, the plaintiff's case for injunction was sustained even

though the word ‗Scrabble' was not descriptive of the word ―game‖ unlike ―monopoly‖

or ―crossword‖ -- on account of its extensive use and popularity which had resulted in

the word being used to describe the game itself. The court took note of the fact that even

the Oxford Dictionary referred the word ‗Scrabble' as a proprietary word game, and thus

displaced its primary meaning. It is, in these circumstances, that the court came to the

conclusion that a case for injunction had been made out since the plaintiffs had been able

to establish distinctiveness, while the defendants could not furnish any explanation as to

how they had come upon the mark ‗Scrabulous' in relation to the word game propagated

by it. The court also took into account the fact that the defendant's mark ‗Scrabulous'

was ‗phonetically' and ‗semantically' close to the plaintiff's mark. The case is once

again distinguishable. In the present case there is a good explanation put forth by the

defendant as to how and why they acquired the descriptor ―LOW ABSORB

TECHNOLOGY‖ for their product. Their recourse to the PFA Act in this regard, at this

stage, cannot be summarily rejected.

</p><p id="p_32">(i)    The court can at an interlocutory stage take a prima facie view as to the validity of

a registered trade mark. This view can be taken based on averments made in the written

statement/ pleadings. [See Lowenbrau AG (supra)]. The pleadings in this regard, as in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                            Page 33 of 36</span>
 every other case, has to be read ―meaningfully‖ (see <a href="/doc/130479/" id="a_81">Begum Sabiha Sultan vs Nawab

Mohd. Mansur Ali Khan &amp; Ors</a> (2007) 4 SCC 343)


</p><p id="p_33">(ii)    Some marks are inherently incapable of distinctiveness.        [See Asian Paints Ltd

(supra)]


</p><p id="p_34">(iii)   The rights under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_82">Section 28</a> are subject to other provisions of the Trade mark Act.

Also the registered proprietor or the permitted user can exercise his rights if the registered

mark ‗is valid'.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">(iv)    A descriptive mark can be registered provided it has acquired secondary meaning

[See Girnar (supra)]


</p><p id="p_37">(v)     If a descriptive mark is one, which is, essentially a combination of common

English words the user of the marks has to bear the risk of, some amount of confusion.

No monopoly can be claimed by the user of the mark. [See Cadila Health Care (supra)

&amp; J.R. Kapoor (supra)]


</p><p id="p_38">(vi)    The mark can be impugned both at the stage of registration and post registration.

See provisions of <a href="/doc/1288548/" id="a_83">Section 9(1)(a)</a> to (c) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_84">Trade Marks Act</a> for challenge at time of

registration and <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_85">Section 30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_86">35</a> for challenge after registration.


</p><p id="p_39">(vii)   If the registered mark and the rival mark are not identical; in other words the two

marks are similar then the same test as in the case of passing off is applicable; which is, is

there a likelihood of deception or cause for confusion. [See Ruston and Hornby Ltd

(supra)]


</p><p id="p_40">16.     In view of the discussion above in my opinion the use of the expression by the

defendant ―LOW ABSORB‖ or ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ cannot be injuncted

at this stage, since they are descriptive of the character or the quality of the defendant's

goods unlike a trade mark which identifies the origin. . This defence is available even

against registered mark under <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_87">Sections 30(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_88">35</a> of the Trade Marks Act. In the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                              Page 34 of 36</span>
 very least, this defence cannot be ruled out at the interlocutory stage. The use by the

defendant cannot be said to be not bonafide since not only does it contain the additive

which reduces oil absorption by food stuffs during the process of frying but the PFA

Rules also recognize such an eventuality.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">17.    The fact that the abbreviation ‗TM' appears alongside the expression ―With Low

Absorb Technology‖ can at best be categorized as fond hope of the defendant that over a

period of time it would gain trade mark significance.         It is not the case of the plaintiff

that the expression does not appear with defendant's registered mark ―Sundrop‖. The

defendant's trade mark is undoubtedly ―Sundrop‖. This apart, having held that the marks

‗LOW ABSORB‖, ‗LOSORB' and ‗LO-SORB' are prima facie descriptive with no

demonstrable acquired secondary distinctiveness; given the fact that there being no

invoices or advertisements filed which carry only the mark ‗LOW ABSORB',

―LOSORB‖, ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖ or ―LO-SORB‖; and the plaintiff and

defendant    use   the   said   marks    alongwith    their    respective    registered   marks

―Sweekar‖/―Saffola Gold‖ and ―Sundrop‖ the defendant can make no gain by such an

act. What is ―sauce for the goose‖ is also ―sauce for the gander‖. In my view, prima

facie none can monopolise the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖. To test the validity of this

argument, I had put it to Mr V.P. Singh whether they would remove the abbreviation

‗TM' used alongside its descriptor with ―LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY‖.                            The

learned senior counsel answered in the affirmative. I intend to hold the defendant to the

statement made in court.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">18.    I may also point out that the limiting factor of ―bonafide use‖ in a defence raised

under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_89">Section 35</a> is not found in Section 30(2)(a) of the Trade Mark Act.            In this case

though I have dealt with the issue of bonafide use. Since the rival marks in any event are

similar and not identical the plaintiff, at least at this stage, has not been able to advert to

any evidence which would persuade me to hold that there is likelihood of deception or

cause for confusion in minds of those in trade or prospective customers.           As observed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) 1590-2009                                                                 Page 35 of 36</span>
 above, the trade dress and get up are entirely dissimilar. Therefore, in my opinion, the

plaintiff has failed to make out at the interlocutory stage a case for either infringement or

passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">19.    What has strengthened my resolve in this case to refuse confirmation of ad-

interim ex parte order, is the non-disclosure of the fact that the plaintiff had filed an

application for registration of the mark ―LOW ABSORB‖ which was withdrawn. In the

course of argument neither any explanation was furnished nor was any material placed on

record to delineate the circumstances which led to the application being withdrawn.


</p><p id="p_47">20.    For the reasons given above, order dated 28.08.2009 is vacated. Consequently,

IA No. 11538/2009 filed by the defendant is allowed and that of plaintiff being IA No.

11037/2009 is dismissed. The defendant shall, however, remove, as contended, the

abbreviation T.M. alongside its descriptor ―with low-absorb technology‖.
