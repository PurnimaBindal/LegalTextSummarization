</p><p id="p_5">1.   The petitioner seeks to invoke the civil writ jurisdiction of this court
praying for a writ in the nature of certiorari or any other writ for quashing
the order dated 28.04.2011 passed by Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal,
New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as "the DRAT") and the subsequent
communication dated 30.06.2011 issued in its wake by LIC Housing
Finance Ltd. (respondent No. 3) calling upon her to surrender property No.
1735, New Gita Colony, Mirzapur Road, Hissar, Haryana (hereinafter
referred to as "the subject property") within a period of three months
beginning 28.04.2011.
</p><p id="p_6">2.    It is necessary to trace the background facts at some length.
</p><p id="p_7">3.    The first respondent was the owner of the subject property during the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                   Page 1 of 33</span>
 relevant period when on 16.05.2003 he, along with another, approached the
third respondent ("the secured creditor") for a housing loan. The loan of
₹4,50,000/- was sanctioned against equitable mortgage created in respect of
the subject property. The loan amount was re-payable over a period of 15
years with equated monthly installment (EMI) settled at ₹4,919/-. It has
been the case of the borrower (the first respondent) that only an amount of
₹2 Lacs was disbursed.         The lender invoked the provisions of the
Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of
Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as "the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">SARFAESI Act</a>")
by initiating action under <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_3">Section 13</a> classifying the loan account as Non-
Performing Asset (NPA). It is stated that on being served with demand
notice, the borrower raised objection under sub-section (3A) of <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_4">section 13</a>
by way of reply dated 09.09.2005 mainly on the ground that full loan
amount had not been disbursed and so the EMIs calculated on the total
disbursable amount were not payable and thus the loan amount could not
have been classified as NPA.
</p><p id="p_8">4.    On 13.03.2006, on an application moved by the secured creditor
under <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_5">Section 14</a> of SARFAESI Act, the District Magistrate, Hissar passed
an order directing Superintendent by Police Hissar to provide police
assistance for the possession of the subject property to be taken over. It is
claimed that after possession had been taken over, inter alia, in terms of
possession notice dated 20.03.2006 published in local newspapers, the
subject property was put to public auction for sale by the secured creditor. It
is further stated that the property was purchased in the said public auction by
Vijay Kumar Takker (respondent No. 4) for consideration of ₹3,00,001/- in
which context a sale certificate was duly issued and registered in his favour.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                    Page 2 of 33</span>
<p id="p_9"> The petitioner claims that she had purchased the subject property for
consideration from the fourth respondent ("the auction-purchaser") by sale
deed executed and registered on 13.12.2007 and accordingly had taken over
the vacant physical possession thereof. She claims that after purchasing the
property, being in immediate need, she carried out construction and started
using it as residence.
</p><p id="p_10">5.    On 15.02.2008, a securitization application registered as SA No.
24/2008 was filed by the first respondent (borrower) under Section (17)(1)
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_6">SARFAESI Act</a> before Debt Recovery Tribunal, Chandigarh (DRT), inter
alia, questioning the action taken by the secured creditor leading to public
auction/possession notice etc. The borrower pleaded in the said application,
inter alia, that the procedure followed in the matter by the secured creditor
was not in accord with the requirements of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_7">SARFAESI Act</a> or rules framed
thereunder. Various objections as to validity of the process leading to the
sale by public auction for recovery were taken including one that the date of
NPA or particulars of the account were not mentioned in the notice under
<a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_8">Section 13(2)</a>; the possession notice/sale notice was not published in the
vernacular language; the representation sent in response to notice under
<a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_9">Section 13(2)</a> of SARFAESI Act had not been disposed of; the
determination of reserve price (₹3,00,000/-) and the auction sale price
(₹3,00,001/-) was depressed; and since the valuation of the plot at the time
of grant of loan was ₹4,50,000/- and also because construction was carried
out thereupon, the sale price should have been higher.       Above all, the
borrower argued mainly that he learnt about the auction under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_10">Section 13(4)</a>
SARFAESI Act on 02.01.2008 when attempt was made to take over the
physical possession of the subject property forcibly, even while no sale

 notice or possession notice had ever been served upon him.
</p><p id="p_11">6.    The petitioner was also impleaded as a party to the securitization
application (SA) before DRT. It appears that she resisted the said move of
the borrower, inter alia, on the grounds that the application under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_11">Section 17</a>
SARFAESI Act was filed beyond the period of limitation of 45 days from
the date of the measures under <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_12">Section 13</a> (leading to the public auction) was
not maintainable and also urged that she was a bona fide purchaser from the
auction-purchaser. She questioned the truthfulness of the contention of the
borrower stating he was not in possession of the subject property since
possession had been taken over much earlier in the course of process under
<a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_13">Section 13</a> of SARFAESI Act by the secured creditor.
</p><p id="p_12">7.    The proceedings arising out of the SA under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_14">Section 17</a> of
SARFAESI Act (moved by the borrower before the DRT) were also resisted
on the additional ground that the auction-purchaser had not been made a
party which vitiated the said proceedings due to non-joinder. The fact,
however, remains that the petitioner represented the interest of the auction-
purchaser in such proceedings.
</p><p id="p_13">8.    The SA under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_15">Section 17</a> of SARFAESI Act of the borrower was
allowed by DRT by its order dated 30.11.2010. She contends that the
objections raised, inter alia, by the petitioner mainly on the plea of she being
successor-in-interest of a bona fide purchaser were repelled. She contends
that the objections were not properly adjudicated upon. The petitioner and
the secured creditor (LIC Housing Finance Ltd.) appealed before the DRAT
but without success.
</p><p id="p_14">9.    The writ petition at hand was entertained by this court by order dated
05.08.2011 whereby rule nisi was issued. Interim protection was granted to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                     Page 4 of 33</span>
 the petitioner against dispossession from the property on condition that she
would not sell, alienate, transfer or part with possession thereof. The interim
protection was made absolute by subsequent order dated 28.02.2012.
</p><p id="p_15">10.   The petition is resisted mainly by the first respondent (the borrower).
The fourth respondent (auction-purchaser) though served has shown
disinterest by suffering the proceedings ex-parte.
</p><p id="p_16">11.   On 15.01.2014, the first respondent questioned the maintainability of
the writ petition before this court on the ground that there is no territorial
jurisdiction. This issue was considered by another Division Bench of this
court on 29.01.2014 when the respondent gave up the objection on the issue
of territorial jurisdiction, inter alia, in light of the decision of the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/1876565/" id="a_16">Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. v. Union of India and Anr</a>., (2004) 6
SCC 254 and instead raised the question of forum non-conveniens. The
submissions were considered but rejected by order dated 29.01.2014, inter
alia, holding that the objection would not survive since the petition had
already been entertained and Rule DB issued by the court in exercise of its
discretion. The order thus passed reads as under:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "After some arguments the learned counsel for the respondent
      fairly stated that while this court has territorial jurisdiction to
      entertain this writ petition, since it is more convenient for the
      respondents to have the petition heard before the Punjab and
      Haryana High Court, therefore this court ought not to entertain
      this petition any further. Two issues arise at this point. One is
      the issue of territorial jurisdiction and the other is of
      convenience.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             Insofar as territorial jurisdiction is concerned, it has now
      been conceded by the learned counsel for the respondent that
      this court has territorial jurisdiction. Even de hors the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                     Page 5 of 33</span>
       concession, we are of the view that this court has territorial
      jurisdiction to entertain this writ petition inasmuch as the
      impugned order had been passed by the Debt Recovery
      Appellate Tribunal which is situated in Delhi. That constitutes a
      part of the cause of action as held by the Supreme Court in
      <a href="/doc/1876565/" id="a_17">Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. v. Union of India and Anr</a>.,(2004) 6
      SCC 254.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             Insofar as exercise of discretion on the question of
      convenience is concerned, we feel that the respondent cannot
      now raise the issue because the matter was already admitted
      for hearing by virtue of an order dated 28.02.2008 when
      another Division Bench of this court had directed the issuance
      of "Rule DB". In other words this court had exercised its
      discretion to hear this matter. This point had already been
      taken in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent
      No.1 at the point of time when rule DB was issued. Therefore,
      there is no occasion for the respondent to raise the issue of
      exercise of discretion of this court to entertain this petition on
      the ground of convenience/inconvenience of the parties.
      Consequently, the objection raised by the learned counsel for
      the respondents for hearing this petition does not hold good.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             Since the writ petition has already been admitted the
      matter be listed in the category of regular matters as per its
      turn."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">12.   Though the objections on the issue of territorial jurisdiction and those
founded on the doctrine of forum non-conveniens have already been rejected
by a reasoned order (as quoted above) in these very proceedings, when the
petition came up for final hearing and disposal, the same contentions were
re-agitated, now placing reliance additionally on <a href="/doc/115567041/" id="a_18">Sterling Agro Industries
Ltd. v. Union of India</a> 181 (2011) Delhi Law Times 658 (5 Judges Bench),

other against the backdrop of controversy relating to Mines and Minerals
(Development and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_21">Regulations) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_19">13.   We have considered the plea again in light of the case law now cited,
but find no reasons to take a view different from the one taken by the
Division Bench which passed the order rejecting these very contentions on
29.01.2014. In Sterling Agro (supra), the larger bench (5 judges) of this
court had recognized the permissibility for High Court to "refuse to exercise
its discretionary jurisdiction" by invoking doctrine of forum conveniens on a
petition preferred under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. The
said case is no authority to support the contention that the High Court is
unexceptionally bound to refuse to exercise the discretionary jurisdiction for
such reasons.
</p><p id="p_20">14.     In our view, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Kusum
Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. (supra) governs the issue. It is well-settled that even if
a small fraction of the cause of action accrues within the jurisdiction of the
court, the court may exercise the jurisdiction and since the order of the
appellate authority which is the subject matter of challenge constitutes part
cause of action to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court, the petition
can be maintained before the High Court within the territorial jurisdiction of
which the appellate authority is located. This view in Kusum Ingots &amp;
Alloys Ltd. (supra) was reiterated by Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1322270/" id="a_22">Canon Steels
(P)Limited v. Commissioner of Customs</a> (2007) 14 Supreme Court Cases
</p><p id="p_21">464. The objection based on the doctrine of forum non-conveniens having
already been rejected, the issue cannot be allowed to be re-opened.

<p id="p_22"> 15.   The first respondent (borrower) defends the impugned orders of the
DRT and the DRAT on the application under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_23">Section 17</a> SARFAESI Act on
the ground that the entire process was vitiated and the proceedings under
<a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_24">Section 13</a> SARFAESI Act initiated by the secured creditor having been set
at naught, it is only just and proper that status quo ante be revived and the
parties restored to their respective positions prior to such action. Reliance is
placed on Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar &amp; others (2014) 5 SCC
610 to contend that any sale or transfer of secured asset under <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_25">SARFAESI
Act</a> in violation of the mandatory requirements of law and rules framed
thereunder is bound to be treated as invalid and, therefore, has rightly been
so held by the authorities below. It is argued that the respondent bank
(secured creditor) not having challenged the impugned orders, the petitioner,
a third party which had stepped into the property consequent upon such sale
as has been held to be effected pursuant to invalid proceedings cannot be
allowed to continue to hold onto it to the detriment of the right, title or
interest of the original owner.
</p><p id="p_23">16.   Per contra, the petitioner relies on <a href="/doc/85450950/" id="a_26">Sadashiv Prasad Singh v.
Harender Singh</a>, 2014(1) SCALE 230 (SC) to contend that there is no
justification whatsoever to disturb the vested rights of the petitioner in the
property in question she being the successor-in-interest of the auction-
purchaser bona fides of whose claim cannot be, and have not been, doubted
since he had participated in the public auction and purchased the property
genuinely and legitimately.
</p><p id="p_24">17.   In Sadashiv Prasad Singh (supra), the property of the mortgager had
been attached and subjected to sale by public auction by the Recovery
Officer in discharge of the debt owed by the borrower in proceedings taken




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                     Page 8 of 33</span>
 out by the bank (the secured creditor) before the Debts Recovery Tribunal
(DRT). The brother of the mortgager had filed objection petition, inter alia,
claiming that the attached property had been purchased by him on the basis
of agreement to sell.    The objection petition, however, was abandoned
midway the proceedings.      Subsequently, the property was sold by the
Recovery Officer in favour of the appellant, as he was the highest bidder.
The objector challenged the sale by way of writ petition before the High
Court and in the course of proceedings arising therefrom even offered a sum
higher than the highest bid amount.

Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules (framed thereunder) to the recovery
proceedings initiated pursuant to recovery certificates issued by DRT. The
High Court of Judicature at Patna, in the case of Sadashiv Prasad Singh
(supra), set aside the sale of the property by public auction in favour of the
appellant primarily on the basis of holding that there had been flagrant
violation on Rule 11(2) of the said rules under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_29">Income Tax Act</a>,
inasmuch as the objections initially raised by the brother of the mortgager
had not been adjudicated upon. While setting aside the auction sale in
favour of the appellant, the Court proceeded to work out the equities
between the parties whereunder the money invested by the auction-
purchaser, along with interest, were directed to be refunded.

thus:-

         party interest is no longer in dispute nor the same is subjected
         to any order of this Court. In any event, ordinarily, a bona fide
         purchaser for value in an auction-sale is treated differently
         than a decree-holder purchasing such properties. In the former
         event, even if such a decree is set aside, the interest of the bona
         fide purchaser in an auction-sale is saved. (See Nawab Zain-
         ul-Abdin Khan v. Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan (1887) 15 IA 12).
         The said decision has been affirmed by this Court in

         the decree are afforded protection by the court because they
         are not connected with the decree. Unless the protection is
         extended to them the court sales would not fetch market value
         or fair price of the property."

Act</a>) was enacted to regulate, inter alia, "enforcement of security interest",
noting in the statement of objects and reasons that "our existing legal
framework relating to commercial transactions has not kept pace with the
changed commercial practices and finance sector reforms" and that unlike
international banks the "banks and financial institutions in India do not have
power to take possession of securities and sell them" on which account there
has been a "slow pace of recovery of defaulting loans and mounting levels of
non-performing assets of banks and financial institutions". The law, thus,
has conferred on the banks and financial institutions the power "to take
possession of securities given for financial assistance and sell or lease the
same or take over management in the event of default, i.e. classification of
the borrower's account as non-performing asset in accordance with the
directions given or guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time
to time" and, for such purposes, has defined the expression "security

to enforce the security interest "without the intervention of the Court or
Tribunal". It may be noted, at the outset, that the rights thus conferred on
the secured creditor are exercisable, by virtue of <a href="/doc/122392953/" id="a_48">Section 13(12)</a> through
officers duly authorized in such behalf. For such purposes, the legislation
sets out an elaborate procedure that begins with a notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_49">Section 13(2)</a>
issued by the secured creditor (giving requisite details of the amount due and
the secured assets in which respect the enforcement is intended) and
addressed to the borrower-in-default requiring him "to discharge in full his
liabilities" within 60 days. On the expiry of the said period of 60 days
calculated "from the date of notice" if the default continues, the secured

and in the event of such objection or representation, the secured creditor is
obliged to consider it and communicate his response (specifying the reasons)
within a week. Of course, by virtue of proviso to <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_52">Section 13(3A)</a>, the non-

include taking of the "possession of the secured assets of the borrower
including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for
realizing the secured asset". Noticeably, <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_55">Section 13(4)</a> broadly indicates the
said measures, pursuit whereof requires compliance with the procedure that
is laid out in detail thereafter.
</p><p id="p_38">31.    It is pertinent to add here that since taking over the possession of the
secured asset is such action as is expected invariably to meet with some
resistance, <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_56">SARFAESI Act</a> further provides, by <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_57">Section 14</a>, for requisite

secured creditor, who has made out a case to proceed to take possession of a
secured asset, after requisite compliance with <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_59">Section 13</a>, is given the option
to approach the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate
within whose jurisdiction the secured asset or other documents relating

<p id="p_40"> 33.   Rule 3 of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 prescribes
the mode of service of the demand notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_64">Section 13(2)</a>. Rule 8 deals
at length with the procedure required to be followed, inter alia, for taking
possession and sale of immoveable secured assets.
</p><p id="p_41">34.   What needs to be particularly noted here is that the process
commences with delivery of "possession notice", prepared in the prescribed
format, and served by affixation on the outer door or at a conspicuous place
of the property. The delivery of the possession notice constitutes, under
Rule 8(1), the taking of possession of the secured immoveable property.
This act, however, is required to be followed by publication of the
possession notice in two leading newspapers (at least one of which is in
vernacular language), having sufficient circulation in the locality in
question. Once possession is taken over by the authorized officer of the
secured creditor, he is expected to first take steps for ensuring preservation
and protection of the secured asset and obtain valuation of the asset from an
approved valuer, inter alia, for purposes of fixing the reserved price in terms
of Rule 8(5).
</p><p id="p_42">35.   For bringing the property to sale, the secured creditor (through its
authorized officer) is required, by virtue of Rule 8(6), to issue and serve on
the borrower "a notice of 30 days for sale of the immoveable secured asset".
The notice of sale is also required to be given widest possible publicity,
including, in terms of Rule 8(7), by way of affixing on a conspicuous part of
the immoveable property, and if deemed fit, by publication on the website of
the secured creditor.
</p><p id="p_43">36.   There are several modes of disposal of the property at the hands of the
secured creditor for purposes of realization of its dues. Barring agreement




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                    Page 15 of 33</span>
 of parties (necessarily the secured creditor and borrower) for sale by some
other method, the mode of sale through "public auction" or "public tender"
are the modes compulsorily required to be adopted in terms of Rule 8(8). In
this view, in terms of proviso to Rule 8(6), the sale by "public auction" or
"public tender" must be preceded by publication of a public notice published
in two leading newspapers (at least one in vernacular language) having
sufficient circulation in the locality setting out the terms of sale which
necessarily would include not only the description of the immoveable
property intended to be sold but also the details of encumbrances, the
secured debt being recovered, reserve price, time and place of public
auction, etc. Rule 9(1) prescribes that there must be a time lag of minimum
30 days between the date of publication of the public notice of sale in terms
of Rule 8(6) and the sale of the property. Of course, in terms of Rule 9(2),
sale cannot be confirmed, unless the borrower consents, at a price lower than
the reserved price.
</p><p id="p_44">37.   The sale of immoveable property under the prescribed procedure is
"confirmed in favour of the purchaser" who has offered the highest sale
price to the authorized officer but is subject to "confirmation by the secured
creditor". Detailed provisions are made in the rules as to the period within
which the sale price is to be paid or deposited, the minimum period being
"on or before the 15th day of confirmation of sale" in terms of Rule 9(4),
which period may be extended.         Upon confirmation, necessarily after
deposit of the money, the property is delivered by the authorized officer to
the purchaser, in terms of Rule 9(9), free from encumbrances "known to
secured creditor" followed by "a certificate of sale", "in prescribed format",
under Rule 9(6).
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                   Page 16 of 33</span>
<p id="p_45"> 38.   Thus, the procedure for effecting the sale of a secured asset in the
nature of immoveable property is a long drawn process strewn with several
stages where notices are to be issued, served or published, generally
speaking, for keeping all concerned or those interested duly informed but,
more particularly, in order to keep the borrower (whose property is the
subject matter of such process) in the loop. The objective behind this
scheme of things is not difficult to comprehend. The law appreciates that
the borrower is bound to be deeply concerned and, thus, might be interested
in discharging his liability to the secured creditor otherwise than by having
the mortgaged property brought under the hammer, and for such purposes
may like to seek redemption.       It is with this view that <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_65">Section 13(8)</a>
SARFAESI Act provides as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "13(8). If the dues of the secured creditor together with all
      costs, charges and expenses incurred by him are tendered to
      the secured creditor at any time before the date fixed for sale or
      transfer, the secured asset shall not be sold or transferred by
      the secured creditor, and no further step shall be taken by him
      for transfer or sale of that secured asset."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                                   [emphasis supplied]

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">39.   The procedure prescribed by the law, and rules, for enforcement of
security interest, as noted above, at the hands of the secured creditor (or its
authorized officer) is subject to the remedy of appeal before the Debts
Recovery Tribunal (DRT), constituted under RDDBFI Act, in terms of
<a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_66">Section 17</a> SARFAESI Act. As noted earlier, mere non-acceptance of the
objection or representation in response to the initial notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_67">Section
13(2)</a> does not confer the right of challenge through appeal. The remedy of
appeal becomes available as soon as effective action, including taking over

 of possession of the secured asset (and further process in the nature of sale,
etc.) commences. The test to which the process undertaken by the secured
creditor is subjected by DRT is indicated in <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_68">Section 17(2)</a> as under:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "17(2). The Debts Recovery Tribunal shall consider whether
      any of the measures referred to in sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_69">section 13</a>
      taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security are in
      accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made
      thereunder."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                                                 [emphasis supplied]

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">40.   Noticeably, the insistence of the law is that the secured creditor in
order to exercise its right to enforce security by bringing the secured asset of
the borrower to sale (etc.) must ensure that it has invoked the permissible
"measures" strictly "in accordance" with the provisions of law and rules
made thereunder. In the event of DRT finding the recourse to be in accord
with the law, the secured creditor is entitled to proceed further. But, in case
the finding of DRT on this score is in the negative, there may be a need to
modulate the relief to the affected party in such manner as can ensure
effective justice and restore equities if the valuable rights or interests have
been unduly disturbed. For such purposes, it is necessary to extract the
provision contained in <a href="/doc/67418708/" id="a_70">Section 17(3)</a> as under:-

this scheme of things, a borrower can tender to the secured creditor the dues
together with all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the secured

<p id="p_49"> 46.   <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_82">The SARFAESI Act</a> confers upon the secured creditor a right of

borrower in the process". With power of such amplitude having been
entrusted in its hands, the law legitimately expects and commands that all
actions of the secured creditor towards this end would adhere scrupulously,
and without let, in letter and spirit, to the prescribed procedure. Since it is
likely that the jurisdiction conferred on the secured creditor to enforce the
secured debt may lead to deprivation of the property of the borrower which,
by virtue of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_86">Article 300-A</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot occur "save
by authority of law", the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1104005/" id="a_87">Ram Kishun v. State
of U.P</a>., (2012) 11 SCC 511 poignantly observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "13. Undoubtedly, public money should be recovered and
      recovery should be made expeditiously. But it does not mean
      that the financial institutions which are concerned only with the
      recovery of their loans, may be permitted to behave like
      property dealers and be permitted further to dispose of the
      secured assets in any unreasonable or arbitrary manner in
      flagrant violation of the statutory provisions."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33"> 47.   Clearly, the authority to adjudicate and enforce (execute) a private
claim (secured asset) placed by the law in the hands of the claimant (secured

in the teeth of the principles of natural justice doctrinal rule wherein it that
no one shall be a judge of own cause. Such extraordinary power cannot
come but with extraordinary responsibility. The entity so authorized must
adhere to the prescribed procedure.          Departure from the prescribed
procedure cannot be countenanced; the concerned Tribunals or Courts can
take appropriate measures to set at naught the entire process undertaken by
the private entity (the secured creditor) under the colour of the authority

the effect that the representation submitted by the first respondent, under
<a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_90">Section 13(3A)</a> of SARFAESI Act had not been disposed of and that
mandatory requirement of Rule 8(1)(2) of the Security Interest
(Enforcement) Rules, 2002 had not been complied with. It found fault with
the classification of the account of the first respondent as NPA observing
that this had been done "without application of mind" and further that even
the notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_91">Section 13(2)</a> SARFAESI Act was deficient since the
factum of the account having been declared NPA or the date of NPA had not
been indicated. The DRT upheld the contention of the first respondent with
regard to the reserve price based on the valuation at `3 Lacs against the
backdrop of the fact that at the time of sanction of the loan the property had
been valued for `4.50 Lacs, holding the sale proceedings to be suspect on

one rupee over and above the reserve price. It held the entire proceedings
under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_92">Section 13(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_93">13(4)</a> of SARFAESI Act undertaken by the third
respondent as "illegal and invalid". While setting aside the action under
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_94">SARFAESI Act</a>, the third respondent was given liberty to proceed afresh for
recovery of its outstanding dues after following the due procedure of law. In
view of this result of the application under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_95">Section 17</a> of the first respondent,
the DRT declined to go into the objections, inter alia, of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_51">49.   The aforementioned findings of fact rendered by DRT were upheld by
DRAT in the appeals taken out by the petitioner and the third respondent.
Dealing with the contentions of the petitioner, the DRAT noted that the
subject property had been sold in her favour "hurriedly" by the auction-
purchaser. Taking note of her stake in the matter, while upholding the
directions of DRT setting aside the sale, and the liberty given to proceed
ahead for recovery of its dues, the third respondent was directed by DRAT
to pay to the petitioner sale price realized in the auction (`3,00,001/-) from
the auction-purchaser along with simple interest calculated @ 8% from the
date of the receipt till payment. The DRAT has directed the petitioner to
handover the possession of the property to the third respondent within the
time specified. On the other hand, the third respondent has been granted the
liberty to "retain the possession" of the property "till it is re-auctioned".
Both the borrower and the petitioner (successor-in-interest of the auction-
purchaser) have been given liberty to participate in such re-auction which is,
however, subject to the right of the borrower of "paying the outstanding
dues" under <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_96">Section 13(8)</a> of SARFAESI Act.

 impeached nor the fourth respondent (the auction-purchaser) have
challenged the impugned order of DRAT by any further proceedings.
Insofar as they are concerned, the findings have attained finality.
</p><p id="p_53">51.    On the above facts and in the circumstances, the petitioner, not a party
to the proceedings leading to the sale, cannot be allowed the liberty of
defending the indefensible. There are consistent findings recorded by the
two statutory forums below that the entire process undertaken by the third
respondent under the colour of authority of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_98">Section 13</a> SARFAESI Act was
vitiated.   The borrower/mortgager did not have sufficient notice at the
crucial stages of the process. His rights were, thus, violated. In the fact-
situation noted above, the transfer of his property by way of auction-sale in
favour of the fourth respondent was wholly impermissible, unjust and
illegal. The manner in which the authorized officer of the third respondent
went about putting the property to sale was, to say the least, irresponsible
and arbitrarily in flagrant violation of statutory provisions, hardly the
conduct expected of a "trustee". The petitioner may have been a bona fide
purchaser of the subject property from the fourth respondent. But, this
cannot be said of the fourth respondent himself. He was the beneficiary of
an auction-sale which has been found to be highly suspect, particularly on
account of undervaluation for fixing the reserve price and the consideration
for which it was sought to be sold (adding just rupee one to the undervalued
reserve price).
</p><p id="p_54">52.    The case of auction-purchaser under <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_99">SARFAESI Act</a> cannot be
equated with that of an auction-purchaser in a sale monitored by a court of
law, particularly when there are reasons to suspect the bona fide of the
process by which such auction is conducted. In this view, there cannot be an




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">WP(C) 5580/2011                                                       Page 25 of 33</span>
 unexceptional rule that an auction-purchaser (or his successor-in-interest) be
afforded protection with regard to the interest he acquires in the auctioned
property. For purposes of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_100">SARFAESI Act</a>, we would, thus, add the case of
"illegal transfer" to the exceptions on account of "fraud" or "collusion" as
the considerations on which auction-sale in favour of strangers (third party)
may also be set aside.
</p><p id="p_55">53.   It is not the conduct of the petitioner that had to be scrutinized. The
fate of her claim hinges on the bona fides of the process through which her
predecessor-in-interest acquired title.       The action under <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_101">Section 13</a>
SARFAESI Act having been found to be illegal and vitiated, the sale in
favour of the fourth respondent and, in turn, in favour of the petitioner,
cannot be saved. We have, thus, no hesitation in upholding the directions of
DRT, and DRAT, to the effect of setting aside the sale proceedings. But, at
the same time, we find that the authorities below have not issued further
requisite directions to properly protect the interests of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_56">54.   It is claimed by the auction-purchaser that after having acquired the
title of the subject property, being in need of residence, she undertook
construction and the house built on the plot of land has been in her use ever
since. It is urged on her behalf that it would be grossly unfair, unjust and
harsh to dislodge her from the subject property for infractions not
attributable to her or to her predecessor-in-title (the auction-purchaser).

having raised further construction, has been using the subject property for
her residence. Undoubtedly, the auction-sale in favour of her predecessor-
in-interest having been set aside, she has no subsisting right, title or interest
left in the subject property. As a consequence of the auction-sale being set
aside the petitioner (bona fide purchaser) faces the prospect of losing the
property. She, however, cannot be denied the value of the improvements
made by her in the property after acquiring it for consideration. The spirit of

so), the petitioner would need to participate in the fresh auction proceedings
for conduct of which liberty has been granted by the authorities below to the
third respondent (secured creditor). In such fresh auction proceedings, she
would be competing against other bidders which may include the borrower,
the first respondent. The fresh auction of the property would necessarily
have to be arranged on the basis of the current market value of the subject
property. The current market value would undoubtedly include the value of
the construction which was carried out by the petitioner from her own
resources. The petitioner would need to be compensated appropriately for
the value addition made by her to the subject property after she had
purchased it from the fourth respondent on 13.12.2007.

were necessary to balance out the equities.

in the SA filed before the DRT was that the representation made in response
to notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_106">Section 13(2)</a> SARFAESI Act had not been disposed of. It
appears that the first respondent had questioned the correctness of the
calculation of the amount claimed by the third respondent as due, amongst
others, for the reason the interest has been calculated on the total amount of
loan sanctioned which was not fully disbursed. Neither DRT nor DRAT
considered this aspect in their respective orders.
