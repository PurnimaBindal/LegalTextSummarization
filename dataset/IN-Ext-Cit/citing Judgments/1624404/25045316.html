<p id="p_1">1.           This order shall dispose of a bunch of three appeals bearing

LPA Nos. 2142, 2147 and 2165 of 2012 as according to the learned

counsel for the parties, similar issues are involved therein. For brevity,

the facts are being extracted from CWP No. 2142 of 2012.

</p><p id="p_2">2.           In this appeal, the appellant has challenged the order dated

11.12.2012 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court whereby

CWP No. 7928 of 2012 filed by her was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           Briefly stated, the relevant facts necessary for adjudication of

the present appeal as narrated therein are that the appellant in the month

of April, 2011 applied for competitive examination, namely, Common

Entrance Test (CET) of 2011 for admission in MBBS Course under

Scheduled Caste Category.      The appellant passed the said CET by

securing 39.16% marks and was selected in the merit list prepared by the

Punjab University. Thereafter, the appellant obtained 2nd prospectus from

respondent No.1 for admission to the MBBS Course. Respondent No.1

prepared 2nd merit list for admission to the MBBS Course to various

candidates. In the merit list for SC Category, the appellant was at Serial

No.7 and overall she was at Serial No. 99. On the basis of the 2nd merit

list, respondent No.1 granted admission to the appellant to the course of

MBBS by accepting fee vide receipt dated 13.7.2011 (Annexure P-4).

Thereafter, the appellant started attending her classes w.e.f. 18.7.2011

and has been continuing till 25.4.2012. After a period of ten months of

the attending of the classes by the appellant, respondent No.1 vide order

dated 25.4.2012 (Annexure P-6) cancelled the admission in the MBBS

Course on the ground that she had not secured minimum percentage of

marks i.e. 40% in CET. The said order was passed on the basis of order

dated 18.4.2012 (Annexure P-5) passed by respondent No.3. Feeling

aggrieved, the appellant approached this Court by way of CWP No. 7928

of 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          The said writ petition was contested by the respondents by

filing separate written statements. Respondent No.1 in its written

statement pleaded that it can only admit the students as per the guidelines

laid down by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and had no power to

overlook or ignore the guidelines so issued by the MCI.          It further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                         -3-</span>

pleaded that order cancelling the admission of the appellant was pursuant

to the directions issued by the MCI. Respondent No.3-MCI in its reply

pleaded that the appellant appeared in the CET Examination under the

category of Scheduled Caste and had scored 39.16% marks in Physics,

Chemistry and Biology whereas as per the MCI Regulations, the

minimum required percentage of marks in CET in the said three subjects

is 40% for the students belonging to SC Category. It was further pleaded

that once the admissions for academic session 2011-12 were over, the

MCI issued circular dated 29.9.2011 to all the Medical Colleges and

Institutions to submit information regarding the admissions made by them

in the MBBS Course in order to verify that all the admissions have been

made on merit while complying with the statutory provisions.

Respondent No.1 accordingly sent its communication dated 25.10.2011

to the MCI who vide communication dated 4.1.2012 sought clarification

on certain issues including the admission of the appellant despite having

scored lesser marks than the minimum prescribed percentage as per the

Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997. Thereafter, the MCI

obtained legal opinion and the matter was placed before the Board of

Governors. The Board of Governors decided that the admission of the

appellant was contrary to Regulation 5(5)(ii) of the Graduate Medical

Education Regulations and ordered that the appellant be discharged from

the course. The said order was communicated to respondent No. 1 on

18.4.2012. Respondent No.1 accordingly discharged the appellant from

the course of MBBS on 25.4.2012.

<p id="p_7">7.          According to the learned counsel, the minimum percentage

of marks in the CET as given in the prospectus in case of general

category was 15% whereas in the case of candidates belonging to

Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, it was 10%.            Relying upon the

judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1555878/" id="a_1">Shri Krishan v. The

Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra</a> (1976) 1 SCC 311 it was

contended that prospectus has a force of law and admission given on that

basis could not have been cancelled later on. Doctrine of Estoppel was

invoked to contend that MCI ought to have been vigilant and there was

no fault on the part of the students. The appellants were fully eligible as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                         -7-</span>

per eligibility criteria prescribed in the prospectus as well as MCI

guidelines and the CET was only for purposes of selection.

</p><p id="p_8">8.          Reference was made to Regulations 4 and 5 of MCI

Regulations to contend that there existed difference between Regulation 4

and 5(2) thereof. Reliance was placed on the judgment reported in <a href="/doc/101257116/" id="a_2">Rajan

Purohit and others v. Rajasthan University of Health</a>, (2012) 10 SCC

</p><p id="p_9">770.

also drawn towards the condition where NRI students were exempted

from taking CET examination.

<p id="p_11">10.         Mr. Harsh Aggarwal and Mr. B.B. Bagga, learned counsel

for the appellants in other appeals also sought to draw support with

reference to Regulations 4 and 5 of MCI Regulations. Support was also

gathered from the following judgments:-

Mr. Deepak Sibal submitted that Ms. Karuna and Vikram Singh had

obtained 39.16% and 38.61%, respectively in the CET examination as

against the minimum requirement of 40% whereas Ms. Sonia Sharma got

24.67% in CET examination as against 45% required for inclusion in the

merit list for MBBS Course.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.        Learned counsel contended that in case the admission to the

appellants is allowed, the same would be in contravention of law which

is not permissible. Learned counsel for the respondents urged that the

minimum standards fixed by the MCI were required to be followed and

placed reliance upon the following observations in <a href="/doc/984314/" id="a_8">State of Punjab v.

Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and others</a> (2001) 8 SCC

664:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                 "17. It is clear that in respect of subjects other than

                 Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pharmacology,

                 Pathology, Microbiology, Forensic Medicine and

                 Social and Preventive Medicine at least 40% of the

                 marks will have to be obtained in order to be eligible

                 for admission and in respect of other subjects there is

                 no such condition at all. In the counter affidavit filed

                 in the High Court, it is stated that the percentage of

                 marks has been reduced below 40% for the basic

                 subjects like Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology

                 because the candidates of higher merit are not opting

                 for these subjects and as such the postgraduate seats in

                 Departments     of     Anatomy,      Physiology     and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                        -9-</span>

                Pharmacology keep lying vacant and thus leading to

                an acute shortage of teachers in these Departments.

                Further, the condition of 50% marks in the entrance

                test was reduced to 40% because 80% of the seats

                reserved for PCMS doctors remained unfilled because

                most of them could not secure 50% marks in PGET

                due to the fact that they do not get academic support in

                rural areas. It is submitted that the postgraduate

                entrance examination is held for those who have

                already passed in MBBS examination by securing at

                least 50% marks and, therefore, the candidates who

                had not secured 50% in the postgraduate entrance

                examination cannot be declared to be filled in MBBS.

                The lowering of the marks to less than 50% has the

                twin objective of safeguarding the interests of weaker

                sections of the Scheduled Castes and Backward

                classes and to meet the constitutional obligation. We

                are afraid, the approach of the State of Punjab in this

                regard results in stultifying the logic. What is

                contended is that suitable candidates are to be selected

                from amongst the eligible candidates and in that regard

                an entrance test is being held. When such an entrance

                test is held, a prescription has been made by the

                Medical Council of India fixing a standard in terms of

                Entry 66, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                       -10-</span>

                Constitution and which cannot be diluted at all as has

                been held in a series of decisions including Dr. Preeti

                Srivastavas case, <a href="/doc/927758/" id="a_9">Dr.Narayan Sharma vs. Dr. Pankaj

                Kumar Lehkar</a> and <a href="/doc/1822248/" id="a_10">Medical Council of India vs. State

                of Karnataka</a>. Therefore, it is not open to the

                University or the Government to dilute that standard

                by fixing marks lower than what is set out by Medical

                Council of India. If they had any difficulty they ought

                to have approached the Medical Council of India for

                fixing of appropriate standards in that regard. The

                State Government could not unilaterally frame a

                scheme reducing the standard in violation of the terms

                of the Regulations framed by the Medical Council of

                India, which is repeatedly stated by this Court to be

                repository of the power to prescribe standards in Post

                Graduate studies subject, of course, to the control of

                the Central Government as envisaged in the Act

                constituting the Council.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">                18. What we have now to see is whether the action

                taken by the appellants is consistent with the

                prescription made by the Medical Council of India to

                the extent of obtaining 50% marks in the entrance

                examination and on that basis operate their rosters. If

                they do so and if the candidates, who have secured

                50% marks, would be admitted, no interference is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                         -11-</span>

                called for in the matter. If, however, any of the

                students has secured less than 50% marks that

                admission alone will have to be cancelled and

                appropriate directions issued to select as against it

                another candidate belonging to the reserved category if

                there is a reserved category candidate who has secured

                such marks, and if no reserved category candidate is

                available, he must then be selected from the general

                 issuing direction to the Corporation for absorbing the

                 respondent in its permanent service which was not

                 touched upon by the High Court is that the case of the

                 respondent requires sympathetic consideration, as

                 presumably the respondent has been visiting the

                 Corporation's Clinic since early seventies, remains to

                 be considered. As noticed earlier, the recruitment of

                 the doctors in the clinic run by the Corporation is

                 made in accordance with the statutory rules and by no

                 other method. Under the rules the vacancies are

                 advertised for inviting applications from eligible

                 candidates. After the applications are received the

                 Selection Committee is constituted to select the

                 candidates for appointment in the Corporation's clinic.

                 Only after the candidates are selected they are taken in

                 the service. It is also noticed earlier that respondent

                 appeared before the Selection Committee but was not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> LPA No. 2142 of 2012                                            -13-</span>

                   selected. Under such circumstances, there is no room

                   for sympathy or equity in the matter of such

                   appointment specially where the recruitment in service

                   is governed by the statutory rules. If the reasoning

                   given by the tribunal is accepted, the statutory

                   recruitment rules would become nugatory or otiose

                   and the department can favour any person or appoint

                   any person without following procedure provided in

                   the recruitment rules which would lead to nepotism

                   and arbitrariness. Once the consideration of equity in

                   the face of statutory rules is accepted then eligible and

                   qualified persons would be sufferers as they would not

                   get any cache to be considered for appointment. The

                   result would be that persons lesser in merit would get

                   preference in the matter of appointment merely on the

                   ground of equity and compassion. It is therefore not

                   safe to bend the arms of law only for adjusting equity.

                   We, therefore, find that the reasoning given by the

                   tribunal that sympathy demands the absorption of the

                   respondent in the service of the Corporation suffers

                   from error of law."

Various criteria have been prescribed for determination of merit which

and 5(ii) of Regulation 5, are relevant for the purpose of decision of these

appeals. Under clause (2) of Regulation 5, in the States where there are

held so as to achieve a uniform evaluation as there may be variation of

                   guidance of universities. The second part of sub-

                   standards    for    post-graduate   medical    education

                   throughout. The last part of sub- section (1) enables

                   the Central Government to constitute from amongst

                   the members of the Council, a post-graduate medical

                education committee. The first part of sub-section(1)

                empowers the Council to prescribe standards of post-

                graduate medical education for the guidance of

                universities. Therefore, the universities have to be

                guided by the standards prescribed by the Medical

                Council    and     must     shape    their      programmes

                accordingly. The scheme of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_18">Indian Medical

                Council Act</a>, 1956 does not give an option to the

                universities to follow or not to follow the standards

                laid down by the Indian Medical Council. For

                example, the medical qualifications granted by a

                university or a medical institution have to be

                recognised under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_19">Indian Medical Council Act</a>,

                1956. Unless the qualifications are so recognised, the

                students who qualify will not be able to practice.

                Before granting such recognition, a power is given to

                the Medical Council under <a href="/doc/118212773/" id="a_20">Section 16</a> to ask for

                information   as   to     the   courses   of    study    and

                examinations. The universities are bound to furnish the

                information so required by the Council. The post-

                graduate medical committee is also under <a href="/doc/157301342/" id="a_21">Section 17</a>,

                entitled to appoint medical inspectors to inspect any

                medical   institution,    college,   hospital     or    other

                institution where medical education is given or to

                medical institution before recommending the medical

                qualification granted by that university or medical

                institution. Under <a href="/doc/2556393/" id="a_22">Section 19</a>, if a report of the

                Committee is unsatisfactory the Medical Council may

                withdraw     recognition    granted    to     a    medical

                qualification of any medical institution or university

                concerned in the manner provided in <a href="/doc/2556393/" id="a_23">Section 19</a>.

                <a href="/doc/198734806/" id="a_24">Section 19A</a> enables the Council to prescribe

                minimum standards of medical education required for

                post-graduate    medical     qualifications       by   the

                universities or medical institutions, while <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_25">Section 20</a>

                gives a power to the Council to prescribe minimum

                standards of post-graduate medical education. The

                universities must necessarily be guided by the

                standards prescribed under <a href="/doc/32627961/" id="a_26">Section 20(1)</a> if their

                degrees or diplomas are to be recognised under the

                <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_27">Medical Council of India Act</a>. We, therefore, disagree

                with and overrule the finding given in <a href="/doc/1564456/" id="a_28">Ajay Kumar v.

                State of Bihar</a>, to the effect that the standards of post-

medicine. The MCI Regulations are thus required to be mandatorily

followed for seeking admission to MBBS course. In terms of the statute

and the regulations passed thereunder, the professional institutions are

required to maintain minimum standards. No deviation or departures can

be made in achieving those standards. In medical profession to acquire

excellence, a   very high calibre is required to be satisfied by the

meritorious students. In such a situation, merit alone should be the basis

of selection of the candidates. The professional education like medicine

would not be able to absorb any candidate who does not obtain the

minimum qualifying marks in terms of Regulation 4 of the MCI

Regulations and at the same time, to maintain quality in the profession,

the Common Entrance Test is also required to be cleared as mandated

under Regulation 5 of the MCI Regulations. The prospectus issued by

any University or College at variance with the MCI Regulation lowering

the minimum required percentage either for qualifying examination or

Common Entrance Test would not have any statutory force. Thus, being

different on factual matrix involved therein, the appellants cannot derive

any benefit from the judgment in Shri Krishan's case (supra).

</p><p id="p_22">21.         Equally, the claim of the appellants on the basis of

promissory estoppel would not entitle them to derive any advantage by

invoking the aforesaid principle primarily as not obtaining minimum

rendered them ineligible for inclusion of their names in the merit list for

consideration for admission to MBBS course.          By this method, the

minimum requirement as prescribed under any regulation, rule or statute

cannot be bypassed and no benefit can be urged on behalf of the

appellants. Issues No.(a) and (b), thus stands answered accordingly.

</p><p id="p_23">22.         Adverting to third issue, it may be noticed that the standard

of excellence has to be preserved and maintained. At higher level, more

particularly in technical and professional institutions/courses, it would be

the requirement of general consensus that the best is preferred avoiding

mediocrity and annihilating quality.         Particularly in professional

institutions, passing of the CET and prescribing of minimum marks is a

necessity to maintain quality, excellence and academic standards in the

profession. This can be achieved by prescribing the minimum standards

and qualifications that must be possessed by candidates.        In order to

acquire excellence in medical profession in particular, a very high calibre

is demanded which criterion can be fulfiled by the meritorious students

alone. In order to produce good doctors, the merit alone should be the

basis of selection for the candidates. The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/8064/" id="a_31">TMA Pai

Foundation v. State of Karnataka</a> (2002) 8 SCC 481 also in no

uncertain terms said that merit would be the first criterion for imparting

professional education. In other words, it has been clarified that merit

and excellence assume special significance in the context of professional

studies. <a href="/doc/1390531/" id="a_32">In P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra and others</a> (2005) 6

SCC 537, it has further been noted that "though merit and excellence are

not anathema to non-professional education, yet at that level and due to

the nature of education which is more general, the need for merit and

excellence therein is not of the degree as is called for in the context of

professional education." It has further been recorded that professional

education should be made accessible on the criterion of merit and on non-

exploitative terms to all eligible students on a uniform basis.

had allowed the appellants to attend classes and appear in the

examination which was specifically with the condition that it shall not

create any right in law or equity in their favour, in the writ petition as

well similar interim order was passed. Thus, the appellants cannot claim

any benefit either in equity or in law to continue their studies. A mistake

or an error committed by the college or the University in publishing its

prospectus contrary to MCI regulations would not clothe the student with

any legal right for admission which would be capable of enforcement in

a Court of law. At the same time, it shall be open for the students to

claim suitable damages against the wrong doer in accordance with law.

Further, the MCI shall also look into the matter and take appropriate

corrective action against the Institute/University for the commission of

such an error which has affected the career of the appellants.
