</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_3">2.     The vexed  question  of  access  to  education  has  hounded India from 


times immemorial. The futile pleadings of an Ekalavya for a teacher, that 


could not even be suppressed in the recesses of our cultural consciousness, 


to the modern day demands for exclusion from portals of knowledge of the 


"others", deemed to be unfit even if lip service of acknowledgement is paid 


that   such   "unfitness"   may   be   due   to   no   fault   of   theirs   but   is   rather   on 


account   of   their   social,   economic   and   cultural   circumstances,   gouges   our 


very   national   soul.   Even   as   higher   levels   of   knowledge   becomes   vital   for 


survival,   and   its   technologies   become   capable   of   empowering   those   who 


belong to groups, that historically and in the present have been excluded 


from the liberating prowess of knowledge, this country seems to witness, 


as in the past, a resurgence in demands that knowledge be parceled out, 


through   tight   fisted   notions   of   excellence,   and   concepts   of   merit   that 


pander to the early advantages of already empowered groups. 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                             4</span>



</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.     For much of our history, most of our people were told that they were 


excluded,  for  no  fault  of theirs  in  this  and  here,  but  on  account   of some 


past mistakes. Hope was restricted to the duty that was supposed to attach 


itself to station ascribed by a cruel fate, cast as cosmic justice. This order 


that parceled knowledge, by grades of ascribed status, chiefly of birth and 


of circumstances beyond the control of the young, weakened this country. 


It weakened our country because it reduced the pool of those who were to 


receive   higher   levels   of   knowledge   to   only   a   small   portion   of   the   upper 


crust.   This   in   turn   weakened   our   method   of   knowing   and   creating   new 


knowledge - knowledge of the deductive kind was extolled primarily for its 


elegance,   and   its   practical   significance   derided,   and   soon   enough   turned 


into metaphysics of mysticism that palliated the deprived with paens of a 


next life. This weakened our ability to apply knowledge to practical affairs 


of all  segments  of  population, and effectively  shut off  the feed  back  loop 


that practice by users could have provided, so that new knowledge could 


be generated. Our practical knowledge ossified, and deductive knowledge 


became ever more ready to justify the worth of the high and the mighty, 


for   such   justification   brought   status   to   the   peddlers   of   mysticism   and 


enabled the high and the mighty to evade questions of accountability to the 


masses.

</p><p id="p_5">4.      It was that truth that our national poet spoke about when he prayed 


that knowledge would be free. It was that truth that the makers of modern 


India,   those   great   souls,   who   could   see   the   causes   for   past   events,   and 


foresee the needs of the future, tried to inscribe in our Constitution. It is 


not any wonder that our first Prime Minister in the excitement of the first 


seconds of freedom from foreign rule spoke about our "tryst with destiny" 


to the Constituent Assembly, and yet in the same breath also added "now 


the   time   comes   when   we   shall   redeem   our   pledge,   not   wholly   or   in   full 


measure,   but   very   substantially."   As   Amartya   Sen   points   out   those   were 


heady times, of promises made and of hope kindled1. And we, as a nation, 


promised ourselves that our huddled masses, condemned to rot in squalor, 


ignorance   and   powerlessness   on   account   of   the  incessant   exploitation   by 


the   elites,   and   on   account   of   enforced   hierarchies   of   social   stature   and 


worth,  will  never again acknowledge  as  a teacher,  a person  who will say 


that he will teach only members of this group, and not that group. To each 


and   every   group,   and   to   each   and   every   individual   in   those   groups,   we 


promised   that   never   again   would   we   allow   social   circumstances   of   the 


groups   they   belonged   to   be   a   factor   in   our   assessment   of   their   social 


worth. We gave our people the hope that we, the upper crust of India will 


change,   and   that   their   patience   and   tolerance   of   our   inhumanity,   over 


many millennia in the past and for a few decades more into the future, will 


soon be rewarded by our humanization.

                 History says, Don't hope

                 On this side of the grave,

                 But then, once in a lifetime

                 The longed-for tidal wave

                 Of justice can rise up,

                 And hope and history rhyme.2





</p><p id="p_7">5.      We formed our nation-state to make sure that hope and history, as 


an actuality of experience of our people - all of our people, belonging to all 


of the groups into which they belonged to - would indeed rhyme. That is 


what our Constitution promises. And that is the motive force that informs 


the basic structure of our Constitution. Our fealty to that motive force is as 


sacred a promise that we as a nation have ever made to ourselves. Every 


other commitment can be assessed only on the touchstone of that motive 


force that balances hope and actuality of history, with hope progressively, 


and rapidly, being transcribed into actuality of real equality.




</p><p id="p_8">6.      In contrast to the above, a strange interpretation has been pressed 


upon us in this instant matter. On the one hand  it  is  contended that the 


State has to be denied the power to achieve an egalitarian social order and 


promote social justice with respect to deprived segments of the population, 


by   imposing   reservations   on   private   unaided   educational   institutions,   on 


the   ground   that   this   Court   has   held   that   private   non-minority   unaided 


educational   institutions   cannot   be   compelled   to   select   students   of   lower

merit as defined by marks secured in an entrance test, notwithstanding the 


fact   that   the   State   may   have   come   to   a   rational   conclusion   that   such 


underachievement is on account of social, economic or cultural deprivations 


and   consequent   denial   of   admissions   to   institutions   of   higher   education 


deleterious   to   national   interest   and   welfare.   On   the   other   hand   it   is 


contended   that   private   unaided   non-minority   educational   institutions, 


established by virtue of citizens claimed right to the charitable occupation, 


"education",   an   essential   ingredient   of   which   is   the   unfettered   right   to 


choose who to admit, may define their own classes of students to select, 


notwithstanding the fact that there may be other students who have taken 


the same entrance test and scored more marks. It would appear that we 


have   now   entered   a   strange   terrain   of  twilight   constitutionalism,   wherein 


constitutionally mandated goals of egalitarianism and social justice are set 


aside,   the   State   is   eviscerated   of   its   powers   to   effectuate   social 


transformation, even though inequality is endemic and human suffering is 


widely   extant   particularly   amongst   traditionally   deprived   segments   of   the 


population,   and   yet   private   educational   institutions   can   form   their   own 


exclusive   communes   for   the   imparting   of   knowledge   to   youngsters,   and 


exclude   all   others,   despite   the   recognized   historical   truth   that   it   is   such 


rules of exclusion have undermined our national capacity in the past.

(1)     Can   the   executive   abrogate   a   legislatively   mandated   and   specified 


        social justice program in the field of education?

<p id="p_11">
(2)     Do private non-minority unaided professional educational institutions 


        have   the   right   to   pre   define   a   social   group   and   admit   into   their 


        institutions   from   only   those   social   groups   and   exclude   all   other 


        students the opportunity of being considered for admission into such 


        educational institutions?

The Private Non-Minority Unaided Professional Educational Institution




</p><p id="p_16">8.      The private educational institution, started and managed by the Army 


Welfare   Education   Society   ("AWES"),   named   Army   College   of   Medical 


Sciences ("ACMS"), located in the National Capital Territory of Delhi ("NCT 


of   Delhi"),   seeks   to   admit   only   students   who   are   wards   or   children   of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                             9</span>



current   and   former   army   personnel   and   widows   of   army   personnel 


(henceforth,   we   will   be   referring   this   entire   group   as   "wards   of   army 


personnel" for ease of use).
</p>
<p id="p_17">


</p><p id="p_18">9.     AWES, it is stated, is a charitable trust that has been set up to cater 


to   the   educational   needs   of    wards   of   Army   personnel,   both   current   and 


former, and widows of Army personnel. It is stated that the operation of its 


educational institutions is funded purely from regimental funds, which have 


been recognized to be private funds and not that of the Indian Army. AWES 


was given on lease, an extent of a little over 25 acres of land in the NCT of 


Delhi under the control and possession of Ministry of Defence in order to 


enable   it  to   start   ACMS,   and   meet   the   regulatory   requirement   regarding 


extent of land that a private medical college ought to have for its college 


campus. In addition, ACMS has also been provided the facility of using the 


Army Hospital in NCT of Delhi, both for its scholars to fulfill the necessary 


clinical   training   at   such   an   hospital,   and   also   to   fulfill   the   regulatory 


requirement that a medical college possess access to a general hospital of 


sufficient number of beds as assurance of availability of facilities to meet 


the curricular requirements. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">


</p><p id="p_20">10.    It   is   also   stated   that   the   wards  of   army   personnel   suffer   from 


extensive disadvantages that children of the regular civilian population do 


not  face.  It  is   of  course  well  recognized   that  army  personnel  are,   by  the

very nature of their job, deputed to serve in various inhospitable terrains, 


or in regions with scant facilities. Such assignments imply non-availability 


of proper educational facilities for their wards in large periods of the critical 


growing periods of the children. Further, in order to facilitate the education 


of   the   children,   personnel   of   army   are   also   compelled   to   maintain   dual 


homes, where the member of the army personnel is in one place, and his 


family   resides   in   another   place.   This   places   tremendous   economic 


hardships,   which   could   be   conceived   as   also   imposing   hardships   in   being 


able to secure any special coaching or training for the children. Further, the 


absence of the father figure could also imply a certain imbalance in family 


lives. All these contribute to lowered  educational  attainments of wards of 


army   personnel,   relative   to   the   civilian   population,   and   hence   lowered 


performance in qualifying examinations for various educational institutes at 


the college level, particularly the professional colleges. It is also contended 


that the seats reserved for Defence personnel, at college level, also do not 


satisfy   the  needs  of  children   and  army  wards   because   of  paucity   of  total 


seats and stringent domicile requirements enacted by State legislatures.

admission;

challenged   the   above   admission   policy   in   writ   petitions   filed   in   the   Delhi

Karnataka3</a>, as further explained in <a href="/doc/1390531/" id="a_14">P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra4</a>, 


specifically   mandated  that   all  admissions   to  private   unaided  non-minority 


professional   institutions   be   only   based   on   merit,   which   is   to   be   taken   as 


inter-se ranking of all the students who have taken the common entrance 


test; (2) even according to the rules and regulations of GGSIU or the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_15">Delhi 


Act</a> 80 of 2007, they would have secured an admission  in ACMS if it had 


followed the principle of inter-se ranking, based  on marks secured  in the 


common entrance test, of all the students applying to ACMS if ACMS had 


not proscribed all non-wards of army personnel from applying; and (3) in 


fact ACMS is an aided educational institution, in as much as it has received 


massive  aid  from the  State,  in  the form  of expensive land and access  to 


Army Base Hospital in Delhi to meet the curricular requirements of clinical 


training in a general hospital that is required by every medical college, per

Government of Delhi were lawful, and hence they were well within the law 


in admitting students only from the wards of army personnel as identified 


by its  admission  policy. Further ACMS, and  AWES, also claim that in any 


event the ratio of TMA Pai, as further explained by P.A. Inamdar, is that, 


contrary   to   what   the   writ   petitioners   were   claiming,   they   have   an 


unfettered   right,   under   <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_16">Article   19(1)(g</a>),   to   choose   its   own   pre-defined 


"source"  of students.  Further,  ACMS  and  AWES  claim  that in as  much  as 


such a choice is not a "reservation" per se, but only choice of "source" as 


rightly   recognized   by   TMA   Pai   (supra),   and   P.A.   Inamdar   (supra),   and 


further   because   such   a   source   is   only   being   delineated   on   the   basis   of 


occupation   and   not   on   the   basis   of   religion,   race,   caste,   sex   or   place   of 


birth or any of them, and inter-se ranking within the "source" is based on 


qualifying marks in the common entrance test, and the admission policy is 


otherwise   transparent,   fair   and   non-exploitative   the   admission   policy   of 


ACMS ought to be upheld. In addition, it is also submitted that in as much 


as   wards   of   army   personnel   suffer   educational   disadvantages,   in 


comparison with the civilian population, and this affects the morale of army 


personnel, it would be in the national interest to allow ACMS and AWES to 


effectuate such admissions. Further, it is also claimed that such a right has 


been recognized previously by the courts in India. Further, with respect to 


it being an unaided educational institution, it was argued that ACMS is run 


purely out of regimental funds that have been held to be private funds, and

not   belonging   to   the   Indian   Army.   Moreover,   it   is   also   claimed   that   the 


lease   granted   to   it   by   the   Army   and   the   Ministry   of   Defense,   in   whose 


possession   the   public   land,   was   for   an   initial   period   of   thirty   years, 


extendable to ninety nine years, to which effect the Ministry of Defense has 


"in principle" agreed to. Moreover, the access to Base Hospital of the Army 


in   NCT   of   Delhi   was   only   for   a   temporary   period,   and   that   an   exclusive 


hospital for ACMS would soon be built. To this extent it was submitted that 


ACMS is not an "aided institution" under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_17">Delhi Act</a> 80 of 2007 as its day to 


day funds are met through fees and regimental funds. Further, it was also 


submitted that MCI has accepted the temporary arrangements with respect 


to hospital facilities, and has granted a conditional permission, which could 


be revoked if ACMS fails to meet the requirement of having its own hospital 


as required by regulations.

of Delhi Act 80 of 2007 to be applicable as regards only the 15% of seats

Division   Bench   found   that   there   is   nothing   in   it   that   prohibits   ACMS   and 


AWES to admit only wards of army personnel in all its seats, the Division 


Bench   upheld   the   admission   policy   of   ACMS.   In   this   regard,   the   Division 


Bench also over-ruled the finding of learned Single Judge that the ratio of

TMA   Pai   (supra)as   explained   in   P.A.   Inamdar(supra),   implied   that   ACMS

<p id="p_74">



</p><p id="p_75">20.    The  learned   Counsel   for  Appellants,   Dr.  Aman  Hingorani,  submitted 


that ACMS is not an unaided institution, and further it is also posited that 


ACMS and its parent society be construed to be an "instrumentality of the 


State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_23">Article 12.</a> To this effect the following facts were pointed out: 


</p><p id="p_76">(i) that a little over 25 acres extent of expensive land has been given on 


lease by Ministry of Defence, Union of India, in the Cantonment of Delhi; 


access has been provided to the Base Hospital; and further that affairs of 


AWES   and   of   ACMS   are   substantially   and   wholly   managed   by   regular 


officers of the Indian Army and headed by the Chief of Army Staff; and (ii) 


that regulations of Medical Council of India ("MCI") do not permit grant of 


permission for setting up of medical colleges unless the Society setting up 


such a college owns such land and has its own hospital of requisite number 


of beds, and further that the permission was granted by MCI on the ground

that ACMS was in fact a governmental entity. It was contended that in such 


an   event,   the   admissions   to   ACMS   ought   to   be   on   the   same   principles 


followed by the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune. It is also contended 


that even if ACMS be deemed to not be an instrumentality of the State, it 


could not be construed as an unaided institution, on account of the massive 


aid   by   Ministry   of   Defence,   merely   because   its   day   to   day   expenses   are 


taken care of by fees from students and regimental funds. The implication 


pressed   by   Dr.   Hingorani   was   that,   in   such   a   case   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_24">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of   2007 


would not be applicable at all, as it is intended to be applicable to unaided 


private   professional   institutions,  and furthermore   the  exemptions   granted 


by   the  Government   of  Delhi   from  the   operation   of  <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_25">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of   2007, 


and relied on by ACMS and AWES, in making the admissions in the manner 


it   has   would   also   not   be   applicable.   The   applicable   law,   consequently, 


would   be   Ordinance   30   of   GGSIU,   which   provides   that   an   upper   limit   on 


reservations to be 5% for wards of defense personnel.

ACMS   were   deemed   to   be   both   a   private   and   an   unaided   professional 


institution, the exemption granted by Delhi Government in allowing ACMS 


to admit only wards of Army personnel to 100% of its seats is ultra vires. 


In this regard it was pointed out that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_26">Section 12</a> of Delhi

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and further, through rules enacted 


pursuant   to   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_27">Section   23(g)</a>,   the   Government   of   Delhi   has   fixed   the 


percentage of reservations for wards of Defence personnel, as enabled by 


clause (c) of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_28">Section 12</a>, at 5%. It was contended that 


there   is   no   provision   in   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_29">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of   2007   that   allows   Government   of 


Delhi   to   grant   the   exemption   from   the   operation   of   the   requirement   of 


merit   based   admissions,   i.e.,   ranking   based   on   marks   secured   in   the 


common entrance test, from within the entire class of students who have 


qualified   in   the   common   entrance   test   and   from   the   operation   of   the 


reservations as provided therein.  Further, it was also pointed out that the 


power   being   claimed,   vide   clause   (b)   of   Sub-section   1   of   Section   12   of 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_30">Delhi Act</a> 80 of 2007, by Government of Delhi to grant such an exemption 


is   only   the   power   to   vary   the   percentage   of   allocable   seats   as   between 


Delhi and non-Delhi students, and not to allocate all the seats in ACMS to 


wards of Army personnel. Moreover, it was also contended that in as much 


as   private   unaided   educational   institutions   are   essentially   rendering 


services that the State ought to be rendering, and wherein such services 


are   "public   services,"   admitting   only   wards   of   Army   personnel   in   all   the 


seats in ACMS would be a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_31">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_32">Article 15.</a>




</p><p id="p_79">22.    In   this   regard,   it   was   also   argued   by   Dr.   Hingorani   that   even

reservations   would   amount   to   a   violation   of   <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Article   14</a>,   and   in   any   event 


any reservations with respect of constitutionally permissible classes would 


need statutory or executive provision. In the event, the permission granted 


by   Government   of   Delhi   to   allow   ACMS   to   admit   only   wards   of   Army 


personnel amounts to a super-reservation and violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Article 14.</a>




</p><p id="p_80">23.    It   was   also   argued   by   the   learned   Counsel   that   the   grant   of 


permission   to   ACMS,   to   admit   only   wards   of   Army   personnel,   without 


regard to the claim of those students who have secured more marks would 


be a violation of the ratio of TMA Pai, as explained in Islamic Academy, and 


P.A. Inamdar.   The learned counsel submitted that the Constitution Bench 


in Islamic  Academy, in the course of interpreting Para 68 of the TMA Pai 


judgment,  held   that  the  percentage  of  seats  that   the  management   of  an 


educational institution can fill up, could never be 100%. In this regard, it 


was   also   contended   that   this   Court,   in   P.A.   Inamdar,   was   only   trying   to 


ascertain   whether,   after   TMA   Pai,   the   State   could   impose   its   own 


reservation   policy   on   private   unaided   professional   colleges.   It   was 


submitted  by the learned  Counsel,  that while P.A. Inamdar has held that 


imposition   of   reservations   by   the   State   would   be   an   unreasonable 


restriction   when   imposed   on   non-minority   private   unaided   educational 


institutions, it cannot be said that P.A. Inamdar stands for the proposition 


that   private   non-minority   private   unaided   professional   educational 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                                             25</span>



institutions could select students from a pre-defined group from within the 


entire  general  category,  thereby disregarding  the  students in the general 


category who have received higher marks. Apart from that, the holding in 


Islamic Academy that a quota that can be filled up by the management at 


its   sole   discretion   could   never   be   to   the   extent   of   100%,   has   not   been 


overruled by P.A. Inamdar. Consequently, it must be taken that the ratio in 


Islamic Academy holds the field with regard to such questions. It was also 


further   contended   that   this   Court   in   P.A.   Inamdar   has   held   that 


professional   colleges   stand   on   an   entirely   different   footing,   and   that   the 


requirement   that   admissions   strictly   be   on   the   basis   of   merit,   as 


determined by marks in a common entrance test, in fact takes precedence 


over   other   considerations   including   the   rights   of   managements   of 


professional unaided non-minority colleges to select students according to 


their choice.

may   form   a   constitutionally   permissible   class   entitled   to   horizontal 


reservations under <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_35">Article 15(1);</a> nevertheless, relying on <a href="/doc/1276295/" id="a_36">D.N. Chanchala

appearing for  the Respondents,  dispute  the contentions  of  the Appellants 


that ACMS is an instrumentality of the State, and also further dispute that 


ACMS is an aided institution. Pointing to the fact that AWES is a charitable 


trust, set up purely with the object of promoting  the welfare of wards of 


Army personnel, and the fact that only regimental funds are used in day to 


day affairs of ACMS, it was contended that AWES and ACMS ought not to 


be treated as an instrumentality of the State. It was also further contended 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                                           27</span>



that in both the decisions of the High Courts, by the learned Single Judge 


and the Division Bench, ACMS has been found to be an unaided educational 


institution, per the definition of such institutions in <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_39">Delhi Act</a> 80 of 2007, 


and hence ought not to be disturbed. Further, it was also submitted that 


ACMS   conducted   its   admissions   on   the   basis   of   exemptions   granted   by 


Government of Delhi, and as such meet the statutory requirements also.




</p><p id="p_85">26.     Learned   Senior   Counsel,   Mr.   K.K.   Venugopal   submitted   that 


admissions   being   effectuated   by   ACMS   ought   to   be   recognized   as   being 


based   purely   on   inter-se   merit   i.e.,   marks   received   in   common   entrance 


test   by   wards   of   Army   personnel   and   that   no   reservations   of   seats   were 


being   made   on   the   basis   of   caste,   race,   religion,   residence/domicile, 


backwardness   or   any   such   criteria.   Tracing   the   history   of   the   law   as 


applicable   to   reservations   and   admissions   to   colleges,   in   case   law   from 


Unnikrishnan J.P. v. State of A.P.7, through TMA Pai, Islamic Academy, to 


finally P.A. Inamdar, he submitted that P.A. Inamdar holds the field, in as 


much as it over-ruled parts of Islamic Academy, and explained the eleven 


judge bench decision of this court in TMA Pai. His main contention was that 


this court in P.A. Inamdar  has found that a private unaided non-minority 


educational   institution   is   entitled,   under   sub-clause   (g)   of   clause   (1)   of 


<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_40">Article   19</a>,   to   the   same   rights   as   a   private   unaided   minority   institution 


under Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_41">Article 30:</a> i.e., in as much as minorities have the right

to choose students entirely from a "source" of their choice, non-minorities 


should also have the same right to be able to pre-define a source from the 


general   pool   and   admit   qualified   students   only   from   such   a   pre-defined 


source.   In   particular   he   relied   on   paras   127   and   137   of   P.A.   Inamdar. 


Specifically he relied on the following observation in para 127: "Nowhere in  


Pai Foundation either in the majority or in the minority opinion, have we  


found     any   justification   for   imposing   seat-sharing   quota   by   the   State   on  


unaided private professional educational institutions and reservation policy  


of   the   State   or   State   quota   or   management   seats."  The   learned   Senior 


Counsel   submitted   that   according   to   P.A.   Inamdar   only   a   consensual 


agreement   can   be   arrived   at   between   private   unaided   professional 


institutions   regarding   seat   sharing,   and   the   State   could   not   unilaterally 


demand any such sharing. In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel was 


equating   the   demand   by   the   Appellants   that   the   State   should   permit 


admissions to professional unaided non-minority professional colleges only 


on the basis of marks secured in the common entrance test to a demand 


by   the   State   of   a   "quota"   of   seats   by   the   State   for   imposition   of 


reservations or for that matter any other purpose. Further, given the issues 


faced by Army personnel, it was submitted that a larger public interest is 


involved   in   the   armed   forces   personnel   having   comfort   and   security   that 


their   wards   can   get   a   fair   opportunity   for   securing   admissions   into 


professional colleges.

</p><p id="p_87">27.    The   learned   Senior   Counsel,   Mr.   Jaideep   Gupta   contended   that   the 


right to set up educational institutions, whether minority or non-minority, 


pursuant to sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_42">Article 19</a>, includes the right to 


admit students of their choice from a "source" within the general pool, so 


long as the procedure adopted is transparent, fair and non-exploitative. As 


far as merit is concerned, it would then be that so long as inter se merit 


within that "source" is concerned, the State ought not to have the power to 


insist   that   as   far   as   non-minority   educational   institutions   only   select 


students from the entire general pool on the basis of marks secured on the 


common   entrance   test.     He   also   contended   that   the   admission   policy   of 


ACMS,  in choosing to  admit  eligible  wards  of Army personnel  in all of  its 


seats, is an instance of selecting a "source" and not a reservation at all. To 


this extent he also submitted that where a particular class is a source of 


admission,   the   principles   relating   to   reservations   would   not   apply   to   the 


same where, the class itself is well defined and rational. The learned Senior 


Counsel,   Mr.   Jaideep   Gupta   submitted   that   this   Court   in   P.A.   Inamdar, 


interpreting TMA Pai, has held that the essential ingredients of freedom of 


management   of   private   non-minority   unaided   educational   institutions 


include   the   right   to   admit   students   and   recruit   staff,   and   determine   the 


quantum of fee to be charged, and that they cannot be regulated, either 


with   respect   to   minority   or   non-minority   educational   institutions.   In

addition   he   also   submitted   that   Clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_43">Article   15</a>,   inserted   by   the 


93rd Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2005, in so far that it enables special

Scheduled   Tribes   and   Socially   and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   in 


private   non-minority   unaided   institutions,   would   be   unconstitutional   and 


violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. In particular he relied on 


the sole opinion of Bhandari J., in <a href="/doc/63489929/" id="a_44">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India8</a> 


that enabling provisions of clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_45">Article 15</a>, in so far as they relate

respect   to   the   matters   on   hand,   if   ACMS   is   an   unaided   non-minority 


educational   institution.   If   that   be   the  status   of   ACMS,   then   we'd  have   to

specifically mandates that all admissions to ACMS would have to be made 


in   accordance   with   merit   of   students,   based   on   marks   secured   in   the 


common entrance test. With respect to those students covered by various 


categories   such   as   Scheduled   Castes,   Scheduled   Tribes   and   other 


constitutionally   permissible   classes,   as   delineated   in   Sub-section   (2)   of 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_56">Section 12</a>, and as applicable with respect to categories described in Sub-


section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_57">Section   12</a>,   the   rule   of   inter-se   merit,   based   on   marks 


secured   in   common   entrance   test   by   students   falling   into   each   category, 


would   apply.  That   would  also   mean,   then,  that   with   respect  to  seats  not 


covered by provisions of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_58">Section 12</a>, they would have to 


be   filled   in   accordance   with   rule   of   merit   based   on   marks   secured   by 


general category of students not covered by Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_59">Section 12</a>.

instrumentality   of   the   State,   and   whether   ACMS   is   an   aided   or   unaided 


institution,   that   at   both   stages   of   proceedings   in   the   High   Court,   the 


conclusion reached was that Respondents were neither an instrumentality 


of the State, nor could ACMS be held to be an aided educational institution. 


Such   determinations   always   present   issues   of   fact   and   of   law.   We   are 


disinclined to over-rule the findings of the High Court in this regard, which 


also corresponds to the decisions of the learned Single Judge. We are also 


disinclined to go into the said issues primarily because we do not believe 


that   the   fact   that   ACMS   is   deemed   to   be   an   unaided   non-minority 


educational institution would have a bearing on the relief being sought by 


the Appellants.

account of enactment of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_62">Delhi Act</a> 80 of 2007. This is so, because <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_63">Delhi Act</a> 


80 of 2007 is a later enactment, much more general, containing a complete 


code covering the entire terrain of admissions  of students to professional 


unaided   non-minority   institutions   affiliated   to   all   universities   in   NCT   of 


Delhi, including GGSIU, with specific provisions therein regarding allocation 


of seats between Delhi and non-Delhi students, and reservations applicable 


in   terms   of   those   students   falling   within   constitutionally   permissible 


classes.   However,   the   expression   used   by   the   Division   Bench,   that 


Ordinance 30 has "lost its relevance": to the extent that it may suggest a 


loss   of   general   relevance   is   not   correct.   Considerable   care   ought   to   be 


exercised   in   delineating   the   applicability   of   unrepealed   sections   of   a 


previous statute, even if they conflict with the provisions of a later statute 


with respect to some specific terrain of activities.  After all, Ordinance 30 of 


GGSIU   may   be   applicable   with   respect   to   many   other   situations,   not 


involving   the   terrain   covered   by   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_64">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of   2007.   In   this   regard   it

<p id="p_103">


</p><p id="p_104">34.    In light of the fact that we have decided to proceed on the basis that 


ACMS   is   a   private   non-minority   unaided   professional   institution,   we   now 


turn   to   the   issue   of   the   validity   of   the   exemptions   granted   by   Delhi 


Government   from   the   operation   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_66">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of   2007.   By   permitting 


ACMS to allocate all its seats to wards of Army personnel, albeit ones who 


had taken and qualified the common entrance test, the Delhi Government 


effectively suspended the operation of the provisions of the Act with regard 


to selection of students solely on merit from the general category, and also 


the provisions that mandated allotment and reservation of seats to various 


constitutionally permissible classes, including but not limited to Scheduled 


Classes and Scheduled Tribes.

<p id="p_105">


</p><p id="p_106">35.    At   the   very   beginning   of   this   portion   of   this   judgment,   we   wish   to 


make an observation based on the text of both the Cabinet Decision, and 


the   Notification   of   Government   of   Delhi,   on   which   reliance   is   placed   by 


ACMS and AWES to admit only students of Army personnel. The texts state 


that an approval was being granted, in the case of Cabinet Decision, and 


that   permission   was   being   granted,   in   the   case   of   the   Notifications,   that 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                                                 37</span>



hundred percent seats in ACMS may be allocated for "admission towards of 


Army   personnel"   as   per   the   policy     "followed   by"   the   Indian   Army.   First 


question that arises is as to how wards of Army personnel could be deemed 


to   be   "Army   personnel"?   Did   ACMS   and   AWES   apply   for   permission   of 


admittance of personnel of the Indian Army and then turn around and use 


the   exemption   granted   to   admit   "wards   of   Army   personnel"?   Or   is   it   the 


case   that   the   Government   of   Delhi   did   not   apply   its   mind   at   all,   or   that 


applied its mind in the absence of relevant facts? We are perturbed by the 


degree of casualness, evident from above, with which exemptions from the 


operation   of   vital   aspects   of   a   law   enacted   by   the   legislature   seemed   to 


have  been  undertaken.  In any event,  we will proceed  on  the assumption 


that the Government of Delhi intended that the exemption be granted with 


respect to "wards of Army personnel" as opposed to "Army personnel" and 


examine whether the exemptions granted are valid or not.




</p><p id="p_107">36.    We   find   that   the   High   Court   has   erred   in   its   interpretation   of   Sub-


section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_67">Section   12</a>,   and   indeed   the   very   thrust   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_68">Delhi   Act</a>   80   of 


2007.   One   of   the   cardinal   principles   of   interpretation   is   to   look   for   the 


purpose   that   the   Act   seeks   to   achieve,   and   in   this   regard   what   is   also 


crucial   is   the   relationship   of   each   clause   or   sub-clause   to   the   other.   The

</p><p id="p_109">37.    Reading   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_69">Section   12</a>   of   Delhi   Act   of   2007   synoptically,   we   find   that 


Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_70">Section 12</a> pervades the entire space of how seats are to 


be   allocated.   In   fact,   the   preamble   to   the   Act,   states   that   it   is   being 


enacted   to   provide   for   "allotment"   of   seats   to  "Scheduled   Castes,  


Scheduled Tribes ........ and other measures to ensure equity and excellence 


in professional education in the National Capital Territory of Delhi"  (emph. 


Supp.). Consequently, it must be read that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_71">Section 12</a> is 


one   of   the   primary   sections   of   the   Act   and   that   it   would   act   upon   the 


provisions of Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_72">Section 12</a>. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_73">Section 12</a> 


provides   that   with   respect   to   seats   in   sub-section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_74">Section   12</a>,   an 


institution shall reserve as provided for in sub-sections (a), (b) and (c) of 


sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_75">Section 12</a> that follow. Clearly the phrase "[I]n the seats 


mentioned   in   sub-section   (1)"     at   the   beginning   of   sub-section   (2)   of 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_76">Section   12</a>   reveals   the   intent   of   the   legislature   that   the   specific 


reservations provided for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other 


provisions that may be made with respect to other weaker segments and 


other   permissible   categories   of   classes,   shall   be   applied   with   respect   to 


each   and   every   category   of   seats   identified   in   sub-section   (1)   of   Section

the management quota.

there is "nothing in <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_79">Section 12</a> of the Delhi Act 80 of 2007 which prohibits  


the   appellants   from   making   100%   allocation   in   favour   of   army/ex-army  


personnel   and   war   widows".   If   indeed   that   be   so,   and   ACMS   admits   all 


wards   of   army   personnel   from   outside   Delhi,   then   what   exactly   is   the 


status of reservations that have been specifically mandated in sub-section

to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and any other Backward Classes

social   justice   by   the   legislature   would   be   obliterated.   This   would   be 


tantamount to grant of powers to set at nought a policy specifically enacted

army personnel, notwithstanding the fact there could be others who have 


taken the common entrance test, and have secured more marks than the 


wards   of   Army   personnel,   the   exemptions   granted   by   Delhi   Government 


also set at naught the legislative intent to ensure excellence by mandating 


that all admissions be made on the basis of inter-se merit within each of 


the   categories   of   students.   The   general   category   would   comprise   of   all 


students who have taken the common entrance test, and other wise satisfy 


the conditions of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_81">Section 12</a> of the Delhi Act 80 of 2007, 


after   the   seats   reserved   pursuant   to   sub-section   (2)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_82">Section   12</a>   are 


reserved   i.e.,   allocated   for   the   described   constitutionally   permissible 


categories   therein.   The   said   Act   clearly   specifies   that   its   objective   is   to 


achieve excellence, and one of the methods specified to achieve the same 


is   of   admitting   students   on   the   basis   of   inter-se   merit   in   each   of   the 


categories   specified   in   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_83">Section   12</a>.   The   grant   of   permission   to   ACMS   to 


admit students who may have scored lower marks than others, both within 


the general category and also in the reserved categories, results in defeat 


of   the   aims,   objects   and   purposes   of   the   Act,   and   the   entire   fabric   and 


scheme   of   the   Act   gets   frustrated.   Nowhere   in   the   Act   do   we   find   any 


powers granted to the government to not implement the Act. Nor does the

implementation   of   the   provisions   with   respect   to   reservations   for   weaker 


segments, and also simultaneously give the merit of the students scoring 


higher marks than wards of Army personnel a go by. To put it pithily, there 


is no power conferred on Government of Delhi to grant any exemption in

basic feature of the Constitution, can claim the power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_86">Article 162</a> to

particular   field,   enact   policy   that   may   be   akin   to   law.   However,   the

away.   (<a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_87">See   Ram   Jawaya   Kapur   v.   State   of   Punjab10</a>)   Further,   the   cited 


portion of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_88">Article 162</a> has been interpreted by this Court to mean that the 


State Executive has the power to make any regulation or order which shall 


have the effect of law so long as it does not contravene any legislation by 


the   State   Legislature   already   covering   the   field.   (<a href="/doc/1295463/" id="a_89">See   State   of   A.P.   v. 


Lavu11</a>) In the instant case, the legislature of NCT of Delhi has specifically 


set out a clear policy with respect to reservations for Scheduled Castes and 


Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of the population. The duty of 


the executive is to implement that policy, and not to abrogate it.

decision   by   the   Cabinet   of   Delhi   and   the   Notification   by   Lieutenant 


Governor granting ACMS permission to admit 100% of the seats to wards

<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_90">Section 12</a>. The interpretation of the said sub-section sought to be pressed 


upon  us  is  as  follows:  That the first part  of said sub-section   ought to  be 


read   as   "eighty   five   percent   of   the   total   seats   except   the   management 


seats, shall be allocated for Delhi students and the remaining 15% percent 


of   seats   for   outside   Delhi   students",   followed   by   an   "or",   and   then   the

second part "such other allocation as the Government by notification in the 


Official   Gazette   Direct".   Such   an   interpretation   it   is   claimed   gives   the 


government the power to vary the entire allocation of seats, and therefore 


the   exemption   granted   by   it   to   ACMS   to   admit   only   wards   of   Army 


personnel ought to be upheld.

<p id="p_118">


</p><p id="p_119">42.    We   simply   fail   to   see   how.   At   best,   even   if   we   were   to   accept, 


arguendo,   the   interpretation   pressed   into   service   by   the   Government   of 


Delhi, the best result that would follow would be that Government of Delhi 


has been given the power to vary the allocation of seats between Delhi and 


non-Delhi students, belonging to all sections and within the broadest class 


of those who have taken the common entrance test and qualified. It cannot 


be read to mean that a power has been granted to Government of Delhi to 


create   entire   new   classes   of   students   from   within   those   eligible   for 


admission   to   professional   institutions   by   itself,   and   exclude   all   those 


students who are not members of such classes, notwithstanding that they 


may fall in the categories of Delhi or non- Delhi students.




</p><p id="p_120">43.    Further, we also hold that such an interpretation to be strained. This 


is so for two reasons. One, the fact that the word "and" is always used as a 


conjunction between the first part of a sentence and the second part of a 


sentence, and the word "or" is used to denote an alternative in a series of 


exclusive   arrangements.   Consequently,   we   hold   that   the   correct 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                                            44</span>



interpretation of sub-section (b) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_91">Section 12(1)</a> is as follows: first part - 


"Eighty five percent of the total seats except the management seats, shall 


be allocated for Delhi students" followed by the conjunction "and" and then 


the   second   part   -   "the   remaining   fifteen   percent   seats   for   outside   Delhi 


students or such other allocation as the Government may by notification in 


Official   Gazette   direct."   Therefore,   it   can   only   mean   that   the   powers   of 


Delhi   Government   are   limited   to   the  extent   of   varying   the   percentage   of 


seats   reserved   for   non-Delhi   students,   up   to   a   maximum   of   15%.   Apart 


from   the   above   grammatical   construction,   we   are   led   to   such   an 


understanding for additional reasons. This is the legislature of Delhi, that is 


legislating  for  the  denizens of  NCT  of  Delhi,  with  a  primary  responsibility 


for   their  welfare.  Further,   in  as   much   as   clause  (a)   of  sub-section   (2)  of 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_92">Section 12</a> provides that 17% of seats be reserved for Scheduled Castes, 


1%   of   seats   be   reserved   for   Scheduled   Tribes,   and   an   unspecified 


percentage of seats be reserved for other Backward classes who are also 


denizens   of  Delhi,  the  legislature   of  Delhi   would   have  taken  into  account 


the   needs   of   Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes   in   Delhi.   The 


discretion   to   vary   the   15%   reserved   for   non-Delhi   citizens   was   in   all 


likelihood to enable the Government of Delhi to increase the percentage of 


seats   allocated   to   denizens   of   Delhi,   in   the   event   a   sizeable   number   of 


other backward classes of students also need to be accommodated in the 


professional   colleges   of   Delhi.   By   fixing   a   number,   15%,   for   non-Delhi 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                                             45</span>



students, the legislature intended to set a maximal limit on the number of 


non-Delhi students who could be admitted, and specified the percentage of 


seats   that   could   be   allocated   to   Scheduled   Castes,   Scheduled   Tribes   and 


other   weaker   sections   which   could   be   reduced   in   the   event   that 


Government of Delhi needed to accommodate the special exigencies of the 


needs   of   denizens   of   Delhi,   including   but   not   limited   to   its   backward 


classes.

</p><p id="p_122">44.     The Government of Delhi has also claimed that a distinction needs to 


be   drawn   between   "allocation"   as   used   in   sub-section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_93">Section   12</a> 


and   "reservation"   as   used   in   sub-section   (2)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_94">Section   12</a>.   The   claim   of 


Government of Delhi is that the power to "allocate" between Delhi and non-


Delhi  students or some other classes  is  prior to "reservation"  of  seats  as 


between   general   category   of   students,   and   moreover   that   such   an 


allocation would mean a power to allocate  all the seats   not just to non-


Delhi students, but even an entirely new class. This plea of Government of 


Delhi is untenable and unsustainable as the same is not supported by any 


of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_95">Delhi Act</a> 80 of 2007 and in fact runs  counter to 


them. One of primary purposes of the act, the goal that it seeks to achieve, 


is   described   in   terms   of   "allotment"   of   seats   to   Scheduled   Castes, 


Scheduled  Tribes and  other weaker segments. The word allot, in its  verb 


form, is defined by the Concise Oxford Dictionary12 to include the meaning

of the act to give or apportion to, distribute officially to. Allotment is what 


results   from   such   an   act   i.e.,   an   apportionment.   The   word   "reserve"   is 


defined to also include the meaning of "order to be specifically retained or 


allocated for a particular person", and the word "reservation" is the act or 


an instance of reserving or being reserved. The word "allocate" is defined 


to   include   the   meanings   of   an   act   to   assign   or   devote   something   for   a 


purpose or to a person. Consequently, it can only be surmised that while 


the   words   allocation   was   used   in   the   said   Act   in   the   context   of 


apportionment   of   seats   between   Delhi   and   non-Delhi   students,   the   word 


"reservation" was used to mean to allocate a certain percentage of seats, 


in   both   groups   formed   by   eligible   Delhi   and   non-Delhi   students,   for 


Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of the 


population and other constitutionally permissible classes. The use of those 


two   words,   allocation   and   reservation   in   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_96">Section   12</a>,   in   as   much   as   they 


overlap   in   their   meaning,   and   the   fact   that   they   together   delineate   the 


seats to  be allotted  to Scheduled  Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes and other 


weaker   sections   and   constitutionally   permissible   classes,   implies   that   we 


cannot   infer   from   the   use   of   the   word   "allotment"   in   sub-section   (1)   of 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_97">Section   12</a>,   the  kind   of   power   claimed   to   vary   allotment   in   clause   (b)  of 


sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_98">Section 12</a> as provided therein and thereby also set at 


naught the intent of legislature of Delhi to allot seats for Scheduled Castes, 


Scheduled   tribes,   and   other   weaker   sections,   and   further,   also   set   at

naught   its   intent   that   at   least   85%   of   seats   that   remain   after   10%   of 


management seats are set aside, be allocated to students of Delhi, also be 


set   at  naught.   Consequently,  the  defense  by  Government  of   Delhi  of   the 


exemptions it granted to ACMS, on the use of different words, allotment in 


sub-section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_99">Section   12</a>,   and   reservations   in   sub-section   (2)   of

<p id="p_123">


</p><p id="p_124">45.    Thus we find that the exemption granted by the Government of Delhi 


allowing ACMS to fill 100% of its seats by wards of army personnel violates 


the   basic   principles   of   democratic   governance,   of   the   constitutional 


requirement   that   executive   implement   the   specific   and   mandatory   policy 


legislated by the legislature, and violates the provisions of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_101">Delhi Act</a> 80 of

reasons   are   wholly   arbitrary,   without   any   basis   in   law,   and   ultra   vires. 


<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_102">Section   14</a>   of   the   said   Act   specifies   that   any   admission   made   in

be punished by imprisonment up to three years or a fine up to Rupees one

legislature that its policy, as specified in the Act, and the purposes of the 


Act, not be derogated from in any manner. The said provisions of the Act

basis of a misplaced belief of its powers, under the Act, a misunderstanding 


of the statutory language of the Act, and its relevant provisions, and also in 


complete contravention of constitutional principles.

P.A.   Inamdar,   stands   for   the   propositions   that   (a)   the   rights   of   non-


minority   unaided   educational   institutions   under   sub-clause   (g)   of   Clause 


(1)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_110">Article   19</a>   are   exactly   the   same   as   the   rights   of   minority   unaided 


educational institutions under Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_111">Article 30;</a> and hence (b) non-


minority   professional   educational   institutions,   such   as   ACMS,   should   be 


deemed   to   have   the   right   to   define   their   own   "source"   from   within   the 


general pool of students taking the common entrance test, so long as the 


classification   is   not   based   on   any   of   the   constitutionally   impermissible 


basis'   such   as   religion,   race,   caste,   place   of   birth   or   sex.   Further,   it   was 


also contended that in as much as the admission policy thereafter proceeds 


in a transparent, fair and non-exploitative manner, the admission policy of 


ACMS should be upheld. Additionally it was also submitted by the learned 


Senior   Counsel   that   allowing   ACMS   to   pursue   such   an   admission   policy 


would be in the national interest.

claiming   an   ability   to   choose   students   of   their   own   choice,   in   case   after 


case before this court, was on the ground that imposition of reservations 


by the State would impede their right to choose the most meritorious on 


the   basis   of   marks   secured   in   an   objective   test.   It   would   appear   that, 


having unhorsed the right of the State to impose reservations in favor of 


deprived segments of the population, even though such reservations would 


be   necessary   to   achieve   the   Constitutionally   mandated   goals   of   social 


justice   and   an   egalitarian   order,   unaided   institutions   are   now   seeking   to 


determine   their   own   delimited   "sources"   of   students   to   the   exclusion   of 


everybody else. The fine distinctions made by learned Senior Counsel, Mr. 


Jaideep Gupta, that an allocation when made by the State is reservation, 


as   opposed   to   allocations   made   by   private   educational   institutions   in 


selecting a source do not relate to the fundamental issue here: when the 


state delimits, and excludes some students who have secured more marks, 


to   achieve   goals   of   national   importance,   is   sought   to   be   projected   as 


contrary   to   Constitutional   values,   and   impermissibly   reducing   national 


welfare by allowing those with lesser marks to be selected into professional 


colleges;   and   at   the   same   time,   such   a   delimitation   by   a   private 


educational   institution,   is   supposedly   permissible   under   our   Constitution, 


and   we   are   not   then   to   ask   what   happens   to   that   very   same   national 


interest and welfare in selecting only those students who have secured the 


highest marks in a common entrance test. We are reminded of the story of

to   convince   ourselves   that   this   Court   would   have   advocated   such   an 


illogical   position,   particularly   given   our   history   of   exclusion   of   people,   on 


various   invidious   grounds,   from   portals   of   education   and   knowledge. 


Surely, in as much as this Constitution has been brought into force, as a 


constitutive   document   of   this   nation,   on   the   promise   of   justice   -   social, 


economic   and   political,   and   equality   -   of   status   and   opportunity,   for   all 


citizens so that they could live with dignity and fraternal relations amongst 


groups of them, it would be surprising that this Court would have unhorsed 


the   State   to   exclude   anyone   even   though   it   would   lead   to   greater   social 


good, because marks secured in an entrance test were sacrosanct, and yet 


give   the   right   to   non-minority   private   educational   institutions   to   do   the 


same. The knots of legal formalism, and abandonment of the values that 


the   Constitution   seeks   to   protect,   may   lead   to   such   a   result.   We   cannot

admission   forms   from   several   institutions   and   appear   at  

several   admission   tests   conducted   at   different   places   on  

the   same   or   different   dates   and   ther   may   be   clash   of  

dates,   If   the   same   candidate   is   required   to   appear   in  

several   tests,   he   would   be   subjected   to  unnecessary   and  

avoidable expenditure and inconvenience. There is nothing  

wrong   in   an   entrance   test   being   held   for   one   group   of  

institutions   imparting   same   or   similar   education.   Such  

institutions situated in one State or in more than one State  

may join together and hold a common entrance test or the  

State may itself or through an agency arrange for holding  

of such test. Out of such common merit list the successful  

candidates can be identified and chosen for being allotted  

to different institutions depending on the courses of study  

offered, and number of seats, the kind of minority to which  

the institution belongs and other relevant factors. Such an  

agency   conducting   the   common   entrance   test   ("CET"   for  

short)   must   be   one   enjoying   utmost   credibility   and  

expertise   in   the  matter.  This   would   better   ensure   the  

fulfillment of twin objects of transparency and merit.  

CET   is   necessary   in   the   interest   of   achieving   the   said  

objectives and also for saving the student community from  

harassment   and   exploitation.   Holding   of   such   common  

entrance   test   followed   by   centralized   counseling   or,   in  

other  words, single window system regulating admissions  

does   not   cause   any   dent   in   the   right   of   the   minority  

unaided educational institutions to admit students of their  

choice. Such choice can be exercised from out of the list of  

successful candidates prepared at CET without altering the  

order of merit inter-se of the students so chosen."

the   procedure   therefore   subject   to   its   being   fair,  

transparent   and   non-exploitative.   The   same   principle  

applies to non-minority unaided institutions. There may be  

a single institution imparting a particular type of education  

which is not being imparted by any other institutions and  

having   its   own   admission   procedure   fulfilling   the   test   of  

being fair, transparent and non-exploitative. All institutions  

imparting same or  similar  professional  education  can join  

together for holding a common entrance test satisfying the

       above   said   triple   tests.   The   State   can   also   provide   a  

       procedure   of   holding   a   common   entrance   test   in   the  

       interest   of   securing   fair   and   merit   based   admissions   and  

       preventing maladministration. The admission procedure so  

       adopted by a private institution or group of institutions, if  

       it   fails   to   satisfy   all   or   any   of   the   triple   tests,   indicated  

       hereinabove,  can be taken over  by the State substituting  

       its   own   procedure.   The   second   question   is   answered  

       accordingly.

       to   the   larger   interest   and   welfare   of   the   student  

       community to promote merit, achieve excellence and curb  

       malpractices,   it   would   be   permissible   to   regulate  

       admissions   by   providing   a   centralized   and   single-window  

       procedure.  Such   a   procedure   to   a   large   extent,   can  

       secure   grant   of   merit   based   admissions   on   a  

       transparent   basis.   Till   regulations   are   framed,   the  

       Admission   Committee   can   oversee   admissions   so   as   to  

       ensure that merit is not the casualty."

</p><p id="p_149">54.    By   examining   paragraphs   127   and   137   in   the   larger   context   of 


paragraphs 135, 137 and 138, it would appear that this Court's emphasis 


was on the right of private educational institutions to admit students on the 


basis  of "merit"  as  determined by marks  secured  in an entrance  test.  To 


this extent, the above paragraphs would stand for the proposition that both 


minority   and   non-minority   unaided   institutions   have   the   right   to   admit 


students who have secured higher marks in the entrance test, and not an 


equivalence between minority and non-minority institutions to engraft their 


own  "sources"   or "classes"   of students   from within  the general   pool.   The 


rights of minority unaided educational institutions to select students, based 


on merit, is with respect to students who belong to that same minority. It

is not a right to define a source as such. We turn to excavate the rights of 


minority   unaided   educational   institutions,   and   non-minority   unaided 


educational institutions in the larger body of judgment P.A. Inamdar to get 


a more synoptic understanding of the ratio in that judgment.




</p><p id="p_150">55.    In paragraph 124 of P.A. Inamdar  it is  stated that the majority did 


not "see much of a difference  between non-minority and minority unaided 


educational institutions".  That expression "much of a difference" gives the 


clue   that   there   is   an   actual   difference   between   the   rights   of   minority 


unaided institutions under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_112">Article 30</a>, and the rights of non-


minority unaided institutions under sub-clause (g) of Clause (1) of Article 


</p><p id="p_151">19.   We   will   address   that   issue   a   little   later   by   gleaning   the   differences 


between minority and non-minority institutions enunciated in P.A. Inamdar. 


By using the expression "much of a difference" the Court did not mean a 


complete absence of difference. If the expression, by itself, were taken out 


of context, it could be understood in two ways: (i) that there is not much of 


a   difference   in   terms,   between   the   two   kinds   of   institutions   under 


consideration, based on an overall quantitative assessment of all the rights 


put   together,   with   a   few   differences   that   would   still   have   operational 


significance;   or   that   (ii)   in   all   respects   the   two   classes   of   educational 


institutions   are   more   or   less   the   same,   with   the   differences   being   minor 


and   not   leading   to   any   operational   significance.   We   hold   that   it   is   in   the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                                            56</span>



former   sense   that   the   said   expression   was   used.   By   noticing   the   phrase 


"much   of   a   difference"   out   of   context   it   might   appear   that   this   Court 


surmised that there were no substantive  differences as  such,  in terms of 


operational significance as to the groups from which the non-minority and 


minority unaided educational institutions could select students from, notice 


of the context, the specific issue that the Court was dealing at that point in 


the judgment, leads to a different conclusion. The issue that the Court was 


dealing with was with respect to whether the State could compel unaided 


educational institutions to choose students with lesser percentage of marks 


in   order   to   implement   its   reservation   policies.   The   last   sentence   of   para 


124   clarifies   this:   "The   State   cannot   insist   on   private   educational 


institutions  which receive no aid from the State to implement  the State's 


policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser percentage of marks 


i.e.,   on   any   criterion   except   merit."   Minority   institutions   have   to   choose 


from   their   own   minority   group   who   are   otherwise   qualified,   and   non-


minority   institutions   have   to   choose   from   the   entire   group   who   are 


otherwise qualified. The modality of choosing within those groups has to be 


on   the   basis   of   inter-se   ranking   determined   in   accordance   with   marks 


secured   in   the   common   entrance   test.   When   we   look   at   the   following 


paragraph, no. 125 in P.A. Inamdar, it might also appear that the State is 


not   entitled   to   impose   a   state   quota,   whereby   the   private   unaided 


institutions   are   compelled   to   give   up   a   share   of   available   seats   to   the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                                        57</span>



candidates chosen by the State, as if it was filling the seats available to be 


filled up at its discretion in such private institutions. This Court made the 


observation   that   such   an   act,   of   imposition   of   a   quota,   would   be   an 


encroachment   on   the   freedoms   granted   pursuant   to   <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_113">Article   30(1)</a>   to 


minority institutions, and an unreasonable restriction under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_114">Article 19(1)(g)</a> 


read   with   <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_115">Article   19(6)</a>   when   imposed   on   non-minority   educational 


institutions. The Court was not suggesting that insistence, by the State, on 


making merit based selections within the groups, general category for the 


non-minority   institutions,   and   the   specific   minority   group   to   which   the 


minority   educational   institution   belonged,   from   which   the   two   kinds   of 


institutions   were   expected   to   select   students   from,   amounts   to   an 


imposition of a State quota. The context of the discussion was of imposition 


of   reservations   on   private   unaided   non-minority   educational   institutions. 


This is borne out by the last sentence in paragraph 125, where it is stated 


"[M]erely   because   the   resources   of   the   State   in   providing   professional  


education   are   limited,  private   educational   institutions,   which   intend  


to   provide   better   professional   education,   cannot   be   forced   by   the  


State   to   make   admissions   available   on   the   basis   of   reservation  


policy to less meritorious candidates." 
</p>
<p id="p_152">


</p><p id="p_153">56.    The   jurisprudence   of   TMA   Pai   with   respect   to   unaided   non-minority 


educational institutions, as explained by P.A. Inamdar, clearly seems to be 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                                              58</span>



that   private   unaided   educational   institutions   seek   to   provide   better 


professional   education,   and   hence   they   should   not   be   saddled   with   less 


meritorious   students,   i.e.,   those   who   get   lesser   marks   in   a   qualifying 


examination   such   as   a   common   entrance   test,   by   imposition   of 


reservations.   With   respect   to   minority   educational   institutions,   the 


imposition   of   reservations   or   the   imposition   of   the   duty   to   select   non-


minorities   beyond   a   sprinkling   would   be   an   encroachment   of   freedom 


guaranteed   by   clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_116">Article   30.</a>   With   respect   to   non-minority 


unaided   institutions,   imposition   of   reservations   was   deemed   to   be   an 


unreasonable   restriction   on   the   freedom   to   engage   in   the   occupation   of 


"education"   pursuant   to   sub-clause   (g)   of   clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_117">Article   19.</a>   In   as 


much   as   Clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_118">Article   15</a>   is   now   part   of   the   Constitution, 


reservations by the State for "socially and educationally backward classes" 


without the creamy layer, and for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 


are now constitutionally permissible categories of state imposition on non-


minority educational institutions. The status of constitutional permissibility 


removes the basis for finding reservations to be an unreasonable restriction 


in the freedom to select students only on the basis of merit with respect to 


all   the   seats   in   a   non-minority   unaided   educational   institution. 


Consequently,   the   unaided   non-minority   educational   institutions   would 


have to comply  with  the State  mandated reservations,  selecting  students 


within   the specified   reservation  categories  on  the  basis   of  inter-se  merit. 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                                               59</span>



The question then is whether with respect to the remaining seats, can the 


state   insist  that  non-minority  private  unaided  institutions   select  the  most 


meritorious students, as determined by the marks secured in the qualifying 


test? The  answer  to  that question  is  in the  affirmative. As  we have  seen 


above that in paragraph 136 in P.A. Inamdar it was held that a Common 


Entrance Test "would better ensure the fulfillment of twin objectives  


of transparency and merit"  and further on in para 138, it stated again 


"[I]t needs to be specifically stated that having regard to the larger  


interests and welfare of the student community to promote merit,  


achieve excellence and curb malpractices, it would be permissible  


to regulate admission by providing a centralized and single window  


procedure.   Such   a   procedure,   can   secure   grant   of   merit-based  


admissions on a transparent basis."

<p id="p_154">


</p><p id="p_155">57.    Clearly, the continuing concern expressed by the Seven Judge Bench 


in   Inamdar,   echoes   the   concern   of     this   Court   in   TMA   Pai:   the   need   to 


ensure merit, as determined by the marks secured on the qualifying exam, 


is   taken   care   of   and   thereby   achieve   academic   excellence.   In   the   post 


clause   (5)   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_119">Article   15</a>   scenario,   we   are   looking   at   all   the   seats   that   are 


available   in   the   non-reserved   category.   Those   seats   have   to   be   filled   by 


non-minority   institutions   on   the   basis   of   merit   of   students,   i.e.,   ranking 


determined   in   accordance   with   marks   secured,   in   the   general   category,

</p><p id="p_157">58.    It   should   be   clear   from   the   above   that   simply   taking   a   few   stray 


sentences from here and there in P.A. Inamdar and asserting from those 


sentences   a   ratio   or   a   categorical   holding   would   be   an   incorrect 


appreciation   and   leads   to   an   inaccurate   assessment   of   what   this   Court 


actually said and meant. The judgments of this Court in TMA Pai, Islamic 


Academy   and   in   P.A.   Inamdar   are   long,   dealing   with   extremely   complex 


issues of law and fact, and diverse zones of similarities and dissimilarities 


between   the   various   types   of   educational   institutions   being   considered, 


both by the ownership  structure  - such as  minority or non-minority, and 


aided or unaided -, as well as by the level of education being sought to be 


imparted.   On   top   of   that   the   issues   related   to   whether   recognition   and 


affiliation   was   being   sought   or   not.   So,   before   arriving   at   an   applicable 


principle from within those huge judgments, for particular cases that courts 


deal   with,   it   is   imperative   that   context   of   observations   be   closely 


scrutinized, and also follow the many lines of delineation of many different 


ratios   and   principles.   To   this   extent   the   structure   that   this   Court   in   P.A. 


Inamdar   gleaned   from   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in   TMA   Pai   provides 


some pathways for these complex interpretational tasks that are imposed 


on courts dealing with many specific aspects of the wider universe of facts 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                                            61</span>



and   law   considered   by   this   Court.   And   depending   on   the  level   of   judicial 


review,  the nature of judicial review,  the courts may also have to take a 


look at the wider universe of facts and laws not taken into account by this 


Court in TMA Pai, Islamic Academy and P.A. Inamdar.  The majority of the 


questions   dealt   with   in   TMA   Pai   related   to   minority   institutions.   In   this 


regard, P.A. Inamdar, gleans three kinds of minority institutions that were 


dealt   with   in   TMA   Pai:   (a)   minority   educational   institutions,   unaided   nor 


seeking recognition or affiliation; (b) minority educational institution asking 


for   affiliation   or   recognition;   and   (c)   minority   educational   institutions 


receiving State aid, whether seeking recognition and affiliation or not. To 


this   broad   classification,   P.A.   Inamdar   finds   that   TMA   Pai   has   considered 


three parallel non-minority educational institutions also: (a1) non-minority 


educational   institutions,   neither   seeking   aid   nor   recognition   or   affiliation; 


(b1) non-minority educational institutions, seeking recognition or affiliation 


but no aid; and  (c1) non-minority  educational  institutions  receiving State 


aid,   whether   seeking   recognition   or   affiliation   or   not.   To   the   matrix   of 


parallel   institutions,   P.A.   Inamdar   also   gleans   from   TMA   Pai,   another 


dimension   on   which   to   differentiate   educational   institutions:   by   level   of 


education,   general   collegiate   education,   professional   graduate   level 


education   and   post-graduate   level   of   education.   It   is   within   this 


labyrinthine maze that this court sought to find similarities and differences 


between   minority   educational   institutions   and   non-minority   educational

institutions.   Consequently,   care   must   be   taken   in   interpreting   P.A. 


Inamdar, and a few stray sentences here and there ought not to be taken 


to   indicate   an   actual   holding   or   ratio.   In   P.A.   Inamdar   itself,   the   seven 


judge   bench   cautioned   that   such   dependence   on   stray   sentences   would 


lead us astray. We have to delve into the foundations and the architectural 


super-structure   erected   by   P.A.   Inamdar   to   eke   out   the   correct   ratio 


applicable to the facts of the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_158">


</p><p id="p_159">59.    In paragraph 91, of P.A. Inamdar, this Court enunciated one of the

also further noted in para 91 that though <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_123">Article 30(1)</a> is styled as a right,

</p><p id="p_163">61.    A   clear   set   of   distinctions   emerge   between   educational   institutions

regulation that the State can impose under Clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_138">Article 19</a> on the 


freedoms enjoyed pursuant to sub-clause (g) of Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_139">Article 19</a> by 


non-minority educational institutions would be greater than what could be 


imposed on minority institutions under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_140">Article 30(1)</a> continuing to maintain 


minority status by admitting mostly students of the minority to which the 


minority   institution   claims   it   belongs   to,   except   for   a   sprinkling   of   non-


minority students. The critical difference in regulation that would be higher 


in the case of non-minority educational institutions is that they only select 


students   from   the   general   pool,   and   based   on   merit   as   determined   by 


marks   secured   in   qualifying   examinations.   The   ability   to   choose   from   a 


smaller group within the general pool, becomes available only to those who 


are   constitutionally   protected   under   Clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_141">Article   30.</a>   Even   that 


ability   to   choose   from   within   the   smaller   group   is   not   really   a   right   to 


choose   a   "source".   The   source   is   given.   The   source   can   only   be   the 


minority to which the minority educational institution claims it belongs to. 


Once the choice is exercised to be an educational institution that serves a 


minority, the source itself is given by Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_142">Article 30</a> and depends 


on   whether   the  group   claiming   to  be  a   minority   is   actually   a   minority   or 


not,   as   determined   at   the   State   level.   Neither   AWES   nor   ACMS,   are

protected by any constitutional provision that allows it to choose to be an 


educational   institution   serving   only   a   small   class   of   students   from   within 


the general pool. If indeed Army personnel now constitute a "Socially and 


Educationally Backward Class", then under Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_143">Article 15</a>, it is for 


the State to determine the same, and provide by law, for reservations of 


wards   of   Army   personnel,   in   consonance   with   the   constitutional 


jurisprudence   extant   with   regard   to   how   a   Socially   and   Educationally 


Backward Class is to be delineated, for instance by removal of the creamy 


layer,   and   that   the   extent   of   reservations   to   be   provided   ought   not   to 


exceed   certain   levels   etc.   That   has   not   happened   in   this   instant   matter. 


Consequently,   all   of   the   permissible   restrictions   and   regulations   under 


Clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_144">Article 19</a> that non-minority institutions would be subject to 


would   also   be   applicable   with   respect   to   ACMS.   These   regulations   would 


also include a determination of how students in the non-reserved category 


of seats, in the post 93rd Amendment scenario, be admitted: on the basis of 


merit,   determined   by   marks   secured   on   the   common   entrance   test. 


Maintenance   of   overall   academic   standards,   which   apparently   can   be 


properly achieved only if high importance is placed on admitting students 


on the basis of ranking determined by marks secured in entrance tests, is 


necessarily   a   State   concern,   which   it   may   relax   only   in   respect   of   those 


groups   that   it   is   constitutionally   permitted   to   relax   for.   In   the   case   of 


minority educational institutions, that relaxation is on account of Clause (1)

constitutionally   permissible   classes.   With   respect   to   Socially   and 


Educationally Backward Classes, such classes can be determined only after 


excluding the creamy layer, as held by this Court in Ashoka Kumar Thakur.

professional   education.   It   is   not   necessary   for   us   to   go  

deep   into   this   aspect   of   the   issue   posed   before   us   in   as  

much   as   Pai   Foundation   has   classified   that   merit   and  

excellence   assume   special   significance   in   the   context   of  

professional studies. Though merit and excellence are not  

anathema   to   non-professional   education,   the   need   for  

merit   and   excellence   therein   is   not   of   the   degree   as   is  

called for in the context of professional education.

<p id="p_168">


</p><p id="p_169">105.   Dealing   with   unaided   minority   educational

come in the way of the State stepping in for the purpose of  

securing   transparency   and   recognition   of   merit   in   the

drawn between unaided minority educational institution at  

the level of schools and undergraduate colleges on the one  

side   and   institutions   of   higher   education,   in   particular  

those imparting professional education, on the other side.  

In   the   former,   the   scope   of   merit-based   selection   is  

practically nil and hence may not call for regulation. But in  

the case of the latter, transparency, and merit have to be  

unavoidably   taken   care   of   and   cannot   be   compromised.

<p id="p_170">Those   could   be   regulatory   measures   for   ensuring

</p><p id="p_171">63.     What stands out therefore, is that even though it is quite clearly and 


explicitly   stated   that   maintenance   of   merit   as   determined   by   marks 


secured   in   qualifying   examinations   is   an   absolute   necessity   under   Clause 


(6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_150">Article 19</a> for those enjoying the freedoms only under sub-clause (g) 


of   Clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_151">Article   19</a>,   the   protection   of   clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_152">Article   30</a>   to 


minorities is extended to choosing those with merit, based on marks on the 


qualifying   examinations,   amongst   their   own   minority   group.   There   is   no 


choice of "source" here. The choice is only with respect to being a minority 


or a non-minority educational institution. If the choice is exercised that the 


promoters   wish   to   start   a   minority   educational   institution,   the   source 


immediately gets affixed, by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_153">Article 30</a> and a determination of 


who  falls   within  that  minority   group.  The  educational   institution   does  not 


do   that.   The   State   does   that,   following   a   constitutionally   mandated   and 


permissible   process.   In   that   sense,   even   there   it   is   the   State   which 


delineates the "source" so that the protections of Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_154">Article 30</a> 


indeed   flow   to   the   minorities   that   the   State   was   expected   to   protect. 


Consequently,   this   attempt   to   define   an   equivalence   between   non-


minorities and minorities, and then come up with the idea that minorities 


can choose  or create a "source"  from within the general pool,  and hence 


the non-minorities should be free to also create their own "sources" has to 


be   deemed   to   be   illogical,   and   based   on   a   weird   interpretation   of   the

common   entrance   test   with   respect   to   filling   up   the   seats   that   are   not 


covered   by   reservations   for   Scheduled   Castes,   Scheduled   Tribes,   and

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_155">Article   15.</a>   Consequently   choice   of   students   by   non-minority   educational 


institutions can only be from the general pool with respect to non-reserved 


seats. They cannot make further distinctions of their own accord.




</p><p id="p_172">64.    In light of the above we have to conclude that non-minority private 


unaided   professional   colleges   do   not   have   the   right   to   choose   their   own 


"source"   from  within   the general  pool.   The   equivalence   between   minority 


and non-minority unaided institutions, apart from that distinction because 


of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_156">Article 30</a>, was to be on the basis that both are subject to 


reasonable   restrictions   pursuant   to   clause   (6)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_157">Article   19</a>,   that   neither 


minority   nor   non-minority   institutions   could   maladminister   their 


educational institutions, especially professional institutions, that affect the 


quality of education, and by choosing students arbitrarily from within the 


sources that they are entitled to choose from. In the case of non-minority 


institutions,   especially   professional   institutions,   the   "source"   can   only   be 


the   general   pool,   and   selection   has   to   be   based   on   inter-se   ranking   of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                                                                              71</span>



students   who   have   qualified   and   applying   or   opting   to   choose   to   be 


admitted   to   such   non-minority   educational   institutions.   In   the   case   of 


minority   educational   institutions,   the   "source"   can   be   delimited   to   the 


particular  minority  the institution  belongs  to. To hold  otherwise  would be 


illogical,   even   if   one   were   to   assume   that   what   is   afforded   to   minority 


institutions   is   only   a   protection   rather   than   a   full   fledged   right.   The 


protection under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_158">Article 30</a> is granted to minority institutions 


so   long   as   they   maintain   their   minority   status.   If   the   non-minority 


educational   institutions   could   choose   their   own   sources,   minorities   which 


are assured equal protections as non-minorities should certainly have that 


right too. The added protections to minority educational institutions makes 


sense only in the event that non-minorities are restricted to choosing from 


the   general   pool,   and   minorities   from   the   delimited   source   of   their   own 


minority. Otherwise Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_159">Article 30</a> would become meaningless.

to fill up all of its seats only with wards of army personnel on account of 


national   interest   has   also   been   noted   by   us.   However,   given   the  ratio   of 


P.A.   Inamdar,   we   are   unable   to   grant   any   relief   on   that   count.   We   do 


recognize that it may indeed be the case that army personnel, particularly 


those at the lower end of the hierarchy in the army, and their families, may 


be suffering from great hardships. It would indeed be, and ought to be a 


matter of considerable national distress if persons who have agreed to lay 


down   their   lives,   for   the   sake   of   national   security,   are   not   extended   an 


empathetic   understanding   of   their   needs   and   aspirations.   However,   the 


ratio of the judgments in TMA Pai, Islamic Academy and P.A. Inamdar, by 


larger   benches   of   this   Court,   leaves   us   with   no   options   with   respect   to 


holding that ACMS may select only those students who have scored higher 


marks in the common entrance test with respect to seats remaining after 


taking into account  reserved seats.  This  is  notwithstanding  what  we  may 


perceive to be an odious and an inherently unjust situation. If any special 


provisions need to be made to protect the wards of Army personnel, this 


may   possibly   be   done   by   the   State,   by   laws   protected   by   Clause   (5)   of

ratio   in   TMA   Pai,   as   further   explained   by   P.A.   Inamdar,   would   have 


foreclosed  any options  for the society and this  country to relax  the strict 


requirement  that all admissions be on the basis of "merit based on marks 


secured in qualifying examinations." The other option would have been for 


Courts   to  find,   in  the  interests  of   justice,  to   expand  the  "doing   complete

injustice,   which   raises   its   own   problems.   If   we   find   that   every   unaided 


educational   institution   can   define   its   own   source,   then   we   run   head   long 


into   a   situation   wherein   the   entire   field   of   higher   education   is   carved   up

which   will   only   admit   wards   of   such   members   of   the   judiciary?   Would 


Indian Administrative Officers, along with some slightly lower level in the 


administrative rung then have a similar right? Would the members of the 


police   force   also   then   get   such   rights?   Would   NASSCOM   or   a   group   of 


software   companies   say   that   they   want   to   start   software   engineering 


colleges that will open their portals only to those who belong to NASSCOM? 


Where will this stop? How will this nation take the burden of such walled 


and divided portals of knowledge? What will become of the prayer of our 


national poet laureate, that knowledge be free and where the world is not 


broken up into fragments of narrow domestic walls? Have we set ourselves 


on the path to such divisiveness, at the very source of the one force that 


could liberate us and unite us, and make us a more egalitarian society? If 


we  were   to  uphold   the  logic   of   the  learned   Senior   Counsel   appearing   for 


the   Respondents,   which   we   cannot   under   the   ratio   of   TMA   Pai,   and   P.A.

we would have set ourselves on a slippery slope, whereby the entire field 


of higher education would comprise of "gated communes" or some new and 


perverse form of caste system, where existing advantages, of occupations, 


social and economic stature, would get ossified only within a small segment 


of   the   population.   Surely,   fundamental   rights   have   been   granted   to   the

of the proceedings earlier. For the first time, before us, the learned Senior

provisions   of   clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_169">Article   15</a>   that   are   applicable   with   respect   to

learned   judges   did   not   evaluate   the   issue   of   whether   the   provisions   in 


clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_173">Article 15</a>, as applicable to unaided non-minority educational 


institutions, violate the basic structure of the Constitution. This was on the 


grounds   that   no   unaided   educational   institutions   were   before   this   Court. 


The majority, including Bhandari J., held that the same provisions in so far 


as   they   relate   to   governmental   and   private   aided   institutions   to   be   valid 


and   not   in   violation   of   the   basic   structure.   However,   Bhandari   J.,   opined 


that in as much as reservations would be imminent, pursuant to clause (5) 


of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_174">Article 15</a>, the same ought to be tested because the content of freedoms 


enunciated by this Court, in TMA Pai, and P.A. Inamdar, were likely to be 


destroyed.   It   was   granted   that,   even   though   this   Court   had   held   in   TMA

Pai, as explained in P.A. Inamdar, that imposition of reservations on non-


minority   unaided   educational   institutions   to   be   unreasonable   restrictions 


under clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_175">Article 19</a> on the freedoms granted by sub-clause (g) of 


clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_176">Article   19</a>   to   pursue   the   charitable   occupation   of   starting, 


operating,   financing,   working   and   teaching   in   non-minority   unaided 


educational   institutions,   the  same   could   be  subjected,  by  a  constitutional 


amendment, to the provisions of clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_177">Article 15.</a> Nevertheless, it 


was reasoned that in as much as the freedoms of citizens to engage in the 


occupation   of   education   was   under   potential   threat,   and   further   because 


the occupation of education was one of the activities covered by freedoms 


that were part of the "Golden Triangle", as enunciated in Minerva Mills Ltd. 


V Union  of India15,  it was posited   that the details be  examined as  to the 


degree of abridgment of the freedom of the "educators" to start, operate, 


manage,   finance,   work   in   and   teach   in   non-minority   educational 


institutions.

"paisa of public money" ought to be free from restrictions of State imposed 


reservations.   Further,   it   was   also   opined   that   even   though   non-minority 


unaided   educational   institutions   would   continue   to   exist,   and   educators 


would have their occupation, the "greatest impact on the educator is that 


neither he nor his institution will choose whom to teach", in as much as in

"49.5%"   of   the   time   the   State   would   determine,   through   a   policy   of 


reservations,   who  the  educators  would   teach.  In  this  regard,  the  test  for 


violation   of   basic   structure   doctrine   was   conducted   by   an   impact   and 


effects   test   (or   what   is   called   as   a   "rights   test"),   claiming   that   the 


observations   of   <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_178">I.R.   Coelho   v.   State   of   Tamil   Nadu16</a>  in   para   151   (ii) 


mandated such a test. In the first phase, the so called impact stage, it was 


determined that clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_179">Article 15</a> would indeed affect the "identity" 


of the freedom of private citizens to engage in the charitable occupation of 


starting, operating, managing, working in, financing and teaching in non-


minority unaided educational institutions. To this extent, the observations 


in   TMA   Pai   were   relied   on   to   trace   the   contours   of   the   outline   of   the 


"identity" of the freedom under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_180">Article 19.</a> 


The   test   of   violation   of   basic   structure   doctrine   was   further   stated   to   be 


whether the identity of the freedom of educators in non-minority unaided 


educational institutions under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_181">Article 19</a> was 


"compromised" by clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_182">Article 15.</a> It was also held that even if the 


freedom to choose students of one educator was affected, then the identity 


of the freedom to engage in the said occupation guaranteed by sub-clause 


</p><p id="p_185">(g)   of   clause   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_183">Article   19</a>   itself   would   have   been   compromised,   and 


consequently the provisions in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_184">Article 15</a> in as much as they 


affect   non-minority   unaided   educational   institutions   would   have   to   be 


deemed   to   be   unconstitutional   and   violative   of   the   basic   structure.

Thereafter an "effect" test was conducted, and by noting that imposition of 


reservations   would   immediately  (1)   make   academic  standards   suffer;   (2) 


affect   the   ability   of   attracting   and   retaining   good   quality   faculty;   (3)   the 


incentive   to   establish   a   first-rate   unaided   educational   institution   is   made 


difficult; and (4) ultimately the global reputation of educational institutions 


would be damaged, it was held that freedom of "educators" in non-minority 


unaided educational institutions would have been compromised and hence 


abrogated.   Further,   it   is   determined   that   sub-clause   (g)   of   clause   (1)   of

be   reasonable   by   virtue   of   the   Constitutional   status   given   to   such 


measures. The correct approach would then be to test whether powers of 


amendment   in   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_193">Article   368</a>   do   extend   to   imposing   restrictions   on   a   right,

a judgment of this Court. Once that test is conducted and found to be not 


violating the basic structure of the Constitution, the grounds on which this 


Court   had   previously   found   the   reservations   to   be   unreasonable   would 


vanish. This is even more so, when the amendment, and the consequent 


legislation,   cannot   and   do   not   seem   to   be   directed   at   completely 


eliminating the possibility of private citizens engaging in that activity, the

jurisprudence does not allow, normally an imposition of reservations above 


50%.   If   we   were   to   be   guided   by   the   submissions   in   this   regard   by   the 


learned  Senior Counsel  we find that we would have to invert  the logic  of 


the   basic   structure   doctrine,   state   the   propositions   of   the   test   in   a 


tautological   manner   and   consequently   convince   ourselves   that   there   is 


great   danger   to   constitutional   identity   by   virtue   of   legislations   that   could 


plausibly  be   enacted  by  the  State  by  virtue  of  the  enabling   provisions   of 


clause (5) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_194">Article 15</a>   with respect to non-minority unaided educational 


institutions.     We   find   that   if   we   were   to   do   that,   we   would   have   set 


ourselves on the path to ineradicably alter the identity of our Constitution, 


damage its very purposes and the national project, and wipe out decades

because of what was stated in para 142 of I.R. Coelho stated above. This is 


on account of the fact that if we were to take the concluding answer given

specific   questions   that   the   courts   set   out   to   answer,   would   then   be 


obliterated,   and  the narrow   application   that  the  Court  finds  for  a  specific

laws which have to be adjudged by applying the "direct impact and effect

<p id="p_204">


</p><p id="p_205">77.     One of the incidental questions that this Court in I.R. Coelho sought 


to   answer   was   whether,   pursuant   to   Keshavananda,   none   of   the 


fundamental   rights   were   to   be   considered   to   be   a   part   of   the   basic 


structure.   This   was   so,   in   the   light   of   the   opinion   of   Khanna,   J.,   in 


Keshavananda, which seemed to suggest that fundamental rights were not 


to be treated as a part of the basic structure. However, in light of Khanna 


J's,   clarification   in   the   Indira   Nehru   Gandhi   v   Raj   Narain21  case,   that   his 


opinion   in   Keshavananda   could   not   be   read   to   mean   that   none   of   the 


fundamental rights could be treated as a part of basic structure, this Court 


in I.R. Coelho in para 97, held that "the rights and freedoms created by the  


fundamental rights chapter can be taken away or destroyed by amendment  


of the relevant article, but subject to the limitation of the basic structure  


doctrine". In para 98 it was observed by this Court that "the first aspect to  


be   borne   in   mind   is   that   each   exercise   of   the   amending   power   inserting  


laws   into   the   Ninth   Schedule   entails   a   complete   removal   of   the  


fundamental rights chapter vis-`-vis the laws that are added to the Ninth  


Schedule.   Secondly,   insertion   in   the   Ninth   Schedule   is   not   controlled   by  


any defined criteria or standards by which the exercise of power may be  


evaluated. The consequence of insertion is that it nullifies entire Part III of  


21 1975 Supp SCC 1.

the Constitution. There is no constitutional control on such nullification........  


The   supremacy   of   the   Constitution   mandates   all   constitutional   bodies   to  


comply   with   the   provisions   of   the   Constitution.   It   also   mandates   a  


mechanism   for   testing   the   validity   of   legislative   acts   through   an  


independent   organ   viz.   the   judiciary."   Thus,   it   appears   that   what   was 


exercising the collective mind of the Nine Judge Bench in I.R. Coelho was 


the   breadth   of   protections   that   were   being   sought   and   placed   on   laws 


included   in   the   Ninth   Schedule:   from   any   standards   or   values   of   the 


Constitution   itself,   including   complete   evisceration   of   Part   III   and   judicial 


review. In fact this is borne out by para 103 wherein it was observed that 


"[T]he absence of guidelines for exercise of such power means the absence  


of   constitutional   control   which   results   in   destruction   of   constitutional  


supremacy   and   creation   of   parliamentary   hegemony   and   absence   of   full  


power   of   judicial   review   to   determine   the   constitutional   validity   of   such

permissibility of an amendment, one needs to look at, as done in <a href="/doc/799151/" id="a_214">Waman 


Rao   v.   Union   of   India</a>,22  how   far   the   amendment   is   "consistent   with   the

opposite   of   what   it   is.   For   that   purpose,   a   comparison   is   undertaken   to 


match   the   amendment   with   the   original.   Such   a   comparison   can   yield 


fruitful results even in the rarefied sphere of constitutional law." In other 


places, as in para 105, it is noted that "Economic growth and social equity  


are   two   pillars   of   our   Constitution,   which   are   linked   to   the   rights   of   an  


individual (right to equal opportunity), rather than in the abstract. Some of  


the rights in Part III constitute fundamentals of the Constitution like <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_215">Article

part of the basic structure of the Constitution and cannot be abrogated, it 


is concluded in para 114 that "the result of the aforesaid discussion is that 


since basic structure of the constitution includes some of the fundamental 


rights,  any   law   granted   Ninth   Schedule   protection   deserves   to   be  


tested against these principles. If  the law infringes the essence of 


any fundamental rights, or any other aspect of the basic structure 


then   it   will   be   struck   down.   The   extent   of   abrogation   and   limit   of 


abridgment shall have has to be examined in each case." (emph. supp.) 




</p><p id="p_213">81.    Consequently,   it   appears   that   in   I.R.   Coelho   this   Court   recognized 


that there  are different kinds  of  constitutional  amendments. The kinds of 


amendments whereby laws are placed in the Ninth Schedule only enjoy a 


"fictional immunity" and they would have to be tested by using the direct 


impact   and   effect   test   i.e.,   "rights   test"   or   even   the   essence   of   each 


fundamental   right   that   has   been   deemed   to   be   a   part   of   the   basic 


structure.   The   laws   placed   in   the   Ninth   Schedule   are   ordinarily   enacted, 


and   then   placed   in   Ninth   Schedule   by   a   constitutional   amendment, 


simpliciter, and enjoy only a "fictional immunity" pursuant to <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_218">Article 31-B.</a>

effectuates changes in the main provisions of the Constitution, particularly 


in   Part   III.   In   such   a   constitutional   amendment,   the   "essences   of   rights" 


test used in M. Nagaraj, wherein the essences of the rights are identified 


across   entire   equality,   freedom   and   judicial   review   codes,   i.e.,   "over-


arching   principles"   of   such   codes,   and   then   the   particular   Constitutional 


amendment   is   evaluated   as   to   whether   it   completely   changes   the   very 


"identity"   of   the   entire   Constitution   itself.   Those   "over-arching   principles" 


are what gives the Constitution its identity, and when they are destroyed 


would the identity of the Constitution have been changed completely.




</p><p id="p_214">82.    This is made very clear by what this Court in I.R. Coelho perceived to 


be the status of the nature of immunity granted by <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_219">Article 31-B:  "</a><a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_220">Article

concludes "The result of the aforesaid discussion is that the constitutional  


validity of the Ninth Schedule laws can be adjudged by applying the direct

</p><p id="p_216">83.    The   above   cited   paragraph   lends   further   support   to   our   earlier 


observation that this Court in I.R. Coelho has made an essential distinction 


between   the   kinds   of   constitutional   amendments   that   are   effected   by 


placement   of   State   laws   in   the   Ninth   Schedule   versus   the   kinds   of 


constitutional   amendments   that   change   aspects   of  the   Constitution   itself. 


This is further supported by the fact that in para 133 the Court recognized 


that   the   laws   placed   in   the   Ninth   Schedule   do   not   become   a   part   of   the 


main   body   of   the   Constitution,   and   that   they   become   a   part   of   Ninth 


Schedule   and   "derive   validity   on   account   of   the   exercise   undertaken   by 


Parliament to include them... This exercise has to be tested every time it is 


undertaken".   Secondly,   it   must   also   be   noticed,   that   state   legislatures 


cannot amend the constitution. It was conclusively held in I.R. Coelho, in 


para   148,   that   "fictional   validation   based   on   the   power   of   immunity  


exercised   by   Parliament   under   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_221">Article   368</a>   is   not   compatible   with   basic  


structure doctrine and, therefore,  the laws that are included in the Ninth  


Schedule   have   to   be   examined   individually   for   determining   whether   the  


constitutional   amendments   by   which   they   are   put   in   the   Ninth   Schedule  


damage   or   destroy   the   basic   structure   of   the   Constitution."   This   was   so 


because post Keshavananda decision, this Court had specified that some of 


the   fundamental   rights   are   also   a   part   of   the   basic   structure   because   of 


their importance. Consequently, a direct impact and effect test i.e., "rights 


test" and "essence of right" i.e., the essence of the fundamental right that

has been affected has to be conducted in the case of laws included in the 


Ninth   Schedule   by   virtue   of   the   constitutional   amendments,   simpliciter, 


whereas   with   respect   to   constitutional   amendments   of   an   article   in   the 


Constitution   itself   had   to   be   tested   in   accordance   with   the   essences   of 


rights i.e., "over-arching principles" test as enunciated in M. Nagaraj. This 


is   further   borne   out   by   sub-para   (i)   of   paragraph   151  cited   earlier   when 


read   with   para   142,   and   taking   the   entire   judgment   in   I.R.   Coelho   into 


account.

</p><p id="p_218">84.     A   few   observations   are   merited   with   regard   to   the   very   carefully 


crafted principles laid down in the sub-para (i) of para 151 in I.R. Coelho. 


The first point is that a law that abrogates or abridges rights guaranteed by 


Part III may or may not violate the basic structure. This means that there 


could be laws that could abrogate some fundamental rights in Part III, and 


yet may not lead to a violation of the basic structure doctrine. The second 


sentence   in   sub-para   (i)   states   emphatically   that   if   a   law   abrogates   or 


abridges a fundamental right and also violates the basic structure then it 


must   be   set   aside.   At   this   stage   it   is   not   yet   clear   whether   the   law   is   a 


constitutional   amendment   exercised   under   <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_222">Article   368</a>   to   make   an 


amendment   to  the  main   body  of  the  constitutional  text,  or   the law   is  an 


amendment that places laws in the Ninth Schedule, whereby such laws in 


the Ninth Schedule do not become a part of the Constitution as such. That

clarification comes from the next sentence: "The validity or invalidity would 


be   tested   on   the   principles   laid   down   in   this   judgment".   That   sentence 


clearly   indicates   that   the   same   has   to   be   determined   in   accordance   with 


the   principles   laid   down   in   the   entire   judgment   and   not   just   in   the 


conclusion. That principle was unequivocally laid down in para 142 that had 


been   cited   earlier,   which   recognizes   that   the   test   of   Constitutional 


amendments on the anvil of the basic structure doctrine would have to be 


in accordance with the test delineated in M. Nagaraj.

</p><p id="p_222">86.     In M. Nagaraj, Kapadia J., (as he then was) speaking for the Court, 


recognized that one of the cardinal principles of constitutional adjudication 


is that the mode of interpretation ought to be the one that is purposive and 


conducive   to   ensure   that   the   constitution   endures   for   ages   to   come. 


Eloquently, it was stated that the  "Constitution is not an ephemeral legal  


document  embodying  a  set  of rules  for  the passing  hour".  In  M. Nagaraj 


this   Court   recognized   that   fundamental   rights   are   not   those   which   exist 


only by virtue of the State recognizing them to be so, but rather that the 


Constitution transcribes them as limitations on the power of the State. This 


would   mean   that   not   merely   or   solely   are   the   negative   rights   to   be 


conceived as natural, given and pre-existing, but the positive rights, which 


cast   an   obligation   on   the   State   to   achieve   egalitarian   and   social   justice 


objectives, that behoove to the benefit of individuals and groups would also 


have   to   be   recognized   as   natural,   given   and   pre-existing.   It   is   also 


recognized  that the content  of the fundamental right granted to a citizen 


has   to   be   determined   by  the  judiciary;   and   variations   effectuated   by   the 


State have to meet the test of reasonableness as enunciated by this Court 


in Minerva Mills, which effectively set aside the narrow construction of A.K. 


Gopalan v State of Madras25 that as long as the variation and the extent of 


such   variation   of   a   granted   fundamental   right   is   effectuated   by   "law"   it 


could not be questioned. However, it was also recognized that the judiciary 


cannot use a narrow and pedantic exposition of the text of the fundamental

right to determine the contents thereof.  Further, the Court in M. Nagaraj 


recognized   that   the   standard   of   judicial   review   of   a   constitutional 


amendment, on the touchstone of the doctrine of the basic structure, is an 


entirely different exercise than review of state legislation with respect to its 


impact on a specific fundamental right. Analysing the rationale and mode 


of analysis of the Court in <a href="/doc/141126788/" id="a_226">S.R. Bommai v. Union of India26</a>, it was stated, in 


para   23,   that   "it   is   important   to   note   that   the  recognition   of   a   basic  


structure in the context of amendment provides an insight that there are,  


beyond the words of particular provisions, systematic principles underlying  


and   connecting   the   provisions   of   the   Constitution.   These   principles  give  


coherence   to   the   Constitution   and   make   it   an   organic   whole....   These  


principles   are   part   of   constitutional   law   even   if   they   are   not   expressly  


stated in the form of rules. An instance is the principle of reasonableness  


which connects <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_227">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_228">, 19</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_229">21.</a> Some of these principles may be so  


important and fundamental, as to qualify as "essential features" or part of  


the "basic structure" of the Constitution, that is to say, they are not open  


to   amendment.   However,  it   is   only   by   linking   provisions   to   such  


overarching principles that one would be able to distinguish essential from  


less   essential   features   of   the   Constitution."   (emphasis   added).   It   was 


further   specified   that   certain   principles,   such   as   federalism,   socialism, 


secularism   and   reasonableness   "are   beyond   the   words   of   a   particular

provision.   They   are   systematic   and   structural   principles   underlying   and 


connecting various provisions of the Constitution."




</p><p id="p_223">87.    The modality of the "essences of rights test" was enunciated in para 


25 of M. Nagaraj as follows: " In order to qualify as an essential feature, it  


must be first established that the said principle is a part of constitutional  


law  binding  on the legislature.  Only, thereafter,  is   the second  step  to be  


taken, namely whether, whether the principle is so fundamental as to bind  


even  the  amending   power  of   Parliament  i.e.,  to   form  a  part  of   the basic  


structure.....   To   sum   up:   in   order   to   qualify   as   an   essential   feature,   a  


principle is to be first established as part of constitutional law and as such  


binding on the legislature. Only then, can it be examined whether it is so  


fundamental   as   to   bind   even   the  amending   powers   of  Parliament   i.e.,   to  


form part of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is the standard of  


review of constitutional amendments in the context of the doctrine of the  


basic structure." And further on, in para 26, the Court also recognized that 


the doctrine of basic structure has emanated from the German Constitution 


and   notes   that   in   that   jurisprudence   the   overarching   principle   that 


connects,   and   informs   all   other   values   is   the   principle   of   human   dignity. 


With respect to our Constitution it was noted that "axioms like secularism,  


democracy, reasonableness, social justice, etc., are over-arching principles 


which   provide   linking   factor   for   the   principle   of   fundamental   rights   like  


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                                                                             98</span>



<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_230">Article   14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_231">,   19</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_232">21.</a>   These   principles"   i.e.,   the   over-arching   principles,  


"are beyond the amending power of Parliament." (emph. suppd.)




</p><p id="p_224">88.    From the above we can glean that evaluation of whether a particular 


amendment   has   amended   those   "over-arching   principles"   is   the   test   for 


basic structure. It is not the specific instances of expression of contents of 


a fundamental right, as stated by the courts prior to an amendment which 


are to become the anvil of the test of basic structure when the amending 


power is exercised and a main element of the provisions of the Constitution 


is altered. Rather, the courts have to be careful in assessing whether those 


over-arching   principles   themselves   are   abrogated.   By   no   stretch   of 


imagination   could   one   claim   that   truncation   of   one   of   the   activities   that 


were deemed to have been one of the many essential features of one of 


the   occupations   of   the   many   occupations   that   are   guaranteed   by   one   of 


clauses   of   the   freedom   code,   by   itself   could   constitute   an   over-arching 


principle, and further that such a principle has been abrogated. It is not the 


change in the identity of any one element of the conspectus of activities of 


one occupation in a plethora of occupations that itself forms a part of the 


many   different   kinds   of   freedoms   that   leads   to   the   violation   of   the  basic 


structure   doctrine;   but   rather   whether   the   over-arching   principles,   that 


connect   one   fundamental   right   to   the   other   that   are   so   abrogated   as   to 


change   the   very   identity   of   the   Constitution   which   is   the   true   test   to 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                                                                              99</span>



evaluate   whether   a   constitutional   amendment   has   violated   the   basic 


structure doctrine. In this regard, the Court in M. Nagaraj further goes on 


to   pithily   state   that   the   standard   to   be   applied   in   evaluating   whether   an 


amendment has also modified the over-arching principles, that inform each 


and every fundamental right and link them, is to find whether because of 


such   a  change   we  have   a   completely   different   constitution.   In   particular, 


summarizing the various opinions in Keshavananda Bharati27, it was stated:




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">        "To conclude, the theory of basic structure is based on the  

        concept   of   constitutional   identity.   The   basic   structure  

        jurisprudence   is   a   preoccupation   with   constitutional  

        identity.... The word "amendment" postulates that the old  

        Constitution survives without a loss of its identity despite  

        the   change   and   it   continues   even   though   it   has   been  

        subjected   to   alteration.   This   is   the   constant   theme   of  

        opinions in the majority decision in Keshavananda Bharati.  

        To destroy its identity is to abrogate the basic structure of  

        the Constitution........ The main object behind the theory of  

        constitutional   identity   is   continuity   and   within   that  

        continuity   of   identity,   changes   are   admissible   depending  

        upon   the   situation   and   circumstances   of   the   day."

a   problem   is   encountered   with   issues   of   identity.   The   issue   of   change   in 


identity,   and   debates   about   it   can   take   extremely   abstract   and 


metaphysical form as with regards to the Ship of Theseus28 or the Theseus' 


Paradox. In the classical narrative, in the metaphysical speculations about 


the  paradox,   reference  is   with respect  to  the ship  in  which   Theseus,  and 


other youth of Athens, returned from Crete having killed a minotaur that 


demanded   sacrifice   of   Greek   youth   every   year.   Because   the   ship   was   of 


such   importance,   Athenians   preserved   it   in   the   harbor   for   generations, 


replacing   its   boards   that   had   become   dilapidated   by   new   ones,   where   at 


one   point   all   the   boards   had   been   replaced.   This   apparently   led   to   the 


fertile Greek minds, prone as they were to metaphysical speculation, to ask 


whether   the   ship,   after   every   part   had   been   replaced   by   another   newer 


part, was indeed the same ship or not. For the formalists, the identity had 


changed   because   none   of   the   original   parts   were   there;   and   in   fact   the 


extreme   amongst   them   claimed   that   the   identity   had   changed   when   the 


first part was itself changed. For the functionalists, the ship was identically 


the same because the parts that replaced the worn out parts were of the 


same quality, shape and size and performed exactly the same functions as 


previously   specified.   In   either   case,   both   the   puritanical   originalists 


delighted in the squabble without there being any pragmatic resolution.

arrived thereupon on this country, by ignoring the practical impact of the 


ship and the larger purposes that it is supposed to serve. Indeed our ship, 


the   Constitution,   was   never   intended   to   remain   in   the   harbour   and   was 


intended to set sail. The narrative of our Ship of Theseus takes a different 


form for us.

<p id="p_229">


</p><p id="p_230">91.    We liken our Constitution to the Ship of Theseus, with the difference 


that   the   ship   itself   has   been   provided   with   sufficient   wood,   and   tools   to 


fashion new boards, and it was to actually set sail. The Ship of our Nation, 


the   Constitution,   set   sail   on   its   journey   in   1950,   on   uncharted   oceans   of 


time, circumstances and challenges. We set sail with a ship as it was then 


designed, nevertheless knowing that certain features were quintessential to 


being a ship that could sail such oceans; and we set sail towards a target, 


almost   like   Columbus,   with   the   understanding   that   sailing   in   a   particular 


direction   would   get   us   to   a   particular   destination.   We   even   promised 


ourselves,   that   notwithstanding   our   prior   history   of   bickering,   of 


degradation   of   humans   amongst   us   by   ascribed   status,   and   of   economic 


poverty,   we   would   have,   by   the   time   of   reaching   our   goal,   ensured   that 


certain   invaluable   qualities,   such   as   dignity,   fraternity,   security   and 


integrity of our nation-state, inform all aspects of social order.  In fact the

achievement of those qualities was to be the goal. The directions we were 


given   were   that   if   we   strive   to   achieve,   in   actual   fact,   JUSTICE,   social, 


economic   and   political;   LIBERTY   of   thought,   expression,   belief,   faith   and 


worship;   and   EQUALITY   of   status   and   opportunity;   within   the   context   of 


organizing our polity as a secular, socialist and a democratic republic, and 


the   State   itself,   necessarily   follows   certain   principles   of   policy,   we   would 


achieve   those   goals.   We   were   enjoined   to   roam   the   high   seas   until   we 


achieved a state of acceptable achievement of those goals, neither knowing 


the length of time nor the length of that journey. In fact we also knew, that 


achievement   of   those   goals   was   never   going   to   be   a   matter   of   some 


quantitative  assessment of those goals, but always a maintenance of  the 


path towards, and sustaining what we may have already achieved. We also 


knew that along that journey, many of the boards, and indeed even certain 


parts   of   the   main   structure   may   appear   to   be   or   actually   become   a 


detriment   to   our   progress.   Hence,   we   were   also   given   liberty   to   change 


some   of   those   parts,   in   terms   of   replacing   those   parts   with   exact   same 


ones,   or  mostly   similar   ones,   or  even  radically   differently   designed   ones. 


The caveat was that, if the changes were such that the destination could 


not be  reached, or that  the motive force  for powering the journey  would 


become  truncated, or   debates could not be conducted  within the settled 


principles of civility, or that on the course of that journey too many were 


actually getting pushed off the ship, or that the changes were such that the

necessarily   get   pushed   into   the   ocean,   etc.,   the   ship   of   our   nation,   the

would sink; and if the appropriate changes were to not be made the ship

reaffirmed the working test laid down by Chandrachud J., in Indira Nehru

       perforce   to   examine   in   each   individual   case   the   place   of  

       the particular feature in the scheme of our Constitution, its  

       object and purpose, and the consequences of its denial on

</blockquote><p id="p_237">95.    In   this   regard,   it   was   noted   in   M.   Nagaraj   that   concepts   like 


"equality",   "representative   democracy"   etc.,   are   delineated   over   various 


articles. "Basically Part III of the Constitution consists of equality code, the  


freedom code and the right to move the courts. It is true that equality has  


several   facets.   However,   each  case   has   to  be   seen   in   the  context   of   the  


placement of an article which embodies the foundational value of equality."

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_236">Article   15</a>,   is   not   about   truncation   of   one   activity   that   was   previously 


deemed by this court to be one of the essential features of one of the many 


occupations that are a part of one of the many freedoms guaranteed in the 


freedom code; and that we not only have to assess the negative impact, 


but   also   the   positive   impact   of   an   amendment.   This   follows   from   the 


realization that while we may classify aspects important for that ship to sail 


towards   its   goals   into   neat   analytical   categories,   the   ship   itself,   and   the 


nation   it   carries   functions   in   accordance   with   the   action   and   reaction   of 


each   category   upon   other   categories.   Consequently,   we   must   take   into 


account the fact that the changes that are made may while truncating one 


small   element,   may   also   be   strengthening   many   other   elements,   and 


thereby   strengthening   the   very   basic   structure   of   the   Constitution.   Thus 


care   needs   to   be   exercised   to   avoid   rhetorical   flourishes   about   the 


importance of one small activity that may be truncated in order to achieve 


larger   purposes.   Obviously,   some   small   activities   could   be   of   primordial 


importance.   Some   rights   may   be   important,   but   not   of   primordial 


importance, and their importance has to be assessed in terms of their place 


in the overall context of constitutional values, and goals.

conflicts   with   an   amendment   that   intends   to   strengthen   the   process   of 


achievement of one of the main navigational tools and thereby the goals of 


the   nation-state   itself,   should   such   an   amendment   be   declared   to   be 


unconstitutional and against the basic structure? Shouldn't one also look at 


the damage that such a declaration can cause to many of the other basic 


features   of   the   Constitution,   and   also   the   loss   of   diverse   strengths   that 


such   an   amendment   is   likely   to   impart   to   many   other   essential   or   basic 


features   of   our   Constitution?   We   opine   that   by   not   undertaking   an 


assessment   of   such   factors   we   would   almost   certainly   lead   to   erroneous 


judgments   that   would   destroy   the   basic   structure   of   the   Constitution.   In 


the present context what is involved is a judicial review of an amendment 


to the Constitution that seeks to strengthen the egalitarian aspects of our 


social   order.   Consequently,   the   conflict,   in   the   instant   case,   has   to   be 


evaluated in terms of whether disallowing the amendment might damage, 


significantly, the prospects of promoting intrinsic and inherent parts of our 


equality   code   -   the   egalitarian   and   social   justice   components   -   that   are 


essential elements of our basic structure. Such a test would give us a more 


nuanced   appreciation   of   how   setting   aside,   as   violative   of   the   basic 


structure,   the   provisions   of   clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_237">Article   15</a>   with   respect   to

recognized   that  there  can  be  no  justice  without  equality  of  status   and of 


opportunity (See M. Nagaraj). As recognized by Babasaheb Ambedkar, at 


the moment that our Constitution just set sail, that while the first rule of 


the   ship,   in   the   form   of   formal   equality,   was   guaranteed,   inequality   in 


terms of access  to social and economic  resources  was  rampant and on  a 


massive scale, and that so long as they individually, and the social groups 


they   were   a   part   of,   continue   to   not   access   to   social   and   economic 


resources that affords them dignity, they would always be on the margins 


of the ship, with the ever present danger of falling off that ship and thereby 


never partaking of the promised goals of that ship. Babasaheb Ambedkar 


with   great   foresight   remarked   that   unless   such   more   fundamental 


inequalities, that foster conditions of injustice, and limit liberty of thought 


and of conscience,  are eradicated at the earliest, the ship itself would be

cherished  values    of peace,  harmony, co-existence,  and a democratic  set 


up in which reasoned and reasonable argument and debate would inform 


our social, political and economic choices. Some may say that this was a 


compromise,  that in fact the framers of our constitution  made the wrong 


choice, and that we should have opted for a revolutionary mode of change, 


if   necessary   by   shedding   of   bloodshed   of   our   own   people.   Some   others 


argue that we should have opted for a pure market economy,  right from 


the  beginning,  so  that  the  inefficient  governmental  regulations   would  not 


have hindered our economic progress. However, they seldom have answers 


as to when, or over what time frame could it be conceived that a state of 


equality   of   status   and   opportunity,   and   social,   economic   and   political 


justice would inform all walks of our lives, so that each and every citizen 


would be enabled to lead a life with dignity, that both promotes fraternity 


and   also   is   promoted   by   such   a   fraternity,   and  of   active   participation,   to 


the fullest extent of their natural talents, to participate in full measure in 


the   making   of   choices,   social,   political   and   economic.   Nor   do   the   free

markets   would   not   lead   to   a   perpetuation   of   ever   widening   disparities 


between   the   haves   and   the   have-nots.   Historical   human   experience

</p><p id="p_245">101. Consequently,  the State was given the responsibility to balance the 


exigencies   of   the   needs,   between   social   justice   and   formal   equality, 


between   a   command   and   control   economy   and   a   private   sector   with 


freedom   to   make   its   choices   within   a   regulated   environment,   keeping   in 


mind   the  larger   needs   of  the  nation,   between   the   imperative   to   promote 


economic   growth,   and   development   in   its   classical   sense,   in   which   the 


progress   of   people   was   measured   on   all   dimensions   of   human   dignity. 


Indeed, these imperatives of statecraft, of governance of the nation state, 


were even transcribed  into fundamental, though non-justiciable,  Directive 


Principles of State Policy. The fact that they were made non-justiciable was 


not to deny their absolute essentiality, but rather that the legislatures, and 


the   executive   under   the   supervision   of   the   elected   representatives,   were 


best   placed   to   make   choices   with   regard   to   issues   of   policy,   while   the 


judiciary endowed with the responsibility of interpreting and upholding the 


Constitution.   An   important   and   particular   aspect   of   our   Constitution   that 


should always be kept in mind is that various aspects of social justice, and 


an   egalitarian   social   order,   were   also   inscribed,   not   as   exceptions   to   the 


formal content of equality but as intrinsic, vital and necessary components 


of the basic equality code itself. To the extent there was to be a conflict, on 


account of scarcity, it was certainly envisaged that the State would step in 


to ensure an equitable distribution in a manner that would be conducive to 


common   good;   nevertheless,   if   the   state   was   to   transgress   beyond   a

certain   limit,   whereby   the   formal   content   of   equality   was   likely   to   be 


drastically abridged or truncated, the power of judicial review was to curtail 


it.   However,   as   long   as   the   policy   initiatives   of   the   State   were   in 


consonance   with   principles   of   equity   and   justice   inherent   within   the 


equality   code,   and   indeed   even   the   freedom   code,   via   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_242">Article   21`</a>s

State Policy, that were based on reasonable and intelligible classifications, 


the   courts   were   to   have   no   further   place   in   entering   the   field   of   policy 


choices.   The   courts   could   of   course,   also,   impose   positive   constitutional 


obligations   on   the   State,   where   the   abnegation   of   those   positive   and 


affirmative   obligations,   encoded   within   fundamental   rights   itself,   were   so 


gross as to constitute a fraud on the face of the Constitution.

indeed   our  constitutional   jurisprudence  specifies   that  Part  III   is   one   such 


zone of limitation. The rigour and discipline of fundamental rights, granted 


to   citizens are to be the checks on the power of the State. Fundamental 


rights   are   indeed   vital   for   the   survival   of   our   society,   and   provide 


guarantees that protect our citizens against totalitarianism, are conducive 


for full expression of human creativity, and in fact foundational for human 


dignity. Further, the substance of justice is inscribed into such fundamental 


rights, that are both substantive and procedural and are available to all the 


citizens, along with powers granted to the State to realize social justice and 


real   and   "in   fact"   equality   of   status   and   opportunity   for   those   who   are 


disadvantaged. Consequently, it cannot be taken to mean that the zone of 


limitation would then operate to frustrate   the obligations of the State, to 


achieve goals of social justice and egalitarian order, by placing primordial 


importance  on formal equality and freedom. Formal rights of some power 


cannot become the foundation to whittle away  powers that are necessarily 


implied in order to achieve national goals. The question is of balance, and it 


is the act of balancing between the compulsions cast upon the State by the

egalitarian and social justice aspects inscribed on many of the fundamental 


rights themselves, that have been called the twin wheels of the chariot of 


national   progress.   In   this   regard   it   has   been   held   in   Keshavananda   that 


harmony   between   Directive   Principles   of   State   Policy   and   Fundamental

such   egalitarian   objectives   within   the   context   of   employment   or   of 


education,   in   the  public   sector,   as   long   as   the  measures   do  not   truncate 


elements of formal equality disproportionately, were deemed to be inherent 


parts of the promise of real equality for all citizens. As stated succinctly in 


M.   Nagaraj,   it   is   an   issue   of   proportionality.   "Concept   of   proportional 


equality   expects   the   State   to   take   affirmative   action   in   favour   of 


disadvantaged   sections   of   the   society   within   the   framework   of   liberal 


democracy" and further that "[U]nder the Indian Constitution, while basic 


liberties   are   guaranteed   and   individual   initiative   is   encouraged,   the  State 


has got the role of ensuring that no class prospers at the cost of other class 


and no person suffers because of drawbacks which is not of his but  


social."   With   regard   to   distribution   of   social   opportunities   and   social 


benefits, Kapadia J. (as he then was) notes that some define "social justice 


in   terms   of   rights",   and   some   others,   like   Friedrich   Hayek   in   terms   of 


"desert" without any regard to the relative advantages or disadvantages as 


between   individuals,   and   some   others,   socialists,   on   the   basis   of   needs. 


With regard to these three different rationale, this Court recognized that all 


three   have   to   be   accommodated   under   the   equality   code,   with   those 


fulfilling the "desert based" criteria located under formal equality zone, and 


those   fulfilling   the   "need   based"   or   the   "disadvantaged   based"   criteria 


under the  zone  covered  by proportional  equality. To this  we need to add 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                                                                           116</span>



another   important   point.   The   critical   aspect   of   the   authenticity   of 


constitutional claims of the disadvantaged, on whose behalf State exercises 


its power, is the fact that it is social circumstances which have prevented 


those   individuals   from   performing   to   their   full   potential,   and   thereby 


compete on a level playing field with those who might satisfy the "desert 


based"   criteria.   In   fact   the   very   notion   that   unequals   ought   not   to   be 


treated  as  equals   is  also  founded  on  the notion  that  those  with  lesser  or 


lower   background   opportunities   could   not   be   expected   to   match   the 


performance of those with much better opportunities. The fact that it is the 


State   that   seeks   to   enhance   through   its   policies,   such   rights   of 


disadvantaged, because it has the duty to ensure their realization, cannot 


be taken to mean that every element of every individual right of the less 


disadvantaged could be used to frustrate the realization of those rights.

would   also   be   necessary   at   this   stage   to   realize   that   the   egalitarian

(See: State of Karnataka v Ranganatha Reddy34) What they could be and 


ought to be tested on was the anvil of reasonableness of classification, and 


extent of intrusion, where the Constitution itself did not specifically provide 


for untrammeled power to completely eliminate the private sector from a 


particular field of activity. This Court's decisions in M. Nagaraj, and equally 


importantly,   Ashoka   Kumar   Thakur,   have   unequivocally   held,   based   on 


Indra Sawhney, that the concept of egalitarianism is an essential and vital 


element of the equality code, and in Ashoka Kumar Thakur that principle 


was   applied   in   the   context   of   education.   The   Court   refused,   in   Ashoka 


Kumar   Thakur,   to   look   at   whether   clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_256">Article   15</a>   as   applied   to 


non-minority private unaided colleges would violate the basic structure, on 


the   ground   that   no   private   unaided   college   was   before   it.   However,   that 


does   not   mean   that   the   principles   enunciated   in   Ashoka   Kumar   Thakur, 


that egalitarianism was an intrinsic part of our equality code with respect to 


the field of education could be limited only with respect to public and aided 


institutions.

level   of   being   essential   features   informing   the   entire   equality   code,   per 


force   have   to   also   be   applied   to   the   context   of   private   sector   unaided

essential   and   a   necessary   component   of   the   equality   code,   which   is   a 


finding   that   this   Court   arrived   at   in   Indra   Sawhney,   M.   Nagaraj   and   in 


Ashoka Kumar Thakur, we cannot in the same breath then turn around and 


say that the same concerns, of national purpose, goal and objectives that 


inform the constitutional identity miraculously disappear in the context of 


the private sector. It is indeed true that the extent of State involvement in 


the   field   of   higher   education   has   dramatically   declined   on   account   of   its 


own   financial   position.   At   least   a   part   of   the   problem   of   the   financial 


situation of the State could be reasonably  linked to increasing privatization 


and liberalization of the economy, and one of the essential elements of that 


process of privatization has been the demand of the private sector that the 


State   reduce   its   deficits,   even   as   tax   rates   were   cut,   by   reducing   its 


involvement in various social welfare activities. This has had an impact on 


the   ability   of   the   State   to   invest   as   much   as   it   could   have   in   education, 


including   higher   education.   An   essential   understanding   was   that   because 


the  private sector  would expand even in  areas  such as higher education, 


the   burden   on   the   State   of   providing   such   services   would   decline.   The 


burden of the State does not comprise merely of the burden of its financial 


outlays. The burden of the State obviously also comprises of the positive 


obligations imposed on it, on account of the egalitarian component of the 


equality code, the directive principles of State policy, and the national goals 


of achievement of an egalitarian order and social justice for individuals and

amongst   groups   that   those   individuals   are   located   in.   If   the   State   had 


clearly articulated that its goal was to withdraw from such crucial and vital 


fields,   such   as   higher   education,   and   that   it   was   also   not   expecting   the 


private sector to carry any of the burdens of ensuring an egalitarian order 


and   realize   the  goal   of   social   justice   in   at   least   some   measure,   then   the 


dimensions   of   constitutional   litigation   on   that   front   could   very   well   have 


taken   a   different   shape,   and   questions   about   whether   such   actions

unreasonable, pursuant to clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_258">Article 19</a>, for the State to fix the

the role of the State in the field which has been recognized even in TMA 


Pai. The power of the State to allow such participation of the private sector 


could only have existed if the State had the power to devise policies based 


on circumstances to promote general welfare of the country, and the larger 


public   interest.   The   same   cannot   be   taken   to   mean   that   a   constitutional 


amendment   has   occurred,   in   a   manner   that   fundamental   alteration   has 


occurred in the basic structure itself, whereby the State is now denuded of 


its  obligations   to  pursue  social   justice  and  egalitarian   ideals,  inscribed   as 


an   essential   part   of   our   constitutional   identity,   in   those   areas   which   the 


State feels that even resources in the private sector would need to be used 


to   achieve   those   goals.   The   argument   that   the   policies   of   liberalization, 


privatization   and   globalization   (LPG)   have   now   cut   off   that   power   of   the 


State are both specious, and fallacious. Such policies are only instances of 


the   broader   powers   of   the   State   to   craft   policies   that   it   deems   to   serve 


broader   public   interests.   One   cannot,   and   ought   not   to   deem   that   the 


ideologies   of   LPG   have   now   stained   the   entire   Constitutional   fabric   itself,

Bowles  and  Steven Durlauf   have  also   posited  that  the  ideological  notions 


that all governmental programs to achieve egalitarian goals are ineffective 


has fundamentally eroded the very culture of nations, and the moral and 


constitutional commitments of the policy makers to pursue such goals, with 


the "dismal prognosis of immutable inequality."36  Moreover, it is also very 


well   recognized   that   markets,   instead   of   eradicating   discriminations   and 


disadvantages,  may  in  fact  perpetuate  the  same.   (See  Cass  R.   Sunstein,

power   of   the   State   to   regulate   the   private   sector   would   lead   to   massive 


redistributions   of   incomes,   assets   and   resources   in   favour   of   the   few,   as

such a role for the State should not be doubted, nor its Constitutional duty 


whittled down. This potential danger, and consequences, of evisceration of 


the   role   of   the   State   was   anticipated   by   the   farmers   of   our   Constitution. 


That is the reason why, the Preamble specifically articulates that ensuring

promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively 


as   it   may   a   social   order   in   which   justice,   social,   economic   and   political,

of a promise made in the Preamble, to all the people of our country, and in 


particular those who were socially disadvantaged, and who continue to be 


disadvantaged, that justice shall inform all institutions of our national life. 


What does <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_261">Article 38</a> mean, when it talks about "institutions informing our

engineering, scientific, managerial and legal fields, are to be recognized as 


being vital to the national well being, and determine the character of life, 


and   social   order   throughout   the   nation.     Each   and   every   particular 


educational   institution   is   a   part   of   a   large   scale   national   endeavour   to 


educate   our   youngsters.   The   word   "institution"   is   capable   of   many 


meanings. It could be used in a narrow sense; however, it is also used, for 


instance,   to   refer   to   a   broad   class   of   fields   of   human   and   organizational 


endeavours: we talk about press and the media as an institution, we talk 


about legislative field as an institution, we talk about the executive as an 


institution,  and  indeed   we  talk  about  the  judiciary,   and  the organizations 


engaged in the act of dispensing justice, collectively as an institution. We 


talk   about   universities,   and   seats   of   higher   learning,   collectively   as   an 


institution.   At   this   level   of   generality,   certainly   the   entire   field   of   "higher 


education" is to be conceived as an institution informing our national life. 


The educated youngsters coming out of the portals of our each individual 


college enter into jobs that may require different degrees of discretionary 


judgment, which in turn may also affect the lives of other people, including 


those   in   socially   and   educationally   disadvantaged   groups.     Consequently, 


we have to necessarily  hold that <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_262">Article 38</a> necessarily includes within its 


conception of "institutions informing our national life", all institutions that 


perform the role of imparting higher education.

to perpetuate the effects of such discrimination, then it would violate the 


principle of substantive equality. In the case of admissions to colleges, it is 


an acknowledged fact, in both TMA Pai, and in fact even by Bhandari J., in 


his opinion in Ashoka Kumar Thakur, that the test of merit, based on some 


qualifying examinations or a common entrance test, actually is particularly 


prone   to   rewarding   an   individual   who   has   had   access   to   better   schools, 


family lives,   social exposure and means   to coaching classes. This would 


mean   that   many   of   the   youngsters,   who   hail   from   disadvantaged

how   well   the   youngsters   learn   and   advance,   it   would   only   mean   that 


complete dependence on such tests which do not discriminate and grade, 


in terms of real merit relative to peers in similar circumstances, but on the 


basis   of   so   called   absolute   abilities,   we   would   end   up   selecting   more 


students   from   better   social   and   educational   backgrounds,   thereby 


foreclosing or substantially truncating the possibility of individuals in such 


disadvantaged groups from being able to gain access to a vital element of 


modern life that grants dignity to the individuals, and thereby to the group 


as a whole, both in this generation, and in future generations. In light of 


the specific command of <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_274">Article 38</a>, of infusing our institutions of national 


life with social justice, we hold that a proper construction of clause (2) of 


<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_275">Article   15</a>   would   in   fact   be   to   prohibit   a   complete   dependence   on   such 


context   (social   and   educational   backwardness)   insensitive   tests.   When 


viewed   against   this   perspective,   it   would   have   to   be   discerned   that 


reservations   based   on   social   and   educational   backwardness   would   in   fact 


promote   the   selection   of   those   who   are   truly   meritorious   amongst   each 


group, on account of their demonstrated ability to be in the higher rungs of 


achievement   within   comparable   situations   of   life's   circumstances   and

of America. Peer group norm referenced grading is extensively used there. 


The   idea   is   simple:   that   given   a   minimal   level   of   achievement   of 


competence,   grading   as   between   similarly   situated   and   provisioned 


individuals would reflect both true talents and also individual variations in 


behaviour such as hard work, diligence, the ability to overcome challenges

find,   as   a   matter   of   pure   genotype,   equal   levels   of   talent,   and   abilities,

other   divisions   such   as   religion   or   gender.   This   is   not  just   a   scientifically 


proven   fact,   notwithstanding   the   efforts   of   misguided   racist   and   junk 


science, but also a veritable ontological and ethical assumption. This would 


mean   that   unless   this   pool   is   expanded,   to   identify   and   provide 


opportunities for the best performers across all those groups, we would not 


have exploited our human resources as well as we could. This would in turn 


mean that the economic gains that were possible if the imperfections in the 


supply   side   of   the   labor   market   had   been   overcome,   have   been   lost   on 


account   of   such   imperfections,   and   also   would   continue   to   be   lost   in   the 


future.42

benefited from reservations have not participated, and that such students 


in the future will not participate, in innovative contexts. No empirical data, 


which   has   been   systematically   collected,   and   is   free   of   implicit   cognitive 


biases against reservations,  to the best of our knowledge, has ever been 


placed before any court of law. To the contrary, proponents of reservations 


point out to  the fact  that certain  regions   of the  country,  which  have had 


reservations for nearly hundred years, in fact have witnessed an explosion 


of private unaided colleges in technical &amp; engineering, and scientific fields, 


and also arguably are the regions in which high tech industry is flourishing. 


The   argument   that   academic   standards   in   our   institutions   of   higher 


education need to be high may be valid; nevertheless, we would also need 


to   be   careful   in   assessing   whether   any   decline   in   standards,   if   any,   has 


been on account of students in reserved categories entering institutions of 


higher   education,   or   on   account   much   wider   systemic   weaknesses   in   the 


field of higher education, including the way our universities are managed, 


and the levels of research conducted or not conducted. Without separating 


such causal factors, it would be constitutionally impermissible, and indeed 


unethical to lay the blame for any loss of academic standards on students 


in reserved categories.

issue.  The  very  notion  of innovation   implicit  in such  arguments  reveals  a 


fundamental   flaw.   Innovation   occurs   across   diverse   fields,   in   diverse 


contexts, and with respect to diverse social needs. Two aspects need to be 


recognized   in   this.   There   is   a   fundamental   distinction   between   invention 


and   innovation.   An   invention   is   a   new   technical   solution   to   a   specific 


technical problem. Joseph Schumpeter43 distinguishes this from innovation, 


which   implies   productisation   of   that   technical   solution,   in   the   form   that 


actually   meets   the   needs   of   customers   or   consumers,   located   across 


various regions, with varying degrees of specificity. In order to be able to 


innovate, there is a need to ensure that the innovation process is informed 


about the social needs, circumstances, and cultural factors that could affect 


the effectiveness of the innovation in the field. Within the universal class of 


innovations one would also find need to innovate in a manner that meets 


the   requirements   that   are   specific   to   geographic   area,   particular   social 


group   or   even   according   to   the   level   of   prior   technological   adaptation   in 


particular   facet   of   social   or   economic   life   of   a   community.   Some 


technological inventions, say general technologies, may not need much of 


user inputs,  and a one size fits all  solution may be fine for most  people. 


However, some innovations may need to be highly specific, and tailored to 


specific   circumstances.   Another   layer   of   complexity   could   be   visualized: 


innovation,   particularly   when   it   is   based   on   specific   information,   that   is 


more likely to be gained through long years of exposure to specific crafts,

problems, social patterns etc. Such information tends to be "sticky" - i.e., 


it   is   not   easily   specifiable   and   transferable,   is   specific   to   people   who 


actually have had the relevant exposure, and may need to be addressed at 


the   location   of   the   problem.   Further,   it   would   also   mean   that   unless   the 


putative  innovator  actually  knows  what the problems   are, in a region,  or 


specifically   to   a   community,   he   or   she   would   not   even   know   that   the 


problem really exists to begin the process of adapting technical inventions 


to solve those particular problems. In as much as the innovator does not 


belong   to   such   communities,   even   if   they   are   broadly   aware   of   the 


problem,   they   may   not   have   sufficient   "sticky"   knowledge   about   it   to 


innovate an appropriate product or service or solution to effectively solve 


such problems. (See: Eric von Hippel, Democratizing Innovation44)

be required at the lower levels of social strata in India. One may need to 


apply technology for a particular localized problem, say in remote villages, 


such   as   a   network   or   a   web   interface   that   allows   women   to   pictorially 


navigate   certain   sites   to   find   out   the   best   prices   for   their   produce.   To

language  of  the  end  user,  as  well   as   the particular   culture,  and  levels  of 


cultural   identification   of   the   end   users.   Additional   factors   may   also   be

broad   exposure   to  emerging   or   new   technologies,   as   well   as   the  level  of

entered collegiate level courses, based on reservations, may be more adept 


at   adapting  existing  technical   solutions   to  particular   problems   because  of 


their background. Most certainly one could conceive of situations in which 


such youngsters by virtue of their social backgrounds may be the only ones 


who would have the knowledge that a problem exists, or the cultural and

Increasingly,   with   technological   advances,   the   choices   made   by   societies

technology is discarded, which technology is promoted and the costs, both

conclude   that   they   may   in   fact   be   more   meritorious   and   deserving   of 


access to higher education. It would be unjust to keep denying their claims

and   caste   like   structures   in   even   other   religious   groups,   apart   from 


endogamy, lack of relative vertical and occupational mobility, has been the 


normative   assumption   that   only   some   amongst   us,   belonging   to   certain 


social groups, deserve to study and gain the knowledge that truly provides 


ability   to   critically   evaluate   and   attempt   to   change   their   world.   Caste 


system   may   have   been   many   things,   but   it   was   also   about   systematic 


exclusion from portals of knowledge. To allow that to happen again, now, 


in the garb of a right of the educator to choose his/her own students, and a 


formal   pretense   of   non-discrimination   while   turning   a   blind   eye   to   the

of   impact   of   clause   (5)   of   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_287">Article   15</a>   with   respect   to   the   basic   structure 


would also have to accept the views expressed by this court in TMA Pai to 


be given and deemed to be immutable, as if carved in stone.




</p><p id="p_305">129. In the first place, we note that in neither of the two judgments, were 


features   of   the   protections   afforded   to   private   unaided   educational 


institutions   evaluated  in  terms  of  the  basic   structure   doctrine.  Except  for 


two references, in two paragraphs in a judgment spanning 450 paragraphs 


in total, TMA Pai does not speak of the basic structure doctrine at all. In 


paragraph 8, the said expression is mentioned, but it is a recitation of the 


submissions  made  by  one  of the litigants  in the  case.  This  shows  that  in 


fact the basic structure doctrine was argued by opponents of reservations 


as   one   of   the   grounds   to   deem   reservations   to   be   unconstitutional.   The 


Court obviously did not proceed on that ground. Instead, it chose to do so 


only   on   the   grounds   of   the   contents   of   sub-clause   (g)   of   clause   (1)   of 


<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_288">Article 19.</a> In terms of M. Nagaraj's ratio, what we have is a finding of this 


court in TMA Pai that freedoms of private unaided educational institutions 


under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_289">Article 19</a> extends to the concept of 


being free from  imposition  of reservations,  but not  an analysis  or  finding

about   the   status   of   that   specific   freedom,   i.e.,   freedom   to   be   free   from 


reservations, within the freedom code itself, much less an analysis of how 


that freedom to be free from reservations relates to the equality code, and 


constitutional identity in terms of its institutions of governance. Indeed, we 


do   not   even   find   that   this   Court   has   engaged   in     an   analysis   of   the 


relationship of that right to be free from reservations in light of the powers 


granted   to   the   State,   under   sub-clause   (ii)   of   clause   (6)   of   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_290">Article   19</a>   to

unaided institutions came about collaterally, and were not the main issue

</p><p id="p_309">130. In   light   of   the   above,   we   are   unimpressed   by   the   arguments   that 


TMA Pai, as explained by P.A. Inamdar also provide the appropriate content 


for   undertaking   an   "essences   of   rights   test"   i.e.,   an   "over-arching 


principles"   test,   as   enunciated   by   M.   Nagaraj,   to   assess   whether   a 


Constitutional   amendment,   such   as   the   93rd  Constitutional   Amendment, 


violates the Basic Structure. Indeed we are acutely aware that TMA Pai, is 


an eleven judge bench judgment,  and P.A. Inamdar to be a seven judge 


bench judgment. However, the very eloquent silence of the two benches as 


to whether the contents they have read into sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of 


<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_295">Article 19</a> to constitute a basic feature of the Constitution, is itself a clear 


indication   that   this   Court,   in   those   judgments   was   not   engaging   in   that 


type of analysis. This Court, through another constitutional bench, Islamic 


Academy, had also exhaustively examined the ratio in TMA Pai, and there 


is not even a whisper therein that there is any indication in TMA Pai, that 


the   right   of   private   unaided   educational   institutions   to   be   free   from 


reservations   would   constitute   a   right   of   such   magnitude   that   its   partial 


truncation   would   abrogate   the   basic   structure   of   our   Constitution   and 


change its very identity. What TMA Pai did was essentially to engage in a 


"reasonableness   standard"   test   based   on   the   text   of   <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_296">Article   19(1)(g).</a>

</p><p id="p_311">131. This  Court,  in  P.A. Inamdar,   warns   us  that  "certain   recitals,  certain 


observations and certain findings in" TMA Pai are "contradictory inter se...


....   There   are   several   questions   which   have   remained   unanswered....". 


Certainly,   the   issue   of   whether   the   State   can   impose   reservations,   on 


private   non-minority   unaided   educational   institutions,   pursuant   to   a 


Constitutional amendment, are not even raised in TMA Pai. Moreover, while 


some   aspects   of   the   contents   of   education   as   an   occupation   have   been 


noted, many other aspects have not been evaluated, especially in light of 


the goals of egalitarian social order, and ensuring of social justice, richness 


of   democratic   processes   and   attitudes   that   inform   them,   and   ultimately 


dignity of   vast swaths of humanity. Hence, to depend on the analysis in 


TMA   Pai,   with   regard   to   the   constitutional   status   of   the   contents   of   the 


rights of non-minority unaided educational institutions, in the context of a 


basic structure review would not only be inapposite, but also lead the Court 


down the wrong path.

unexamined aspects, including the contents of the very occupation that is 


guaranteed by sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_297">Article 19.</a> This is imperative 


because   a   test   of   a   constitutional   amendment   on   the   anvil   of   the   basic

principles   test"   is   an   entirely   different   exercise   from   a   mere 


"unreasonableness test" undertaken by this Court in TMA Pai.





</p><p id="p_314">133. This   Court,   in   TMA   Pai,   declared   the   establishment   of   educational 


institutions by citizens to be an "occupation" as comprehended in the text 


of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_298">Article 19.</a> In doing so, the Court cited 


approvingly,   and   extensively,   from   Corpus   Juris   Secondum.   In   particular, 


the word "occupation" is stated to be a very "comprehensive term, which 


includes   every   species   of   the   genus,   and   encompasses   the   incidental,   as 


well   as   the   main,   requirements   of   one's   vocation,   calling,   or   business." 


Consequently, it would necessarily mean that in describing "education" as 


an occupation, the Court, in TMA Pai, certainly meant that it needs to be 


comprehended   in   its   entirety,   even   if   for   the   specific   purposes   of   the 


questions it set out to answer in that particular case, the Court did not deal 


with all such incidental and other  requirements of the calling.





</p><p id="p_315">134. The   Court   also   cited   approvingly   the   observations   of   the   University 


Education Commission, headed by Dr. Radhakrishnan as its Chairman, and 


in   particular   the   following   is   very   important:   "Liberal   Education   -   All 


education is expected to be liberal. It should  free us from the shackles of 


ignorance, prejudice and unfounded belief. If we are incapable of achieving 


the good life, it is due to the faults in our inward being, to the darkness in

us.   The   process   of  education   is   the slow   conquering  of   this  darkness.   To 


lead  us  from  darkness   to  light,  to  free  us   from every  kind   of domination 


except   that   of   reason,   is   the   aim   of   education.(emphasis   supplied)"   This 


obviously implies that the darkness of ignorance, prejudice and unfounded 


belief,   wherever   it   may   be   found,   including   amongst   the   socially   and 


educationally  disadvantaged   classes,  and those  who have  been  subjected 


to   grossly   inhuman   deprivations   and   unjust   discriminations,   such   as 


Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes,   has   to   be   eliminated.   Not   just 


equality,  but   freedom  itself   would   lose   any  meaning   and   content,   if  such 


darkness were to pervade amongst large swaths of our people. Certainly, 


in   as   much   as   the   word   "occupation"   comprehends   within   itself   all 


incidental, as well as the main requirements of the vocation, we ought to 


reasonably   be   able   to   conclude   that   education   as   an   occupation   would 


certainly have to comprehend as one of its chief goals the tasks to which 


liberal   education,   in   so   far   that   all   education   is   liberal   education,   has   to 


necessarily serve.

also have to be taken into account to assess the nature of content of the 


rights granted to "educators" under sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of Article 


</p><p id="p_318">19.   Note   should   also   be   made   of   the   fact   that   the   Court   in   TMA   Pai   has

and in fact specifically notes that private educational institutions have been 


started   by   educationists,   philanthropists   etc.   This   was   so   because 


"[E]ducation is a recognized head of charity."
</p>
<p id="p_319">


</p><p id="p_320">136. A charitable activity, is also a philanthropic activity. Charity, the basis 


on which  the charitable activity  is  undertaken,  such  as  the setting up of, 


managing and operating educational institutions, is defined to include the 


following meanings: giving voluntarily to those in need, an institution or an 


organization for helping those in need, kindness &amp; benevolence, tolerance 


in   judging   others   and   love   of   one's   fellow   men.   In   a   similar   vein, 


philanthropy involves a love of mankind46. If one were to take a synoptic 


view of history of mankind, one would realize that educational institutions, 


as formal structures for learning, were invariably started by the State, or 


by citizens who had a great love for their fellow human beings. In societies 


which were homogenous, and not hierarchically ordered, this love extended 


to   all   its   members.   The   idea   was   that   equipping   as   many   youngsters   as 


possible with knowledge would strengthen the society, bring in the benefits 


of   enlightenment   that   darkness,   caused   by   ignorance,   prejudices   and 


unfounded   beliefs,   denies   to   the   individuals   as   well   as   the   society.   No 


philanthropist, with love for mankind, would want to educate a person who 


says that he or she wants to be enlightened only for personal benefit or for 


using   the   knowledge   gained   to   perpetuate   injustices   in   the   society   or

strengthen inequality. Of course TMA Pai, by declaring that reasonable fees 


has to be collected, to cover capital costs, day to day operations etc., has 


brought in an element of financial viability. However, one should not then 


view that TMA Pai would have intended, when it accepted that education as 


an   occupation   could   only   be   charitable   in   nature,   that   it   would   also   be 


devoid of intrinsic and essential qualities such as love for mankind as the 


motivating factors in starting educational institutions.


</p><p id="p_321">137. However,   in   hierarchical   societies,   marked   by   endemic   inequalities, 


and   where   hierarchy   had   ossified,   this   "love   of   mankind",   which   was   the 


primary,   and   inherent,   motive   of   education   as   a   charitable   or   a 


philanthropic occupation, was extended only to individuals who belonged to 


the   communities   to   which   such   philanthropists   belonged   to.   Time, 


knowledge, and philosophical constructs that inform our love for mankind 


change. Even societies in which race was used to impose horrific economic 


and   social   conditions   on   those   who   belonged   to   enslaved   races,   have 


changed. Great universities, such as Harvard which many decades ago did 


not admit students from formerly enslaved races, or women, or those with 


other disadvantages, have with the march of time recognized that the very 


notion of education as a philanthropic activity would lose its motive force, 


and the essentiality of its purpose, of imparting liberal education that leads 


people   from   darkness   to   light   and   that   is   inner   soul   would   be   derogated 


from   if   individuals   from  other   races,   or   women,   or   those   who  face   social

disadvantages   are   also   not   provided   access.   In   this   regard,   many 


universities have also come to the view that one of their essential purposes 


lies in providing higher education   to ensure that in every sphere of social 


action,   in   which   choices   are   made   that   impact   differentially   on   different 


segments   of   the   society,   there   be   diversity   of   representation   from   all 


segments   of   the   society.   This   is   recognized   as   necessary   to   enrich   and 


strengthen   democratic   processes,   by   bringing   diversity   of   views   and 


ensuring that debate occurs in a reasoned and reasonable manner, which 


in turn integrates the society and polity. Knowledge has expanded by leaps 


and bounds, and not all of it can be taught at the stage of secondary school 


education. The ability to engage with this expanding knowledge, to auto-


didactically keep pace with such expanding frontiers, is typically provided 


only at collegiate level.47  This implies that unless access is provided on a 


wide   scale,   across   all   swath   of   the   population,   the   debates   about   social, 


political,   economic   and   technological   choices   would   be   uninformed,   and 


therefore   also   likely   to   be   unreasoned   and   unreasonable,   thereby 


threatening  the  democratic  process  and social  integration  that is  vital for 


fraternity   and   unity   of   the   nation   threatened.   Noting   the   pernicious 


influence of marketplace throngs that seek to subordinate the higher status 


of   higher   education,   Frank   Newman,   Laura   Couturier   and   Jamie   Scurry

cannot be assessed purely on past performance, in exams or as revealed 


by   grades.   They   recognize   that   a   more   composite   manner   of   evaluation 


ought to be implemented. For these reasons, they look at not merely  the 


marks secured at the qualifying level, or aptitude tests. They also evaluate 


the desirability of admitting students on the basis of recommendations of 


their teachers, the statements of purposes written by prospective students, 


and   consider   many   other   factors   such   as   background   experiences.   For 


instance a demonstrated desire to undertake social service, or being part of 


activities that demonstrate an acknowledgement of social responsibility are 


also taken into account. There are three reasons why they do that.





</p><p id="p_324">139. One   is   that   grades   and   marks,   at   the   secondary   level   may   not 


necessarily indicate why a youngster has scored a certain level of marks or 


not, thereby not being a substantially accurate measure of ability to pursue 


studies   at   the   collegiate   level.   The   second   relates   to   expectations   of

universities   as   to   how   knowledge   gained   would   be   used   by   the   wider 


society   and   its   impact   on   society.   Those   multiple   other   means   provides 


them,   obviously   not   perfectly,   but   a   more   granulated   and   textured   view 


about the background of the youngster, the particular circumstances under 


which the youngster was expected to study, and yet achieved what he or 


she achieved.

</p><p id="p_326">140. The third is the recognition that knowledge is generated and applied 


in diverse social contexts. Consequently, from a pedagogic and educational 


perspective, it is felt  that having a diverse student body would enable the 


scholars   to   interact,   learn   about   the   diversities   in   life,   and   social   worlds, 


and   appreciate   the   diverse   points   of   views   and   needs.   This   obviously 


enhances   the   learning   environment   for   students,   and   is   viewed   as   an 


essential   component   of   the   environment   of   the   university   in   which   all 


students   from   diverse   backgrounds   would   study.   It   is   viewed   as   a 


necessary   component   of   the   "knowledge   inputs"   and   also   an   essential 


aspect of learning to be. We must recognize that many Indians, essentially 


from the upper crust, would not have had the opportunity to study in such 


universities,   which   are   centers   of   great   academic   excellence,   if   those 


universities, educationists, and their philanthropists who had financed such 


institutions   had   stuck   to   archaic   notions   of   inherent   inequality   amongst 


human   beings,   and  insisted   only   on  the  demonstrated   ability   to   get   high 


marks.   Our   students   were   selected   because   they   had   demonstrated   an

ability   to   excel   within   the   background   of   our   current   socio-economic 


circumstances, and their academic accomplishments may or may not have 


been equivalent to what youngsters in similar cohorts in those nations, and 


indeed all across the World, actually accomplished. It was also felt that it 


was   important   for   other   students   in   such   universities   to   interact   with 


Indians, learn about our ancient culture, our lives and our circumstances, 


and   view   the   knowledge   they   were   gleaning   from   text   books,   whether 


sciences,   social   sciences   or   humanities,   from   the   perspective   of   entire

generated in diverse circumstances, in the practical arenas that range from 


a  highly  technical  and clinical   laboratory,   to the humble  farmer, or  a hut 


dweller eking out a bare subsistence. It is an accumulated gift of humanity

truth.   We   were   a   horrifically   divided   society.   We   may   have   progressed   a 


bit. Yet we remain endemically unequal, as between groups. Caste, gender, 


and class  still are  the structural impediments  to the  realization of a truly 


egalitarian society. The inherited social, educational, cultural, political and 


economic   disadvantages   of   vast   swaths   of   humanity   in   our   country   are 


propagated   across   generations.   A   system   that   predominantly   results   in 


giving   access   to   only   certain   groups   would   necessarily   work   towards 


sustenance   of   those   inequalities.   This   will   have   an   immediate,   and 


necessarily,  a deleterious impact  on the quality of our social  and political 


discourse,   in   our   assessment   of   the   problems   that   our   society   confronts 


and which of those problems ought to be prioritized for social action. It will 


also hinder the development of abilities amongst students graduating from 


those   gated   institutions   of   higher   education   that   are   vital   to   be   able   to

Reservations,   for   socially   and   educationally   backward   classes   and 


Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, would ensure that students from

and   applied.   This   necessarily   relates   to   the   standards   and   purposes   for 


which higher education, including professional  education, is imparted. We 


certainly don't expect all of our students, who graduate from our colleges 


to go and join the "global society," whatever such a construct might mean. 


We obviously expect most or many of them to live and work in India. To 


not build the right scholastic environment, in which there is a diversity in 


the student body, reflecting the diversities of India, would be a fraud that 


our   educational   institutions   would   be   perpetrating.   Further,   if   one   posits 


that   national   barriers   are   breaking   down,   and   that   we   are   all   a   part   of 


some  amorphous  "global  village",   based on knowledge  economy,  to deny 


access to the best amongst various social groups in India, would be an act 


that destroys their prospects of living in such a global society. Either way, 


to   allow   that   to   happen   by   granting   access   to   higher   education   solely   or

backgrounds,   from   the   dehumanization   that   is   implicit   in   the   very 


acceptance of a hierarchical order of superior and inferior. One of the great 


dangers that a highly stratified society faces is that when the oppressed, 


trained to think that hierarchy, and the power to oppress are the natural 


order   on   account   of   the   culture   perpetrated   by   the   oppressors,   fight   for 


relief from oppression, that they currently face, the cry for liberation might 


then turn into a liberty and a right to oppress the previous oppressor. That 


process dehumanizes them too. The task of education, as a cultural action 


for freedom, is to promote the establishment of a truly humanized society.

         For the aforesaid reasons the impugned judgment of the Delhi High 


Court   is   set   aside.     Consequently,   the  respondents   are   directed   to   admit 


the Writ Petitioners into the First Year of MBBS Course in Army College of 


Medical Sciences, if the Writ Petitioners still so desire, for they have been 


deprived of their legitimate right of admission to the course, for no fault of 


theirs,   notwithstanding   the   rank   secured   by   them   in   the   CET.     It   is   true

that   they   have   appeared   at   the  common   entrance   examination   held   long 


ago     and   qualified   themselves   to   get   admitted   but   were   deprived   of   the 


same on account of the illegal admission policy of Army College of Medical 


Sciences permitted by the Government of Delhi.   In the circumstances, all 


the respondents are accordingly directed to ensure that the Writ Petitioners 


are admitted into the First Year MBBS Course in the ensuing academic year 


by   creating   supernumerary   seats.     However,   we   make   it   clear   that   the 


admissions  already  made  by Army College  of Medical  Sciences  are saved 


and shall not be affected in any manner whatsoever.
