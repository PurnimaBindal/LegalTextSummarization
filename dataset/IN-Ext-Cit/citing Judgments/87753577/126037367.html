</p>
<p id="p_3"> 1        Though the learned Advocate for the Petitioners has strenuously

 canvassed   his   grounds,   I   find   that   the   Petitioners   have   a   statutory

 remedy   of   approaching   the   State   by   filing   a   second   revision   under

 Section   257   of   the   Maharashtra   Land   Revenue   Code   in   view   of   the

 judgment   of   the   Honourable   Supreme   Court   in   the   matter   of

 <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing Nawoosing Panjwani vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a>,

 2016 (2) SCC 213.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
 2        In view of the above, this Writ Petition is disposed of with liberty

 to avail of the statutory remedy. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">
 3        If such revision is preferred within four weeks from today, the

 time spent by the Petitioner in this Court from 2.8.2018 till the passing

 of this order, would be considered as a ground for condonation of delay.
