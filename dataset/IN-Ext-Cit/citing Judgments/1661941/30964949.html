<p id="p_1">       By Hon&#x27;ble Dr.Chhabilendra Roul, Member (A):-

</p><p id="p_2">1.     Sh Sachin Sharma, Deputy Director in the Office

of Director General Patents, Designs, Trademarks &amp;

Registry, the applicant, has filed the present OA

challenging the Transfer and Reallocation of Work

order dated 19.12.2022 vide which the applicant was

transferred to Chennai Office of the organization with

reallocated work responsibilities.


</p><p id="p_3">2. The brief facts of the case are as follows:-

</p><p id="p_4">       The       present    applicant      joined   as     Assistant

Registrar, Trade Marks and Geographical Indications

(Group A Gazetted Service) on 28.10.2011 at the

Mumbai Office of the Directorate of Patents, Designs,

Trade Marks &amp; Registry. He was promoted as Deputy

Registrar, Trade Marks &amp; GI on 5.4.2018 and posted at

the Ahmedabad office of the Directorate. He joined at

Ahmedabad on 1.5.2018. He was transferred to the

Delhi Office on 11.11.2020, after nearly two and half

years      on      his    own   request.   On   19.12.2022           the

impugned transfer-cum-work reallocation was issued

by the Office of DG,Patents, Designs, Trade Marks &amp;

Registry.         In this order, the present applicant was

Court No.6 (item No.07)



shifted to Chennai Office in the Capacity of Deputy

Registrar, GIR, Chennai and was also designated Head

of Office , GI at Chennai. On 20.12.2022, the applicant

made a request representation to Respondent No.2 via

e-mail to postpone his transfer to 31stMarch , 2023 on

the ground that he has been transferred prematurely

(before the expiry of stipulated period of tenure),                  on

health grounds, death of a relative during pandemic,

and education of his children who are studying in

Schools (the eldest being in class 10) and for his

frequent visits to his home town Bareilly. He did not

get a favourable response from the Respodent-2. On

18.01.2023, the applicant made another representation

stating that his father expired on 09.1.2023. He also

mentioned that his children are                in class 10, 7 and 4

respectively         and   under       these   circumstances        his

transfer would create a lot of hardship to the family of

the applicant. On 23.01.2023, the applicant was

relieved from the Delhi Office, vide letter no. TMR/DEL

/ADMIN /Office             Order   /2022-23/ AD-952             Dated

come in the present OA challenging the impugned

order seeking the following relief:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      4</span>
</p><p id="p_5">                                                           OA No.458 of 2023
Court No.6 (item No.07)



       (I.)         To declare the impugned transfer order
                    dated 19.12.2022 as perverse, malafide
                    and without application of mind thus
                    contrary to the OM dated 09.01.2020.
       (II.)        To set aside the impugned transfer order
                    dated 19.12.2022 keeping in view the OM
                    dated 09.01.2020.
</p><p id="p_6">       (III.)       To pass any other appropriate orders or
                    directions as this Hon‟ble Tribunal feel fit
                    and proper in the facts of the present
                    case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3. On admission of the OA notices were issued to the

respondents and they have filed their counter affidavit

to which the applicant has also filed his additional

affidavit to the same.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4. On admission and issuance of notice to the

respondents, and hearing both the parties Interim

Relief was granted by this tribunal on 15.2.2023

stating that the respondents shall not give effect to the

impugned transfer order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5. The main grounds on which the applicant has

prayed the prayed relief             is that keeping in view the

facts and circumstances of the case, the transfer -cum-

reallocation         order   dated       19.12.2022   is         biased,

malafide and issued as punitive measure and hence it

is bad in law and action. The applicant in his OA and

his counsel during arguments have tendered the

following in support of their claim:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>
</p><p id="p_11">                                               OA No.458 of 2023
Court No.6 (item No.07)



</p><p id="p_12">       (i) The transfer order dated 19.12.2022 issuded by
       Respodent No.2 is contrary to the „mandated‟
       Transfer Policy of the Organisation issued on
       9.1.2020. The applicant has been transferred out
       after spending merely two years where as the
       stipulated tenure is 4 years for Deputy Registrars.
       As per clause 4.1of the said Transfer Policy, the
       normal station tenure shall be 5 years.

</p><p id="p_13">       (ii) The transfer order violates the provision of
       transfer policy (Clause 2.1), which states that the
       transfer of Group „A‟ and „B‟ officers shall be
       effected based upon the recommendations of the
       Placement committee . In the instant case, there
       was no recommendation of the Placement
       Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       (iii) The transfer -cum-reallocation order is in
       effect transferring the applicant to a non-existent
       post in Chennai. The post in Chennai was held by
       an officer of Assistant Registrar Rank and the
       incumbent there was holding charge of both
       Trademarks as well as GI . By splitting the Trade
       mark and GI work responsibilities into two
       separate Trade Mark and GI Offices ( Two officers
       have been designated as Head of Office of the
       respective divisions), the RespodentNo.2 has
       virtually transferred the applicant to a non-
       existent position.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       (iv) The transfer and reallocation has been effected
       selectively. The applicant is the only official who
       has been relocated from the present place of
       posting. The other officials mentioned in the
       transfer order have been retained in their
       respective work stations.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       (v) The transfer-cum-reallocation order has been
       issued in a particular manner in respect of the
       applicant as a punitive measure because he did
       not comply with the illegal orders of Respondent
       no.2 in respect of a Qausi-judicial matter
       pertaining to one Mr. Upesh Kumar. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        6</span>
                                                       OA No.458 of 2023
Court No.6 (item No.07)



       applicant has mentioned meetings, WhatsApp
       messages     and    e-mail    (27.10.2022   and
       subsequently on 9.11.2022, 15.11.2022 4.11.22
       and 18.11.2022 ), regarding alleged pressure by
       Respondent No.2 in respect of the case of Upesh
       Kumar. (He has not produced the copies of such
       e-mails, notice/ proceedings of   the meeting or
       emails).
</p>
<p id="p_17">       (vi) The Respondent No.2 has not considered the
       genuine hardship and difficulties of the applicant
       and his family (education of his children, the
       unfortunate death of applicant‟s father, poor
       health of the applicant) while not considering his
       request to cancel the transfer order.

</p><p id="p_18">6. The counsel for the applicant argued that the

transfer order is bad in law as it violated the mandated

provision of the Transfer Policy dt 9.1.2020. The

second ground averred by him is that the transfer

order smacks of bias, malafide, and punitive which is

contrary         to       the    reasonable   expectations     of     a

government employee from a model employer like

government of India. To buttress his arguments he

cited the Doctrines of Reasonable Expectations vs

Public Interest expounded by the Apex Court                   in the

case of <a href="/doc/125080125/" id="a_1">Food Corporation of India v. M/s Kamdhenu

Cattle          Feed            Industries    CIVIL   APPELLATE

JURISDICTION</a>: Civil Appeal No. 4731 of 1992, where it

was held that :

Court No.6 (item No.07)



       &quot;8. The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation
       of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself
       be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to
       consider and give due weight to it may render the
       decision arbitrary, and this is how the
       requirement of due consideration of a legitimate
       expectation forms part of the principle of
       non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the
       rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a
       relevant factor requiring due consideration in a
       fair decision-making process.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_21">       .......
</p>
<p id="p_22">       &quot;9. In Council of Civil Service Unions v.
       Minister for the Civil Service [1985 AC 374 :
       (1984) 3 All ER 935 (HL)] the House of Lords
       indicated the extent to which the legitimate
       expectation     interfaces    with     exercise    of
       discretionary power. The impugned action was
       upheld as reasonable, made on due consideration
       of all relevant factors including the legitimate
       expectation of the applicant, wherein the
       considerations of national security were found to
       outweigh that which otherwise would have been
       the reasonable expectation of the applicant. Lord
       Scarman pointed out that &quot;the controlling factor
       in determining whether the exercise of prerogative
       power is subject to judicial review is not its source
       but its subject­matter&quot;. Again in Preston, in re
       [1985 AC 835 : (1985) 2 All ER 327] it was stated
       by Lord Scarman that &quot;the principle of fairness
       has an important place in the law of judicial
       review&quot; and &quot;unfairness in the purported exercise
       of a power can be such that it is an abuse or
       excess of power&quot;. These decisions of the House of
       Lords give a similar indication of the significance
       of the doctrine of legitimate expectation. Shri A.K.
       Sen referred to <a href="/doc/906879/" id="a_2">Shanti Vijay and Co. v. Princess
       Fatima Fouzia</a> [(1979) 4 SCC 602 : (1980) 1 SCR
       459] which      holds that court should interfere

Court No.6 (item No.07)



       where discretionary power is                not      exercised
       reasonably and in good faith.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_23">

The counsel for the applicant averred that the facts and

circumstances mentioned in the OA                  point out the

arbitrariness, malafide and biasedness on the part of

Respodent no.2 in passing the impugned order.                       The

transfer to place having no position, mid-tenure

transfer, transfer as a punitive action for not obeying

illegal pressure, violation of transfer Policy in not

holding meeting of Placement Committee , etc point to

biasedness, malafide on the part of Respondent no.2.

The personal hardships (children‟s education and

family tragedy and poor health of applicant ) were also

brushed aside. All these point to failure of the tests of

reasonable expectations from a model employer like

Government of India.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">7. The counsel for the applicant further cited the

judgments of the Apex Court in Civil               Appeal arising

out of WP No 1137 of 2018 in <a href="/doc/60630796/" id="a_3">Mrs X vs Registrar

General, High</a> Court of Madhya Pradesh &amp;Anr decided

on 10.2.2022.             This judgment has also reiterate the

principle of drawing balance between the Doctrines of

Court No.6 (item No.07)



Interest as it was discussed in the Food Corporation

(supra) case. It was held that the petitioner had

legitimate expectation in view of the provisions of the

relevant Transfer Policy. Secondly, the Apex court in

this judgment has drawn attention to the judgment of

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1261492/" id="a_4">Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthyi

and Ors vs Sate of U.P. and Ors</a> wherein                     it was

discussed the onus to prove unbiasedness on the part

of the state when reasonable facts and circumstances

points to a               preponderance of presence of bias in

transfer orders. The counsel for the applicant draws to

the facts and circumstances in case of the applicant

and stated that in analogy of the judgment of the Apex

court in Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi ( supra) case, it

is up to the respondents to nullify the allegations of

baisedness in the passing of the impugned transfer

order. The respondents, he argued, have failed to do so.


</p><p id="p_26">8. The counsel for the respondents drew attention of

the Tribunal to substantiated facts and circumstances

of the case as mentioned in the counter affidavit by the

respondents               and   rebutted   the   allegations       of

baisedness, malafide and violation of any statutory

provision in issuance of the transfer-cum-reallocation

Court No.6 (item No.07)



of work order dated 19.12.2022 (impugned order). He

based his arguments on the following:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i) That transfer is ordinarily an incident of service
       and the Tribunals and Courts should not interfere
       with such transfers. There are several judgments‟
       by the Apex Court and the High Court‟s upholding
       the prerogative of the Government (the employer)
       to transfer an employee in public interest. The
       impugned transfer order has specifically mentions
       that it is a reallocation of work responsibilities
       and in respect of the applicant it has specifically
       mentioned that &quot; * Shri Sachin Sharma, Deputy
       Registrar of TM&amp; GI is hereby transferred to GIR ,
       Chennai in public interest with immediate effect.&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii) The allegations of malafide and bisedness
       have been invented by the applicant much after
       the transfer dated 19.12.2022. In his initial e-mail
       representation, the applicant has not taken any of
       these stands as taken in the OA and argued by
       the counsel for the applicant during arguments.
       These are after thoughts by the applicant.
       Initially, the applicant accepted the transfer order
       without any objection that he was transferred to a
       non-existent position at Chennai , nor he alleged
       the absence of the recommendations of the
       Establishment committee , nor premature
       transfer before expiry of 5 years tenure at Delhi.</blockquote><p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">       He only requested for stay of the transfer till
       March 2023 on account of the ongoing academic
       session of his school going children and his poor
       health. In the subsequent representation, he
       requested the cancellation of the transfer order in
       view of the family circumstances on account of
       death of his father. In both these representations,
       he never alleged any bias, malafide, non-existent
       post etc. which have been invented as an
       afterthought to perpetuate his stay at Delhi. At
       each stage of representations, pleadings in the OA
       etc the applicant is inventing new grounds to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    11</span>

Court No.6 (item No.07)



            allege bisedness and malafide on the parts of the
            respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_29">            (iii) The counsel for the applicant refuted the
            allegation that the applicant was transferred to a
            non-existent post. He cited several instances in
            the past when the officers in the rank of deputy
            registrar have been posted at Chenai (Documents
            III, IV &amp;V produced at the time of argument and
            part of file). Similarly, the allegation that there is
            no post of Deputy Registrar GIR at Chenai is
            counter to the organizational structure of the
            Organization (Documents-I &amp;II produced at the
            time of argument and part of file.)

</p><p id="p_30">            (iii) The transfer policy is only a guideline and it
            has several clauses allowing the competent
            authority to transfer the employees before tenure,
            without recommendations of the Establishment
            committee and reallocated place /station

            and serving the greater purpose of managing the
            affairs of the responsibilities assigned to the

            absence      of   the   recommendation      of   the
            Establishment committee, the transfer before
            tenure or during the mid-session of academic year
            of school going children should not constitute
            biasedness, malafide nor it should constitute

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       &quot;Transfer of a Government servant appointed to a
       particular cadre of transferable posts from one
       place to the other is an incident of service. No
       Government servant or employee of Public
       Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at
       any particular place. Transfer from one place to
       other is generally a condition of service and the
       employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer
       from one place to other is necessary in public
       interest     and    efficiency   in     the    Public
       administration. Whenever, a public servant is
       transferred he must comply with the order but if
       there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on
       transfer it is open to him to make representation
       to the competent authority for stay, modification
       or cancellation of the transfer order. If the order of
       transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
       concerned public servant must carry out the
       order of transfer. In the absence of any stay of the
       transfer order a public servant has no
       justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
       merely on the ground of having made a
       representation, or on the ground of his difficulty
       in moving from one place to the other. If he fails
       to proceed on transfer in compliance to the
       transfer order, he would expose himself to
       disciplinary action under the relevant Rules, as
       has happened in the instant case. The respondent
       lost his serv- ice as he refused to comply with the
       order of his transfer from one place to the other.&quot;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 &quot;:6. An order of transfer is an incident of
                Government Service. Fundamental Rule 11
                says that &quot;the whole time of a Government
                servant is at the disposal of the Government
                which pays him and he may be employed in
                any manner required by proper authority&quot;.
                Fundamental Rule 15 says that &quot;the
                President may transfer a government servant
                from one post to another&quot;. That the
                respondent is liable to transfer anywhere in

                                               OA No.458 of 2023
Court No.6 (item No.07)



       was not justified in interfering with the impugned
       orders of transfer. It is by now well-settled and
       often reiterated by this Court that no Government
       servant or employee of public Undertaking has
       any legal right to be posted forever at any one
       particular place since transfer of a particular
       employee appointed to the class or category of
       transferable posts from one place to other is not
       only an incident, but a condition of service,
       necessary too in public interest and efficiency in
       the public administration. Unless an order of
       transfer is shown to be an outcome of malafide
       exercise of power or stated to be in violation of
       statutory provisions prohibiting any such
       transfer, the Courts or the Tribunals cannot
       interfere with such orders as a matter of routine,
       as though they are the Appellate Authorities
       substituting their own decision for that of the
       Management, as against such orders passed in
       the interest of administrative exigencies of the
       service    concerned.      On    the    facts   and
       circumstances of the cases before us, we are also
       unable to agree with the learned counsel for the
       respondents that Rule 4.1.1 of the Seniority Rules
       interdicts any transfer of the employees from one
       Office or Project or Unit to any one of the other as
       long as the seniority of such an employee is
       protected based on the length of service with
       reference to the date of promotion or appointment
       to the grade concerned irrespective of the date of
       transfer. We also consider it to be a mere
       submission in vain, the one urged on the basis of
       alleged adverse consequences detrimental to their
       seniority resulting from such transfer. In the facts
       of the present cases, at any rate, no such result is
       bound to occur since the project undertaken to
       which the respondents have been transferred is
       itself a new one and, therefore, we see no rhyme
       or reason in the alleged grievance.&quot;

       &quot;Even administrative guidelines for regulating
       transfers or containing transfer policies at best
       may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
       concerned to approach their higher authorities for
       redress but cannot have the consequence of
       depriving or denying the competent authority to
       transfer a particular officer/servant to any place
       in public interest and as is found necessitated by
       exigencies of service as long as the official status
       is not affected adversely and there is no infraction
       of any career prospects such as seniority, scale of
       pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
       often reiterated that the order of transfer made
       even in transgression of administrative guidelines
       cannot also be interfered with, as they do not
       confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as

       &quot;A challenge to an order of transfer should
       normally be eschewed and should not be
       countenanced by the Courts or Tribunals as
       though they are Appellate Authorities over such

       administrative needs and requirements of the
       situation concerned. This is for the reason that
       Courts or Tribunals cannot substitute their own
       decisions in the matter of transfer for that of
       competent authorities of the State and even
       allegations of mala fides when made must be such
       as to inspire confidence in the Court or are based

       reasons, no interference could ordinarily be made
       with an order of transfer.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_46">14. In view of the facts and circumstances of the

instant case and the case laws cited by the counsel for

the respondents, the counsel for the respondents

argued that there is no a priori reasonable ground to

hold the presumption that the impugned order dated

19.12.2022 suffers from malafide and biasedness.

Hence, it was bounden duty of the applicant to prove

the allegation of biasedness and malafide. The burden

cannot be shifted to Government of India that it‟s

action is devoid of any biasedness and malafide. The

party alleging such biasedness should adduce evidence

and       produce         documents   to   bring     resanable

presumption of malafide and baisedness. The applicant

has failed to produce the documents based on which

he alleges that Respondent No.2 excreted pressure

relating one quasi-judicial matter and because of his

non-compliance, he has been victimized.


Secondly, the counsel for the respondents, citing the

aforementioned judgments averred that the transfer

policy is mere guidelines and these is ample scope for

the government to transfer the employee suspending

any other clause of such guidelines for administrative

exigencies. The public interest weighs heavily against

the relative discomfort of individual employee in

relocation to a new place of posting.


</p><p id="p_47">15.            I have gone through the records of case

thoroughly and heard the arguments by the both

counsels carefully. The assertion by the applicant and

averment by his counsel regarding the biasedness,

malafide on the part of Respondents is not borne out

from the facts and circumstances of the case. The

transfer order dated 19.12.2022 has not singled out

the      applicant. The reallocation -cum- transfer order

involves five more officials. The allegation of non-

existent post of Deputy Director at Chennai office is not

sustainable in view of the documentary evidence

produced          by      the   counsel   for     the   Respondents

(Additional         documents-III,IV &amp;          V).   Because     it is

transfer prior to 5 years tenure and because the

applicant‟s children are in Schools and the applicant

has health and family issues, the transfer order cannot

be considered as biased and based on malafide

intentions. I agree with the contention of the counsel

for the respondents that the allegation regarding

punitive        action      based   on    vendetta      because      the

applicant did not comply with the alleged illegal

pressure in respect of one quasi-judicial case is not

substantiated by documentary evidence. It is easier to

allege such pressure in organizations dealing with

quasi-judicial matters.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">16. The argument by the counsel for the applicant

that the present transfer case fails the Doctrine of

Reasonable Expectations by an employee from the

model employer i.e. the Government of India falls flat.

On the other hand, the Government as custodian of

Public interest has also reasonable expectations from

its civil servants. A group &quot;A‟ officer is supposed to

serve anywhere in the country. That is the basic service

condition        for      such    officers.      Moreover,        it    is   the

prerogative of the employer to transfer his employee at

any point of time and to any work station based on

administrative exigencies.                   The transfer policies are

framed        keeping        in   view       effective    deployment          of

manpower            for     the    purpose        of     discharging         the

responsibilities of the organization in service public

affairs. It is part of the Human Resources Management

policy      of     the      Government           to     provide          better

opportunities             to officers        for excellence       and more

planned          approach         to    cadre         planning.        Effective

Utilization of service of an employee is in the very core

of administrative exigency. The public interest is more

or equally important as the reasonable expectations of

the employee being treated fairly and impartially in

respect        of     personal      hardships       and    difficulties.

Somewhere, public interest weighs above the personal

comfort of the employees. Referring to Shilpi Bose case

(supra) and <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_7">Gujarat Electricity Board v. Atmaram

Sungomal Poshani</a>, 1989 (2) SLR 684 (SC), The Delhi

administrative action is of course permissible, but

orders of transfer are interfered when:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                &quot;(a) the transfer is malafide or arbitrary or

would have submitted representation regarding his

personal difficulties. Instead of             joining at the place of

posting, i.e., Chennai, he presented one alibi by

another to perpetuate his stay at Delhi. When he was

transferred after two years from Ahmedabad to Delhi

he     willingly          accepted.     When,      for   administrative

exigency , he was prematurely transferred to Chennai ,

he protests. The system should not work only for the

comfort        and        advantage     of   the    employee      at    the

detriment of public interest. Reasonable expectation of

the government from government servant regarding

public service to the general public, and governance

efficiency        cannot      be      sacrificed    at   the   altar      of

convenience of balance for the employee only.

Tribunal regarding the allegations of bias, malafide and

vindictiveness. Nevertheless, the applicant has already

availed interim relief from this Tribunal in the form of

the order which directs the respondents not to enforce

the transfer order till further orders.                   This is now

month of March and almost the end of academic

session. Hence, the major personal difficulty of the

shall not be relocated to Chennai till 31.3.2023. This

was the request the applicant made to the respondents

in his first representation after the issuance of transfer

order dated 19.12.2022. As regards, the reallocation of

the work responsibilities and splitting of the position of

Deputy Director, Trade Mark and GIR to two positions

regarding Trademark and GIR , it is my view that it is

the prerogative           of the administrative Department to

do so in best interest of the organization and the public

interest. It is up to the Respondent No.1, i.e.,

Secretary, DIIP to look into the matter and take

appropriate action, if any warranted.
