<p id="p_1">By Dr. Veena Chhotray, Member (A):
</p>

<p id="p_2">	While considering the C.P. No.441/2010 and after hearing both the learned counsels, to meet the ends of justice, it was decided to dispose of both the OA 1556/2010 and the CP No.441/2010.  On behalf of the applicant the learned counsel, Shri R.K. Shukla and for the respondents, the learned counsel, Shri R.L. Dhawan would appear before us.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	The applicant, a Senior Section Engineer under the Railways is challenging his transfer from Kurukshetra to Jind vide the order dated 22.3.2010.  This is the second round of litigation.  In the first round, the OA No.1094/2010 had been disposed  of in limini vide order dated 7.4.2010 directing the respondents to decide the applicants representation against the said transfer, before giving effect to the same, considering the OA as a supplementary representation.  A direction for passing a reasoned and speaking order and until that time not giving effect to the order of transfer had also been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	In pursuance of the aforesaid directions, the respondents have passed the impugned order dated 6.5.2010 in which after considering the representation by the applicant the order for the said transfer has still remained unchanged.  In the order it has been stated that the transfer has been done in view of several complaints having been received from the staff and also through Trade Unions highlighting human relation problems and rough behaviour on the part of the applicant with the staff.  It is further stated that despite counseling there had not been any improvement in his behaviour, the transfer in question is sought to have been ordered with a view to maintain peaceful industrial relations and staff satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	The OA has sought, by way of relief, setting aside the impugned order and a direction for retaining the applicant at his present place of posting till completion of three years tenure.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.	The learned counsel for the applicant, Shri R.K. Shukla  would pose the instant transfer to be absolutely arbitrary and unjustified and having been done wholly  at the instance of Staff Union and particularly group D staff.  It would be alleged that before the transfer, no opportunity had been given to the applicant to explain his case. Learned counsel would advert to the guidelines on the subject which stipulate a normal tenure of four years to the employees.  The averment of the said transfer disturbing the family life of the applicant having been affected in the course of the academic session is also made. The learned counsel would also draw our attention to the fact that the earlier order had in fact been modified and in place of another person the name of the applicant had been inserted.  Further the learned counsel would submit as admitted by the respondents in the impugned order, the transfer at this stage was premature.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.	On behalf of the respondents, the learned counsel Shri Dhawan would strongly oppose the rival contentions.  It would be submitted by the learned counsel that there had been a full compliance of the Tribunals directions in the earlier OA, on their part by passing a speaking and reasoned order.  It would be stated that after due consideration of the representation, the competent authority had  found it appropriate to maintain the decision to transfer the applicant in the interest of smooth industrial relations; thus it was an administrative decision on the part of the respondents.   The learned counsel would advert to the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_1">Gujarat Electricity Board  v. Atmaram Sungomal Poshani {SLJ</a> 1989 (3) SC 68} to contend that as per the law laid down by the Apex Court,  a transferred public servant could only make a representation to the competent authority and in the event of the same not being accepted, he/she is bound to carry out the order of transfer.
</p><p id="p_8">	The learned counsel would also make some factual submissions to apprise the Tribunal of the background of the entire case by showing documentary proofs attached along with the counter in the Contempt Petition.  It would be submitted that the transferred employee, Shri Dhingra had in fact been relieved by the concerned Engineer, Karnal on 7.5.2010.  It would further be stated that the letter/notice for the same had been sent to him through a special messenger, which the applicant  haddeclined to accept.  This was in the presence of three witnesses (Annexure R/1).  Our attention would further be drawn to a corroborative report from the concerned Divisional Officer dated 13.5.2008 about the refusal on the part of the applicant to accept the aforesaid notice.  It is stated in this report that consequently the Notice had been served by affixing the notice on the house of Shri Dingra again in the presence of the three witnesses.  Shri Dhawan would also submit that the applicants successor had already joined on 8.5.2010 (Annexure R/4).  However, as given through a written report by the concerned officer, despite his personally intimating the same to the applicant, the later closed the office and went away.  The same was also continued on the next several days.  As per the concerned officer, Shri Dingra was refusing to hand over the keys of the Office and also not giving the charge.  In the process the Office work was suffering (Annexure R/2).
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.	In the matter of transfer the view consistently taken by the Apex Court and the High Courts in a catena of judgments is that the scope of judicial intervention in such matters is extremely limited.  It is the settled law that where an appointment carries transfer liability; transfer is not only a necessary incidence of service inherent in the terms of appointment but also an essential condition of service.  The view taken is that judicial fora cannot act as appellate authorities and substitute their own judgment for those of the administrative authorities.  Emphasis has been regarding not to disturb the smooth running of the wheels of the administration.  Hence the consensus of law that has emerged is that in such judicial review Courts and Tribunals are to be  extremely reluctant to interfere unless there are very strong and compelling circumstances such as the transfer in question being found apparently arbitrary, malafide or by way of infraction of any professed norms.  
</p><p id="p_10"><a href="/doc/146531721/" id="a_2">In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Gobardhan Lal</a> {(2004) 11 SCC 402} , the Apex Court had also emphasized that as long as a transfer did not adversely affect the 	  transferred officials career prospects such as seniority, scale of pay and secured emoluments, transfer made even in transgression of administrative guidelines cannot be interfered with, as they do not confer any legally enforceable rights.  Again deprecating the tendency of disobedience of Government orders and emphasizing the need for curbing infructuous litigations, the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1238927/" id="a_3">S.C. Saxena V. Union of India</a> {(2006) 9 SCC 583} had held that even if a transferred employee wanted to make a representation or approach the Court for judicial relief, he/she must first report to the transferred place of posting.
</p><p id="p_11">	The dicta by the Apex Court in the decision relied upon by the Respondents in <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_4">Gujarat Electricity Board vs. Atmaram Sungomal Poshani {SLJ</a> 1989 (3) SC 68) is also extracted as here under:
</p>
<p id="p_12">Transfer from one place to other is generally a condition of service and the employee has no choice in the matter.  Transfer from one place to other is necessary in the public interest and efficiency in the public administration.  Whenever a public servant is transferred, he must comply with the order but if there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on transfer, it open to him to make representation to the competent authority for stay, modification or cancellation of the transfer order.  If the order of transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled, the concerned public servant must cry out the order of transfer.

</p><p id="p_13">6.	The facts of the present case reveal that the respondents have found the aforesaid transfer as necessary in administrative exigencies.  The conduct of the applicant in non-acceptance of the relieving order and creating obstructions in the normal functioning of the office, certainly do not project a favourable image of him  before the Tribunal.  We do not find any justification for our intervention in the present order.  Resultantly, the OA is dismissed.  We also do not find any case for contempt of our earlier order.  Hence the C.P. is closed as well and notices discharged.
