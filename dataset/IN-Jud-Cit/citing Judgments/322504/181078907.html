            being queried as to how many children he has, he
            initially said 6 and then 5. He is also unable to state as
            to whether his children are sons or daughters or name
            them. When asked as to who is his wife, he said that he
            has one wife and her name was initially stated to be
            `Pani&#x27; and thereafter he said `Madam&#x27;.
            4. Mrs. Uma Devi also joined the hearing online in the
            presence of the Court Commissioner. She was initially
            asked about the daily routine of the DMP. She is fully
            aware of the daily routine including the medicines
            being administered to him on a daily basis. She has
            informed the Court about the DMP&#x27;s daily routine. She
            states that the first time she noticed a change in the
            behaviour of the DMP was in May, 2018 when he was
            admitted in AIIMS. At that time, though he was broadly
            okay, he used to repeat his sentences. He is 81 plus and
            Dr. Kameshwar Prasad, Neurologist, AIIMS, was
            consulted at that time. Since then, there has been a
            change in behaviour. However, in December, 2020, he
            suffered an asthmatic attack and was again admitted in
            AIIMS. Subsequently, he was admitted to Apollo
            Hospital, developed pain on the right side and an
            angiography was conducted which revealed some
            blockages in the heart. Open-heart surgery was
            performed by Dr. Nanda. According to Mrs. Uma Devi,
            the DMP&#x27;s physical and mental condition improved
            substantially after the open-heart surgery and he
            started walking also. In July, 2020, however he
            contracted Covid and after his treatment of Covid, he
            seems to have lost a substantial part of his memory. In
            October, 2020 he again suffered an asthmatic attack.
            In February, 2021, his oxygen levels were dropping
            and he was accordingly admitted to Apollo hospital
            and after various tests were conducted, he was
            discharged. The medicines to be given to him were also
            confirmed by the doctors. Currently, he is comfortably
            staying at home.&quot;

and mental condition of the DMP:
       &quot;i. Dr. M.V.Padma, Professor &amp; HOD, Neurology, Chief -
       Neuroscience Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi. Email:
       vasanthapadma123@gmail.com (9810819167);

       &quot;11. In so far as the medical review/evaluation of the DMP is
       concerned, it is noted that the DMP is currently staying at his
       residence No. 4, Safdarjung Lane, New Delhi, with Ms. Uma
       Devi and Ms. Kanchana Rai along with the staff. A complete
       list of the medicines which are being currently administered to
       the DMP have been submitted to the Court which the Court is
       yet to peruse. The last independent medical evaluation of the
       DMP by a medical board was in 2019, as directed by the Ld.

       Division Bench in was in the Habeas Corpus petition being
       W.P. (Crl.) No. 2255/2019. It has been approximately two years
       since the said medical evaluation was conducted. Thereafter, as
       was recorded on the last date, the DMP has undergone an open
       heart surgery and has also suffered from Covid-19. The Court
       also has attempted to interact with him virtually, but he has
       hardly been coherent during the said interaction. Thus, this
       Court is of the opinion that an independent medical assessment
       is required to which Dr. Singhvi submits that the DMP is
       willing for a voluntary medical assessment/review by a medical
       board.
       12. Accordingly, a Medical Board is constituted with the
       following members:
              i.     Dr. M.V.Padma, Professor &amp; HOD, Neurology,
              Chief - Neuroscience Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi. Email:
              vasanthapadma123@gmail.com (9810819167);
              ii.    Dr. Achal Srivastava, Professor Department of
              Neurology,      AIIMS,       New      Delhi.     Email:
              achalsrivastava@hotmail.com (9811178784)
              iii. Dr. Nitish Naik, Professor, Department of
              Cardiology,      AIIMS,      New      Delhi.     Email:
              nitishnaik@yahoo.co.in (9810416170)
       The mandate of the Board, would be to conduct an overall
       assessment/review of the physical and the mental condition of
       the DMP. The Board would also make an assessment of all the
       medicines that are being currently administered to the DMP.
       The Board, may also request for all the past medical records of
       the DMP, which it may deem appropriate. Ms. Uma Devi and
       Ms. Kanchana Rai shall cooperate with the Board for enabling
       the evaluation and assessment. The board shall file a
       comprehensive report including their recommendations, by 5th
       July 2021. The report may be emailed to the Court Master at
       courtmaster@pmsingh.in.&quot;
8.     Owing to the financial status and the standing of the DMP as also the
fact that Ms. Satula Devi was living away from the DMP, this Court had
directed payment for a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- per month from the DMP&#x27;s

account to Ms. Satula Devi.      The Court, thereafter, interacted with the
Medical Board through the virtual platform on 23rd July, 2021.                   The
members of the Board explained the mental and physical condition of the
DMP as under:
            &quot;3. The medical board consisting of Dr. M.V. Padma
            Professor and HOD Neurology &amp; Chief
            Neurosciences Centre, Dr. Achal Srivastava
            Professor of Neurology and Dr. Nitish Naik
            Professor of Cardiology have joined the video
            conferencing proceedings today through a separate
            link. The Court has interacted with the doctors.

            4. Dr. M.V. Padma explained the nature of fronto-
            temporal dementia to the Court and as per her, this
            condition is worse than a condition of Alzheimer&#x27;s
            and would become worse over time. She stated that in
            2019 when the DMP was admitted in the AIIMS, as
            per the history recorded therein, the changes were
            noticed in DMP&#x27;s behavior since 2017 i.e., two years
            before he was admitted to AIIMS. He presently
            requires assistance in most activities including
            visiting the bathroom, etc. At that time, when the
            DMP was admitted in AIIMS, the MRI of the brain
            and the PET-SCAN of the brain was also conducted.
            According to her, the DMP is incapable of taking any
            major decisions and this was the position even in
            2019. According to her, the same was recorded in the
            discharge summary when the DMP was discharged
            from AIIMS.

            5. Dr. Achal Srivastava who is a Professor of
            Neurology at AIIMS, informed the Court that he had
            examined the DMP even in 2019. At that time, in
            2019 the DMP was capable of taking smaller
            decisions such as visiting bathroom etc, however,
            according to him even then, the DMP was incapable

            of taking any major decisions. He also states that in
            comparison with the condition of the DMP in 2019,
            the DMP&#x27;s condition has further deteriorated and he
            requires support for even all the basic activities much
            more than what it was in 2019.

            6. Dr. Nitin Naik who is Professor of cardiology has
            stated that the DMP had a history of chest pain and
            in March, 2020 he had undergone angiography. He is
            currently being given medical treatment in respect of
            his heart problem which is satisfactory.&quot;

This Court has been hearing the present matter finally since February, 2021
and on various occasions submissions have been made in respect of the
medical condition of the DMP. The concern expressed at that stage by the
ld. Senior Counsels for the parties was not to release the medical reports of
the DMP as the same may have an impact on the DMP&#x27;s stature and
standing as a Member of Parliament. On 12th August, 2021, certain
applications were filed, which were considered by the Court. Copies of the
medical reports have also been released to all the parties concerned.
Proceedings in this petition:
9.     The Sr. Counsels for the Petitioners and the supporting Respondents -
i.e., Mr. Vikas Singh, Mr. K.K. Rai and Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani, have
concluded their opening submissions. On behalf of the Respondents and the
intervenor senior counsels - Mr. Gopal Subramaniam and Mr. Sandeep
Sethi, have already made detailed submissions. On behalf of Respondent
No.5, submissions commenced on 9th August, 2021 and are yet to conclude,
owing to various reasons. Since February 2021, submissions by ld. Sr.
Counsels are continuing and yet to conclude.

the court was informed that an SLP has been filed in this matter being SLP
(Civil) Diary No(s). 18022/2021 titled <a href="/doc/88546423/" id="a_1">Uma Devi v. Satula Devi &amp; Ors</a>.,
which has been dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 1st
September, 2021. The order reads as under:
            &quot;Heard ld. senior counsel/learned counsel for the parties at
            great length.
               We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned
            order(s). The Special Leave Petitions are, accordingly,
            dismissed.
               Pending applications also stand disposed of.&quot;

11.    The matter was listed for arguments yesterday i.e., 7th September
2021, however, an adjournment was sought on behalf of Dr. A.M. Singhvi,
ld. Senior Counsel for Respondent No.5. Accordingly, the case was
adjourned for hearing on 10th September, 2021. In the meantime, the DMP
has been hospitalized, which has been brought to the notice of this Court
only this morning.
Moveable and immoveable assets of the DMP
12.    The DMP is the owner of substantial assets, both movable and
immovable. There are various bank accounts which have balances running
into crores of rupees. Currently, Respondent No.5 - Ms. Uma Devi is stated
to be the joint account holder in the bank accounts since November 2019.
13.    The issue of the management of the DMP&#x27;s assets was considered by
this Court on 4th June, 2021. Considering the submissions made on behalf of
Ms. Uma Devi and Ms. Kanchana Rai, status quo was directed in respect of
all movable and immovable assets. The relevant paragraphs of the order are
set out herein below:


W.P.(C) 1271/2020                                                   Page 8 of 17

            &quot;6. There are two accounts of the DMP, having
            substantial amounts, in which Ms. Uma Devi is stated
            to be a joint account holder and a co-signatory. On a
            query from the Court as to since when Mrs. Uma Devi
            is a joint account holder Mr. Abhinav Rao, ld. counsel
            has fairly submitted to the Court that she has been a
            joint account holder since November 2019. The Court
            notes that by November 2019, the DMP had already
            been detected with `fronto- temporal dementia&#x27;, in writ
            proceedings before the Ld. Division Bench of this
            Court being W.P.(CRL) 2255/<a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_2">2019 R.S. v. State &amp; Ors</a>
            as noted in the judgment dated 20th September, 2019.

            7. In this background, since the DMP&#x27;s assets
            (movable and immovable) are substantial and run into
            thousands of crores, without listing out the same, it is
            deemed appropriate to accept the voluntary statement
            made by Ms. Kanchana Rai and Ms. Uma Devi in reply
            to the application being CM 4396/2020 where it is
            stated as under:

              &quot;That, in view of the fact that the answering
              Respondent and the Respondent No.5 have
              voluntarily offered to maintain status-quo till the
              disposal of the present writ petition, the present
              Application seeking maintaining of status-quo of
              DMPs property has become infructuous.&quot;

            Thus, it is directed that status quo shall be maintained
            in respect of all moveable and immoveable assets of
            the DMP by both Mrs. Uma Devi and Ms. Kanchana
            Rai/her family.

              accounts. From the submissions made, it appears that
              Ms. Uma Devi and the Secretary of the DMP are
              operating his accounts or spending therefrom.
              Accordingly, the status quo, as volunteered above,
              shall apply to all the bank accounts of the DMP. If any
              amounts are withdrawn, spent or transferred from the
              accounts of the DMP for living needs and other
              expenses, a statement of such amounts and expenses
              incurred every month along with the bank statements
              of the bank accounts of the DMP shall be filed, for the
              perusal of the Court in a sealed cover. &quot;

bank statements for the period 1st July 2021 to 30th July 2021 reveal that
there are substantial amounts lying in the said accounts and there is
continuous in-flow of amounts to the DMP. This court is not aware of the
details of the parties making the deposits or the withdrawals.
</blockquote><p id="p_3">15.    Apart from the amounts lying in the bank accounts and in deposits
       which are more than Rs. 3000 crores, the DMP is the owner of

       companies in which the DMP is a substantial shareholder viz., -
