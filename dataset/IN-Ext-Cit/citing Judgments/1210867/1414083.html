I - JUDGMENT UNDER APPEAL

	The appellant is the sole accused in Sessions Case No.230 of 1999 on the
file of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track court No.I, Tirunelveli
District.  He questions the correctness of the judgment dated 11.04.2002
rendered in the above stated sessions case, whereunder the appellant was
convicted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">Sections 498-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">302</a> IPC and
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years with a fine of

to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> IPC.  The
appellant hereinafter is referred to as the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_2">II - CHARGE

</p><p id="p_3">	2. The charge against the appellant is that at    10.00 a.m. on
11.02.1998, he demanded his wife Radha to get Rs.50,000/- from her mother and
threatened that he  would live with her only if she brings money, or otherwise,
he would kill her, which is punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_7">Section 498-A</a> IPC and in the course
of the same transaction, at 12.00 noon on 11.02.1998, with an intention to
murder his wife, he poured kerosene on her body and set her on fire, causing her
death, which is punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_8">Section 302</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_4">III - CASE OF THE PROSECUTION
</p><p id="p_5">	3. The case of the prosecution, as discerned from the evidence of
prosecution witnesses, is as follows.
</p><p id="p_6">	3.1. The deceased Radha is the wife of the accused. P.W.1, Sulochana, is
the mother of the deceased.  P.W.2, Selvi, and P.W.5, Vijayalakshmi, are the
younger sisters of the deceased.  P.W.6, Ulagammal, and P.W.7, Sekar, are the
younger sister and brother of P.W.1.  P.W.8, Rajendran, is the husband of P.W.2.
On 11.2.1998 at 10.00 a.m., the deceased came to the house of P.W.1 to give dosa
flour.  The deceased was doleful.  P.W.1 questioned about her sadness.  The
deceased told her mother that the accused was demanding her to get Rs.50,000/-
from mother.  P.W.1 replied that she did not have money at present and asked her
to pray God, He would give.  The deceased went to her house.
	3.2. On the same day at 2.15 p.m. the accused came to the house of P.W.1
and informed that the deceased set herself on fire.  Immediately, P.Ws.1 and 2
went to the house of the deceased.  The deceased was lying down with full of
burn injuries and without any clothes.  When P.W.1 questioned the deceased as to
why she set fire on her, she replied that the accused alone did so.  P.Ws.1 and
2 took the deceased to the hospital in an auto at 2.15 p.m.

	3.3. P.W.3 Doctor Bakthavatchalam, Assistant Surgeon, on 11.2.1998 at 1.50
p.m. examined the deceased and found  100% burn injuries and as the pulse rate
and blood pressure of the deceased were not normal, he admitted her in F.S. Ward
and sent intimation to the police as well as to the Magistrate under Ex.P2.
	3.4. P.W.13, Judicial Magistrate, on receipt of intimation from P.W.3,
proceeded to the Palayamkottai Government Hospital and recorded the dying
declaration of the deceased.  Ex.P7 is the intimation received from the hospital

statement of the deceased.  P.W.1 also attested the statement of the deceased,
Ex.P1. P.W.15 sent wireless message to Sivanthipatti Police Station.  On the
same day at 6.15 p.m. the deceased died in the hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	3.6. On receipt of the death intimation at 7.00 p.m. on 11.2.1998 from

</p>
<p id="p_15">	3.9. P.W.19, Inspector of Police examined P.Ws.1, 2 and 5 to 11 and

</p>
<p id="p_16">	3.10. Thiru.Kumaresan, Inspector of Police, who succeeded P.W.19, on

the final report in the court against the accused under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_11">Sections 498-A</a> and
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">302</a> IPC.
</p><p id="p_17">	3.11. To prove its case, the prosecution examined 19 witnesses as P.Ws.1
to 19, marked exhibits P1 to 12 as well as M.Os.1 to 7.
</p><p id="p_18">IV - DEFENCE

</p><p id="p_19">	4. When the accused was questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_13">Section 313</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure about the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence
of prosecution witnesses, the accused denied them.  No oral or documentary
evidence was brought forth by the accused before the court.
</p>
<p id="p_20">V - JUDGMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT

</p><p id="p_21">	5. The trial court, on consideration of the oral and documentary evidence
placed before it, found the accused guilty and convicted and sentenced him as
referred to earlier. Hence, the above appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">VI - CONTENTIONS AND FINDINGS

	6.1. It is the admitted case of the prosecution and the appellant that the
deceased was originally married to one Ali and even though there was no divorce
between them, the deceased and the accused were living as husband and wife for
nearly six years.
</p>
<p id="p_23">	6.2. According to the prosecution, even one week prior to the date of
occurrence, namely 11.02.1998, as per the statement of the deceased, Ex.P1,
recorded by the police at 3.00 p.m. on 11.02.1998  and as per Dying Declaration
of the deceased, Ex.P8, recorded by the Judicial Magistrate between 2.45 p.m.
and 3.00 p.m. on 11.02.1998, there was a quarrel between the deceased and the
accused; the accused was demanding a sum of Rs.50,000/- from the parents of the
deceased; and the accused was beating and ill-treating the deceased for the
same.
</p>
<p id="p_24">	6.3. In the statement, Ex.P1, the deceased had stated that she married the
accused six years before; they had no issue; the accused was not in employment
for the past three years; the accused was harassing her and sold all her jewels;
the accused was demanding the deceased to get Rs.50,000/- from her mother,
otherwise threatened her that she could not live with him and he would do away
her; on the fateful day, viz., on 11.2.1998, she went to her mother's place for
giving dosa flour to her; on her returning at 12 noon, the accused demanded
money from her; and since she replied in negative, the accused poured kerosene
and set fire on her stating to die with that.
</p><p id="p_25">	6.4.  The Judicial Magistrate, P.W.13, after complying with the statutory
formalities, recorded the statement of the deceased between 2.40 pm and 3.00 pm
on 11.2.1998, wherein the deceased, in conscious state of mind, after
understanding the questions put forth to her, stated that there was a quarrel
between her and the accused for the past two or three days; her husband was
without employment for the past three years; they got married four years back;
they had no issue; on the date of occurrence, when the deceased went to her
mother's place to hand over dosa flour, the accused asked her to get Rs.50,000/-
from her father; he took away her jewels and pledged the same; she informed the
accused that her father had no money; when she returned from her mother's place,
the accused kept all his clothes ready; the accused stating the suggestion of
his mother to locate a house near the house of the mother of the deceased and to
stay with her for ten days and to do away her, made a mockery and therefore, the
accused cried and prayed Jesus to take her life soon; and immediately, the
accused poured kerosene and set fire on her and ran away.
</p>
<p id="p_26">	6.5. Of course, the conviction and sentence is purely based on the dying
declaration, Ex.P8.
</p><p id="p_27">	6.6. The core contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is as to
the validity and dependability of Ex.P8, dying declaration, on the following
grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_28">	(a-i) There cannot be  two dying declarations recorded at the same time,
namely at 3.00 pm.  The statement of the deceased was recorded by the Police at
3.00 p.m. and marked as Ex.P1. Another statement, viz. dying declaration was
recorded by P.W.13, Judicial Magistrate, between 2.45 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. and
marked as Ex.P8.
</p><p id="p_29">	(a-ii) We are unable to accept the same.  On perusal of the original
exhibits, we are satisfied that the Judicial Magistrate, P.W.13, after complying
with the requirements for recording the dying declaration, as per <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_14">Section 32</a> of
the Indian Evidence Act and satisfying himself that the deceased was in a state
of mind to understand the queries and answer the same, started recording the
dying declaration at 2.45 p.m. and completed the same at 3.00 p.m. This fact is
clearly noted in the dying declaration itself.  On the other hand, Ex.P-1 was
recorded by the Head Constable at 3.00 p.m.  Therefore the contention that both
Ex.P1 and Ex.P8 were recorded simultaneously is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_30">	(b-i) In Ex.P8 certain allegations are made against the mother-in-law of
the deceased, namely the mother of accused, to the effect that she suggested her
son (the accused) to locate a house near the house of the parents of the
deceased, to live there for 10 days pretending to be happy and thereafter, to do
away the deceased; on hearing the same, the deceased prayed JESUS to take her
life peacefully; and immediately the accused, proclaiming that why God should
take your life, poured kerosene on the deceased, set her on fire and ran away.
This has taken place at 12.00 p.m. on 11.02.1998.  On the other hand, there is
no such mentioning about the conduct of the mother-in-law in the statement of
the deceased, Ex.P1.  Pointing out the above discrepancy, the learned counsel
for the accused claims that the benefit should go the accused.
	(b-ii) In our considered opinion,  non-mentioning of the allegations in
Ex.P1 against the mother-in-law of the deceased as stated in Ex.P8, by itself,
would not take away the veracity and quality of the dying declaration.  In both
the statements, Ex.P1 and Ex.P8, the common version of the deceased was that (i)
there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused few days before the
date of occurrence; (ii) from then, there was a constant demand of dowry of a
sum of Rs.50,000/- by the accused from the parents of the deceased with a threat
of danger to life;  (iii) on the fateful day, the accused husband demanded money
and the deceased replied that she could not get money; and (iv) immediately, the
accused poured kerosene on the deceased and set her on fire. Therefore, mere non
mentioning of the allegations against her mother-in-law in Ex.P1, as stated in
the dying declaration Ex.P8, would not affect the quality of the dying
declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_31">	(c-i) The statement of the Doctor, P.W.3, who first treated the deceased,
and the Doctor, P.W.4, who conducted postmortem on the body of the deceased, is
to the effect that the deceased sustained 100% burn injuries  and therefore, the
left hand thumb impression of the deceased, with ridges, could not have been
obtained in Exs.P-1 and P-8, as found therein and the same creates a doubt in
the manner in which Exs.P1 and P8 were brought into existence. In this regard,
the learned counsel for the accused relies on the decision of the Supreme Court
in <a href="/doc/1513502/" id="a_15">State of Punjab  vs.  Gian Kaur and another</a> (1998 SCC (Cri) 942), wherein it
is held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_32">	"5.The High Court disbelieved the dying declaration on the ground that
even though according to the medical evidence Rita had 100% burns, the thumb
mark  of Rita appearing on the dying declaration had clear ridges and curves.
The High Court found the evidence of Dr.Ajay Sahni-PW 1 not reliable as he
failed to satisfactorily explain how such a thumb mark could appear on the dying
declaration when Rita had 100% burns over her body.  The High Court relied upon
the deposition of Doctor Aneja, who had performed the post-mortem and who has
categorically stated that there were 100% burns over her body and both the
thumbs of Rita were burnt.  In view of such inconsistent evidence, the High
Court was right in giving benefit of doubt to the respondents.  It cannot be
said in this case that the High Court has taken an unreasonable view."
</p>
<p id="p_33">	(c-ii) In the above cited decision, there is a clear finding that the
Doctor, who conducted postmortem has categorically stated that there were 100%
burns over the body of the deceased.  In the instant case, even though both
Doctors, P.W.3 and P.W.4, who treated the deceased and who conducted post
mortem, had stated that there was 100% burns over the body of the deceased, the
Doctor, P.W.4, who conducted post mortem, had opined that the death was due to
extensive burns.   Even, there was no cross examination of the Doctor, P.W.4,
who conducted post mortem.  But, he had stated in the post mortem certificate
that de-gloving of skin of hands and feet was found.  On the other hand,  the
Judicial Magistrate, P.W.13, who recorded the dying declaration of the deceased,
has categorically stated that after recording of the dying declaration, she
obtained  the left thumb impression of the deceased in Ex.P8.  <a href="/doc/1201415/" id="a_16">In Sree
Vijayakumar  vs.  State</a> (2005) 10 SCC 737, the Apex Court has held as follows:
	"14.The dying declaration recorded by the Judicial Magistrate cannot be
assailed on any germane ground.  We cannot accept the contention of the learned
counsel for the appellants that the deceased would not have been in a position
to sustain his consciousness and give a statement narrating the details of the
incident.  The evidence of the Magistrate, PW 2 is unequivocal that the deceased
was conscious and was able to answer the questions.  The certificate of the
doctor (Dr.Lalita Kumari) who was with him was also obtained on the dying
declaration.  If some persons other than the accused attacked and burnt him
there is no reason why the deceased should have thought of implicating the
accused while leaving out the real culprits."
</p><p id="p_34">We do not see any material to disbelieve the thumb impression of the deceased
affixed in Exs.P1 and P8.
</p><p id="p_35">	(c-iii) That apart, the dying declaration, Ex.P8, was marked through the
Judicial Magistrate, P.W.13, who recorded it.  The accused did not avail the
opportunity of putting any suggestion to the Magistrate by way of cross
examination to substantiate that the thumbs of the deceased were completely
burnt and therefore the Magistrate would not have obtained the thumb impression
with the ridges as found in Ex.P8.  Ex.P8, which was marked through P.W.13, had
given an opportunity to the accused to cross-examine P.W.13 about the recording
of the dying declaration, which the accused failed to avail it.  The accused
also had an opportunity to cross examine the two doctors, which also he had
failed to avail.  Finally, when he was questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_17">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the
accused did not avail that opportunity also.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	(c-iv) On the other hand, when  specific questions were put to the accused
under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_18">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., as to the incriminating circumstances under which
Ex.P-8 was recorded, namely question Nos.23, 24 and 25, the accused had baldly
stated that he was not aware of that.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	(c-v)  The scope of <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_19">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. has been dealt with by the Supreme
Court in the decision in <a href="/doc/1210867/" id="a_20">Subhash Chand  v. State of Rajasthan</a> (2002) 1 SCC 702,
wherein it has been held as follows:
</p><p id="p_38">"20. .. The purpose of asking questions during examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_21">Section 313</a>
CrPC is to afford the accused personally an opportunity of explaining any
incriminating circumstance so appearing in evidence against him.  The accused
may or may not avail the opportunity for offering his explanation. ...."
</p>
<p id="p_39">	(c-vi) In the decision in <a href="/doc/97757764/" id="a_22">Bejoy Chand Patra  vs.  State of West Bengal</a> -
1952 (1) MLJ 411, the Supreme Court held as as follows:
</p><p id="p_40">	"The facts of the case being free from any complications and the points in
issue being simple, we find it difficult to hold that the examination of the
appellant in this particular case was not adequate.  To sustain such an argument
as has been put forward, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show
that he has not been fully examined as required by <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_23">section 342</a> of the Criminal
Procedure Code, but he must also show that such examination has materially
prejudiced him."
</p>
<p id="p_41">	(c-vii) The Apex Court in the decision  in <a href="/doc/402211/" id="a_24">Radha Kishan  vs.  State of
U.P</a>. - AIR 1963 S.C. 822 dealt with the question as to prejudice caused by non-
compliance with Section 342 (Present <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">section 313</a>)  cannot be allowed to be
raised for the first time in the Appellate Court.  The relevant portion of the
judgment reads as follows.
</p><p id="p_42">	"5...... In so far as the contravention of provisions of S.342, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">Cr.P.C</a>.
are concerned it is sufficient to point out that no grievance was made either
before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge or before the High Court that
there was such a contravention and the appellant was prejudiced and we cannot
allow the point to be raised for the first time here, the reason being that
whether there was prejudice is a question of fact and cannot be permitted to be
agitated for the first time in an appeal under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_27">Art.136</a> of the Constitution."
</p><p id="p_43">	7. For the reasons aforementioned, we are unable to accept the contention
of the learned counsel for the accused that it  would not be safe to rely on the
dying declaration of the deceased, Ex.P8. On the other hand, the dying
declaration, Ex.P8, is clear and it satisfies the requirement of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_28">Section 32</a> of
the Indian Evidence Act.
</p><p id="p_44"> 	8. Coming to the question of conviction of the accused under <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_29">Section
498(A)</a> IPC, it is clear from the evidence of prosecution witnesses, dying
declaration, Ex.P8 and statement of the deceased, Ex.P1, that the accused and
the deceased lived as husband and wife for more than four years.  Further there
is overwhelming evidence to show that the accused demanded the deceased to get a
sum of Rs.50,000/- from her parents and when she was not able to bring the same,
the accused beat her and ill-treated her.  Though  a defence was raised that the
deceased was already married to one Ali and there was no marriage between the
deceased and the accused to attract an offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_30">Section 498-A</a> IPC, it is
not necessary that there should be a valid marriage.  On the other hand, it is
enough that if there is an evidence to prove that a man and a woman lived as
husband and wife.  In this case, there is evidence to show that the accused and
the deceased lived as husband and wife for a period of more than four years.  In
such circumstances, we see no force in the contention of the learned counsel for
the accused on this aspect.
</p><p id="p_45">	9. From the above discussion, it is clear that the prosecution has proved
its case that the accused subjected the deceased to cruelty and when she failed
to meet the demand of the accused, he murdered her by  pouring kerosene and
setting fire on her.  The trial court has rightly appreciated the evidence
adduced on behalf of the prosecution and found the accused guilty under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_31">Sections
498-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_32">Section 302</a> IPC and convicted him thereunder and therefore, we do not
find any reason or ground to interfere with the said judgment of the trial
court.
</p>
<p id="p_46">	In the result, the appeal fails and the same is  dismissed.  The
conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant/accused by the trial court are
confirmed.
