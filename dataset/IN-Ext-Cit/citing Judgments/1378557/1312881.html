<p id="p_4">2.         Abilio Coelho Pereira - since      deceased and now

represented by the present appellants, (for the sake of

convenience hereinafter referred to as `landlord'), made an

application on April 6, 1979 before the Rent Controller, Goa

North   Division,   Panaji   for   eviction   of   Mahabaleshwar

Ramchandra Colcar - since deceased and now represented by

the respondents - (hereinafter referred to as `tenant') on the
grounds of subletting and change of user, as provided in Goa,

Daman &amp; Diu Buildings (Lease, Rent &amp; Eviction) Control Act,

1968, (for short, `Act, 1968'). The landlord in the application for

eviction averred that a building situated at Stres Joao de

Castro, Panaji is owned by him; that one of the rooms on the

ground floor of the said building was let out to the tenant @

Rs.80/- per month on January 10, 1959 for grocery business;

that initially the lease was for a period of two years but later on

it was renewed from time to time and the last renewal was

made upto October 10, 1969; that on coming into force of Act,

1968 the tenant became statutory tenant; that the tenant

without   permission    or   consent    of   the   landlord    has

transferred/sublet tenancy interest in the premises to Mandovi

Tours and Travels; that the transferee/sub-lessee is exclusively

running the business in the said rented premises and that no

grocery shop is being run by the tenant in the said premises.

</p><p id="p_5">3.          The tenant traversed the application for eviction and

denied that he has transferred/sublet the premises to Mandovi

Tours and Travels or that the tenancy interest in the said

premises has been let out to the said partnership concern. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                 2</span>
tenant's defence in the written statement was that having

advanced in age, he was not doing good business in grocery

and he thought of starting the business of tours and travels

within the territory of Goa and, for this reason, he formed a

partnership in the name and style of M/s. Mandovi Tours and

Travels and took his son and daughter-in-law as his partners

along with one    Smt. Kunda Wagh. The tenant further averred

that booking and reservation of passengers and tourists is

being done from the said premises by the firm and that the

possession of the premises continues to be with him

exclusively. An additional written statement was filed by the

tenant on September 25, 1979 but since nothing material turns

on that, it is not necessary to refer to the said additional written

statement.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.           During the pendency of the proceedings, an

application came to be filed by M/s. Mandovi Tours and Travels

through its partner Umesh Kolkar for its impleadment and

intervention but the said application came to be rejected on

September 15, 1984.

</p><p id="p_8">5.           It may be noticed here that the original tenant died

on May 18, 1986 and his legal heirs (present respondents)

were impleaded as respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.           The Additional Rent Controller, Panaji Sub-Division,

Panaji-Goa recorded the evidence of the parties and, after

hearing them vide his order dated January 16, 1995 held that

ground of sub-letting was established and directed the present

respondents     to vacate the subject premises and put the

landlord in possession within 30 days from the date of receipt of

the order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.           The present respondents challenged the order of

eviction passed by the Additional Rent Controller in an eviction

appeal before the Administrative Tribunal, Goa. The original

landlord seems to have died during the pendency of appeal

and the present appellants who are his legal representatives

were brought on record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.           The Administrative Tribunal, Goa, after hearing the

parties, dismissed appeal on December 24, 1998. Thus, the

eviction order passed by the Additional Rent Controller was

upheld by the Administrative Tribunal, Goa.

</p><p id="p_12">9.          The present respondents, not satisfied with the

concurrent orders, preferred writ petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of

the Constitution before the High Court of Bombay at Goa.

</p><p id="p_13">10.         Vide judgment and order dated November 29, 2006,

High Court      allowed the writ petition and set aside the

concurrent orders of eviction passed by the Additional Rent

Controller and the Administrative Tribunal. It is from this order

that the present appeal by special leave has been preferred by

the present appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.         We heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel

for the appellants and Mr. S.G. Dessai, learned senior counsel

for the respondents at quite some length.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.         The Additional Rent Controller, after sifting the

evidence let in by the parties and the covenants of the

partnership deed, recorded his findings thus :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "It may be noted that from the covenants of the partnership
      deed it was clear that the books of accounts had to be
      maintained, statement for the purpose of income tax had to
      be prepared etc. and instead of bringing this evidence into
      record the respondent went on saying that he could not
      produce the books of accounts as his father had told him
      that the same were not maintained from the beginning. This
      statement was made on the next date of hearing when on
      the previous date he had promised to produce the same.</blockquote><p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      Further the power of attorney of the respondent mentioned


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                     5</span>
      that he was not able to say how much his wife received from
      the share of the sales of the two tempos belonging to the
      partnership firm even the files regarding the income tax
      returns, the power of attorney of the respondent stated that
      he was not aware whether any returns have been filed or
      not. It is clear from this that none of the partners were
      brought into the witness box. It is difficult to accept that this
      partnership actually existed but it was a cover front for any
      under-hand dealing with the said Balaji Lawande and
      Netravalkar. It is to be noted that neither Balaji nor
      Netravalkar came to depose as witnesses. As regards to the
      point that the partnership was purely a family concern it was
      difficult to accept when at the time of hearing different parties
      of the same family engaged different advocates and
      advances arguments on their behalf. Under no
      circumstances, it was explained as to why Kunda Wagh was
      taken as a partner when she could have easily been taken
      as an employee as she was required for the purpose of
      liaison and planning of tours."
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">13.          The Additional Rent Controller, thus, held that the

case of the tenant that the partnership firm existed cannot be

accepted and that it was a cover for an underhand dealing

with Balaji Lawande and Netravalkar. The Additional Rent

Controller went on to hold :
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ".......Even if the authorities mentioned by the respondent in
      their written arguments were to support the case of the
      respondent, it is difficult to accept this proposition because in
      the facts itself and the omission of the respondent to come
      out with the truth the said authorities do not hold him at all.
      Now considering all these aspects it is held that the
      respondent has not performed his obligation specially with
      reference to the authority mentioned above in RCJ 1993 Vol.</blockquote><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      I page 292 to 295 in the case of Trilok Singh Vs. Bavanti
      Prasad where it was mentioned in the judgment "Sub-letting
      being clandestine affairs direct evidence cannot ordinarily be
      available" have been complied by the respondent to justify


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                          6</span>
      the genuineness and the existence in practice of the said
      partnership deed. It may be noted also that the ground taken
      at later stage that two partners of the firm had become the
      legal heirs of the respondent, the question of the application
      of the section 2(p) i.e. the definition of the member of the
      firm of the tenant becomes applicable after his death cannot
      be accepted because proceedings were initiated well before
      the death of the original respondent and it relates to the
      events at the time of filing of this application. It may be noted
      also that the evidence of the respondent was recorded
      through his power of attorney and son Ulhas during the life
      time and, therefore, the respondent cannot take shelter of
      this provision now.
</p>
<p id="p_23">              Under these circumstances, as the respondent has
      failed to perform his obligation to prove that there had not
      been an under hand sub-letting because in all such cases,
      the sub-letting was always clandestine and, therefore, direct
      evidence cannot be brought by the applicant and hence the
      duty cast on the respondent."
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">14.          The Administrative Tribunal also held                 that the

partnership - Mandovi Tours and Travels - was not a genuine

partnership and it was formed to cover up subletting of suit

premises. For recording this finding, the Administrative Tribunal

gave the following reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "Admittedly, the appellants did not examine any of the
      partners of the partnership firm before the Rent Controller.
      However, the appellants examined one Shri Ulhas Kholkar
      as a power of attorney for the original tenant. In fact, he
      happens to be the son of the original tenant. According to
      this witness, the appellants started the business in the suit
      premises under the name and style M/s. Mandovi Tour &amp;
      Travels in February 1977 for conducting sight seeing tours.</blockquote><p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">      This witness was cross-examined by the respondents. From
      the trend of the cross examination of this witness, it is clear
      that the partnership was not at all acted upon and it only


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                          7</span>
      remained as a paper document. He has admitted that the
      Mandovi Tours and Travels has not maintained any books of
      accounts from the inception. It was suggested to this witness
      that there are no account books as partnership business
      does not exist at all which suggestion was denied by this
      witness. It was also suggested to this witness that the suit
      premises are in exclusive possession of Sitakant Netravalkar
      and Balaji Lawande which suggestion was also denied by
      this witness. His wife happens to be one of the partners but
      he does not know what income his wife receives from the
      partnership business. In his cross-examination, he has also
      stated that he cannot say as to who shall retain the premises
      in case the partnership was dissolved. As per clause 7 of the
      Partnership Deed, it was necessary for the partnership firm
      to open bank account in the name of firm to be operated by
      second and third party jointly. As per clause 8 of the
      partnership deed the accounting year of the partnership was
      from Ist April ending on 31st March every year and the first
      sets of books were required to be closed on 31.3.1978. As
      per clause 9 of the partnership deed, it was necessary to
      keep proper books of accounts and which were required to
      be completed on 31st March every year. However, it is
      pertinent to note that the appellants have not brought any
      evidence on record to show that they have opened a bank
      account in the name of the firm. The appellants have also
      not brought any evidence on record to show that books of
      accounts were maintained by the partnership firm. In my
      view, therefore, the evidence on record clearly establishes
      that the said partnership was not at all a genuine partnership
      and it was created only to circumvent the provisions of the
      Rent Control Act."
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">15.         The Administrative Tribunal also held that the tenant

did not hold any control over the suit premises and though his

case was that to do travel business, a firm Mandovi Tours and

Travels was constituted but failed to prove that Mandovi Tours

and Travels was a genuine partnership. This is what the

Administrative Tribunal said :
</p>
<p id="p_31">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                       8</span>
              "In the present case before me the original tenant had
      only 10% share. The partner Smt. Kunda J. Vagh who is
      stranger has 30% shares. As discussed above, the said
      partnership is found not to be genuine partnership and it was
      formed to cover up the sub-letting of the suit premises. This
      being the position, it is difficult to hold that the appellants still
      have a control over the suit premises. I am, therefore,
      satisfied that the appellants have parted with the possession
      of the suit premises to the said Mandovi Tours and Travels.
      The appellants have failed to prove that the said partnership
      was a genuine partnership."
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">16.          Insofar as High Court is concerned, two errors are

apparent from its judgment. In the first place, High Court

erred in holding that the tenant wanted to examine one of the

partners, Umesh Mahabaleshwar Kholkar but he was not

permitted by the Rent Controller. This is factually incorrect

inasmuch      as there is nothing on record that even remotely

suggests that        the tenant wanted to examine one of the

partners Umesh Mahabaleshwar Kholkar. What appears from

record is that an application came to be filed by M/s. Mandovi

Tours and Travels through its partner Umesh Kholkar for its

impleadment and intervention but the said application was

rejected on September 15, 1994. The fact of the matter is that

the said order never came to be challenged by M/s. Mandovi

Tours and Travels. Secondly, the High Court failed to advert to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                              9</span>
the question whether the firm M/s. Mandovi Tours and Travels

was a genuine partnership firm or was a camouflage to cover

up the mischief of subletting. Though, the Administrative

Tribunal as well as the Additional Rent Controller have

recorded a specific finding that the partnership M/s. Mandovi

Tours and Travels was not genuine partnership and it was

created with an intention to circumvent the provisions of Act,

1968, but the High Court did not go into this aspect on the

ground that there was no specific pleading to this effect in the

application for eviction.
</p>
<p id="p_34">17.         Section 22(2)(b)(i) of the Act,1968 which is relevant

for the present appeal reads thus :

v. S.B. Sardar Ranjit Singh1</a>, this Court held that when eviction

is sought on the ground of subletting, the onus to prove

subletting is on the landlord. It was further held that if the

landlord prima facie shows that the third party is in exclusive

possession of the premises let out for valuable consideration, it

would then be for the tenant to rebut the evidence.

a tenant becomes a partner of a partnership firm and allows the

firm to carry on business in the demised premises while he

himself retains legal possession thereof, the act of the landlord

does not amount to subletting. It was held that whether there is

genuine partnership or not must be judged in the facts of each

case in the light of the principles applicable to partnership.

          contemplated under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_6">Section 14(1)(b)</a> of the Act has been
          committed as the tenant had sublet, assigned, or otherwise
          parted with the possession of the whole or part of the
          premises without obtaining the consent in writing of the
          landlord. There is no dispute that there was no consent in
          writing of the landlord in this case. There is also no evidence
          that there has been any subletting or assignment. The only
          ground perhaps upon which the landlord was seeking
          eviction was parting with possession. It is well settled that
          parting with possession meant giving possession to persons
          other than those to whom possession had been given by the
          lease and the parting with possession must have been by
          the tenant; user by other person is not parting with
          possession so long as the tenant retains the legal
          possession himself, or in other words there must be vesting
          of possession by the tenant in another person by divesting
          himself not only of physical possession but also of the right
          to possession. So long as the tenant retains the right to
          possession there is no parting with possession in terms of
          clause (b) of <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_7">Section 14(1)</a> of the Act. Even though the father
          had retired from the business and the sons had been looking
          after the business, in the facts of this case, it cannot be said
          that the father had divested himself of the legal right to be in
          possession. If the father has a right to displace the
          possession of the occupants, i.e., his sons, it cannot be said

          Landlord and Tenant, 6th edn., at page 323, for the
          proposition that the mere act of letting other persons into
          possession by the tenant, and permitting them to use the
          premises for their own purposes, is not, so long as he retains
          the legal possession himself, a breach of covenant. In
          paragraph 17 of the report, it was observed that parting of
          the legal possession means possession with the right to
          include and also right to exclude others. In the last
          mentioned case, the observations of the Madras High Court
          in <a href="/doc/304429/" id="a_12">Gundalapalli Rangamannar Chetty v. Desu Rangiah</a> (AIR
          1954 Mad 182) were approved by this Court in which the
          legal position in Jackson v. Simons [(1923) 1 Ch 373) were
          relied upon. The Madras High Court had also relied on a
          judgment of Scrutton L.J. in Chaplin v. Smith [(1926) 1 KB
          198] at page 211 of the report where it was said :

as a camouflage to circumvent the provisions of the Rent

Control Act. The following observations are worth noticing :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     "The rent control legislations which extend many a protection
     to the tenant, also provide for grounds of eviction. One such
     ground, most common in all the legislations, is sub-letting or
     parting with possession of the tenancy premises by the
     tenant. Rent control laws usually protect the tenant so long
     as he may himself use the premises but not his transferee
     inducted into possession of the premises, in breach of the
     contract or the law, which act is often done with the object of
     illegitimate profiteering or rack-renting. To defeat the
     provisions of law, a device is at times adopted by
     unscrupulous tenants and sub-tenants of bringing into
     existence a deed of partnership which gives the relationship
     of tenant and sub-tenant an outward appearance of
     partnership while in effect what has come into existence is a
     sub-tenancy or parting with possession camouflaged under
     the cloak of partnership. Merely because a tenant has
     entered into a partnership he cannot necessarily be held to
     have sub-let the premises or parted with possession thereof
     in favour of his partners. If the tenant is actively associated
     with the partnership business and retains the use and control
     over the tenancy premises with him, maybe along with the
     partners, the tenant may not be said to have parted with
     possession. However, if the user and control of the tenancy
     premises has been parted with and deed of partnership has
     been drawn up as an indirect method of collecting the
     consideration for creation of sub-tenancy or for providing a
     cloak or cover to conceal a transaction not permitted by law,
     the court is not estopped from tearing the veil of partnership
     and finding out the real nature of transaction entered into
     between the tenant and the alleged sub-tenant.</blockquote><p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">     A person having secured a lease of premises for the
     purpose of his business may be in need of capital or finance
     or someone to assist him in his business and to achieve
     such like purpose he may enter into partnership with
     strangers. Quite often partnership is entered into between
     the members of any family as a part of tax planning. There is
     no stranger brought on the premises. So long as the
     premises remain in occupation of the tenant or in his control,
     a mere entering into partnership may not provide a ground
     for eviction by running into conflict with prohibition against


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                       1</span>
          sub-letting or parting with possession. This is a general
          statement of law which ought to be read in the light of the
          lease agreement and the law governing the tenancy. There
          are cases wherein the tenant sub-lets the premises or parts
          with possession in defiance of the terms of lease or the rent
          control legislation and in order to save himself from the peril
          of eviction brings into existence, a deed of partnership
          between him and his sub-lessee to act as a cloak on the
          reality of the transaction. The existence of deed of
          partnership between the tenant and the alleged sub-tenant
          would not preclude the landlord from bringing on record
          material and circumstances, by adducing evidence or by
          means of cross-examination, making out a case of sub-
          letting or parting with possession or interest in tenancy
          premises by the tenant in favour of a third person. The rule
          as to exclusion of oral by documentary evidence governs the
          parties to the deed in writing. A stranger to the document is
          not bound by the terms of the document and is, therefore,
          not excluded from demonstrating the untrue or collusive
          nature of the document or the fraudulent or illegal purpose
          for which it was brought into being. An enquiry into reality of
          transaction is not excluded merely by availability of writing
          reciting the transaction........."

between the owner of the property and his tenant becomes a
sub-lease when entered into between the tenant and tenant
of the tenant, the latter being sub-tenant qua the owner-
landlord. A lease of immovable property as defined in
<a href="/doc/645212/" id="a_17">Section 105</a> of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is a
transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain
time for consideration of a price paid or promised. A transfer
of a right to enjoy such property to the exclusion of all others
during the term of the lease is sine qua non of a lease. A
sub-lease would imply parting with by the tenant of the right
to enjoy such property in favour of his sub-tenant. Different
types of phraseology are employed by different State
Legislatures making provision for eviction on the ground of
sub-letting. Under <a href="/doc/420207/" id="a_18">Section 21(1)(f)</a> of the old Act, the
phraseology employed is quite wide. It embraces within its
scope sub-letting of the whole or part of the premises as also
assignment or transfer in any other manner of the lessee's
interest in the tenancy premises. The exact nature of
transaction entered into or arrangement or understanding
arrived at between the tenant and alleged sub-tenant may
not be in the knowledge of the landlord and such a
transaction being unlawful would obviously be entered into in
secrecy depriving the owner-landlord of the means of
ascertaining the facts about the same. However still, the rent
control legislation being protective for the tenant and eviction
being not permissible except on the availability of ground
therefor having been made out to the satisfaction of the court
or the Controller, the burden of proving the availability of the
ground is cast on the landlord i.e. the one who seeks
eviction. <a href="/doc/114533/" id="a_19">In Krishnawati v. Hans Raj</a> [(1974) 1 SCC 289]

may then be raised and would amount to proof unless
rebutted. In the context of the premises having been sub-let
or possession parted with by the tenant by adopting the
device of entering into partnership, it would suffice for us to
notice three decisions of this Court. Murlidhar v. Chuni Lal
(1970 Ren CJ 922) is a case where a shop was let out to a
firm of the name of Chuni Lal Gherulal. The firm consisted of
three partners, namely, Chuni Lal, Gherulal and Meghraj.
This partnership closed and a new firm by the name of
Meghraj Bansidhar commenced its business with partners
Meghraj and Bansidhar. The tenant firm was sought to be
evicted on the ground that the old firm and the new firm
being two different legal entities, the occupation of the shop
by the new firm amounted to sub-letting. This Court
discarded the contention as "entirely without substance" and
held that a partnership firm is not a legal entity; the firm
name is only a compendious way of describing the partners
of the firm. Therefore, occupation by a firm is only
occupation by its partners. The two firms, old and new, had a
common partner, namely, Meghraj, who continued to be in
possession and it was fallacious to contend that earlier he
was in possession in the capacity of partner of the old firm
and later as a partner of the new firm. The landlord, in order
to succeed, has to prove it as a fact that there was a sub-
letting by his tenant to another firm. As the premises
continued to be in possession of one of the original tenants,
Meghraj, then by a mere change in the constitution of the
firm of which Meghraj continued to be a partner, an inference
as to sub-letting could not be drawn in the absence of further
evidence having been adduced to establish sub-letting. <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_22">In
Helper Girdharbhai v. Saiyed Mohd. Mirasaheb Kadri</a> [(1987)
3 SCC 538] the tenant had entered into a partnership and
the firm was carrying on business in the tenancy premises.
This Court held that if there was a partnership firm of which
the appellant was a partner as a tenant, the same would not
amount to sub-letting leading to forfeiture of the tenancy; for
there cannot be a sub-letting unless the lessee parted with
the legal possession. The mere fact that another person is
allowed to use the premises while the lessee retains the
legal possession is not enough to create a sub-lease. Thus,
the thrust is, as laid down by this Court, on finding out who is
in legal possession of the premises. So long as the legal
possession remains with the tenant the mere factum of the
tenant having entered into partnership for the purpose of
carrying on the business in the tenancy premises would not
amount to sub-letting. <a href="/doc/1684919/" id="a_23">In Parvinder Singh v. Renu Gautam</a>

             premises with him, maybe along with the partners, the

tenant has sub-let the premises to M/s. Mandovi Tours and

Travels, a partnership concern, without his permission and that

the sub-lessee has been exclusively running the business in

the rented premises although he has not pleaded specifically

that the premises have been sublet to Balaji Lawande and

Netravalkar but such lack of pleading cannot be held to be

fatal. It has to be kept in mind     that a transaction such as

sub-letting by tenant which is not permissible under lease

may be outwardly a deceptive arrangement and landlord

may not come to know of true facts. The pleadings in such

matters ought not to be construed too technically. The true

tenant is ostensible and a deed of partnership is drawn to

conceal the real transaction of subletting in a given case, the

judgment shows, has been too technical in construing the

pleadings of the case overlooking the fact that plea of sub-

letting has been set up by landlord in the plaint and there has

been full and critical examination of the evidence         by the

Additional Rent Controller as well as the Administrative

Tribunal. The Additional       Rent Controller       and      the

Administrative Tribunal cannot be said to have misdirected

themselves either on law or on facts. Both Authorities found as

a fact that Mandovi Tours and Travels was not a genuine

partnership and it was formed to cover up the subletting of the

suit premises. They also found as a fact that the partnership

having not been found to be genuine partnership, it was difficult

to hold that the tenant continued to have a control over the suit

premises. These findings recorded by the Administrative

Tribunal as well as the Additional Rent Controller are based on

be said that the aforesaid view of the Rent Control Authorities is

not a possible view.
