<p id="p_1">G. P. MITTAL, J.
</p><p id="p_2">I.A. No. 11760/ 2013 (O. XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC)

</p><p id="p_3">1.        By virtue of this application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read

          with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), the

          Plaintiff        (Applicant)         seeks   ad   interim   injunction     restraining

          infringement of its trademark/trade name ZARA, passing off, dilution

          of its trademark/trade name and delivery up against the Defendants.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                                            Page 1 of 42</span>
</p><p id="p_4"> 2.        The case set up by the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff is an internationally

          reputed company engaged in the manufacture, design, sale and

          distribution of fashion and related lifestyle products in various classes

          of International Classification of Goods and Services. In India, the

          Plaintiff carries out commercial operations through its associate

          company, Inditex Trent Retail India Private Limited, a joint venture

          between the Plaintiff and Trent Limited of well known Tata Group

          Company. It is the case of the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff coined,

          conceived and adopted ZARA as its trademark in 1975 and opened

          first ZARA shop 38 years ago in A Coruna, Spain. The domain name

          zara.com was registered by the Plaintiff on 29th May, 1997 and the

          same has since been in continuous use of the Plaintiff.


</p><p id="p_5">3.        It is averred that ZARA stores are located in some of the most

          privileged and prominent locations in several major cities around the

          world including New York‟s 5th Avenue, Paris‟s Champs Elysees,

          London‟s Regent Street and Tokyo‟s Shiyuba Shopping Centre. The

          Plaintiff had 1763 ZARA stores, 171 ZARA KIDS stores and 364

          ZARA HOME stores in over 86 countries. The products bearing

          Plaintiff‟s ZARA marks are manufactured in various countries

          including India, which are then exported to the Plaintiff at various

          locations. In India, garments and other articles bearing Plaintiff‟s
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                                 Page 2 of 42</span>
           ZARA mark have been specially manufactured since 1986-87 by

          Plaintiff‟s Indian manufacturers.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.        The Plaintiff has been using its trademark ZARA and its derivatives

          like ZARA KIDS, ZARA HOME, ZARA FOR MUM, ZARA MAN,

          ZARA WOMAN or TEXTURES ZARA on a global scale. The

          Plaintiff had turnover of over 3310 million Euros in 2003 which has

          risen to 10,541 million Euros in the year 2012. In India, the total sales

          of ZARA products in the very first year of operation was ` 120 crores

          which rose to over ` 384 crores (annually) within two years i.e. in

          2012.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.        It is averred that ZARA trademark is one of its most valuable assets

          and the same has featured in top 50 brands among 100 most valued

          trademarks in the world as per the Interbrand rankings, with a brand

          value exceeding US$ 9.4 billion. The Plaintiff‟s mark has thus,

          become a well known mark within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (zg)

          of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 (the Act) and thus, the Plaintiff is

          entitled to protect its mark ZARA against identical or confusingly

          similar marks even in respect of goods and services which are not

          same or similar to the goods and services of the Plaintiff. It is averred

          that the Plaintiff has been vigilant in protecting its ZARA marks and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                              Page 3 of 42</span>
           has been enforcing its trademark rights against all forms of

          infringement and dilution. In a number of oppositions filed by the

          Plaintiff against trade mark applications of various parties for the mark

          ZARA or other deceptively similar marks, the Applicants have

          abandoned their applications. It is pleaded that owing to extensive and

          continuous use of the mark in India since 1986-87 and opening of

          commercial outlets in the beginning of 2010, the Plaintiff‟s mark

          ZARA has acquired tremendous reputation in India.


</p><p id="p_10">6.        It is averred that in or around April, 2005, the Plaintiff first came

          across Defendant no.1‟s trademark application no. 1195357 for ZARA

          TAPAS BAR in Class 16, advertised in Trade Mark Journal 1327

          (Suppl.) dated 17th January, 2005 (which was made available to the

          public on 8th April, 2005). The Plaintiff filed opposition no. MAS-

          202722 against the said advertised mark which is pending before the

          Trade Mark Registry, Chennai. In the end of 2012 and beginning of

          2013, the Plaintiff came across other trademark applications filed by

          Defendant no.1 for registration of ZARA TAPAS BAR which is in

          violation of the Plaintiff‟s right to the globally known registered

          trademark and brand name ZARA. The Plaintiff has filed opposition

          against all the trademark applications comprising the expression

          ZARA filed by Defendant no.1 which have not been advertised till the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                              Page 4 of 42</span>
           date of filing of the suit. It is averred that in February, 2011, the

          Plaintiff‟s Indian trademark attorneys received a letter dated

          24.02.2011 from Defendant no.1‟s trademark attorneys, proposing

          settlement and co-existence of the marks ZARA and ZARA TAPAS

          BAR. Defendant no.1‟s attorneys put forth undertakings on behalf of

          their clients pertaining to the mark ZARA TAPAS BAR as under:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "(a) Not to claim any protection and use in Class 24
                    and 25 pertaining to textile and textile goods;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                    (b) to confine only to restaurant services and other
                    allied and cognate goods and services in relation to
                    hospitality and provision of foods and drinks falling
                    under Clauses 16, 30, 32, 33 and 43; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    (c)        to use it always in composite form."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">7.        The terms of settlement in the form proposed by Defendant no.1 were

          not acceptable to the Plaintiff, the same were consequently rejected.


</p><p id="p_12">8.        It is averred that the Defendants are using the Plaintiff‟s trademark

          and brand ZARA for their business with the generic extensions

          "TAPAS BAR" which is a type of dining concept, or "TAPAS" which

          is the name given to appetizers or snacks in Spanish cuisine. It is

          pleaded that the independent expression ZARA in isolation does not

          inherently provoke a Spanish feel, the expression has no meaning in

          Spanish language and is neither a popular nor a common name in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                             Page 5 of 42</span>
           Spain. Thus, any Spanish association of the expression ZARA is

          solely attributable to the popularity and goodwill acquired by the

          Plaintiff worldwide, being a company originally of Spain. Thus, by

          use of the name ZARA TAPAS BAR by the Defendants, there is

          strong likelihood of unwarranted association between the Plaintiff and

          the Defendants in the minds of the existing and potential consumers. It

          is pleaded that adoption of the mark ZARA together with Spanish

          expression and concept TAPAS BAR by the Defendants is fraudulent

          and is solely to ride on the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff‟s

          brand name ZARA.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9.        It is stated that the Defendants‟ emphasis is on the use of the mark

          ZARA and the Defendants are misrepresenting to the public at large

          on social media like Facebook and Twitter by addressing themselves

          as ZARA, ZARA CHENNAI, ZARA CATHEDRAL, ZARA

          KOLAKTA, ZARA AIRPORT, etc. to induce the public to visit their

          establishment situated in Chennai and Kolkata. It is pleaded that the

          Defendants indiscriminating use of the mark ZARA is irreparably

          damaging the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff by tarnishing its

          most valuable ZARA mark. The Plaintiff thus, seeks the following

          injunctions:-

<p id="p_16">10.       The Defendants have contested the suit and the application by way of

          filing the written statement and reply to the injunction application.


</p><p id="p_17">11.       The Defendants have taken preliminary objections that the Plaintiff

          has approached this Court with unclean hands. It has misrepresented

          and concealed significant information from the Court. It is averred that

          there are multiple parties in India and abroad co-existing with the use

          of mark ZARA or ZARA formative marks. The presence of multiple

          parties can be seen from the list of registrations granted to third parties

          using ZARA which came to be shown listed in the Registrar of

          Companies‟ search report. The Plaintiff‟s mark ZARA has itself been

          challenged in various jurisdictions including India and Plaintiff‟s

          home country EU which fact has not been disclosed by the Plaintiff. It

          is averred that the Plaintiff entered into India for the first time only in

          2010. The Plaintiff has not shown any use or reputation or goodwill of

          its mark ZARA prior to 2002 in India or even in any part of the world,

          when the Defendants established their restaurant with the mark ZARA

          TAPAS BAR.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">12.       It is the case of the Defendants that Defendant no.1 is not using the

          mark ZARA per se but using the mark earlier adopted as ZARA
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                                Page 8 of 42</span>
           TAPAS BAR and later as ZARA, the Tapas Bar and Restaurant.


</p><p id="p_20">13.       The Defendants have admitted that they wanted to settle the matter

          amicably with the Plaintiff by offering to confine Defendant no.1 only

          to their own core classes of activity within classes 30, 32 and 43,

          which remain unused by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff, however, has a

          tendency to monopolise the mark which is actually used by multiple

          parties in India and abroad.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">14.       In para 7 of the preliminary objections, the Defendants have given the

          details and origin of the word ZARA and have denied that it is a

          coined or a conceived mark of the Plaintiff. It is the case of the

          Defendants that all the applications except the one in classes 25, 3 and

          18 had been filed on proposed to be used basis by the Plaintiff at least

          two months after the date of application of the Defendants. It is

          contended that there is no evidence whatsoever of any goodwill and

          reputation of the Plaintiff‟s credit and Plaintiff‟s registration are

          totally irrelevant. In para 17 of the preliminary objections, the

          Defendants have given the details of the third party registration of the

          mark ZARA.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">15.       It is further averred that there is a major delay in filing of the suit by

          the Plaintiff which amounts to acquiescence by the Plaintiff to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                               Page 9 of 42</span>
           Defendants‟ use of the mark ZARA. The Plaintiff ought to have

          known the Defendants‟ use of the mark since the year 2002 as it had

          obtained a bar licence by this name in the year 2002. It has given

          certain advertisements as well since March 2003 onwards and the

          trademark application filed on 28.04.2003 was published on

          17.01.2005. The Defendants have challenged the jurisdiction of the

          Court to entertain the suit as well and have thus, prayed for dismissal

          of the application as well as the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">16.       It may be noted that by an ex-parte ad interim order dated 29.07.2013,

          the Defendants were restrained from using the mark ZARA as a

          trademark, trade name, corporate name, domain name or in any other

          manner whatsoever. Subsequently, on an application under Order

          XXXIX Rule 4 CPC by the Defendants, the injunction order was

          modified and the Defendants were permitted to use the composite

          trademark ZARA TABAS BAR only till further orders. Paras 32 to 34

          of the order dated 25.04.2014 are extracted hereunder:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                    "32. Hence, the ex parte order was passed keeping in
                    view the averments made by the Plaintiff as elaborated in
                    paras 21 and 22 of the plaint, namely that it was only in
                    March 2013 that the Plaintiff received evidence which
                    show that Defendant No.1 has started using the
                    expression ZARA per se and not as part of ZARA TAPAS
                    BAR i.e. in the form of composite label. Same is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                               Page 10 of 42</span>
                     thrust of the averment in para 22 of the plaint. Factually
                    this appears incorrect inasmuch as in its Affidavit filed
                    on 14.01.2008 before the Trade Mark Registry of Mr.
                    Antonio Abril Abadin there are categorical averments
                    made by the Plaintiff that the Defendants are using the
                    mark ZARA per se. As this averment was made in 2008,
                    knowledge of use of this mark could not be attributed to
                    be in March 2013 as averred in para 21 of the plaint.

 SIMILARITY DECEPTIVE OR OTHERWISE BETWEEN MARK
'ZARA' AND 'ZARA TAPAS BAR'

</p><p id="p_38">19.       The case of the Plaintiff is that the Defendants are using the mark

          ZARA per se as also as ZARA TAPAS BAR. The way the mark

          ZARA is being used by the Defendants, there is huge prominence of

          the word ZARA and it is sought to be conveyed as if the Defendants

          own the trademark ZARA and have relation with the Plaintiff.


</p><p id="p_39">20.       On the other hand, the case of the Defendants is that they are not using

          the mark ZARA per se. They are merely using the mark ZARA

          TAPAS BAR or ZARA, the Tapas Bar and Restaurant in relation to

          goods and services different from those of the Plaintiff and thus, there

          is no similarity between the two marks.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">21.       Before answering the question posed, it shall be appropriate to refer to

          para 22 of the plaint and the written statement. In Para 22, the Plaintiff

          alleged          that       the      Defendants   were   operating   a    website

          www.zaratapasbar.in wherein Defendant no.1 is trying to project itself

          as a retail outlet offering Spain-styled products and services under the

          name ZARA.

          no.1 were extracted in Para 22 which are reproduced hereunder:-

</p><p id="p_44"> 23.       In the first screenshot on the left side, only the word ZARA is readable

          before the words TAPAS BAR. Similarly at the bottom, only the word

          ZARA is prominent whereas the words the TAPAS BAR AND

          RESTAURANT are hardly readable. Similarly, in the second

          screenshot on the right top, again the word ZARA has been

          highlighted. In the middle screenshot, the Defendants advertise the

          complimentary cocktail in the words "Do all that and more over

          complimentary cocktail at ZARA, so don‟t forget to drop in."


</p><p id="p_45">24.       On the second page (Page 31 of the Plaint) of the screenshot at the top,

          Defendant no.1 describes itself happening every Monday at ZARA,

          offering one drink free for one. It reads as "Buy one drink &amp; get one

          free. Now, every Monday at Zara..." In the second middle and the

          bottom screen shots, again the restaurant is described as ZARA.


</p><p id="p_46">25.       It is therefore, evident that wherever the Defendants have used

          TAPAS            BAR          along   with   ZARA   or   TAPAS   BAR   AND

          RESTAURANT or TAPAS, the Bar and Restaurant, the word ZARA

          is almost ten times bigger than the other words used in the

          advertisement/screenshots. At the same time, at so many other places,

          the words BAR AND RESTAURANT have not been used at all with

          the word ZARA and the word ZARA per se has been used. Thus,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                                 Page 16 of 42</span>
           there is no manner of doubt that there is deceptive similarity between

          the mark ZARA of the Plaintiff and the mark ZARA TAPAS BAR,

          the way it is being used by the Defendants.

<p id="p_47">
ADOPTION OF THE MARK 'ZARA TAPAS BAR'

</p><p id="p_48">26.       The Plaintiff urges that adoption of the mark ZARA TAPAS BAR is

          dishonest and fraudulent whereas the same is claimed to be honest

          adoption of the mark by the Defendants which is now being used for

          over a decade.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">27.       According to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff coined, conceived and adopted

          ZARA as its trademark in 1975 and the first ZARA shop was opened

          38 years ago in A Coruna, Spain. The domain name zara.com was

          registered by the Plaintiff on 29th May, 1997. It is not in dispute that

          the Plaintiff used ZARA initially in Spain and then it opened its stores

          in various countries. In the year 2003, when the Defendants claimed to

          have opened ZARA TAPAS BAR, the Plaintiff had already opened its

          stores in 44 countries and the Plaintiff was having annual turnover of

          over 3 billion Euros by that time.

<p id="p_51">

          Italian, Portuguese and Spanish variation of the English, French and

          German name Sarah. The relevant averments in this regard from para
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                             Page 17 of 42</span>
           7 of the written statement read as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    "7........The word ZARA also has a meaning in common
                    Hindi parlance connoting "some or little". In Urdu, the
                    word means dawn, morning and is a popular and
                    common Muslim feminine name. From Arabic roots, its
                    meaning is blossoming flower; splendor; dawn. In this
                    context, the word ZARA can be used in the Arabic,
                    English, and Hebrew languages to connote „zahrah‟ for
                    blossoming flower as „zahr‟ meaning flower. The name is
                    derived from the Arabic „zahrah‟ (blossoming flower),
                    but it has sometimes also been used as a form of Sarah.
                    The Moorish influence in Spain perhaps evokes an
                    association of Arabic terms with Spanish culture thereby
                    making ZARA a popular Spanish name. Historically
                    there is an undeniable link between Spanish culture and
                    North African Islamic culture which unknowingly draws
                    an association with a name like ZARA. A copy of the
                    news report that appeared in Economic Times in August
                    2013 has been filed in the present proceedings that states
                    that anyone tracing the historical links between these
                    regions cannot also fail to see the connection between the
                    Arabic, Mediterranean and the Tapas that may after all
                    have come about in Southern Spain during its long
                    Moorish period. Infact, the name ZARAGOZA is the
                    name of a province in Northern Spain whose capital city
                    is also called ZARAGOZA. Additionally, it is name of a
                    place in Columbia, Mexico, El Salvador, Phillipines all
                    of which are Hispanic countries. "Zorro" is also
                    Spanish for "fox" and is also a popular fictional
                    character which was created in 1919. The character has
                    been featured in numerous books, films, television series,
                    and other media. Zorro is the secret identity of Don
                    Diego de la Vega, a California nobleman and master
                    living in the Spanish colonial era. Therefore while ZARA
                    TAPAS BAR provokes Spanish feel, it does not signify in

                     any respect an association with the retail and fashion
                    business of the Plaintiffs. Internet extracts indicate that
                    the word ZARA has various connotations in different
                    languages and in different cultures. In Islam, the word
                    ZARA refers to radiance or flower and has etymological
                    origin from the Biblical name Sarah, the daughter of
                    Abraham (also referred to in Islam as Ibrahim). The
                    Biblical character Sara is cited as having been a very
                    strong swarthy woman of Indian ancestry, being a patron
                    of gypsies. Internet extracts of meanings of the word
                    ZARA in different languages and cultures are being filed
                    in the present proceedings...."

<p id="p_54">29.       It is urged that Defendant no.1 adopted and used its mark in India in

          2003 and acquired tremendous distinctiveness within a very short span

          of time.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">30.       It is urged by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff that the explanation

          given by the Defendants for adoption of the mark is an afterthought in

          as much as earlier while replying to a letter sent by the Plaintiff, the

          Defendants had stated that "ZARA is a commonly used dictionary

          word in various languages especially Arabic, Urdu, Hebrew and

          Hindi to name a few. The word Zara denotes a blooming flower and is

          a widely used name for girls in many countries including the Arab

          world and east Europe".
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">31.       It is contended that initially there was not even a whisper that the word

          ZARA is a Spanish word or a word of Spanish origin. The learned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                                 Page 19 of 42</span>
           counsel for the Plaintiff has also referred to the press article filed by

          the Defendants which says"Thanks to Mahadevan, who came across

          the concept in Paris, Chennai has India‟s first Tapas bar ZARA Tapas

          Bar (launched in March 2003)".
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">32.       Thus, it is urged that the mark ZARA or „ZARA, the Tapas Bar‟ is

          fraudulently adopted by Defendant no.1 to infringe the Plaintiff‟s

          registered mark and to pass on and to make people believe that

          somehow the goods and services offered by the Defendants have some

          connection with the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">33.       I have gone through the pleadings of the parties. It is too much to say

          that the word ZARA is a dictionary word or that the word ZARA was

          adopted by the Plaintiff from the name of the city ZARAGOZA. In the

          press article itself (relied upon by the Defendants), it has been stated

          that Defendant no.2 came across the concept in Paris. Admittedly,

          there were 40 ZARA stores in Paris by the year 2003. The word

          ZARA is neither generic nor descriptive nor a dictionary word (as far

          as Spain is concerned). The Defendants have not given any plausible

          explanation for adoption of the mark ZARA. Thus, in all probability,

          the mark ZARA TAPAS BAR was adopted by the Defendants from

          the mark ZARA of the Plaintiff. Stores by this name were already

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                              Page 20 of 42</span>
           opened in over 44 countries by the Plaintiff. In my view, it cannot be

          said to be an honest adoption entitling Defendant no.1 to its concurrent

          user. If the Defendants did not want to ride on the Plaintiff‟s

          reputation, they would have not used the word ZARA prominently in

          the words ZARA TAPAS BAR or ZARA, the Bar and Restaurant.


</p><p id="p_63">34.       In this connection, a reference may be made to the judgment of this

          Court in <a href="/doc/315836/" id="a_2">M/s. Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. India Stationery

          Products Co. &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1999 Delhi 19. In the said case, the

          Plaintiffs were owner of registered trademark Nataraj. The Defendants

          also used the said trademark and got it registered with the same

          spelling of the word having identical dancing figure of Natraj. It was

          held that adoption of the mark was clearly fraudulent and in spite of

          the long delay, injunction was granted. Of course, in the instant case

          there is difference with regard to the goods and services offered by the

          Plaintiff and the Defendants, yet, as discussed earlier, the Defendants

          adopted the mark just to ride on the reputation of the globally

          established mark ZARA.

<p id="p_64">
MARK ZARA USED BY MANY ENTITIES

</p><p id="p_65">35.       It is urged by the learned senior counsel for the Defendants that the

          mark ZARA is used by many entities and has, therefore, become

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">I.A No.11760 /2013 in CS (OS) No. 1472/ 2013                             Page 21 of 42</span>
           publici juris. In support of his contention, the learned senior counsel

          for the Defendants refers to the case of <a href="/doc/588217/" id="a_3">Hearst Communications, Inc.

          v. Dinesh Varyani &amp; Anr., ILR</a> (2009) 4 Del. 799. In the said case, the

          Plaintiff filed a suit for injunction and passing off of their magazine

          Cosmopolitan               against   Defendants   publishing   their   magazine

          Cosmowoman. In the said case, it was held that the word Cosmo is a

          dictionary word and is also publici juris. A common English word

          cannot be made the basis for passing off action to claim monopoly

          rights unless right to exclusivity is established due to long and durable

          association of the word with the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">36.       The Plaintiff has filed a long list of cases where the Plaintiff‟s mark

          ZARA was protected in Hungary, European Union, Japan, Turkey,

          Czech Republic, Portugal, Uruguay, Spain and Colombia.


</p><p id="p_68">37.       The Defendants on the other hand, relied on third party registrations

          comprising the word ZARA. It is very unfortunate that the words

          HAZARA KEWDA, ZARATOR, LOZAR-A, etc. are sought to be

          claimed similar to the word ZARA by the Defendants. The Defendants

          have given a list of 46 registrations alleged to be containing the mark

          ZARA which is misconceived. Falsity of the Defendants‟ claim can be

          demonstrated by extracting the alleged registered marks similar to

          (Del.) DB, it was held that the Plaintiff is not expected to sue all types

          of infringers who may not be affecting his business. So-called

          concurrent use, if any, cannot be a ground to refuse interim injunction.


</p><p id="p_70">39.       The Defendants have failed to show that the mark ZARA is used by a

          large number of persons, yet even if it is used by any other person, it

          will not disentitle the Plaintiff to seek relief against the Defendants if

          it is otherwise entitled to the same.

DELAY AND ACQUIESCENCE

</p><p id="p_72">40.       It is urged by the learned senior counsel for the Defendants that the

          Defendants entered into Restaurant and Bar business in India several

          years before the Plaintiff even contemplated entering into the Indian

           market. There were various news papers, articles, advertisements and

          widespread write-ups in the press from March, 2003. The Defendants

          obtained a bar licence in the name of ZARA TAPAS BAR in the year

          2002. Defendant no.1‟s first trademark application under no. 1195357

          was published in Journal No. 1327 (Suppl. III) dated 17.01.2005. On

          19.12.2007, Defendant no.1 filed its Affidavit in support of its

          application and the Plaintiff also filed an opposition to the registration.

          It is thus, contended by the learned senior counsel for the Defendants

          that the Plaintiff chose to wait for 8½ years from 17.01.2005 to

          29.07.2013 to file the instant suit. On account of long delay, there is

          acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is, therefore,

          disentitled to the relief of ad interim injunction. In support of his

          contention, the learned counsel for the Defendants have referred to the

          reports in <a href="/doc/111758/" id="a_5">Honda Motor Company Ltd. v. Kewal Bros</a>. &amp; Anr., (2002),

          25 PTC 763 (Cal.) and <a href="/doc/588217/" id="a_6">Hearst Communications, Inc. v. Dinesh

          application was published by the Trade Mark Journal, Chennai in the

          year 2007, the Plaintiff filed an opposition to the registration. It is also

          borne out from the record that in the Affidavit dated 14.01.2008 of

          Mr. Antonio Abril Abadin, there was an admission of the Defendants

           doing restaurant business in the name of ZARA TAPAS BAR. At the

          same time, simply because the Defendants obtained a bar licence in

          the name of ZARA TAPAS BAR in the year 2002 or that they started

          their restaurant and hospitality business in the year 2003, the

          Plaintiff‟s knowledge cannot be attributed to that date. Admittedly, the

          instant suit was filed in the year 2013. The parties were in

          correspondence for amicable resolution of the dispute with regard to

          use of the name ZARA since at least February, 2011. In my view,

          once the Plaintiff had filed opposition to the Defendants‟ application

          for registration, this delay of three years will neither amount to

          acquiescence nor this delay will disentitle the Plaintiff to the relief of

          ad interim injunction if it is able to make out a case on merits.

          763 (Cal.) relied upon on behalf of the Defendants, there was a delay

          of 28 years in taking action and there was no evidence on trans-border

          reputation in the year 1970 when the mark was adopted. Thus, the

          injunction was refused on the ground of delay of 28 years as also on

          the plea that the adoption of the mark by the Defendants was bona

          fide.

           ILR (2009) 4 Del. 799, there was not only a delay of four years in

          taking action by the Plaintiff, but there was also no evidence of trans-

          border reputation. In the instant case, I have already held that adoption

          of the mark ZARA with the words TAPAS BAR by the Defendants

          was not bona fide but was fraudulent.

          was held that delay without prejudice is not a good defence. Mere

          delay does not amount to acquiescence. In the absence of satisfactory

          explanation given by the Appellant for adopting the mark Whirlpool

          (although it was registered by the Appellant in India under this name),

          the order of injunction granted in favour of the Plaintiff was upheld.

SUPPRESSION/CONCEALMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS

</p><p id="p_85">47.       It is urged by the learned senior counsel for the Defendants that the

          Plaintiff‟s averment about its knowledge of Defendant no.1 carrying

          on business in the name of ZARA TAPAS BAR only on the basis of

          the letter dated 25.02.2011 is contradictory to the averments made in

          the Affidavit dated 14.01.2008 of Mr. Antonio Abril Abadin. It is

          urged that part disclosure of the proceedings without relevant details

          tantamounts to material suppression and concealment disentitling the

          Plaintiff to the discretionary relief of interim or permanent injunction.


</p><p id="p_86">48.       I have already discussed this argument while dealing with the question

          of delay and acquiescence. It may be noted that a party seeking ex-

          parte ad interim injunction is expected to make full disclosure but

          when the matter is heard on merits, both the parties are before the

          Court. The mis-statement of some facts unless it is mala fide will not

          disentitle the Plaintiff to the relief of injunction.


</p><p id="p_87">49.       It is true that statement with regard to the Defendants‟ activities

          coming to the notice of the Plaintiff for the first time in 2011 is not

          correct but at the same time, there is a mention of an Affidavit being

          not very material in the circumstances of this case. I think that the

          Plaintiff‟s statement that it came to know about the Defendants‟

          activities sometime in the year 2011 cannot be said to be a statement

          to non-suit the Plaintiff. I have considered the judgments in <a href="/doc/113963352/" id="a_13">S.P.

                    awareness of the same reaches even the shores of those

                    a product is launched and hits the market in one country,
                    the cognizance of the same is also taken by the people in
                    other countries almost at the same time by getting
                    acquainted with it through advertisements in newspapers,
                    magazines, television, video films, cinema etc. even
                    though there may not be availability of the product in
                    those countries because of import restrictions or other
                    factors. In today's world it cannot be said that a product
                    and the trade mark under which it is sold abroad, does
                    not have a reputation or goodwill in countries where it is

                    of knowledge of a trade mark in respect of a product
                    through advertisement in media amounts to use of the
                    trade mark whether or not the advertisement is coupled

                     reputation. Thus, if a mark in respect of a drug is
                    associated with the respondents worldwide it would lead
                    to an anomalous situation if an identical mark in respect
                    of a similar drug is allowed to be sold in India. However,
                    one note of caution must be expressed. Multinational
                    corporations, which have no intention of coming to India
                    or introducing their product in India should not be
                    allowed to throttle an Indian company by not permitting
                    it to sell a product in India, if the Indian company has
                    genuinely adopted the mark and developed the product
                    and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate test should
                    be, who is first in the market.

                    are in respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact
                    that the respondents have not been using the mark in
                    India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world
                    market. The Division Bench had relied upon material
                    which prima facie shows that the Respondents' product
                    was advertised before the Appellants entered the field.
                    On the basis of that material the Division Bench has
                    concluded that the Respondents were first to adopt the
                    mark. If that be so, then no fault can be found with the
                    conclusion drawn by the Division Bench."

<p id="p_114">64.       In the instant case, although there was no ZARA store in India opened

          prior to 2010 but the mark ZARA (word) was registered in Class 25

          since 1993. The Plaintiff has placed on record a number of documents

          to show that it was getting the fabrication done from various exporters

          in India. Some of the documents, particularly at pages 219, 259, 260,

          262, 263 and 266 of the Plaintiff Documents reveal that the clothes

          with mark ZARA were being got fabricated in India by Inditex.

          century, there is widespread dissemination of information through the

          internet and television. ZARA was catering to the middle class and

          higher middle class. Consumers in India cannot be unaware of the

          Plaintiff‟s company and its product.

</p><p id="p_117">66.       To sum up, the Defendants‟ adoption of the mark ZARA TAPAS

          BAR and ZARA, the Restaurant and Bar has been found to be adopted

          dishonestly and fraudulently. The explanation as to the manner of

          adoption of the name and that it has a dictionary meaning is found to

          be not convincing. The mark ZARA (word) is being used prominently

          with very small words "TAPAS BAR" which indicates the

          Defendants‟ intention to ride on the Plaintiff‟s reputation as ZARA

          was a well known mark even in the year 2003 having its presence in

          over 44 countries and annual turnover of 3 million Euros. Thus, the

          Plaintiff, in my considered opinion, has a good prima facie case

          entitling it to protection of the mark even in relation to dissimilar

          goods and services. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of

          the Plaintiff in view of the fact that the mark was not only well known

          worldwide but was also registered in India in Class 25 in the year

          1993.

          loss and injury in case its mark is not protected and the Defendants are
