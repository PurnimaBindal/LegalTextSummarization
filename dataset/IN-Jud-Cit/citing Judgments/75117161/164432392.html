CORAM:
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA

1.     By this application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC the

Plaintiff seeks ad-interim injunction in favour of the Plaintiff and against the

Defendant in relation to the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ or any other mark

identically or deceptively similar to the Plaintiff‟s mark „4T PREMIUM‟

amounting to infringement of the Plaintiff‟s registered trademark under No.

1261544 or leading to passing off the goods or business of the Defendant as

that of the Plaintiff.

2.     Learned counsel for the Plaintiff contends that the Plaintiff is a 50-50

joint venture of Valvoline International Incorporation, USA and Cummins

India Limited, the two 500 Fortune Company, that is, Ashland Inc. and




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                 Page 1 of 19
 Cummins. Inc. The Plaintiff is India‟s fastest growing lubricant marketer and

producer of quality branded automotive/industrial products. The Plaintiff‟s

products include automotive lubricants, transmission fluids, gear oil,

hydraulic lubricants, automotive filters, specialty products, greases and

cooling system products. The Plaintiff‟s products are available in more than

15,000 retail counters across India.   The products of the Plaintiff are

imported under various famous trademarks one of which is „4T PREMIUM‟

which has been used extensively, continuously and uninterruptedly by the

Plaintiff since the year 2003 in India. The Plaintiff has been manufacturing

and selling multi-grade engine oils under the trade name „4T PREMIUM‟

under the strict quality control and supervision. The products of the Plaintiff

under the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ improve engine life and provide

maximum power, besides giving special protection to air cooled engines of

four stroke motorcycles and are thus recommended for use in four stroke

model Hero Honda, Bajaj, TVS, Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda, Kinetic

Engineering, LML and all other makes. The Plaintiff is the proprietor of the

trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ in Class-4 for engine oils vide registration No.

1261544 dated 16th January, 2004.

 3.     Learned counsel for the Plaintiff states that the plaintiff does not claim

any exclusive right in the use of mark "4T" which indicates four stroke

engine oil as number of other companies are marketing the same however,

the Plaintiff is aggrieved by the Defendants use of the trademark „4T

PREMIUM‟ which is likely to lead to the confusion and deception amongst

the members of the public. The Defendant is neither registered proprietor

nor has filed any trademark application for registration of the trademark „4T

PREMIUM‟. The Defendant has adopted the Plaintiff‟s trademark „4T

PREMIUM‟ with mala fide intention, hence the Defendant is liable to be

injuncted from using the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟. Though number of

companies is using "4T" but none is using „4T PREMIUM‟ and only one

other company Veedol is using the same to which also the Plaintiff has given

a notice. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_1">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma vs.

Khosla vs. Anil Aggarwal and another</a>, 2007 (34) PTC 370 Delhi.

4.     Learned counsel for the Defendant on the other hand contends that the

Plaintiff cannot claim exclusive right either in the word "4T" or "4T

PREMIUM" because the word "4T" denotes four stroke engine and the word




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                  Page 3 of 19
 PREMIUM is a laudatory word descriptive of the goods and no-one can

claim the right to use the word exclusively.           The Defendant uses its

trademark „AGIP‟ with „4T PREMIUM‟. The packing of the Defendant is

totally different from the Plaintiff and thus there can neither be any

infringement nor passing of the Defendant‟s goods as that of the Plaintiff.

The Defendant has never used the mark „4T PREMIUM‟ separately and has

always used the same with its trade name „AGIP‟. The Defendant has

already filed an application for cancellation of the Plaintiff‟s trademark

before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board as the same could not have

been registered in the first instance itself. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/114822719/" id="a_3">Puma

5.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties.

 6.     The present suit was filed on 18th October, 2011 when summons in the

suit and notice in the present application was issued. The present application

is pending since then and no ad-interim ex-parte injunction was granted to

the Plaintiff till date. In the meantime pleadings and admission/denial of the

suit are complete and thus issues have been framed however, since the

Defendant has already filed an application before the Intellectual Property

Appellate Board for cancellation of the Plaintiffs trademark the present suit

is directed to be stayed under Section 124 of the Trademark Act. Since the

stay of the proceedings in the suit is not a bar in deciding the application

under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC this Court has proceeded to hear the

application.

7.     The case of the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff is using the trademark „4T

PREMIUM‟ exclusively, continuously and uninterruptedly since the year

2003 in India. The advertising, publicity and sales promotion expenses of

the Plaintiff for the period from 1996-2010 are approximately Rs.

11,92,645,334/-. The claim of the Plaintiff is that due to the extensive

advertising and promotional activities undertaken by it the goods of the

Plaintiff under the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ have become extremely




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                  Page 5 of 19
 popular amongst the consumers at large. The sales figures of the engine oil

under the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ are as follows:

           Year                     Volume (Ltrs)            Value (Rs.)
        2004-2005                               22555                 2,454,059
        2005-2006                              103905               11,855,251
        2006-2007                               47774                 6,881,965
        2007-2008                              141641               15,950,705
        2008-2009                              324701               43,151,502
        2009-2010                              406164               56,972,239
        2010-2011                              412854               62,296,659



8.     It is the claim of the Plaintiff that the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ has

come to be identified with that of the Plaintiff. It has lost its primary

meaning and has acquired a secondary significance as distinctive trademark

used in the course of the trade indicating a source, an indicator and symbol

of highest standard of quality.         The Plaintiff applied for and obtained

registration of the trademark „4T PREMIUM‟ in India in Class-4 for engine

oils vide registration No. 1261544 on 16th January, 2004 claiming its user

since 30th September, 2003. It is the admitted case of the Plaintiff that it has

no objection to the use of mark "4T" simplicitor which the other players in

the market are using such as CASTROL POWER, RS GPS 4T, SERVO 4T




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                 Page 6 of 19
 ZOOM, REPSOL 4T RIDER, RELIABLE 4T, HIZOL HONDA 4-T PLUS.

The claim of the plaintiff is to the use of the mark „4T PREMIUM‟ because

the Plaintiff‟s mark has acquired distinctive significance and is now

associated with the product of the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiff, the

Defendant dishonestly and with malafide intention is using the trademark of

the Plaintiff, infringing its trademark and passing of its goods as that of the

Plaintiff. The case of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff cannot claim any

exclusive right to use the word 4T as the same indicates „four stroke engine

oil‟ and the word premium is a totally descriptive of the goods, is laudatory

in nature and has no trademark significance attached to it. There are other

companies which are using 4T premium with their lubricants with the name

of their company or Extra Premium etc. The use of word PREMIUM in the

oil products is common and global. The Trademark of the Plaintiff has been

wrongly registered and the Defendant has filed an application challenging

the same. The labels of the Plaintiff‟s products and the Defendant‟s products

are entirely different. The colour prints of the same are also totally different.

There is no resemblance between the VALVOLINE 4T PREMIUM of the

Plaintiff and AGIP 4T PREMIUM of the Defendant. The Defendant has

also given his consolidated sales figure. According to the Defendant it




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                  Page 7 of 19
 launched its product AGIP 4T PREMIUM in the year 2007 as AGIP 4T

RED and AGIP SUPER 4T. In August, 2008 the Defendant marketed and

upgraded its products by introducing AGIP 4T RED, AGIP 4T PLUS, AGIP

4T PREMIUM and AGIP 4T ECO. It further upgraded its products in the

year 2011. The use of words RED, PLUS, PREMIUM, ECO and FURY are

totally descriptive, common to trade and have no trademark significance.

9.     A perusal of the product of the Plaintiff shows that it uses the name of

its company before 4T PREMIUM, that is, VALVOLINE 4T PREMIUM

and not simplicitor „4T PREMIUM‟. Similarly the Defendant has though

used the word 4T PREMIUM however, the container also depicts its logo

and the company name AGIP. Packaging and colouring etc. of the two

products are totally different.

10     In Marico Ltd. (Supra) while dealing with the trademark „LOW

ABSORB‟ the Division bench of this Court held that in light of ratio laid

down in case of <a href="/doc/204866/" id="a_9">Cadila Healthcare Ltd. v. Gujrat Co-operative Milk

Marketing Federation Ltd. and Ors</a>.2009 (8) AD (Delhi) 350, the Appellant

can have no exclusive ownership rights on the Trade Mark LOW ABSORB.

It was further held that it is unable to hold that the appellant's trademark

"Sugar Free" is a coined word; at best it is a combination of two popular




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                Page 8 of 19
 English words. This Court upheld the order of the learned Single Judge

refusing the injunction on the point that besides the word LOW ABSORB

TECHNOLOGY‟ the prominent trademark of the Defendant „SUNDROP‟

also appeared on the package. The colour scheme of the respective packages

was also different. Similarly this court in Nestle India Ltd. (supra) refused to

set aside the interim injunction granted on the ground that the expression

„YO‟ cannot be equated with „YO! China‟.            „YO!‟ by itself is not a

trademark. Similarly in The Gillette Company and others (supra) this Court

held that the real question to be answered is that whether there would be

confusion and deception in the minds of the consumers. It held that it was

difficult to agree with the submissions of the Plaintiff therein that the use of

trademark „EKCO FLEXGRIP‟ by the Defendant would create confusion

with the Plaintiff‟s trademark „LUXOR PAPER MATE FLEXGRIP‟. It was

held that if the complete trademarks adopted by the two parties are

compared, the same are totally different and confusion seems to be unlikely.

In Rich Products Corporation and another (supra) this Court held that

despite the word „Whip Topping‟ being a common word, the combinations

were totally different in „RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING‟ and „BELLS WHIP

TOPPING. It was held:




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                 Page 9 of 19
        36. Since lengthy submissions were made by both sides with
       respect to whether or not "WHIP TOPPING" is a generic and/or
       a descriptive expression, it may be necessary to briefly touch
       upon this aspect of the matter. The word 'generic' ordinarily
       would mean that which has character of or belongs to a genus
       or class (see New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition
       1993 at page 1074); whereas the word 'descriptive' would mean
       that which seeks to describe, characterized by description,
       consist of or concern with description or observable things or
       qualities (see New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition
       1993 at page 644). Whether a word or expression is 'generic' or
       'descriptive' or both is dependent on the facts and circumstances
       arising in a particular case. It is quite possible that a word or
       expression which is 'generic', i.e., which refers to a genus or a
       class is also descriptive as the word by itself characterize the
       qualities of the product. The line dividing the two in certain
       cases may get blurred. The word 'whip' by itself means, in the
       context of the present case, a light fluffy desert made with
       whipped cream or beaten eggs (see New Shorter Oxford
       English Dictionary, Edition 1993at page 3670), while the word
       'topping' means a top layer or garnish put on food (see New
       Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993 at page 3342).
       Similarly, the word 'cream' means part of liquid that gathers at
       the top; froth etc. or a liquid rich in droplets or particles of the
       dispersed phase that forms a separate (especially upper) layer in
       an emulsion or suspension when it is allowed to stand or is
       centrifuged (see New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,
       Edition 1993 at page 543). The words "Whip Topping", when
       juxtaposed would, in my view, be representative of toppings or
       garnishes for food items which have cream like quality.
       Therefore, it is, in my opinion, both 'generic' as well as
       'descriptive' of the product. The submission of Mr Gupta that
       the words 'WHIP TOPPING' is distinctive because it relates to a
       non-dairy product is not substantiated by any evidence on
       record which would demonstrate that the words "WHIP
       TOPPING" are associated only with a cream which is not dairy
       based.




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                   Page 10 of 19
        37. It is not disputed by the learned Counsel for the
       defendant, as it cannot be, that descriptive words and
       expression can be registered. Even if they are not registered
       they can be protected, provided it has attained secondary
       distinctive meaning by its extensive use and publicity. In other
       words use is a question of degree. What one needs to ask
       oneself is whether the descriptive mark has become the trade
       mark. The defendant can ward off a challenge in respect of a
       mark in which the plaintiff claims proprietorship rights and
       seeks to enforce his rights whether on the basis of the
       registration or otherwise; on the ground that the trade mark is a
       descriptive word or consists of words which are descriptive of
       the character and quality of the product as long as the use is
       bonafide or that the descriptive word is well known or used
       extensively by third parties.

       38. The plaintiff, in order to demonstrate that "WHIP
       TOPPING" has attained secondary distinctive meaning, has
       relied upon the affidavits of PW1 to PW4. The plaintiffs'
       witnesses attempted to prove the extensive promotion of its
       trade mark "RICH'S WHIP TOPPING" through indices such as
       the world wide turnover of its product, which included the sales
       in India, the amount spent on promotional material and the
       extensive publicity received over the years in newspapers and
       journals both in India and abroad. I have already observed
       hereinabove the use of the mark by itself does not translate into
       distinctiveness. The distinctiveness should be of an order which
       displaces the "primary descriptive meaning" of the word. The
       evidence placed before me falls well short of this standard.
       Assuming that one were to accept the evidence produced as an
       indicator of the fact that words "WHIP TOPPING", which is
       part of the plaintiffs' trade mark "RICH'S WHIP TOPPING",
       has attained secondary distinctive meaning, the very fact in at
       least in two jurisdictions i.e., the USA and the New Zealand the
       plaintiffs' mark "RICH'S WHIP TOPPING" has been registered
       with limitation. While the U.S. registration excludes use of the
       word 'Topping'; the New Zealand company office has excluded
       the use of the words "WHIP TOPPING". Even in India the




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                Page 11 of 19
        plaintiffs have of their own accord disclaimed their right to the
       letter 'S' and the word 'Topping'. In these circumstances, I am
       not persuaded to hold that the use of the words "WHIP
       TOPPING" by the defendant in its trade mark "BELLS WHIP
       TOPPING" would infringe either the statutory rights vested in
       the plaintiffs' registered trade mark "RICH'S WHIP
       TOPPING", or even constitute violation of any common law
       rights that the plaintiffs would have in its mark "RICH'S WHIP
       TOPPING" for the reasons given herein below. In the context
       of what is said by me above, there is therefore also no necessity
       for me to deal with the submission that the defence of
       "character" and "quality" referred to in <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_10">Section 35</a> of the Trade
       Marks Act are used in the adjectible sense, though I have
       doubts about the tenability of this argument. The example most
       commonly used, which comes to my mind, is that of a 'soap'.
       Can 'soap' be used by itself as a mark? The answer in my
       opinion is clearly in the negative since it describes the product;
       however, it nevertheless is a noun.

11.    In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma (surpa) relied upon by learned

counsel for the Plaintiff the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that an action for

passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance an action for

deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another,

that is not the gist of an action for infringement.            The action for

infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a

registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of

the trade mark in relation to those goods. It was further held that where the

similarity between the Plaintiff‟s and Defendant‟s mark is too close either

visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that




IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                 Page 12 of 19
 there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the

Plaintiff‟s rights are violated. It was held that if two marks are identical, no

further question arises and the infringement is made out. When the two

marks are not identical, the Plaintiff would have to establish that the mark

used by the Defendant so nearly resembles the Plaintiff‟s registered

trademark as is likely to deceive a false conclusion in relation to the goods in

respect of which it is registered.

12.    <a href="/doc/204866/" id="a_11">In Cadila Healthcare Ltd. v. Gujrat Co-operative Milk Marketing

Federation Ltd. and Ors</a>. 2009 (VIII) AD 350 it was held:

       8.     In our view, at this juncture i.e. at the interim stage, even
       assuming distinctiveness claimed by the appellant in its favor
       qua its artificial sweetener, the appellant has rightly been
       declined an injunction by the learned Single Judge since it is
       evident and has indeed been found by the learned Single Judge
       that the use of the term 'Sugar Free' by the respondent is not in</pre>
<p id="p_1">       the trademark sense but as a common descriptive adjective. The
       learned Single Judge has found and in our view rightly that the
       respondent has not used the expression in a trademark sense but
       only in a descriptive sense in the following passage:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               54. It is important to be borne in mind that use of a
               descriptive expression as a trade mark by a trader,
               irrespective of the said trade mark having acquired a
               secondary meaning and distinctiveness in relation to the
               trader's products, does not entitle such trader from
               precluding other traders from using the said expression
               for the purposes of describing the characteristic features
               of their products. I have no hesitation in stating, albeit
               without prejudice to the rights and interests of the
               plaintiff in the present suit, that by adopting such a purely




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA 16704/2011 in CS(OS) 2597/2011                                    Page 13 of 19</span>
                descriptive and laudatory expression 'Sugar Free' as its
               trade mark, the plaintiff must be prepared to tolerate
               some degree of confusion which is inevitable owing to
               the wide spread use of such trade mark by fellow
               competitors. Simply because the plaintiff claims to be
               using the expression 'Sugar Free' as a trade mark much
               prior to the launch of the defendant's product Pro Biotic
               Frozen Dessert in the market does not give this Court a
               good ground for imposing a blanket injunction on the
               defendant from using the expression 'Sugar Free',
               especially when the defendant intends to use this
               expression only in its descriptive sense and not as a trade
               mark, and even otherwise, when the use of this
               expression is widespread in relation to foods and
               beverages.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               We fully agree with and reaffirm the said finding.
</blockquote><p id="p_2">       9.     We are unable to hold that the appellant's trademark
       'Sugar Free' is a coined word; at best it is a combination of two
       popular English words. The mere fact that the appellant's
       product cannot be directly consumed or eaten and merely is an
       additive does not detract from the descriptive nature of the trade
       mark. Once a common phrase in the English language which
       directly describes the product is adopted by a business
       enterprise, such adoption naturally entails the risk that others in
       the field would also be entitled to use such phrases provided no
       attempt is made to ride on the band wagon of the appellant's
       indubitably market leading product 'Sugar Free'. In this
       connection, merely because the attributes of 'sugar free' can be
       described by other phrases cannot detract from the common
       usage of the phrase 'Sugar Free' as denoting products which do
       not contain sugar and any trader which adopts such mark in the
       market place, does so with the clear knowledge of the
       possibility of other traders also using the said mark. That is
       precisely the reason for the denial of protection to such marks
       by       refusing      registration     as       envisaged      by
       <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_12">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_13">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_14">35</a> of the Act. The said Sections read as

       ground for refusal of registration of a mark unless it has
       acquired a distinctive character. The expression can at best be
       said distinctive qua the artificial sweetener of the appellant and
       mere starting of the marketing of the drink 'sugar free D'lite'
       cannot give the appellant the right to claim distinctiveness in
       the expression 'Sugar Free' in relation to all the food products.
