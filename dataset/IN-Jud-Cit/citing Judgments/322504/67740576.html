                               JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The question involved in the Writ Petition is whether the order

issued by Air India Charterers Ltd. (AICL) debarring the petitioner

from participating in any of the tenders floated at Cochin for a period

of three years, in conformity with the Central Vigilance Commission

guidelines which provide for blacklisting the contractors, without

affording an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner is legal and

proper.

<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">      2.    The petitioner, Karnataka Commercial and Industrial

Corporation Pvt. Ltd. submitted tender for the award of contract for

providing dedicated teams for enhanced passenger handling

including their baggage at the Cochin International Airport, pursuant

to the tender notification dated 8.1.2010. The technical bid was

opened on 1.2.2010. On evaluation of the technical bids, it was

found that the petitioner and seven others were qualified.           The

commercial bids were opened on 18.2.2010. The petitioner's bid

Letter Of Intent (LOI) to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">       3.   According to the petitioner, he was invited for tender

negotiation meeting on 23.2.2010 at Cochin.         According to the

respondents, that was not a negotiation meeting, but it was a

meeting for a briefing on the activities to be carried out by the

petitioner. The petitioner sought clarifications on nine items as per

Ext.P3 communication dated 1.3.2010. One of the items on which

clarification sought for was regarding gross salary of the personnel to

be deputed by the petitioner. According to the tender document, the

salary payable to the personnel have been indicated. The petitioner

contended that the gross salary means the total costs incurred by the

service provider (petitioner) and the gross salary would include all

employee related expenses, namely, salary, house rent allowance,

transport allowance, overtime allowance, leave salary, statutory

bonus payable under the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_1">Payment of Bonus Act</a> and gratuity payable

under the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_2">Payment of Gratuity Act</a>, 1972.

<p id="p_9">personnel to be employed by the petitioner.            As per Ext.P4

communication dated 4.3.2010 issued to the petitioner, it was

suggested by the respondents that a meeting be held to finalize the

matters.     The petitioner, as per Ext.P5 communication dated

5.3.2010, replied that no further meeting was required and the

petitioner   had    already   stated    their views   in   the  earlier

communication.        The petitioner requested to incorporate the

clarifications in the Letter Of Intent. As per Ext.P6, the respondents

again invited the petitioner for a discussion, to which, the petitioner

sent Ext.P7 reply. Thereafter on 12.4.2010, Ext.P8 Letter Of Intent

was issued to the petitioner. Even after the issue of the Letter Of

Intent, a meeting between the parties took place at Mumbai on

6.5.2010, evidenced by Ext.P10 minutes, wherein it is recorded thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "During the meeting, M/s.KCIC (P) Ltd. have

       informed that based on the terms of the LOI, they would

       not be able to provide the required manpower as they

       misunderstood the requirement of AICL."



</blockquote><p id="p_10">Thereafter on 12.5.2010, AICL issued Ext.P11 communication to the

petitioner stating thus:
</p>
<p id="p_11">              "In view of the above, we have no other option but

       to rescind the Letter of Intent (LOI) and further debar

<p id="p_12">       your organization from participating in any of the tender

       floated at Cochin for a period of three years from 06 May

       2010 to 05 May 2013, as per the existing policy of the

       company, which is in conformity with the CVC

       guidelines."
</p>
<p id="p_13">

Ext.P11, to the extent to which it debars the petitioner from

participating in the tender for a period of three years, is challenged in

this Writ Petition. In other words, the rescission of the Letter Of

Intent made as per Ext.P11 is not challenged by the petitioner.



</p><p id="p_14">       5. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondents 1 to 3,

the issue of Ext.P11 was justified. According to the respondents,

there was no negotiation meeting as claimed by the petitioner and

the various meetings were held since the petitioner raised several

objections and sought clarifications.        Ext.P3 communication was

issued by the petitioner as if the claims were mutually agreed upon.

The claims regarding salary, overtime etc. were not agreed upon and

therefore, the request in Ext.P3 could not be accepted.             The

petitioner reiterated his contentions in the later communications as

well. In the meeting held on 6.5.2010, in which the representative of

the petitioner also participated, it was confirmed that clause 6 of the

</p>
<p id="p_15">LOI relating to payment of salary is not acceptable to the petitioner

and they also confirmed that they would not be able to provide the

required manpower. It is further stated in the counter affidavit thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "It is submitted that the respondents are governed

      by the Manual of the company, which was drawn up

      after the merger of Air India Limited and Indian Airlines

      Limited. The Manual incorporates the latest guidelines

      issued by the Central Vigilance Commission as well as

      notifications issued by the various regulatory authorities.

      Clause 13.9 of the Manual reads as follows:


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "13.9-         In case the LI vendor backs out,
             either      before       issue      of     Purchase
             Order/Letter          Of     Intent      (LOI)        or
             subsequent to its issue, the LI vendor
             should be black listed for a minimum
             period of three years.                 This would,
             however, be subject to the Purchase
             Order/LOI having been issued within the
             period of validity of the quotation.                  In
             addition, the EMD/SD of the vendor
             would also be forfeited.""</blockquote><p id="p_16">


</p><p id="p_17">      6. In the reply affidavit filed by the petitioner, it is stated that in

the tender document, terms were incorporated without clarity and

certainty. The tender conditions were vague, which necessitated

W.P.(C) NO.16045 OF 2010

                                    :: 6 ::
</p>
<p id="p_18">further discussion in several meetings. That there was uncertainty in

the terms relating to certain important aspects in the original tender

is clear from the re-tender issued for the same work by the

respondents, in which, matters have been clarified. It is also stated

that the tender in question was the first of its kind issued by the

respondents. Earlier, the respondents were inviting tenders quoting

rates per flight for rendering comprehensive ground handling service.

For the first time, the respondents invited tenders on "manpower

basis". When a new system was introduced, naturally there was

some confusion, uncertainty and vagueness.         The difference of

opinion regarding "gross salary" arose in the first meeting held on

23.2.2010 itself. Subsequently, prolonged discussions took place in

respect of these matters. Several other clarifications sought for by

the petitioner were accepted by the respondents.             In these

circumstances, the petitioner had no other alternative but to withdraw

from the contract.      Debarring the petitioner from participating in

tenders floated at Cochin for a period of three years really amounts

to blacklisting even according to the respondents. Such blacklisting

was made without affording an opportunity of being heard to the

petitioner.

<p id="p_20">       7. Sri.Abraham Vakkanal, learned senior counsel appearing

for the petitioner, submitted that blacklisting, that too without

affording an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner, really affects

the constitutional and civil rights of the petitioner. It is submitted that

Ext.P11, to the extent to which it is challenged in the Writ Petition, is

violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_3">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.



</p><p id="p_21">       8.    In Black's Law Dictionary, the meaning of the term

"blacklist" is given as follows:

<p id="p_22">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">               "Blacklist:   A list of persons marked out for

       special avoidance, antagonism, or enmity on the part of

       those who prepare the list or those among whom it is

       intended    to   circulate;  as   where     a  trades-union

       "blacklists" workmen who refuse to conform to its rules,

       or where a list of insolvent or untrustworthy persons is

       published by a commercial agency or mercantile

       association. Such practices are prohibited by statute in

       most states."</blockquote><p id="p_23">

rights, fundamental or otherwise. It was also held by the majority

that "a mere refusal to afford a man the prospect of doing profitable

or unprofitable business with the Government, of entering into

advantageous relationships with the Government as it has been put,

entails no civil consequences however serious a blow that might be

to the person concerned. The principle of natural justice cannot be

invoked in such a case unless <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">article 14</a> is attracted. And <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_7">article 14</a>

      government can be forced to do so.       It is one thing to

      say that government, like any other private citizen, can

      enter into contract with any person it pleases, but a

      totally different thing to say that government can

      unreasonably put a person's name in a blacklist and

      debar him from entering into any contractual relationship

      with the government for years to come. In the former

      case, it might be said that Government is exercising its

      right like any other private citizen but no democratic

      government should with impunity pass a proceeding

      which will have civil consequences to a citizen without

      notice and an opportunity of being heard."
</p>
<p id="p_31">

It was also held by Justice K.K.Mathew that blacklisting and

debarring the contractor from taking any government work for ten

years by way of punishment is against all notions of fairness in a

democratic country.

sought for by the petitioner were approved. The clarification sought

for by the petitioner in respect of "gross salary" was not accepted by

the respondents. However, it is to be noted that the term "gross

salary" was explained and defined in the subsequent tender issued

by the respondents. Therefore, I do not think that blacklisting the

petitioner and debarring him from participating in any tender floated

it was made without affording an opportunity of being heard to the

in the Manual which provides for blacklisting should not be applied

mechanically.     Clause 13.9 of the Manual which provides for

blacklisting on the mere ground of the vendor backing out, does not

apply to each and every case in which a contractor could not comply

with the terms of the agreement. There may be circumstances in

which a contractor may be justified in backing out. There may be

unforeseen circumstances which may justify the contractor in

backing out. There may be supervening circumstances which may

justify backing out. There may be several other situations which the

contracting parties could not comprehend, and the ground realities

may be found otherwise than what was meant and understood by the

contracting parties. There may be mutual mistake or mistake on the

side of one party on the basis of wrong understanding of the ground

realities. It cannot be said that in all cases where a contractor backs

out, his acts are contumacious, deliberate, wilful or in defiance of the

terms agreed upon. Each case depends on the facts obtaining in

that case. A unilateral decision by one of the contracting parties,

who is in a dominating position, to blacklist a contractor on the mere

ground that he backed out, unmindful of the consequences and

is wrong and illegal. If the decision to blacklist is taken without

affording an opportunity of being heard to the affected party, it adds

to the illegality and the order blacklisting the contractor is liable to be

struck down. "Debarring" as mentioned in Ext.P11 was admittedly

on the basis of the Central Vigilance Commission guidelines which

speak of blacklisting. Though the word "blacklisted" is not used in

Ext.P11, it really amounts to blacklisting. Ext.P11 is violative of the

fundamental rights of the petitioner enshrined in Articles 14, 19(1)(g)

and 21 of the Constitution of India.
