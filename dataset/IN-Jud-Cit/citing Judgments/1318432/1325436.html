</p><p id="p_2">2.   12.08.2011                    This Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is
                  filed by the elected councilors of the Patna Municipal Corporation
                  to challenge the constitutional validity of the second proviso of
                  Section 41 of the Bihar Municipal Act 2007 (hereinafter referred
                  to as 'the Act') as violative of <a href="/doc/220803/" id="a_2">Article 243P(e)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_3">                                   <a href="/doc/586850/" id="a_3">Article 243P</a> of the Constitution incorporates
                  definitions. Clause (e) thereof defines 'Municipality' to mean "an
                  institution of self-government constituted under <a href="/doc/15169/" id="a_4">article 243Q".</a>
                  Section 41 of the Act provides for appointment of officers of the
                  State Government for municipalities. The said Section empowers
                  the State Government to appoint the officers of the Government as
                  executive officers of the Municipal Corporation or class of
                  municipal councils or Nagar Panchayats. The proviso thereto
                  provides that the officers so appointed shall be under the
                  administrative control of the Empowered Standing Committee.
                  The said proviso also empowers the State Government to
                  withdraw such officers suo motu or if a resolution to that effect is
                  passed by the Councilors at a meeting called for that purpose by a
                  2/3rd majority of the total number of councilors holding office for
                  the time being. The impugned proviso has been added under
                  Section 17 of the Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Act, 2011. The
                  impugned proviso added under the aforesaid 2011 Act reads as
                  under:-
</p><p id="p_4">                                      "Provided          further     that   resolution
                               regarding withdrawal of the officer shall not be
                               taken within one year of the posting of the
                               officer."
</p><p id="p_5">                                           Thus, the above proviso curtails the power of

            the councilors of the Municipality/Municipal Corporation to pass a
            resolution for withdrawal of the Municipal Officer for one year
            from the date such officer assumes charge. It is the aforesaid
            proviso which is under challenge before us.
</p><p id="p_6">                             Learned advocate            Mr.   S.B.K.    Mangalam has
            appeared for the writ petitioners. He has submitted that the
            Municipal Corporation is an institution of self-governance. The
            officers of the State are posted in the Corporation as its executive
            officers. By virtue of the first proviso to Section 41 of the Act,
            they are under the administrative control of the Standing
            Committee. If such officers do not perform the duties as directed
            by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Corporation, the
            Municipal Corporation cannot                   function.   The   Corporation,
            therefore, should have the power to enforce removal of such
            officers. That power is conferred by first proviso to Section 41 of
            the Act. The said power conferred by the first proviso has now
            been curtailed under the aforesaid second proviso inserted in the
            Act. The curtailment of the power under second proviso to Section
            41 of the Act defeats the purpose of self-governance of the
            Municipal Corporation. Thus, violates <a href="/doc/220803/" id="a_5">Article 243P(e)</a> of the
            Constitution.
</p><p id="p_7">                             In course of his submission Mr. Mangalam has cited
            instances of insubordination by the respondent No. 5, the
            Municipal Commissioner. He has submitted that the resolution
            passed by the Councilors of the Municipal Corporation to request
            the Government to withdraw respondent No. 5 has been turned
            down by the State Government under its communication dated 28 th
            July 2011. Mr. Mangalam has also taken us to Section 36 of the
            Act. In support of his argument, he has relied upon the judgments

            of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_6">Rai Sahib Ram
            Jawaya Kapur and others v. The State of Punjab</a>, [AIR 1955 SC

</p><p id="p_8">                             The Petition is contested by the learned Additional
            Advocate General-1 Mr. Lalit Kishore. He has submitted that no
            provision of an enactment can be held ultra vires unless it
            contravenes any of the provisions of the Constitution or it is
            beyond the legislative competence of the State. In the present case,
            it is not the allegation of the petitioners that the impugned proviso
            has been inserted without the authority of law. He has submitted
            that <a href="/doc/220803/" id="a_8">Article 243P(e)</a> contains the definition of the 'Municipality'.
            The impugned proviso in no manner contravenes the definition of
            the word 'Municipality' incorporated in the aforesaid <a href="/doc/220803/" id="a_9">Article
            243P(e).</a> In absence of any other challenge, the challenge to the
            constitutional validity of the impugned proviso inserted under
            Section 17 of the 2007 Act shall fail. He has further submitted that
            the legislative wisdom of the State cannot be questioned. In
            support thereof he has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
            Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/736467/" id="a_10">Sardar Sarup Singh and others v.
            State of Punjab and others</a>, [AIR 1959 SC 860], particularly

            occasion to consider the executive order made by the State of
            Punjab in respect of printing and publishing the text-books. The
            order was challenged as being violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_12">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
            Constitution. While considering the constitutional validity of the
            said executive order the Hon'ble Supreme Court discussed the

            nature of our Constitution thus, "Our Constitution, though
            federal in its           structure,      is    modelled   on the   British
            Parliamentary system where the executive is deemed to have
            the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental
            policy and its transmission into law though the condition
            precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining
            the confidence of the legislative branch of the State.
</p><p id="p_10">                             The executive function comprises both the
            determination of the policy as well as carrying it into
            execution. This evidently includes the initiation of legislation,
            the maintenance of order, the promotion of social and
            economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy, in fact the
            carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the
            State."
