<p id="p_1">VIBHU BAKHRU, J

IA Nos. 1733/2015 &amp; 1732/2015

</p><p id="p_2">1.      The defendant (hereafter „BMPL‟) has filed the afore-captioned
applications under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC (IA No. 1732/2015) and
under Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC (IA No. 1733/2015). By way of IA No.
1732/2015, BMPL prays that suit be dismissed with exemplary costs and in
IA No. 1733/2015, BMPL seeks the following relief:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "It is therefore most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble
        Court may most graciously be pleased to pass a judgment in
        favour of the defendant based on admissions made by the
        Plaintiffs in respect of the allegations and claims made by
        them in respect of infringement of: (i) copyright in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                 Page 1 of 32</span>
         drawings of boom and dipper, (ii) the registered design of
        stabilizer leg, hydraulic tank and diesel tank, (iii)registered
        designs of all components, and (iv) copyright in all
        components as prayed in para 27 (b)."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">2.      Some of the grounds urged in both the applications are common and,
therefore, the same were heard together.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.      Before adverting to the specific rival contentions advanced, it is
expedient to briefly indicate the facts necessary to address the controversy
in these applications.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.      Plaintiff no.1 (hereafter „JBEL‟) is a company incorporated under
the laws of England and is engaged in the manufacture of earth moving and
construction equipment. JBEL claims to be the world‟s largest
manufacturer of "Backhoe Loader" since 1945. Plaintiff no.2 (hereafter
„JIL‟) is a wholly owned subsidiary of JBEL and is engaged in
manufacturing of earth moving and construction equipment in India. It is
stated that JIL commenced operations in India in 1979 as a joint venture
company and in 2002 JBEL acquired the entire paid up share capital of JIL
resulting in JIL becoming the wholly owned subsidiary of JBEL.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.      The plaintiffs filed the above-captioned suit in November 2011 as a
quia timet action alleging imminent infringement of copyright and
registered designs in respect of parts used in manufacture of 3DX Backhoe
Loader (hereafter „the Product‟). The plaintiffs claimed that the Product is
a versatile multipurpose earth moving machine, which can be used both as
an excavator and a loader. It is stated that the Product weighs
approximately seven tonnes and has more than three thousand parts. In the
plaint as originally filed, the plaintiff no.2 claimed that designs relating to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                    Page 2 of 32</span>
</p><p id="p_7"> (i) Boom; (ii) Dipper; (iii) Bucket; and (iv) Stabilizer Leg were being
infringed by the defendants. The designs of the said parts of the Product
were registered under the design registration nos. 200016, 200017, 200018
and 200019. The plaintiffs also alleged infringement of their copyright in
respect of drawings of various components of the Product and claimed that
certain parts manufactured and used in backhoe loader manufactured by
BMPL (hereafter „the infringing Product‟) were substantially reproductions
of the drawings of the components of the Product and this amounted to
infringement of plaintiffs copyright in those drawings. The plaintiffs also
secured an ex parte ad interim injunction. Thereafter, BMPL filed an
application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC (IA 19122/2011) for vacation
of the ad interim injunction. It is stated that there were certain negotiations
between the parties and the ad interim order granted in favour of plaintiffs
was suspended on 12.12.2011. The plaintiffs‟ engineers inspected the
infringing Product on 21.12.2011 and submitted their technical report on
12.04.2012 (hereafter „the technical report‟).
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.      While the settlement talks and negotiations were being held, the
plaintiffs withdrew their applications filed under Order XXXIX Rule 1 &amp; 2
of the CPC (IA No. 18812/ 2011). Consequently, BMPL was no longer
interdicted in manufacturing and selling the infringing Product. This Court
is informed that subsequently the negotiations between the parties for an
amicable settlement failed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.      Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an application under Order VI Rule 17
CPC (IA 11745/2014) for amendment of the plaint. The said application
was allowed on 15.10.2014, as the same was not contested. The present




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                    Page 3 of 32</span>
 applications were moved by BMPL subsequently. Thus, the suit is still at a
pre-trial stage and the issues have not been framed as yet.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.      In its amended plaint, the plaintiff no.2 alleged infringement of
designs in respect of Hydraulic Tank (design registration no. 200007),
Diesel Tank (design registration no.200009), Seat (design registration no.
200011) and Stabilizer Leg (design registration no. 200016). It is also
relevant to mention that BMPL had filed an application for cancelation of
design registration in respect of Stabilizer Leg, which was allowed and the
registration of the said design has been since cancelled. However, an
appeal preferred against such cancellation is pending before the Controller
of Patents.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.      The plaintiffs also claim infringement of their copyright in drawings
in respect of the following parts used in the infringing Product:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   1.    Hose Retainer
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   2.    Side Cutters (LH and RH)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   3.    Tooth of the Bucket and Shovel
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   4.    Wear Pad Upper
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   5.    Wear Pad Lower
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                   6.    Adjuster Assemble
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                   7.    Wear Pad Adjuster
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                   8.    Adjuster Nut
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                   9.    Knobs
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                   10.   Boom Bottom Plate


IA No. 1732/2015

</blockquote><p id="p_12">10.     BMPL claims that the present suit is liable to be dismissed as it does
not disclose any cause of action. Mr Haksar, learned Senior Advocate
appearing on behalf of BMPL contended that the suit was filed as a quia


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                     Page 4 of 32</span>
 timet action at a stage when BMPL had not launched the infringing
Product. The plaintiffs were given full relief by an order passed by this
Court on 25.11.2011 and BMPL was interdicted from launching the
allegedly infringing Product. The plaintiffs inspected the infringing
Product and, thereafter, withdrew their application filed under Order
XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of CPC. He pointed out that the plaintiffs had
expressly pleaded in the plaint that the cause of action would subsist in
favour of the plaintiffs till BMPL was restrained from launching or
exhibiting its product. He stated that once having voluntarily withdrawn
the relief of injunction, no further cause of action survived in favour of the
plaintiffs. He referred to Black‟s Law Dictionary for the definition „quia
timet‟ and also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1742704/" id="a_1">Kuldip
Singh v. Subhash Chander Jain and Ors</a>.: (2000) 4 SCC 50 for
explaining the ambit and nature of such actions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.     Mr Haksar further contended that injunction order was obtained by
the plaintiffs by concealment of the prior actions instituted by the plaintiffs
and/or their affiliated parties for infringement of copyright in drawings of
the parts in question. In those proceedings, it was specifically pleaded that
finished products produced with the help of drawings were functional
items and would not qualify for registration of designs under <a href="/doc/1121428/" id="a_2">Section 2(b)</a>
of the Designs Act, 2000. It was further claimed that the drawings had been
specifically developed to increase the efficiency of finished products. Mr
Haksar contended that since it was clear from the pleadings filed in those
suits that admittedly the drawings were for functional items and, therfore,
incapable of being registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_3">Designs Act</a>, 2000 (hereafter „the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_4">Design Act</a>‟). The present suit claiming infringement of designs in respect



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                    Page 5 of 32</span>
 of components of the Product was wholly contrary to the earlier stand and,
thus, the present suit was liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.     Next, Mr Haksar submitted that by virtue of <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_5">Section 52(1)(w)</a> of the
Copyright Act, 1957 (hereafter the „<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_6">Copyright Act</a>‟), making of three
dimensional objects (allegedly infringing parts) from two dimensional
technical drawings of a purely functional part or a device would not
constitute infringement of copyright and, therefore, the present suit was not
maintainable. He relied on the decision of a Division Bench of this Court
in <a href="/doc/112937069/" id="a_7">Microfibres Inc. v. Girdhar &amp; Co. and Anr</a>.: 2009 (40) PTC 519 (Del)
in support of his contention.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.     Lastly, he submitted that this Court did not have the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the present suit as BMPL‟s factory was located in
Coimbatore and its office is located at NOIDA, Uttar Pradesh and,
therefore, this Court would not have the jurisdiction to entertain the suit for
infringement of designs.        Insofar as infringement of copyright is
concerned, he submitted that the same was barred by virtue of <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_8">Section
52(1)(w)</a> of the Copyright Act. He further submitted that the concept of
"dynamic effects" for attracting territorial jurisdiction, which was relied
upon by the plaintiffs on the strength of the decision of this Court in
<a href="/doc/1514213/" id="a_9">Girdhar Lal Gupta v. M/s K. Gian Chand Jain &amp; Co</a>.: AIR 1978 Delhi

v. Reckitt Benckiser Australia PTY Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.: 2010 2 SCC 535. He also
referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1001948/" id="a_11">Dhodha House v. S.K.
Maingi</a>: (2006) 9 SCC 41 and the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1616484/" id="a_12">Jay

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                    Page 6 of 32</span>
<p id="p_16"> 14.     Mr Pravin Anand, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs
countered the submissions made by Mr Haksar. He referred to the
specification sheet (brochures) of the Product and the infringing Product
and pointed out that certain pages were identical and even the errors that
had crept in the brochure published by the plaintiffs had been slavishly
copied by BMPL. He also referred to certain emails exchanged during the
course of negotiations for an amicable settlement wherein BMPL had
agreed to change some of the parts of the infringing Product. Mr Anand
emphasised that the technical report also indicated a striking similarity
between parts of the Product and the infringing Product. He submitted that
in the aforesaid circumstances, the plaintiffs had established a cause of
action and, thus, the suit could not be dismissed under Order VII Rule 11
of the CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.     Mr Anand, explained that the plaintiffs had withdrawn the interim
application in order to examine the infringing Product in greater detail. He
submitted that at the time when the suit was filed, the BMPL had not
commercially launched the infringing Product and, therefore, the plaintiffs
could not strip down the machine to compare all the parts. He stated that
this was only possible after the plaintiffs had purchased the infringing
Product by way of a resale. He stated that thereafter the plaint was
amended and, therefore, there was no merit in the contention that
withdrawal of an application for interim relief indicated that the plaintiffs
had forfeited their right to agitate their cause. Next, Mr Anand submitted
that the pleadings in other suits could not be referred for considering
whether plaint disclosed a cause of action.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                  Page 7 of 32</span>
<p id="p_18"> 16.     He further countered the submission that the present plaint was
barred under <a href="/doc/37285/" id="a_13">Section 15(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/991805/" id="a_14">15(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_15">52(1)(w)</a> of the Copyright Act. First
of all, he submitted that <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_16">Section 52(1)(w)</a> of the said Act was inapplicable
as it came into force with effect from 21.06.2016 and in the light of the
savings clause under <a href="/doc/1687472/" id="a_17">Section 79</a> of that <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_18">Copyright Act</a> was not applicable
retrospectively. Secondly, he submitted that <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_19">Section 52(1)(w)</a> was only
applicable in case of „purely functional‟ items and did not include other
types of technical drawings. Thirdly, he submitted that the question
whether <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_20">Section 15</a> of the Copyright Act was applicable was a mixed
question of fact and law that required trial and, therefore, the plaint could
not be rejected on that ground. He relied upon the decision of the Supreme
Court in Tri-Star Products P. Ltd. v. Jagdamba Impex: SLP (C) No.
22113/2014, decided on 08.09.2014. He also relied upon the decision of
the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/6587016/" id="a_21">Standard Corporation
India Ltd. v. Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd</a>.: O.S.A. No. 107/2013,
decided on 04.04.2014. He stated that engineering drawings fall within the
scope of artistic works as defined under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_22">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act
and thus, were excluded from the definition of designs under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_23">Section 2(d)</a>
of the Design Act. He submitted that copyright in designs derived from
technical drawings was materially different from the copyright in technical
drawings. He relied on the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in
Microfibres Inc. (supra) in support of this contention.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.     Lastly, Mr Anand submitted that BMPL was selling its infringing
products within the territories of NCT of Delhi and thus, this Court would
have the territorial jurisdiction in respect of a suit for infringement of
designs. He further submitted that the principal office of JIL was in Delhi



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                  Page 8 of 32</span>
 and, therefore, this Court would have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain
the present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_20">IA No. 1733/2015

</p><p id="p_21">18.     In addition to the submissions made in connection with BMPL‟s
application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, Mr Haksar contended that
the present suit is liable to be dismissed on account of admissions made by
the plaintiffs in prior actions instituted by the plaintiffs/their affiliates. He
referred to the pleadings in CS(OS) No. 566 of 2006 captioned "JC
Bamford Excavators Ltd. and Anr. v. Action Construction Equipment Pvt.
Ltd. and Ors" filed by the plaintiffs. The suits were filed by the plaintiffs
and one of the Joint Venture Company in the years 2006 and 1998
respectively. He pointed out that in the said plaints, it was specifically
pleaded that the designs were incapable of being registered under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_24">Designs
Act</a>, 1911 and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_25">Designs Act</a>, 2000 as the finished products produced with
the help of the drawings were all functional items and would not qualify as
„designs‟ as defined under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_26">Section 2(d)</a> of the Designs Act. He submitted
that in view of the specific pleadings, the plaintiffs had admitted that the
industrial drawings were incapable of being registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_27">Designs
Act</a> and, therefore, the defendant‟s claim that the registrations of the
designs were invalid as they were incapable of being registered under the
<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_28">Designs Act</a> was admitted and thus had to be accepted. He further
submitted that by virtue of <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_29">Section 52(1)(w)</a> of the Copyright Act making
of three dimensional object from any two dimensional artistic works such
as technical drawings for the purposes of industrial application of any
purely functional part of a useful device, would not constitute infringement
of Copyright. He submitted that since the plaintiffs plainly admitted that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                      Page 9 of 32</span>
 the parts were functional, their claim in the present suit could not be
sustained. He earnestly contended that in view of the admissions made in
the earlier suits, the present suit was liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_22">19.     Mr Haksar, thereafter also referred to the technical report prepared
by the experts of the plaintiffs, which plainly indicated that there were
dissimilarities between the Products and the infringing Product
manufactured by the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20.     He also submitted that the design registration in respect of seat
(Registration No. 200011) indicated that the seat was covered by a
polythene sheet and thus, was not visible.         He submitted that in the
circumstances, the present suit insofar as it relates to infringement of the
design of the seat, cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21.     Mr Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
plaintiffs countered the aforesaid submissions. Mr Chidambaram submitted
that at the time when the suit CS(OS) No. 959 of 1998 captioned "<a href="/doc/384219/" id="a_30">Escorts
JCB Ltd. v. Action Construction Equipment Private Limited and Ors</a>."
was filed, registrations in respect of designs had not been granted in favour
of the said plaintiff - Escorts JCB Ltd. - and, therefore, the statement made
that the designs were incapable of registration under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_31">Designs Act</a>, 2000
was a mistaken statement of law, which cannot be construed as an
admission on the part of the plaintiffs. He submitted that similarly the
statement made by the plaintiffs in CS(OS) 566 of 2006 was also a
mistaken statement of law. He submitted that at that stage about twenty
applications for registrations under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_32">Designs Act</a> were pending.
However, the counsel who made the statement may not have been sure
whether pending applications would fructify into design registrations. He


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                  Page 10 of 32</span>
 contended that in any event a statement as to law could not be held as an
admission and it was always open for the plaintiffs to canvas a different
view. He relied on the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in
<a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_33">Kapil Wadhwa and Ors. v. Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.:
2013 (53) PTC 112 (Del), wherein the Division Bench of this Court had re-
affirmed the principle that estoppel could not be pleaded against a statute
and an admission by a party as to a principle of law would have no
relevance while determining the rights and liabilities of a party. He
submitted that the statement that the designs were incapable of registration
under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_34">Designs Act</a> was an erroneous statement regarding the law and
the plaintiffs were not be bound by the same.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22.     Next, he submitted that the bar under <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_35">Section 52(1)(w)</a> of the
Copyright Act was only applicable to a purely functional item, which has
no aesthetic value. He submitted that an item could be functional and yet
have certain features of aesthetic value and in 52(1)(w) of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_36">Copyright
Act</a> would not apply in such cases.
</p>
<p id="p_26">Discussions and Conclusion

</p><p id="p_27">23.     The first and foremost question to be addressed is whether the plaint
is liable to be rejected on the ground that it does not disclose a cause of
action. The plaint has been filed seeking permanent injunction in respect of
the plaintiffs‟ registered designs and infringement of copyright in respect
of parts of the Product (3DX Backhoe loader). It is settled law that the
question whether a plaint is to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 has to
be tested without any reference to the Written Statement or the defence
raised by the defendant. In other words, the averments made in the plaint
must be accepted as correct for the purposes of determining whether the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                  Page 11 of 32</span>
 suit is sustainable. The question whether a plaint is to be rejected has to be
addressed on a demurrer.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24.     In the present case, the plaintiffs allege infringement of designs in
respect of Hydraulic Tank (Design Registration No. 200007), Diesel Tank
(Design Registration No. 200009), Seat (Design Registration No. 200011)
and Stabilizer Leg (Design Registration No. 200016). The plaintiffs have
also claimed infringement of their copyright in drawings relating to several
parts as noticed hereinbefore. Plainly, if the averments made by the
plaintiffs are accepted to be correct, they would be entitled to the relief as
claimed by them.
</p>
<p id="p_29">25.     The present suit was instituted as a quia timet action as at the
material time, BMPL had not commercially launched the infringing
Product. Thus, in paragraph 24 of the plaint, the plaintiffs had pleaded that
the cause of action has arisen as they apprehend that BMPL may launch
and sell the infringing product. The plaintiffs further pleaded that the cause
of action would continue and subsist till such time, BMPL is restrained
from launching/exhibiting its product that infringes plaintiffs‟ registered
design and their copyrights. Undoubtedly, if the said paragraph 24 is read
in isolation, it would plainly appear that the cause of action no longer
survives particularly keeping in view that the plaintiffs have withdrawn
their prayer for interim relief. However, it is trite that a plaint has to be
read as a whole. A plain reading of the plaint as a whole clearly indicates
that the grievance sought to be agitated by the plaintiffs are regarding
alleged infringement of their designs and copyright. The plaintiffs have
also subsequently amended the plaint to specifically indicate the designs,
which are allegedly infringed and their copyright in the drawings, which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                   Page 12 of 32</span>
 the plaintiffs claim have been violated. In this view, this Court is unable to
accept that the plaint does not disclose any cause of action and is,
therefore, liable to be dismissed under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_30">26.     Mr Haksar had argued that the plaintiffs were guilty of concealment
of material facts inasmuch as they are failed to disclose the earlier suits
filed by them where they had clearly admitted that the drawings were not
capable of being registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_37">Designs Act</a>. He had also relied on
the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/113963352/" id="a_38">S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v.
Jagannath &amp; Ors</a>.: AIR 1994 SC 853 to contend that that the plaint was
liable to be dismissed as it amounted to playing a fraud. In addition, Mr
Haksar had pointed out that the plaintiffs had obtained an interim
injunction on the basis of submitting misleading comparative photographs
of the „Bucket‟ which was a component of the Product. He submitted that
subsequently the suit was amended and the plaintiffs now claim that only
the teeth appeared to have been copied.
</p>
<p id="p_31">27.     This Court is not persuaded to accept the contention that the present
suit is liable to be dismissed on the ground of fraud. Undoubtedly, the
pleadings made by the plaintiffs in CS(OS) 566 of 2006 are relevant and it
also appears that the stand of the plaintiffs in that suit and the present suit
are in variance. However, this Court is unable to accept that non-disclosure
of the said action amounts to a fraud. The question whether the averments
made in the suit are to be accepted in view of the stand taken by the
plaintiffs in an earlier suit, requires examination and would be considered
after the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to explain their averments.
However, the present proceedings cannot be dismissed at the threshold.
The defendant‟s grievance that the plaintiffs had obtained an interim


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                    Page 13 of 32</span>
 injunction on the basis of certain allegations that were subsequently
withdrawn, is understandable. However that would not warrant dismissal
of the suit at the threshold. The decision in the case of S.P. Chengalvaraya
Naidu (supra) has no application in the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_32">28.     In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (supra), the Supreme Court was
concerned with a preliminary decree obtained by the predecessor of the
respondents therein (Jagannath). Jagannath had purchased a property in
auction as a benami of his principal (Chunni Socar) and had subsequently
relinquished his all rights in the said property in favour of his principal.
Thus, indisputably Jagannath did not have any right, title or interest in the
property in question; nonetheless, Jagannath filed a suit for partition and
obtained the preliminary decree in respect of the said property without
disclosing that he had executed a relinquishment deed in respect of this
property. It is, in this context that the Supreme Court had held that
Jagannath had procured the preliminary decree by playing a fraud on the
Court and litigation cannot be made an engine of fraud. There can be no
quarrel as to this principle as set down by the Supreme Court. However,
the same is clearly not applicable in the facts of the present case. The
question whether a copyright subsist in the drawings as claimed by the
plaintiffs and the question whether any registration in respect of designs for
parts of the Product could be granted to the plaintiffs are contentious
issues. The fact that the stand of the plaintiffs in Suit (CS(OS) 566 of 2006)
appears to be contrary to their stand in the present suit, cannot at the
threshold lead to the conclusion that the present suit is an engine of fraud.
The effect of the pleadings in the earlier actions instituted by the plaintiffs
would necessarily have to be evaluated. However, non-disclosure of a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) 2934/2011                                                     Page 14 of 32</span>
 previously instituted suit against the third party, although material, does
not render the present proceedings as fraudulent.
</p>
<p id="p_33">29.     The contention that this Court does not have any territorial
jurisdiction is also unpersuasive. It is not disputed that the defendants are
selling the infringing Product within the National Capital Territory of
Delhi and thus, indisputably, part of the cause of action has arisen within
the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_34">30.     The controversy that now remains to be addressed is essentially
narrowed down to three questions. First, whether by virtue of <a href="/doc/991805/" id="a_39">Section 15(2)</a>
of the Copyright Act, the copyright in respect of the designs of the parts of
the Product have ceased. Second, whether by virtue of <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_40">Section 52(1)(w)</a> of
the Copyright Act, the plaintiffs are precluded from claiming infringement
of their copyright in the technical drawings relating to the parts of the
Product in question. And third, whether suit is liable to be dismissed under
Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC on the basis of (i) admissions as contained in
the prior suits instituted by the plaintiffs, CS(OS) 566 of 2006, and/or the
suit instituted by the joint venture company (Escorts JCB Ltd. being
CS(OS) 959 of 1998); and (ii) admissions contained in the technical report.
</p>
<p id="p_35">31.     By virtue of Section 15(2) of the Copyrights Act, copyright in any
design, which is capable of being registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_41">Designs Act</a> but has
not been so registered, shall cease as soon as an article to which the design

<p id="p_36">32.     According to the plaintiffs the expression "copyright in any design"
as used in <a href="/doc/991805/" id="a_46">Section 15(2)</a> of the Copyright Act is different from the
copyright in the original artistic work. They claim that even if a part has
been manufactured more than fifty times by an industrial process, the
original copyright in the technical drawings would subsist even though the
copyright in the design applied to the article in question would cease.
</p>
<p id="p_37">33.     At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_47">Section 2(d)</a> of the
Designs Act, which defines the term "design" to mean as under:-

         or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are

<p id="p_38"> 34.     It is apparent from the above that the term "design" means only
features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines
or colours applied to any article and does not include any artistic work as
defined under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_52">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act. Clearly, the expression
"copyright in any design" would necessarily exclude copyright in an
„artistic work‟ because „artistic works‟ as defined under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_53">Section 2(c)</a> of the
Copyright Act are excluded from the definition of „design‟ under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_54">Section

<p id="p_39">35.     <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_55">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act defines the scope of the term
„copyright‟ in relation to (a) literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a
computer program; (b) a computer program; (c) an artistic work; (d) a

"copyright" in relation to a „design‟. The said term is defined under <a href="/doc/1321789/" id="a_57">section

and Co. and Anr</a>. (supra) had held that there was a clear distinction
between an original artistic work and the design derived from it for an
industrial application on an article. The relevant extracts of the said
decision are set out below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">         "23. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between an
         original artistic work, and the design derived from it for
         industrial application on an article. This position is clarified
         by the use of the expression "only" before the words "the
         features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or
         composition of lines or colours" in the definition of "design"
         in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_63">Designs Act</a>. Therefore, the original artistic work,
         which may have inspired the creation of a design, is not
         merely the feature of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament
         or composition of lines or colours which are created to apply
         to an article by an industrial process. The original artistic
         work is something different from the design. Secondly, the
         definition of "design" expressly excludes, inter alia, any
         artistic work defined in <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_64">section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright act,
         1957.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">         24. It needs to be emphasized that it is not necessary that in
         every case a design has to be preceded by an artistic work
         upon which it is founded. A craftsman may create a design
         without first creating a basic artistic work. This may best be
         illustrated by a weaver who may straightaway create a
         design while weaving a shawl, which product could be
         created even without the basic artistic work.

         2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act. This is so because the expression
         'artistic work' as defined in <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_66">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright
         Act bears a wide definition to mean a painting, a sculpture, a
         drawing (including a diagram, map, chart or plan), an
         engraving or a photograph, whether or not any such work
         possesses artistic quality. However, the design may or may
         not enjoy a copyright protection under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_67">Copyright Act</a>,
         depending on whether it is an 'original artistic work' or not.

         <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_69">Copyright Act</a>, and not under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_70">Designs Act</a>. This is
         evident from the expression "copyright shall not subsist
         under this Act......" used in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_71">Section 15</a>.
         However, copyright in an artistic work subsists provided it
         is an original artistic work. Therefore, there can be no claim
         for Copyright under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_72">Copyright Act</a> in an artistic work
         which does not have the quality of possessing originality.
         The holder of a copy of an original artistic work cannot
         claim copyright protection. Therefore, to be entitled to
         protection under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_73">Copyright Act</a>, the design should have
         originality. That is not to say that if the design is not entitled
         to copyright protection under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_74">Copyright Act</a>, on account
         of it not possessing originality vis-à-vis the original artistic
         work, the design does not require, or cannot be granted

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">         29. <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_86">Section 15</a> of the Copyright Act is in two parts. The first
         part i.e. sub-section (1) states that copyright shall not subsist

         not the design is eventually applied to an article by an
         industrial process, the design loses its protection as an
         artistic work under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_90">Copyright Act</a>. Therefore, subject to
         whatever rights that are available under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_91">Designs Act</a>, the
         registered design holder cannot claim protection or

         more than 50 times by an industrial process by the owner of

         clear to us that the Parliament in <a href="/doc/1018906/" id="a_95">Section 15</a> of the Copyright

         Copyright Act does not exclude from the ambit of Copyright
         protection either the original "artistic work" upon which the
         design is based or the design which by itself is an artistic
         work. It cannot be disputed that the original
         paintings/artistic works which may be used to industrially
         produce the designed article would continue to fall within
         the meaning of the artistic work defined under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_104">Section 2(c)</a>
         of the Copyright Act, 1957 and would be entitled to the full

         Act. This, in our view, in fact is a factor which would go
         against the appellants in construing the nature of protection

         contrasted with the applied artistic work that is the design,

objects for the purpose of a purely functional part would not constitute
infringement of copyright. Thus, it would be necessary to address the
controversy whether the part manufactured by the defendant is a "purely
functional part". The plaintiffs claim that even though the parts in question
are functional, they, nonetheless, have certain aesthetic values and thus, are
not solely functional. Plainly, this is a question of fact that must be
addressed after a full trial. The defendant‟s contention that the parts of the
Products are functional items and therefore manufacturing those parts
would not amount to infringement of copyright in the technical drawings of
those parts is, prima facie, persuasive. However, this is a contentious
question, which requires to be adjudicated. Plainly, the said suit cannot be

                   novel or original, but due to fact that the industrial
                   drawings and the finished products produced with the
                   help of the drawings are all functional items and
                   would not qualify as "designs" as defined under
                   <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_152">Section 2(d)</a> of The Designs Act, 2000. All the
                   components in which the Plaintiffs are claiming
                   copyrights have been specially developed to increase
                   the efficiency of the finished product. The Defendants
                   are therefore not only infringing the copyright of the
                   Plaintiffs but are also in this manner passing off
                   and/or attempting to pass off their products as those of
                   the Plaintiffs."

Backhoe loader are functional items and do not qualify as designs as

 defined under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_153">Section 2(d)</a> of the Designs Act. It has been earnestly
contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that the said statement is a
misstatement of law. However, this Court is not persuaded to accept that
the statement made by the plaintiffs in the above pleadings is a mere
statement of law. The statement that the drawings are functional items is a
statement of fact. The statement that the items in question do not qualify as
designs under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_154">Section 2(d)</a> of the Designs Act is also a statement of fact as
it is based on the assertion that the item in question are functional items. In
the written submissions dated 06.12.2016 filed by the plaintiffs, it has also
been expressly stated that "what is registrable under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_155">Designs Act</a>, 2000
is a question of fact to be determined on a case to case basis taking into
account factors such as whether the finished article appears (sic) to and is
judged solely by the eye i.e. has aesthetic features, or whether the article is
merely functional/purely functional or whether it has both functional and
has aesthetic features." Thus, even in the written submissions, the
plaintiffs have expressly conceded - and i rightly so - that the question
whether an article is registrable under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_156">Designs Act</a> is a question of fact.
This statement (made in the additional written submissions) runs contrary
to their earlier submissions that the statement made in the pleadings is a
misstatement of law. It was also contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that
the fact that certain designs have been registered clearly indicate that their
statements made in the pleadings in the suits instituted previously were ex
facie erroneous. This contention is also unpersuasive. One of the principal
controversy in the present suit is whether the designs which have been
registered in favour of the plaintiffs (the infringement of which is alleged)
are valid registrations or not. The fact that such registrations have been

 granted begs the question and therefore, plainly, would not relevant in
deciding the said controversy.

<p id="p_58">45.      Having stated the above, it is also trite law that an admission is only
a piece of evidence and the weight attached to such admission must depend
on the circumstances in the which the same have been made. <a href="/doc/1010762/" id="a_157">In Nagubai
Ammal &amp; Ors. v. B. Shama Rao &amp; Ors</a>.: 1956 SCR 451, the Supreme
Court had observed that "An admission is not conclusive as to the truth of
the matters stated therein. It is only a piece of evidence, the weight to be
attached to which must depend on the circumstances under which it is
made. It can be shown to be erroneous or untrue, So long as the person to
whom it was made has not acted upon it to his detriment, when it might
become conclusive by way of estoppel."

<p id="p_59">46.      In the present case, the pleadings relied upon are in another suit and
the plaintiffs must have full opportunity to explain the same at the time of
trial.

<p id="p_60">47.      In the present case, there is yet another aspect that would require a
further determination and that is whether the parts of the Product are
similar or identical to the parts in the context of which the previous suit has
been instituted by the plaintiffs. Further, this Court would also have to
examine whether the copyright in respect of drawings, which were the
subject matter of CS(OS) 566 of 2006 are similar or identical to the designs
/ copyright as claimed in the present suit.

in its discretion, to pass a decree on admission but it is not mandatory to do

 so. <a href="/doc/109034285/" id="a_158">In S.M. Asif v. Virender Kumar Bajaj</a> : (2015) 9 SCC 287, the Apex
Court observed that:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">         "8. The words in Order XII Rule 6 CPC "may" and "make
         such order..." show that the power under Order XII Rule 6
         CPC is discretionary and cannot be claimed as a matter of
         right. Judgment on admission is not a matter of right and
         rather is a matter of discretion of the Court."

<p id="p_62">49.     A Division Bench of this Court, in <a href="/doc/348470/" id="a_159">Charanjit Singh v. Kehar Singh</a> :
(2006) 90 DRJ 268 (DB), also observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">         "8. It is also a settled principle of civil jurisprudence that
         judgment on admission is not a matter of right and rather is
         a matter of discretion of a Court. Where the defendant has
         raised objection which will go to the very root of the case, it
         would not be appropriate to exercise this discretion. The use
         of the words „May‟ and „make such orders‟ or „give such
         judgment‟ spells out that power under these rules are
         discretionary and use of discretion would have to be
         controlled in accordance with the known judicial cannons.
         The cases which involves questions to be decided upon
         regular trial and the alleged admissions are not clear and
         specific, it may not be appropriate to take recourse to these
         provisions."
