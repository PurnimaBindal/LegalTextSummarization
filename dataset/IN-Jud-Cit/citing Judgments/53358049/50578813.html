1.    The plaintiff Mittal Electronics through its partner have filed the
present suit inter alia seeking a decree of injunction against the defendants,
their directors, partners etc. from manufacturing, purchasing or selling the
home appliances and other accessories under the trademark 'Star SUJATA'
or 'SUJATA' or any other identical or deceptively similar mark or corporate
name, domain name and email address as the same not only violated its
statutory right by way of the registration of the trademark but also amounted
to passing off the goods of the defendants as that of the plaintiff besides
seeking cancellation of the domain name, declaring the plaintiff's trademark

2.    In the suit, the plaintiff impleaded 'SUJATA' Home Appliances (P)
Ltd. with its addresses at Delhi, Bhatinda, Punjab as defendant No.1, Gorani
Industries Ltd. at Indore, Madhya Pradesh as defendant No.2, Asija
Electricals at Sirsa, Haryana as defendant No.3 and Radiant Industries at
Chandigarh as defendant No.4. It was stated that defendant No.1 was the
main contesting defendant whereas the defendant Nos.2 and 4 were the
manufacturer of defendant No.1 and defendant No.3 was the dealer of the
goods of defendant No.1 under the infringing trademark.
3.    In the suit, the plaintiff stated that the predecessor of the plaintiff
adopted the trademark 'SUJATA' in the year 1980 which business was
gradually expanded to electrical goods and home appliances including
Mixer, Grinder, Grater, Shredder, Chopper, Mincer, Kneader, Atta Chakki,
Electric Spin Drier, Electric Waste Dispenser, Electric Flat Iron, Heating,
Cooling Ventilating, Steam Generating and Cooling Appliances. It was
claimed that from the year 1991 to 2018 the plaintiff is the owner of the
registered trademark 'SUJATA' in various classes including class-7, 8, 9, 11
and 35. Besides the registrations already there, several applications of the
plaintiff for the registration of the trademark 'SUJATA' in different classes
are also pending. Plaintiff claims that it has huge sales under the trademark
'SUJATA' and was also spending substantial amount on advertising.
4.    Plaintiff pleaded in the plaint that the plaintiff came to know about the
defendant No.1 using the mark 'SUJATA' for Geysers when one of the
technician of the plaintiff visited a premises to repair the geyser and got to
know that the Geyser under the trademark 'SUJATA' was not manufactured
by the plaintiff. Consequently, when the suit came up before this Court for

                                                                    12:07:08
 hearing on 7th February, 2020 this Court in I.A. 1751/2020 under Order
XXXI Rule 1 and 2 CPC passed an ex-parte ad-interim injunction
restraining the defendants from using 'Star SUJATA'/'SUJATA' or any
other identical or deceptively similar trademark in terms of prayer in para-36
of the application and also restrained the defendants from using the domain
names www.sujatahomeappliances.com and www.sujataro.com and the
email address till the next date of hearing. This Court also appointed Local
Commissioners to visit the five premises mentioned above and the reports of
the Local Commissioners were received therein.
5.    On receipt of summons and pursuant to compliance under Order
XXXIX Rule 3 CPC defendant No.1 filed an application being
I.A.3612/2020 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC on 11th March, 2020 before
this Court. However, the said application could not be listed due to lock
down, hence, the defendant No.1 filed fresh application being I.A.
No.4098/2020 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC which came up for hearing
on 1st June, 2020. I.A. 3612/2020 was dismissed as withdrawn on 9th June,
2020 in view of a fresh application being I.A. No.4098/2020 for the same
relief being filed. The defendant No.1 sought variation of the interim
injunction granted by this Court and pointed out that the plaint filed by the
plaintiff suffers from suppression of material facts as Mr.Rajesh Kumar
Bansal, Director of defendant No.1 started his business, trading as Luxmi
Enterprises based in Bhatinda in the year 2008 which was then a
proprietorship firm and was manufacturing and selling water purifiers under
the brand name 'SUJATA' primarily in the State of Punjab. Rajesh Kumar
Bansal had been granted trademark registration under application
No.2337951 whereby the device mark 'SUJATA' was registered in favour

 of Rajesh Kumar Bansal trading as Luxmi Enterprises under class-11 in
respect of water purifiers, RO system, water filters w.e.f. 25th May, 2012.
The defendant No.1 also placed on record invoices relating to its sale of
water purifiers and RO systems under the brand name 'SUJATA' since the
year 2013.
6.    It is the case of the defendant No.1 that to expand the business, the
defendant No.1 company was incorporated comprising of only two Directors
namely Mrs.Mamta Bansal and Mrs.Sampada Bansal, that is wives of
Rajesh Kumar Bansal and his brother. Copy of the license agreement dated
25th December, 2017 entered into between Rajesh Kumar Bansal and
defendant No.1 company was also placed on record. It is further stated that
in the year 2018 since Mrs.Mamta Bansal died, she was replaced by her son
Shubham Bansal and finally Rajesh Kumar Bansal and his brother were
included as Directors of defendant No.1. In the application for registration
Rajesh Kumar Bansal, trading as Luxmi Enterprises had clearly stated user
of the trademark 'SUJATA' since 1st April, 2008.
7.    According to defendant No.1, the plaintiff is selling only juicer,
mixer, grinders and geysers despite the fact that the plaintiff has got
registration in various classes and is thus squatting on the trademark without
using the same. It is clearly stated that the plaintiff has never sold water
purifier, RO systems or water filters for which the defendant No.1's user
under the trademark 'SUJATA' is prior in time hence the fact that defendant
No.1 has a registration in its favour and was the prior user of the mark
'SUJATA' in respect of Water Purifiers, RO Systems and Water Filters was
concealed from this Court when an ex-parte ad-interim injunction was
sought.

                                                                    Signing Date:09.09.2020

 8.    By I.A. No.4098/2020 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC the
defendant No.1 only seeks modification of the order dated 7th February,
2020 allowing the defendant No.1 to manufacture, sell, offer for sell,
advertise its product namely water purifiers, water filters and RO systems
under the trademark 'SUJATA' and does not seek vacation of the entire ex
parte ad interim order in respect of other goods and also seeks release of the
goods seized and sealed by the Local Commissioners besides seeking cost.
9.    Contentions of learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff is that
the plaintiff and defendant No.1 are using the trademark 'SUJATA' for sale
of home and kitchen appliances and the goods of the plaintiff and defendant
No.1 are allied and cognate goods even if defendant No.1 was using the
mark for the purpose of water purifiers, water filters and RO systems. The
said goods are used by the same consumers in the same location and are sold
through the same outlet. Hence the plea of defendant No.1 that the goods of
the plaintiff and defendant No.1 are entirely different is incorrect.
Defendant No.1 adopted the trademark 'SUJATA' which is identical to the
plaintiff's prior adopted and registered trademark 'SUJATA' and thus the
adoption of the defendant No.1 of the trademark 'SUJATA' was dishonest
and caused serious prejudice and damages to the plaintiff. Rebutting the
arguments on behalf of defendant No.1, learned Senior Counsel for the
plaintiff submits that the plaintiff has adopted the mark 'SUJATA' in the
year 1980 and the first registration was granted in favour of the plaintiff on
22nd April, 1991. Plaintiff has filed documents as far back as November,
1988 to show the sales of its product under the trade name 'SUJATA' and
that the plaintiff is heavily investing on advertisements in prominent
newspapers, magazines, TV advertisements as well as international cricket


                                                                    Signature Not Verified
                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE
CS (COMM) 60/2020                                                     Page GUPTA
                                                                    MUKTA      5 of 41
                                                                    Signing Date:09.09.2020
                                                                    12:07:08
 matches. Case of defendant No.1 on the other hand is claim of user only
since 2008 by Luxmi Enterprises and the first invoice placed is of June,
2013. Thus the user of the plaintiff is long before the defendant No.1 in
respect of similar, allied and cognate goods. In view of the prior adoption of
the mark, the order of injunction passed by this Court is completely justified
in terms of the decisions reported as 2002 (3) SCC 65 Lakshmikant V. Patel
vs. Chetanbhai Shah, 2016 (2) SCC 683 <a href="/doc/127697258/" id="a_1">S.Syed Mohindeen vs. P. Sulochana
Bai</a>, 1989 ILR (1) Delhi 115 <a href="/doc/1752560/" id="a_2">Hindustan Pencils vs. India Stationary
Products</a> and 1996 (16) PTC 160 (Del) Aktiebolaget SKF Vs. Rajesh
Engineering.
10.   The defendant No.1 not only adopted 'SUJATA' but 'Star SUJATA'
after the plaintiff used Star device along with its mark. The trademark
application of Rajesh Kumar Bansal for 'Star SUJATA' in class-11 was
rejected on account of prior registered trademark of the plaintiff and the said
order of the Registrar had attained finality as neither the defendant No.1 nor
Rajesh Kumar Bansal challenged the same. The Registrar ought to have
refused the registration of the mark 'SUJATA' also to Rajesh Kumar Bansal
which has been wrongly granted.          Plaintiff has preferred cancellation
petition with requisite fees prior to the service of the application under Order
XXXIX Rule 4 CPC filed by defendant No.1 with the Registrar of
Trademarks. The plaintiff has made out a substantial case for cancellation
of the registration before the Registrar granted in favour of Rajesh Kumar
Bansal Proprietor M/s Luxmi Enterprises. Hence the interim order passed
by this Court is justified under Section 124(5) of the Trademarks Act (in
short 'TM Act').
11.   Defendant No.1 has not provided details of its sale which would


                                                                     Signature Not Verified

 justify that with the use by the defendant No.1 the mark SUAJATA is being
associated with defendant No.1. Since the identity of the mark, identity of
the goods and identity of the manner have been established in favour of the
plaintiff, the order of ex-parte ad-interim injunction passed by this Court
was fully justified as held in the decisions reported as 2004 (76) DRJ 1616

12.   Plaintiff is already into the business of home appliances and kitchen
appliances and having registration of the mark 'SUJATA' in various classes
including classes relating to water purifiers, RO systems and water filters.
The plaintiff is at liberty to use the same as and when it deems fit.
Defendant No.1 is not entitled to protection as registered proprietor under
Section 28 (3) and Section 30 (2) (e) of the TM Act. The license agreement
between Rajesh Kumar Bansal and Defendant No.1 is not a stamped
document and hence not reliable and fully suspect and in any case in terms
of <a href="/doc/176042882/" id="a_7">Section 35</a> of the Indian Stamp Act, the license agreement cannot be
relied upon for any purposes. Reliance is placed on the decision reported as
2011 (14) SCC 66 <a href="/doc/24736/" id="a_8">SMS Tea Estates vs. Chandimari Tea Co</a>.

reported as 2018 (9) SCC 183 <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_9">Nandhini Deluxe vs. Karnataka Co-operative
Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a>. is misconceived as the said decision was

 was not looking into the issue of injunction. The present action is under
Section 29 of the TM Act wherein the legal grounds and applicable
principles are entirely different from those under Section 11 of the TM Act
as also held in the decision reported as 1997 (4) SCC 201 <a href="/doc/1747781/" id="a_10">Vishnudas
Trading vs. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Nandhini Deluxe</a> (supra) was a case
of honest and concurrent user of the junior user and the two businesses were
entirely distinct. The goods in question in Nandhini Deluxe (supra) were
found to be entirely distinct being restaurant and milk co-operation and the
respondent therein was a public corporation.       In the present case it is</pre>
<p id="p_1">admitted case of defendant No.1 as per the opposition filed by M/s Luxmi
Enterprises that the goods were admittedly similar, allied and cognate. The
mark in that case was a generic name of a Goddess and the two label marks
in Nandhini Deluxe (supra) were entirely different so that there was no
chance of confusion in the mind of ordinary customers. Thus the principles
laid down by the Supreme Court in Nandhini Deluxe (supra) or Vishnudas
Trading (supra) would not be applicable to the facts of the present case.
Allegation of defendant No.1 that the plaintiff is squatting over the
registered mark is incorrect and bereft of any supporting material. In any
case the ground of non-use by the plaintiff is not relevant for the present
action under Section 29 of the TM Act.

 placed on the decision as ILR (1997) 1 Delhi 64 Montari Overseas Ltd. vs.
Montari Industries Ltd. and Malhotra Book Depot (supra). The use of
registered mark of the plaintiff as the corporate name of defendant No.1
clearly contravenes <a href="/doc/148810362/" id="a_11">Section 29</a> (6) of the TM Act.
</p><p id="p_3">15.   It is vehemently contended that the plaintiff has not concealed any
material fact before this Court. Defendant No.1 is not the proprietor of the
mark 'SUJATA' and is only a licensee of one M/s Luxmi Enterprises in
whose favour the mark 'SUJATA' has been registered for water purifiers,
water filters and RO systems. The plea of defendant No.1 that the plaintiff in
the suit concealed material facts and on a mere due diligence it would have
been evident that one of the Directors of defendant No.1 being Rajesh
Kumar Bansal was the owner of the registered trademark is unsubstantiated.
Further it was not Luxmi Enterprises but Rajesh Kumar Bansal who had
filed the opposition in respect of the plaintiff's trademark, the addresses of
Rajesh Kumar Bansal and defendant No.1 of Bhatinda are different. The
packaging of the products, leaflets and the website of defendant No.1 carried
only the Delhi address which was not available in the Ministry of Corporate
Affairs (in short 'MCA') records. Thus it was difficult to co-relate that the
Rajesh Kumar Bansal of defendant No.1 was the same Rajesh Kumar Bansal
of Bhatinda. Defendant No.1's reliance on the decisions reported as 150

reason that the Court in the said decisions was concerned with the owner of

the defendant No.1 vehemently contends that details of registration of the
device mark in class-11 over 'SUJATA' by its licensor Rajesh Kumar
Bansal through M/s Luxmi Enterprises as well as the details of user of the
mark by its licensor since 1st April, 2008 have been accepted by the
Trademarks Registry as is evident from the document filed at page No.37 of
the defendant No.1's documents. Till date the plaintiff is not manufacturing
or selling water purifiers, water filters and RO systems. The plaintiff has not
filed one single document showing manufacture or sale of 'SUJATA' for
water purifiers, water filters and RO system and the documents filed relate
only to juicer, mixer, grinder and/or juicer-mixer-grinder.

under Luxmi Enterprises on 25th May, 2012 and was granted on 8th April,
2014. This certificate of registration is a public document and in case slight
due diligence had been done by the plaintiff, it would have had the
knowledge of defendant's registration of the mark. Further the plaintiff did
not oppose the registration of the mark 'SUJATA' in favour of Rajesh
Kumar Bansal nor filed rectification after the registration of the mark despite
this fact having come to the notice of the plaintiff when the defendant No.1
applied for the mark 'Star SUJATA'. The rectification petition has now

 application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC is incorrect. Defendant No.1
has placed on record invoices of its licensor from June, 2013 to show the use
of device mark 'SUJATA' continuously in relation to water purifiers, water
filters and RO system besides the brochures. The license agreement entered
into between Rajesh Kumar Bansal with defendant No.1 on 25 th December,
2017 has also been placed on record and the same captures the consideration
of license fee being low and fixed at ₹5,000 since the defendant No.1 was a
family entity of the licensor and the licensor was also directly involved in
the running of the affairs of the defendant No.1. Further the master data of
defendant No.1 is a public record available online which shows Rajesh
Kumar Bansal as one of the Directors.
</p><p id="p_6">18.   Plaintiff's trademark application in class-11 for its mark 'SUJATA'
filed on 28th July, 2014 was on 'proposed to be used' basis which clearly
shows that the defendant No.1's user for mark 'SUJATA' in class-11 was
prior in time and despite advertisement of the said mark, the plaintiff never
opposed the registration of the said device mark 'SUJATA' in favour of
Rajesh Kumar Bansal in relation to water purifiers, water filters and RO
system. Rajesh Kumar Bansal, the licensor on 21 st June, 2016 had objected
to the plaintiffs registration of the trademark, this opposition is specifically
within the knowledge of the plaintiff which fact has been concealed in the
present suit. The Plea of the plaintiff that it could not have known that
Rajesh Kumar Bansal was the Director of present Defendant No.1 is sham
argument as the master data of the defendant No.1 clearly shows that Rajesh

concealment and suppression. Further the plaintiff also filed opposition to
the defendant No.1's two       trademark application being 4282373 and
4282374 in class-11 on 6th February, 2020. In the said notices of opposition
the plaintiff clearly refers to Mr.Rajesh Kumar Bansal and M/s Luxmi
Enterprises. Thus now to say that the plaintiff was not aware of the link
between Luxmi Enterprises and Rajesh Kumar Bansal or between Sujata
Home Appliances and Rajesh Kumar Bansal is only a mala fide conduct.
The defendant No.1 is not seeking vacation of the ex-parte ad-interim
injunction in totality but seeking the modification thereof in terms of the
provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC. Referring to the order of this
Court dated 7th February, 2020, it is stated that from the order itself it is
evident that in the product list of the plaintiff there is no mention of water
purifiers, water filter and RO system and since the plaintiff was not dealing
in water purifiers, water filter and RO system, thus this Court ought not have
injuncted the defendant No.1 to that extent.       Defendant No.1 by this
application only seeks modification of the ex-parte ad-interim injunction to
the extent permitting the defendant No.1 to manufacture, sell, offer for sale,
advertise its product namely Water Purifiers, Water Filters and RO System,
the limited registration granted in favour of the defendant No.1 under the
mark 'SUJATA'. The claim of the defendant No.1 at this stage pending
disposal in the suit is only vacation of the stay qua the products water
purifier, water filters, RO system in which admittedly till date the plaintiff
has not dealt with by either manufacturing or selling the same. Referring to
Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC learned counsel for the defendant No.1 states

to why such vacation is not necessary in the interest of justice. The second
proviso to Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC is irrelevant to the facts of the present
case. In terms of the mandate under the first proviso to Order XXXIX Rule
4 CPC an ex-parte ad-interim order is liable to be vacated in its entirety. In
any case the modification as sought by defendant No.1 is required to be
allowed. Reliance is placed on the decision reported as AIR 1994 SC 853

seniority and exclusivity of the use of the mark 'SUJATA' in relation to

</p><p id="p_12">24.   It is contended that the arguments of learned counsel for the plaintiff
on the invalidity of the trademark registration of the defendant No.1 are
untenable for the reason plaintiff has never actually used the mark
'SUJATA' in the context of water purifiers, water filter and RO systems
despite having applied for the mark on 28th July, 2014. Whereas the licensor
of defendant No.1 applied for the trademark registration of the mark
'SUJATA' on 25th May, 2012 and was granted the same on 8th April, 2014
with the user date of 1st April, 2008 and atleast invoices from June, 2013.
No material has been placed on record to show that there has been actual
confusion or deception in relation to water purifiers, water filter and RO
systems and the plaintiff is clearly a squatter of the mark 'SUJATA' in
relation to water purifiers, water filters and RO systems under class-11 as it
has neither used the mark for the said goods since 2014 nor has shown any
intention to use the mark for the said goods. Thus the grant of registration in

 misconceived. On a comparison it would be found that the Supreme Court
in Nandhini Deluxe (supra) compared the two business entities and the
audience they cater to and quoting Vishnudas Trading (supra) in para-30
held that it was possible for a subsequent entity to obtain a registration in
respect of specific goods within a certain class even if there exists a
registration on an identical or similar trademark which covers the entire
class, if it is established that the prior registered proprietor had no intention
of using the mark in respect of the specific goods sought to be registered by
the subsequent applicant. From the combined reading of Vishnudas Trading
(supra) and Nandhini Deluxe (supra) it is evident that it is not necessary for
the subsequent user to first apply for limiting the earlier registration to those
goods which were being used by the prior registered proprietor before filing
an application for registration in respect of the excluded goods. As a matter
of fact in Nandhini Deluxe (supra), it was a prior registered proprietor who

the Delhi High Court decided on 26th May, 2020. The decisions relied upon
by the learned counsel for the plaintiff were prior to the decision rendered in
Nandhini Deluxe (supra) and Vishnudas Trading (supra) and as regards the
issue of squatting of trademark is concerned Nandhini Deluxe (supra) and
Vishnudas Trading (supra) still occupy the field.
</p><p id="p_15">27.   It is further contended that the plea of passing off by the plaintiff
which is independent of infringement also cannot be sustained for the reason
the plaintiff has not filed a single document to demonstrate that the plaintiff
is manufacturing/selling water purifiers, water filters and RO system and has
thus established goodwill and reputation for the said products whereby an
inference can be drawn that the defendant No.1 is riding on the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiff is passing off its goods as that of the plaintiff. The
plaintiff has yet not secured a well known registration under Section 124 of
the Trademarks Rules, 2017 in order to demonstrate its well known status.
In any case the claim of being well known must be tested at the time of
adoption of the mark by the defendant No.1 and admittedly, when the
defendant No.1 adopted the trademark 'SUJATA' for the water purifiers,
water filters and RO system, the plaintiff was not even using the said mark
for these goods so cannot be considered to be a well known trademark in the
said goods.

by the plaintiff is that despite due diligence there was no way that the
plaintiff would have come to know that the same Rajesh Bansal who is the
registered proprietor of the trademark 'SUJATA' for the three goods as
mentioned above is the Director of defendant No.1. The grounds urged in
this favour are that the application for registration was filed by Luxmi
Enterprises and the address of Bhatinda of the defendant No.1 is also
different. A perusal of the trademark registration granted vide application
No.2337951 in class-11 in respect of water purifiers, RO systems and water
filters noted the proprietor's name as Rajesh Bansal trading as Luxmi
Enterprises single firm and the proprietor's address was Bengali Wali Gali,
Near Bus Stand, Bhatinda-15001. The master data with the Registrar of
Companies in respect of the defendant No.1 company, which is a public
document filed by the defendant No.1 under the name Sujata Home
Appliances Pvt. Limited clearly notes Rajesh Kumar Bansal as one of its
Directors w.e.f. 1st October, 2019. Admittedly the suit has been filed by the
plaintiff after 1st October, 2019. No doubt in the master data the registered
address of Sujata Home Appliances Pvt. Limited, that is, defendant No.1 has
been mentioned as Rajesh Kumar #12, Kamal Cinema Road, Bhatinda,
Bathinda, Pb, 151001 IN, however, the fact that Rajesh Kumar Bansal was
one of the directors of defendant No.1 was sufficient for the plaintiff to have
carried out further investigation and found out whether it was the same
Rajesh Bansal in whose favour registration of the mark 'SUJATA' has been
granted, particularly in view of the fact that due to earlier objections and
proceedings before the Trade Mark Registry, plaintiff was aware that one

 Rajesh Kumar Bansal through Luxmi Enterprises has a registration of mark
'SUJATA' in his favour.
</p><p id="p_25">33.   Earlier knowledge of the plaintiff that mark 'SUJATA' was registered
for water purifiers, water filters and RO systems, in favour of Rajesh Bansal,
sole proprietor of Luxmi Enterprises is evident from number of documents.
An application in opposition to the registration of the mark 'SUJATA' by
the plaintiff in class-11 was filed by M/s Luxmi Enterprises having its
registered address at Bengali Wali Gali, Near Bus Stand, Bhatinda and duly
signed by Rajesh Bansal. Thus even if the said opposition was abandoned
the fact that a registration in favour of Rajesh Bansal as sole proprietor of
Luxmi Enterprises with address at Bhatinda exists was sufficient for the
plaintiff to have conducted the due diligence as to the constitution of
defendant No.1 before filing the present suit as noted above. It is clear that
despite having knowledge that one Luxmi Enterprises through its sole
proprietor Rajesh Bansal was the proprietor of the trademark 'SUJATA' in
respect of water purifiers, RO systems and water filters which was at
Bhatinda, the plaintiff did not reveal this fact in the plaint.

 plaintiffs clearly shows the oblique manner in which the injunction was
sought. In case the plaintiff had no knowledge that the defendant No.1 was
not dealing in water purifiers, RO systems there was no way that the
plaintiff out of the blue after the geysers would have listed the products
water purifier, RO systems and only thereafter listed the products which the
plaintiff is actually manufacturing and selling in the prayer clause. The
plaint is thus a clear case of claver drafting.

       Commissioner and the learned Single Judge of the High Court
       and neither of them was apprised of the fact that the appellant
       had taken 27.95 acres land on lease from the Government by
       unequivocally conceding that it had purchased excess land in
       violation of <a href="/doc/515390/" id="a_27">Section 154(1)</a> of the Act and the same vested in the
       State Government. In the list of dates and the memo of special
       leave petition filed in this Court also there is no mention of
       lease agreement dated 15-10-1994. This shows that the
       appellant has not approached the Court with clean hands. The
       withholding of the lease agreement from the Additional
       Commissioner, the High Court and this Court appears to be a
       part of the strategy adopted by the appellant to keep the quasi-
       judicial and judicial forums including this Court in dark about
       the nature of its possession over the excess land and make them
       believe that it has been subjected to unfair treatment. If the
       factum of execution of lease agreement and its contents were
       disclosed to the Additional Commissioner, he would have
       definitely incorporated the same in the order dated 30-5-2001.</blockquote>

       by concealing a material fact, the appellant succeeded in
      persuading the High Court and this Court to entertain
      adventurous litigation instituted by it and pass interim orders.
      If either of the Courts had been apprised of the fact that by
      virtue of lease deed dated 15-10-1994, the appellant has
      succeeded in securing temporary legitimacy for its possession
      over excess land, then there would have been no occasion for
      the High Court or this Court to entertain the writ petition or

consequences of abuse of the process of the Court as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      1. Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon litigants
      who, with intent to deceive and mislead the courts, initiated
      proceedings without full disclosure of facts and came to the
      courts with "unclean hands". Courts have held that such
      litigants are neither entitled to be heard on the merits of the
      case nor are entitled to any relief.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      2. The people, who approach the court for relief on an ex
      parte statement, are under a contract with the court that they
      would state the whole case fully and fairly to the court and
      where the litigant has broken such faith, the discretion of the
      court cannot be exercised in favour of such a litigant.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      3. The obligation to approach the court with clean hands is an
      absolute obligation and has repeatedly been reiterated by this
      Court.</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">      4. Quests for personal gains have become so intense that

      not entitled to any relief, interim or final.

<p id="p_34">      6. The court must ensure that its process is not abused and in
      order to prevent abuse of process of court, it would be
      justified even in insisting on furnishing of security and in
      cases of serious abuse, the court would be duty-bound to
      impose heavy costs.

<p id="p_35">      7. Wherever a public interest is invoked, the court must
      examine the petition carefully to ensure that there is genuine
      public interest involved. The stream of justice should not be
      allowed to be polluted by unscrupulous litigants.

In the present case also the suit is at the stage of grant of interim relief or the

engaged in manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products for the last over

products under the trademark 'Dr.Reddy's'. The registration processes of the
trademark 'Dr.Reddy's' had started in various countries including in India
however, in India by that time it was not registered. Further the defendant
therein was not a registered owner of the mark much less in class of goods it
was supplying. There was a past relationship between the plaintiff and
defendant therein in as much as the defendant had been purchasing the bulk
drugs from plaintiff since 1997 and at no stage it was manufacturing or
marketing its own pharmaceutical preparations. Thus the activities of the
defendant there were in the nature of distributor/agent of the plaintiff's
manufactured drugs without changing the packaging or the label. It is in the

drug was also similar to that of the plaintiff therein and the drug Omeprazole
which the plaintiff was selling under the name OMEZ was being sold by the
defendant under the name OMRE with similar design of packaging. This
Court also noted that the malafides of the defendant therein were writ large
as not only the defendant therein started using a similar trademark/trade
name but also started using the Hyderabad address despite the fact that the
defendant's registered office was in Delhi and the bills clearly mentioned
that the customers were required to make payments at Delhi and disputes
between the defendant therein and its customers were subject to jurisdiction
of Delhi Courts. It is in light of these facts that this Court held that the
adoption of the mark was dishonest and granted the injunction.

the principle of law that in the case of trademark, registration merely

       separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under
      the broad classification. If registration has been given
      generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad
      classification and if it is established that the trader or
      manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use
      any other Article except the articles being used by such trader
      or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is liable to be
      rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining
      such registration to the specific Article or articles which really
      concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration
      made in his favour. In our view, if rectification in such
      circumstances is not allowed, the trader or manufacturer by
      virtue of earlier registration will be permitted to enjoy the
      mischief of trafficking in trade mark. Looking to the scheme of
      the registration of trade mark as envisaged in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_40">Trade Marks
      Act</a> and the Rules framed thereunder, it appears to us that
      registration of a trade mark cannot be held to be absolute,
      perpetual and invariable under all circumstances. <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_41">Section 12</a> of
      the Trade Marks Act prohibits registration of identical or
      deceptively similar trade marks in respect of goods and
      description of goods which is identical or deceptively similar to
      the trade mark already registered. For prohibiting registration
      Under <a href="/doc/128323199/" id="a_42">Section 12(1)</a>, goods in respect of which subsequent
      registration is sought for, must be (i) in respect of goods or
      description of goods being same or similar and covered by
      earlier registration and (ii) trade mark claimed for such goods
      must be same or deceptively similar to the trade mark already
      registered. It may be noted here that Under Sub-section (3) of
      <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_43">Section 12</a> of the Trade Marks Act, in an appropriate case of
      honest concurrent use and/or of other special circumstances,
      same and deceptively similar trade marks may be permitted to
      another by the Registrar, subject to such conditions as may
      deem just and proper to the Registrar. It is also to be noted that
      the expression "goods" and "description of goods" appearing
      in <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_44">Section 12(1)</a> of the Trade Marks Act indicate that
      registration may be made in respect of one or more goods or of
      all goods conforming a general description. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_45">The Trade Marks
      Act</a> has noted distinction between description of goods forming

       a genus and separate and distinctly identifiable goods under
      the genus in various other Sections e.g. goods of same
      description in <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_46">Section 46</a>, <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_47">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_48">34</a> and class of
      goods in <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_49">Section 18</a>, Rules 12 and 26 read with Fourth
      Schedule to the Rules framed under the Act.

<p id="p_73">      48. The "class" mentioned in the Fourth Schedule may
      subsume or comprise a number of goods or articles which are
      separately identifiable and vendible and which are not goods of
      the same description as commonly understood in trade or in
      common parlance. Manufactured tobacco is a class mentioned
      in Class 34 of Fourth Schedule of the Rules but within the said
      class, there are a number of distinctly identifiable goods which
      are marketed separately and also used differently. In our view,
      it is not only permissible but it will be only just and proper to
      register one or more articles under a class or genus if in reality
      registration only in respect of such articles is intended, by
      specifically mentioning the names of such articles and by
      indicating the class under which such Article or articles are to
      be comprised. It is, therefore, permissible to register only
      cigarette or some other specific products made of
      "manufactured tobacco" as mentioned in Class 34 of Fourth
      Schedule of the Rules. In our view, the contention of
      Mr.Vaidyanathan that in view of change in the language of
      <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_50">Section 8</a> of the Trade Marks Act as compared to <a href="/doc/614348/" id="a_51">Section 5</a> of
      the Trade Marks Act, 1940, registration of trade mark is to be
      made only in respect of class or genus and not in respect of
      articles of different species under the genus is based on
      incorrect appreciation of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_52">Section 8</a> of the Trade Marks Act and
      Fourth Schedule of the Rules.

 inasmuch as the main object underlying the said principle is that the
proprietor of a trade mark cannot enjoy monopoly over the entire class of
goods and, particularly, when he is not using the said trade mark in respect
of certain goods falling under the same class. Supreme Court referring to
<a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_55">Section 11</a> of the Trade Marks Act which prohibits registration of the mark
in respect of similar goods or different goods held that the provisions of the
Section does not mean the same class of goods. Supreme Court further held
that the use of 'NANDHINI' by the appellant therein in respect of its
different goods would not be detrimental to the purported distinctive
character or repute of the trade mark of the respondent. It was observed that
the appellant therein had adopted the trade mark in respect of the items sold
in its restaurants way back in the year 1989 which was soon after the
respondent had started using the trade mark 'NANDINI' and that there was
no document or material produced by the respondent therein to show that by
the year 1989 the respondent therein had acquired distinctiveness in respect
of this trade mark within four years of the adoption thereof. Therefore, the
case was of a concurrent user of the trade mark by the appellant therein.

is the prior user of the mark 'SUJATA' but for the goods mixer, grinders,
blenders, however, for the goods water filters, water purifiers and RO
System, Rajesh Kumar Bansal the licensor and director of defendant No.1 is
the prior registered owner of the mark SUJATA and also the prior user, in
fact the only user as till date plaintiff has not used the mark 'SUJATA'for
water filters, water purifiers and RO system. Though the goods of the
plaintiff and defendant may fall in same broad classification of home
appliances are different goods used for different purposes.</p><pre id="pre_8">
