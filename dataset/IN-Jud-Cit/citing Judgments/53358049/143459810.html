                          filed by the Defendant seeking vacation of the injunction order, Court
                          modified the order dated 25.01.2016 qua the classes in which the Defendant
                          was registered but with a prima facie finding that the services of the
                          Defendant are allied and cognate to those of the Plaintiffs. As a matter of
                          record, both the interim orders are continuing to operate till date.
</p><p id="p_8">                          6.    Defendant filed written statement dated 18.04.2016 to the original
                          plaint and one of the defences taken against the alleged infringement was
                          that Defendant has registration in the mark TRAVELXP in Classes 38, 39,
                          41, 42 and 43. Defendant claimed to be a continuous user of TRAVELXP
                          trademark since the year 2009 and averred that its business activities
                          primarily involve booking of tickets and lodgings for travellers under
                          TRAVELXP and running of TV channel TRAVELXP HD. Defendant also
                          stated that its usage of the registered trademark has been honest and keeping
                          in view its flourishing reputation in travel consultancy and travel
                          programmes, Defendant is also entitled to a defence under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of

                          TRAVELXP in various classes from the written statement, Plaintiffs took
                          the plea of invalidity of Defendant&#x27;s registration in the mark, in the
                          replication and filed an application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_5">Section 124</a> of the Act, being I.A.
                          1152/2017. However, Court was of the view that plea of invalidity is
                          required to be pleaded in the plaint and vide order dated 31.01.2019
                          permitted the Plaintiffs to withdraw the application, with liberty to seek
                          amendment of the plaint. Pursuant to the liberty granted, Plaintiffs filed an
                          application for amendment of the plaint, to incorporate the plea of invalidity,
                          being I.A. 4121/2019. Vide order dated 22.08.2019, the application was

                          allowed and the amended plaint was taken on record. Subsequent thereto,
                          the present application was filed by the Plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_10">                          8.    By this application, Plaintiffs seek framing of an additional issue
                          regarding invalidity of Defendant&#x27;s trademark registrations to avail the
                          remedy of cancellation/rectification. Arguing in support of the application,
                          learned counsel for the Plaintiffs contended that: (a) Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark
                          TRAVELEX is a coined word, invented due to Plaintiffs&#x27; imagination and
                          skilful allusion, on account of which the mark is inherently distinctive and
                          exclusively associated with the Plaintiffs and none else; (b) Plaintiffs are
                          prior adopters and users of the trademark, adopted in the year 1976, whereas
                          admittedly, Defendant adopted the impugned trademark TRAVELXP in
                          2009; (c) rival trademarks are phonetically similar, which fact has been
                          admitted by the Defendant in its counter statement filed before the Trade
                          Marks Registry viz: &#x27;there is a phonetic similarity insofar as the words
                          TRAVELXP DAKSHIN/TRAVELEX are concerned...&#x27;; (d) rival marks are
                          also structurally and visually deceptively similar; (e) Defendant has adopted
                          a deceptively similar mark with a mala fide and dishonest intent to create
                          confusion in the minds of the consumers and members of the trade and
                          encash upon Plaintiffs&#x27; formidable goodwill and reputation; (f) Defendant&#x27;s
                          services are allied and cognate to the services provided by the Plaintiffs,
                          applying the tests laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/53358049/" id="a_6">FDC Limited v. Docsuggest
                          Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., 2017 SCC OnLine Del 6381, as the
                          respective use, users, intended purpose, physical nature of the services,
                          sector and trade channels are the same; (g) this Court has rendered a prima
                          facie finding that the services offered by the Defendant are allied and
                          cognate to those of the Plaintiffs in the order dated 25.01.2016, modified

                          vide order dated 09.05.2016, both of which hold the field today; (h) plea of
                          invalidity has been taken by the Plaintiffs in the amended plaint, stating
                          therein that the registrations obtained by the Defendant are invalid and liable
                          to be rectified and removed from the Register of Trade Marks, in view of
                          <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_7">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_8">11</a> of the Act; (i) the plea is prima facie tenable as this Court
                          has rendered a prima facie finding that Defendant&#x27;s trademark bears visual
                          and phonetic resemblance to Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark and the respective
                          services go hand in hand leading to likelihood of confusion, which connotes
                          that Defendant&#x27;s mark is vulnerable and registration ought to be cancelled
                          under <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_9">Section 11</a> of the Act; and (j) ingredients of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_10">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_11">11</a> of the
                          Act are mirror images of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_12">Section 29</a> of the Act, which becomes evident
                          when grounds of refusal under <a href="/doc/1822769/" id="a_13">Section 11(1)(a)</a> are compared with grounds
                          of infringement under <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_14">Section 29(1)</a>. This is fortified from the fact that in
                          Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, the Supreme
                          Court applied the test of purchaser with average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection in proceedings arising from rectification petition, whereas this
                          Court relied on Amritdhara Pharmacy (supra), in <a href="/doc/170773848/" id="a_15">Inter Ikea Systems BV v.
                          Annanya Gautam</a>, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 11665, which was a trademark
                          infringement suit.
</p><p id="p_11">                          9.    Learned counsel relied on the law laid down in the judgment of the

                          invalidity of registration of Defendant&#x27;s mark is prima facie tenable and,
                          therefore, an issue be framed, enabling the Plaintiffs to seek cancellation of
                          registration of the impugned trademark and consequent rectification of the
                          Register. Reliance was also placed on the judgments in Bacardi and

                                SCC 370, the Supreme Court has held that if pleadings do not contain
                                sufficient particulars and details, issues cannot be framed. In Patel
                                Field Marshal Agencies and Another (supra), the Supreme Court has
                                held that an application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_29">Section 124</a> of the Act can only be

                                which provide that issue arises where a material proposition of fact or

                                relating to travel exchange, travel insurance, etc. are similar or even
                                allied and cognate to Defendant&#x27;s services. When examined in the

                                feature of the said judgment is that in the said case, the trademark in
                                question was unregistered and the judgment was not rendered in the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                  &quot;31. Rather, from the résumé of the provisions of the 1958
                                  Act made above, it becomes clear that all questions with
                                  regard to the validity of a trade mark is required to be
                                  decided by the Registrar or the High Court under the 1958
                                  Act or by the Registrar or the IPAB under the 1999 Act and
                                  not by the civil court. The civil court, in fact, is not
                                  empowered by the Act to decide the said question.</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">                                  Furthermore, the Act mandates that the decisions rendered by
                                  the prescribed statutory authority [Registrar/High Court (now
                                  IPAB)] will bind the civil court. At the same time, the Act
                                  (both old and new) goes on to provide a different procedure to
                                  govern the exercise of the same jurisdiction in two different

                                  find a triable issue on the plea of invalidity the remedy of an
                                  aggrieved party would not be to move under <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_33">Sections 46</a>/<a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_34">56</a> of

                                  appeal. This would be necessary to avoid multiple

                                  situations i.e. where no suit for infringement is pending at the

                                  has come to be instituted subsequent to the application for
                                  rectification, it is the Registrar or the High Court which
                                  constitutes the tribunal to determine the question of invalidity,
                                  the procedure contemplated by the statute to govern the
                                  exercise of jurisdiction to rectify is, however, different in the
                                  two situations enumerated. Such difference has already been
                                  noted.
</p><p id="p_23">                                  34. The intention of the legislature is clear. All issues
                                  relating to and connected with the validity of registration has
                                  to be dealt with by the Tribunal and not by the civil court. In
                                  cases where the parties have not approached the civil court,
                                  <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_35">Sections 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_36">56</a> provide an independent statutory right to
                                  an aggrieved party to seek rectification of a trade mark.
                                  However, in the event the civil court is approached, inter alia,
                                  raising the issue of invalidity of the trade mark such plea will
                                  be decided not by the civil court but by the Tribunal under the
                                  1958 Act. The Tribunal will however come into seisin of the
                                  matter only if the civil court is satisfied that an issue with
                                  regard to invalidity ought to be framed in the suit. Once an

                                  parties do not approach the Tribunal for rectification, the
                                  plea with regard to rectification will no longer survive.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_24">                          13.   Plain reading of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_37">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Act shows that two
                          ingredients are required to be met for an Applicant to succeed viz: (a) plea of
                          invalidation; and (b) prima facie tenability. In view of the aforesaid binding
                          dicta of the Supreme Court, the first point that needs examination is if the
                          Plaintiffs have raised a plea of invalidity of registration of the impugned
                          mark. Learned Senior Counsel for the Defendant is right in his submission
                          that provisions of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_38">Section 124</a> of the Act require that a party must satisfy the
                          Court that the plea of invalidity of registration of the Opponent&#x27;s mark is
                          prima facie tenable and for the Court to raise an issue, provisions of Order
                          XIV Rule 1 CPC are attracted, which provide that issues arise when a
                          material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and denied by
                          the other. This proposition needs no reiteration and the principle is re-stated
                          by this Court in Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (supra). With this backdrop,
                          pleadings in the present suit need to be analysed to see if Plaintiffs have laid
                          the foundation supporting the plea of invalidity.
</p><p id="p_25">                          14.   It is an undisputed position that the plea of invalidity of registration of
                          Defendant&#x27;s trademark is not set out in the plaint, as according to the
                          Plaintiffs, this fact was disclosed in the written statement. Plaintiffs
                          thereafter sought amendment of the plaint, which was allowed and therefore,
                          for the purpose of the present application, it is the amended plaint which
                          requires to be examined. From a perusal of the amended plaint, it is evident
                          that Plaintiffs have pleaded that Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark TRAVELEX is a
                          coined and invented trademark, inherently distinctive and registered in
                          multiple Classes and that it is also prominently used along with other

                          trademarks/trade names of the Plaintiffs in all promotional and advertising
                          material. With reference to the impugned mark, Plaintiffs have pleaded
                          phonetic, visual and structural identity/deceptive similarity between the rival
                          trademarks and also averred that Defendant is using the infringing mark with
                          mala fide intent to obtain undue monetary benefits by encashing on the
                          substantial goodwill and reputation attached to Plaintiffs and their affiliate/
                          group companies. Plaintiffs have also pleaded that continued user of the
                          infringing trade name by the Defendant for its business activities is likely to
                          result in dilution, diminution and eventual erosion of the reputation in the
                          trademark TRAVELEX. Allegations of erosion in the reputation and
                          goodwill, assiduously built over the years by the act of the Defendant, which
                          would reduce the capacity of the public to identify and distinguish services
                          of the Plaintiffs originating from a particular source, also find mention in the
                          plaint, in addition to identity/deceptive similarity in the activities of the
                          respective parties. Significantly, in para 25, Plaintiffs also aver that the
                          registrations have been obtained by the Defendant fraudulently and the same
                          being invalid, deserve to be struck off from the Register of Trade Marks.
                          Plea of violation of provisions of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_39">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_40">11</a> is also asseverated in the
                          plaint, reserving the right of the Plaintiffs to take appropriate steps to initiate
                          rectification proceedings. In my view, the pleadings are sufficient to lay a
                          foundation for the plea of invalidity as required under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_41">Section 124</a> of the Act
                          and, therefore, the judgement in Maria Margarida (supra), will have no
                          applicability in the present case. Even otherwise, it has been held in Abbott
                          Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (supra) that a litigant ought not to suffer for poor
                          pleadings, and I quote para 39 of the judgment as under:-

                                  requisite but following the principle enunciated in <a href="/doc/18240547/" id="a_42">Teva
                                  Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. Natco Pharma Ltd</a>. (2014)
                                  210 DLT 591 (DB) that the litigant ought not to suffer for
                                  poor pleadings and in view of the fact that Patel Field
                                  Marshal Agencies supra is of recent vintage and the counsels,
                                  on enquiry, state that there is no precedent on the said aspect,
                                  I am of the view that benefit should be given to the plaintiff
                                  and the aforesaid weakness in the pleadings of the plaintiff
                                  should not be allowed to come in the way of the plaintiff to

</p>
<p id="p_27">                          15.   Looking at the plea of invalidity raised by the Plaintiffs on account of
                          the alleged phonetic and visual similarity between the rival trademarks and
                          the commonality of activity, which view is supported by the interim orders
                          granted by this Court on 25.01.2016 and 09.05.2016, this Court is of the
                          view that plea of invalidity is prima facie tenable. Learned Senior Counsel
                          for the Defendant had emphatically articulated that the interim orders passed
                          by this Court cannot be relied on by the Plaintiffs, as the threshold of an
                          application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_43">Section 124</a> of the Act is much higher. Albeit subtly, an
                          argument was also raised that in some classes, registration is post the interim
                          orders and the mark TRAVELXP carries suffixes such as HD, TAMIL, 4K
                          HDR etc. and when seen as a whole are wholly different. Dissimilarities in
                          the nature of services rendered and field of activities were also raised. In my
                          view, these arguments cannot come to Defendant&#x27;s aid at this stage. No
                          doubt, the injunction orders passed by this Court are only interim orders, but
                          they continue to operate till date and reflect the prima facie view of the
                          Court. In any case, at this stage, this Court is only examining if the plea of
                          invalidity raised by the Plaintiffs is prima facie tenable and the final

                          decision on the validity of registration of the impugned mark will be taken
                          only in the rectification petition, if and when filed. It would be open to the
                          Defendant to defend its registrations on all grounds available in law,
                          including alleged dissimilarity of marks which carry suffixes, if any and the
                          services offered by the respective parties.
</p><p id="p_28">                          16.   Contention of the Defendant that there is a delay in raising the issue
                          of invalidity, only deserves to be rejected. Plaintiffs have averred in the
                          plaint that in July, 2015, they discovered the use of the infringing trade name
                          on cyber space and immediately served a cease and desist notice on the
                          Defendant on 10.07.2015. However, when the Defendant failed to respond,
                          the present suit was filed. As the record shows, the suit was originally filed
                          on 20.01.2016. In the order dated 09.05.2016, on an application filed by the
                          Defendant under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC, Plaintiffs stated that they were
                          not aware of the registration of Defendant&#x27;s trademark while the plea of the
                          Defendant was that Plaintiffs had concealed the registrations of the
                          Defendant in Classes 38, 39, 41, 42 and 43. Taking note of the submissions,
                          the Court modified the ex parte injunction order dated 25.01.2016, however,
                          restraining the Defendant from offering its services under the impugned
                          trademark in Classes 16, 35 and 36. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed an
                          application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_44">Section 124</a> of the Act on 25.01.2017, which was
                          withdrawn on 31.01.2019, with liberty to amend the plaint, since at that
                          stage, the plaint was bereft of pleadings with respect to the plea of invalidity
                          of Defendant&#x27;s trademarks. Amendment application was thereafter filed and
                          the same was allowed vide order dated 22.08.2019. Pursuant to the
                          amendment in the plaint, the present application was filed on 03.09.2019.
