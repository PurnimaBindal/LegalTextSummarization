Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
</pre><p id="p_1">1. Notice. Notice is accepted by learned counsel for the Respondents. With
the consent of learned counsel for the parties the appeal has been heard
finally.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2. This appeal by the Defendant in CS (COMM) 342 of 2019 is directed
against an order dated 5th July 2019 passed by the learned Single Judge in IA
No.8873 of 2019 in the said suit whereby inter alia the Appellant was
restrained from infringing Indian Patent IN No.247381 (hereafter referred to
as „the suit patent‟) held by the Respondents/Plaintiffs.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                           Page 1 of 20</span>
<p id="p_3"> 3. There are 3 Respondents in this appeal. They correspondingly were
Plaintiffs 1, 2 and 3 in the aforementioned suit. They will be referred to in
this order, for convenience, as Plaintiffs 1, 2 and 3, just as the Appellant will
be referred to as the Defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4. Plaintiff No.1 is Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ireland Unlimited
Company, which is a company incorporated in the laws of Ireland, with its
head office in Switzerland. Plaintiff No.2 Bristol-Myers Squibb India Pvt.
Ltd. is incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956, having its registered
office in Mumbai and another office in New Delhi. It is a subsidiary of
Plaintiff No.1 and markets pharmaceutical products in the domestic market.
Plaintiff No.3 Pfizer Ltd. is a company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies
Act</a>, 1913 having its registered office in Mumbai. Plaintiff No.3 is also into
discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical
products.   Plaintiff No.3 is stated to have entered into a collaboration
arrangement with Plaintiff No.2 inter alia to "commercialize including
marketing, promoting, selling, etc. of „Apixaban‟ products in India."
</p>

<p id="p_5">5. The prayer in the above suit was for a permanent injunction, restraining
the Defendant from using, making, selling, storing, distributing, advertising,
marketing, exporting, offering for sale, importing or in any other manner
directly or indirectly dealing in any product, including but not limited to
„Apigat‟ that was alleged to infringe the subject matter of the suit patent.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6. The Plaintiffs have averred in the plaint that the suit patent covers a
molecule having an International Non-proprietary Name („INN‟) Apixaban
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                               Page 2 of 20</span>
 used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. It is stated
that the Plaintiffs are the rightful owners of the suit patent, the term of which
expires on 17th September 2022. It is stated that the patent was granted in
2011.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7. It is further averred in para 10 of the plaint that the Defendant on 9th May
2016 filed a petition before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board
(„IPAB‟) seeking revocation of the suit patent. The said petition is stated to
be pending. It is averred in the plaint that the Plaintiff No.1 has also been
granted Indian patent No.243917 for „Nitrogen Containing Heterobicycles
As factor Xa Inhibitors‟ on 11th November 2010. It is stated that Plaintiff
No.2 was granted import and marketing approval for Apixaban tablets by
the Drug Controller General of India („DGCI‟) on 3rd August 2012, 16th May
2014, 29th May 2015 and the permission was recently amended in the name
of Plaintiff No.3 on 15th February 2019 by the DGCI.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8. According to the Plaintiffs, in the last week of June 2019 they received
information that the Defendant is planning to launch a generic version of
Apixaban under the probable brand name „Apigat‟ and has "already
distributed sample packs to many cardiologists in the country." According
to the Plaintiffs, in the first week of July 2019 they were shocked to learn
that "the stock of the Defendant would soon be available for sale in the
market, as the saleable stock are in transit as per the information received
from credible sources."
</p>

<p id="p_9">9. The Plaintiffs have stated that investigation conducted by them revealed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                               Page 3 of 20</span>
 that the Defendant was in the process of launching the product „Apigat‟
having the composition of Apixaban. However, "the same was not available
with any super stockist/distributor/company and the same is not available for
sale in the open market."
</p>

<p id="p_10">10. In para 33 of the plaint it is averred as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "33. Moreover, the intention of the Defendant to launch the
        generic version of the drug in the commercial market is
        further evident from the activities of the Defendant that it has
        filed a suit for declaration of non-infringement of Plaintiffs'
        another Patent No.IN 243917 against the Plaintiffs before the
        City Civil Court in Hyderabad pertaining to their product
        having the international non-proprietary name Apixaban
        which was listed on 28th June 2019."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">11. The plaint stated that notice appeared to have been issued in the said suit
by the City Civil Court Hyderabad on 8th July 2019. It was contended by the
Plaintiffs that without waiting for the injunction application to be argued in
the said suit, the Defendant appeared to have "sent the products to their
distributors, although the infringing product has not entered the commercial
and retail market, as verily believed by the Plaintiffs." It is on the above
basis that the aforementioned suit CS (COMM) 342 of 2019 was filed and
came up for hearing first before the learned Single Judge on 5 th July 2019
along with IA No.8876 of 2019 filed by the Plaintiff under Order XXXIX
Rules 1 and 2 CPC seeking interim injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_12">12. A perusal of the impugned order shows that the Defendant appeared on
caveat and was represented by Senior Counsel. Para 11 of the impugned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                             Page 4 of 20</span>
 order indicates that the learned Single Judge "straightaway asked the senior
counsel for the Defendant as to why the interim order in terms of the order
dated 31st May, 2019 in CS (COMM) No. 314/2019 titled as <a href="/doc/100652936/" id="a_3">Sterlite
Technologies Ltd. v. ZTT India Pvt. Ltd</a>. should not be passed till the
completion of pleadings and hearing of the application for interim relief". A
copy of the aforementioned order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra) was
also "handed over to the senior counsel for the Defendant."
</p>

<p id="p_13">13. At this stage it requires to be noticed that the suit, in which the said
interim order in <a href="/doc/100652936/" id="a_4">Sterlite Technologies Ltd. v. ZTT India Pvt. Ltd</a>. was
passed (incidentally by the same learned Single Judge who passed the
impugned interim order), was for a permanent injunction restraining the
Defendant in that case from infringing two Indian patents. The subject
patents there were „method patents‟. The case of the Plaintiff in that case
was that "the optical fibre being marketed by the Defendant had the same
technical parameters as that of the optical fibres of the Plaintiff produced
with the patented technology."
</p>

<p id="p_14">14. The said interim order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. granting ad interim
injunction was passed ex-parte. Interestingly in para 9 of the said order, the
learned Single Judge observed that "at this stage, it is not possible to form an
opinion, even prima facie." In the said order the learned Single Judge was of
the view that there should invariably be an interim injunction granted in the
first place in favour of a patent holder for the reasons set out in paras 16-17,
which read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "16. I say so because, a patentee, even after succeeding in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                              Page 5 of 20</span>
       suit, in the absence of any interim order, is entitled only to
      profits earned by the defendant and which do not reflect the
      profits which the plaintiff would have earned if there had been
      no infringement. As aforesaid, the infringer is able to market at
      a much lower price, resulting in earning far less profits that
      which the patentee would have earned if there had been no
      infringement. The patentee would then also be entitled to
      punitive action against defendant for violation of the interim
      order.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      17. Such arrangement, in my view, will also ensure that suits
      for infringement are not contested, only to take advantage of
      and to reap the fruits of delays in Court process, in spite of
      defendant in its heart knowing the truth. Each defendant, in its
      heart knows the truth and if in spite of knowing that it is in
      infringement, violates the interim order, will, besides taking the
      risk of financial liability, also run the risk of penal
      consequences. This will also ensure purity of the Court
      process."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">15. According to the learned Single Judge "this experimentation, with
interim orders in patent infringement suits, is the need of the hour." On the
above reasoning in the instant case, by the impugned order the learned
Single Judge granted on the lines of the order granted in Sterlite
Technologies Ltd. (supra) till the next date i.e. 19th September 2019, an
interim injunction restraining the Appellant/Defendant herein from
infringing the suit patent i.e. IN Patent No. 247381. A copy of the order in
Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra) was annexed to the impugned interim
order "for convenience".
</p>

<p id="p_16">16. It requires to be noticed at this stage that on the same date that CS
(COMM) 342 of 2019 was listed before the learned Single Judge another

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                             Page 6 of 20</span>
 patent infringement suit CS (COMM) 343 of 2019 (Bayer Health Care LLC
v. Natco Pharma Ltd.) was listed. A near identical order for interim
injunction was passed by the learned Single Judge in the application filed in
the said suit CS(COMM) 343 of 2019 on the same day i.e. 5th July 2019 in
terms of the interim injunction granted by the order dated 31 st May 2019 in
<a href="/doc/100652936/" id="a_5">Sterlite Technologies Ltd. v. ZTT India Pvt. Ltd</a>. (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_17">17. The said interim order dated 5th July 2019 passed by the same learned
Single Judge in the interim injunction application in the aforementioned CS
(COMM) 343 of 2019 was set aside by this Division Bench (DB) by a
detailed judgment dated 11th July 2019 in FAO (OS) (COMM) 158 of 2019
(<a href="/doc/52483234/" id="a_6">Natco Pharma Ltd. v. Bayer Healthcare LLC</a>). The application for interim
relief in which the said order granting interim injunction was passed was
placed before the learned Single Judge for a fresh consideration on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_18">18. Mr. Sai Deepak, learned counsel appearing for the Appellant/Defendant,
made the following submissions:
</p><p id="p_19">(i) The impugned interim order is contrary to the settled law explained in
several decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court in the matter of
granting an ad interim injunction. In particular, there is no satisfaction
recorded of the Plaintiff having made out a prima facie case or that the
balance of convenience is in its favour or that it would suffer irreparable
hardship if the injunction is not granted.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(ii) On essentially the same issue in „Apixaban‟ the earlier suit filed by the
Defendant in the City Civil Court in Hyderabad against the plaint is pending
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                            Page 7 of 20</span>
 and, therefore, in terms of Section 10 of the CPC the suit before the learned
Single Judge could not have proceeded.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(iii) In the cause of action paragraph in the plaint filed before the learned
Single Judge, the Plaintiffs admitted the cause of action that arose in July
2019 when the Defendant‟s suit was filed in Hyderabad. Therefore, under
Section 20 CPC the Plaintiffs ought to have pursued their remedies only in
that Court.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(iv) There is no presumptive validity in the grant of a patent. There was
already a revocation application filed by the Defendant against the suit
patent pending before the IPAB; inasmuch as Apixaban was already
disclosed but not claimed in IN 243917 it was publici juris. No valid patent
could have been granted in respect thereof again in favour of the Plaintiffs.
The fundamental premise of patent law was that monopoly in a patent is
limited to the claims and any product/process/compound which is disclosed
but not claimed is dedicated to the public.
</p>
<p id="p_23">(v) The impugned order overlooked the fact that the Defendant‟s product
was already in the market. The falsity of the case of the Plaintiffs was
evident from the fact that they had all the details of the Defendant‟s product
including the trademark, photograph of the actual product, all of which was
possible only if the Plaintiffs had the Defendant‟s product.
</p>
<p id="p_24">(vi) The impugned order was vague and was capable of leading to further
litigation regarding non-compliance by the Defendant with the said interim
injunction. In fact the Plaintiffs had already filed IA 9421 of 2019 against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                            Page 8 of 20</span>
 the Defendant under Order XXXIX Rule 2-A CPC alleging violation of the
interim injunction and the said application was being heard today before the
learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(vii) An order similar to the one passed by this DB in FAO (OS) (COMM)
158 of 2019 should be passed in the present appeal as well. The impugned
order should be set aside and the matter remanded to the learned Single
Judge for a fresh decision on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_26">19. Mr. Amit Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondents/
Plaintiffs, stated that he was aware of and had examined the order dated 11 th
July 2019 passed by this Court in FAO (COMM) 158 of 2019 but sought to
distinguish the present case by referring to the fact that in that appeal the
Appellant (Natco Pharma Ltd.) had filed an affidavit before the DB stating
that they had released their product in the market on 27 th June 2019. In the
present case, on the other hand, the Defendant filed an affidavit before the
learned Single Judge in IA 9421 of 2019 claiming that it had started its
promotional activity for launch on 19th June 2019 and that its product Apigat
"was prescribed to patients from 28th June 2019." He submitted that it was,
therefore, false for the Defendant to contend that its product Apigat was
already available in the market. Clearly an attempt was made to overreach
the Court of the learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_27">20. Mr. Sibal further submitted that

</p><p id="p_28">(i) The elements of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                            Page 9 of 20</span>
 hardship to the Plaintiffs in support of the grant of interim injunction in their
favour, even if not so stated in express terms, were discernable from the
impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(ii) It was plain that the only defence of the Defendant was regarding
invalidity of the patent whereas there was sufficient admission even in the
plaint in the suit filed by the Defendant in the City Civil Court at Hyderabad
that the suit patent covered the product 'Apigat‟.
</p>
<p id="p_30">(iii) Without pursuing its revocation application pending before the IPAB to
its logical conclusion, the Defendant had risked introducing its product in
the market. This was dishonest and done knowing fully well that the product
sought to be introduced by it was already covered by a valid patent held by
the Plaintiffs.
</p>

<p id="p_31">21. The above submissions have been considered. At the outset, the Court
would like to observe that the impugned order is nearly identical to the
interim order passed on the same day i.e. 5th July 2019 by the same learned
Single Judge in the suit CS (OS) (COMM) 343 of 2019 filed against the
present Defendant by Bayer Healthcare LLC. That suit too alleged
infringement of a pharmaceutical patent. The only difference is the suit
patent. Even several paras of the impugned interim order in the present case
are a verbatim reproduction of the said interim order in the suit by Bayer
Healthcare.
</p>

<p id="p_32">22. As already noticed, this DB has by a detailed order dated 11 th July 2019
 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                               Page 10 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                               20</span>
 in FAO (OS) (COMM) 158 of 2019 (<a href="/doc/52483234/" id="a_7">Natco Pharma Ltd. v. Bayer
Healthcare LLC</a>) set aside the said interim order and remanded the
application for interim injunction to the learned Single Judge for a fresh
decision on merits. In the present appeal, the issues involved are the same.
In the considered view of this DB, the order passed by it on 11th July 2017 in
FAO (OS) (COMM) 158 of 2019 would apply on all fours to the present
appeal. The discussion that follows, therefore, is largely on the lines of that
contained in the said order.
</p>

<p id="p_33">23. To begin with, it may be observed that the impugned order was clearly
not an ex parte order. The Defendant appeared on caveat on the very first
date and made submissions. On the other hand, the order which has been
adopted by the learned Single Judge i.e. the order in Sterlite Technologies
Ltd. (supra) was an ex parte order.
</p>

<p id="p_34">24. The law in relation to the passing of orders of interim injunction is fairly
well settled. Illustratively, reference may be made to the decision in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_8">Wander
v. Antox</a> (1990) (Supp) SCC 727 where the legal principles were enunciated
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction
      is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the
      plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and
      uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the
      trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well
      settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory
      remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object
      of the interlocutory injunction, it is stated
              "...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by
 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                              Page 11 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                              20</span>
              violation of his rights for which he could not
             adequately be compensated in damages
             recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were
             resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for
             such protection must be weighed against the
             corresponding need of the defendant to be
             protected against injury resulting from his having
             been prevented from exercising his own legal
             rights for which he could not be adequately
             compensated. The court must weigh one need
             against another and determine where the "balance
             of convenience lies."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo,
      the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The
      court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he
      considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be
      prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration
      whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or
      whether he has already been doing so in which latter case
      considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a
      case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are
      attracted."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_35">25. <a href="/doc/1822024/" id="a_9">In Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden</a> (1990) 2 SCC 117,
the Supreme Court explained:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus
      granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last
      non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy
      until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to
      compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done
      or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the
      party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction
      to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the
      trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party
 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                              Page 12 of

       against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it
      to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause
      great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain
      guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are:
      (1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it shall be of
      a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally
      required for a prohibitory injunction.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which
      normally cannot be compensated in terms of money
      (3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking
      such relief.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of an
      interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in the
      sound judicial discretion of the Court to be exercised in the
      light of the facts and circumstances in each case. Though the
      above guidelines are neither exhaustive or complete or absolute
      rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances needing
      action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or refusal of
      such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial
      discretion."

Supreme Court in its recent judgment in <a href="/doc/95304362/" id="a_10">Tek Singh v. Shashi Verma</a> 2019

      temporary injunction only when the following requirements are

       made out by the plaintiff : (i) existence of a prima facie case as
      pleaded, necessitating protection of plaintiff's rights by issue of
      a temporary injunction; (ii) when the need for protection of
      plaintiff's rights is compared with or weighed against the need
      for protection of defendant's rights or likely infringement of
      defendant's rights, the balance of convenience tilting in favour
      of plaintiff; and (iii) clear possibility of irreparable injury being
      caused to plaintiff if the temporary injunction is not granted. In
      addition, temporary injunction being an equitable relief, the
      discretion to grant such relief will be exercised only when the
      plaintiff's conduct is free from blame and he approaches the
      court with clean hands."
</p>
<p id="p_39">28. <a href="/doc/1224686/" id="a_12">In Mahadeo Savlaram Shelke v. Pune Municipal Corporation</a> (1995) 3
SCC 33, the Supreme Court explained that the expressions „prima facie‟
case, „balance of convenience‟, „irreparable hardship‟ were not rhetorical
phrases for mere „incantation‟. It was explained:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "8. <a href="/doc/49480/" id="a_13">In Dalpat Kumar v. Prahlad Singh</a> AIR 1993 SC 276, a
      Bench of two Judges (in which K. Ramaswamy, J. was a
      Member) of this Court held that the phrases "prima facie case",
      "balance of convenience" and "irreparable loss" are not
      rhetorical phrases for incantation but words of width and
      elasticity, intended to meet myriad situations presented by
      men's ingenuity in given facts and circumstances and should
      always be hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to
      meet the ends of justice. The court would be circumspect before
      granting the injunction and look to the conduct of the party, the
      probable injury to either party and whether the plaintiff could
      be adequately compensated if injunction is refused. The
      existence of prima facie right and infraction of the enjoyment of
      his property or the right is a condition for the grant of
      temporary injunction. Prima facie case is not to be confused
      with prima facie title which has to be established on evidence at
      the trial. Only prima facie case is a substantial question raised,
      bona fide, which needs investigation and a decision on merits.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10"> FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                                Page 14 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                                20</span>
       Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not
      sufficient to grant injunction. The court further has to satisfy
      that non-interference by the court would result in "irreparable
      injury" to the party seeking relief and that there is no other
      remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction and
      he needs protection from the consequences of apprehended
      injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury, however, does not
      mean that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the
      injury but means only that the injury must be a material one,
      namely one that cannot be adequately compensated by way of
      damages. The balance of convenience must be in favour of
      granting injunction. The court while granting or refusing to
      grant injunction should exercise sound judicial discretion to
      find the amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely
      to be caused to the parties if the injunction is refused and
      compare it with that which is likely to be caused to the other
      side if the injunction is granted. If on weighing competing
      possibilities or probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the
      court considers that pending the suit, the subject matter should
      be maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued. The
      court has to exercise its sound judicial discretion in granting or
      refusing the relief of ad interim injunction pending the suit."

<p id="p_40">29. Matters involving alleged infringement of patents constitute a separate
species of litigation. A further sub-species would be those concerning
pharmaceutical patents. This is because the law concerning them under the
<a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_14">Patents Act</a>, 1970 and other related legislation has peculiar elements that
would have to be kept in view by the Court. Unsurprisingly, therefore, there
is a growing volume of Indian case law dealing with the parameters that
should weigh with the Court while examining the case of alleged
infringement of pharmaceutical patents. While the parameters that have to
generally be kept in view in all suits where interim injunctions are sought,

 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                             Page 15 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                             20</span>
 would apply in such cases as well, they would indubitably involve other
parameters which have been discussed in a large number of decisions
including     <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_15">Merck    Sharp    and    Dohme     Corporation    v.   Glenmark
Pharmaceuticals</a> 2015 (63) PTC 257 [Del][DB]. A further example,
illustratively, is the decisions in <a href="/doc/57798471/" id="a_16">Cipla Ltd. v. F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</a>.
(2009) 40 PTC 125 (DB). The question of challenge of the validity of
pharmaceutical patents has also engaged the attention of the Indian Courts at
all levels. The need for the principles that would have to be kept in mind
while dealing with those contentions, even at the interim injunction stage,
hardly need to be emphasised. Illustratively, reference may be made to
<a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_17">Novartis Ag v. Union of India</a> (2013) 6 SCC 1.
</p>

<p id="p_41">30. The Court at this stage would like to refer to the fact that only one of the
submissions of the Defendant was noted in the impugned order in para 12 as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "12. The senior counsel for the defendant draws attention to
         para no.28 of the plaint where the plaintiffs have referred to
         another patent being Indian Patent No.243917 and has
         contended that the plaintiff in the plaint in para no.28 has
         falsely pleaded that Indian Patent No.243917 "does not
         specifically disclose APIXABAN" subject matter of Indian
         Patent No.247381, subject matter of this suit. It is contended
         that Indian Patent No.243917 discloses APIXABAN and the
         defendant, along with its pleadings, will file documents in this
         regard, which have not been filed by the plaintiffs."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">31. The opinion of the learned Single Judge on the said submission is
contained in para 13 which reads as under:
</p><p id="p_43">         "13. In my view, same would be a ground for invalidity of the
 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                              Page 16 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                              20</span>
       patent. The same would also be a ground for defeating the suit
      and if the suit is defeated, the consequences as provided in the
      order dated 31st May, 2019 in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra)
      would not apply."
</p>
<p id="p_44">32. Thereafter, in para 14, the learned Single Judge observes that "the said
argument is thus not a ground, at least till the next date of hearing to not pass
orders in the said terms."
</p>

<p id="p_45">33. Far from rejecting the submission, the learned Single Judge
acknowledges that it would be „a ground for invalidity of the patent‟ and
would also be „a ground for defeating the suit‟. However, there is no
formation of an opinion of the Plaintiffs having made out a prima facie case
in their favour for grant of an interim injunction. Even the order in Sterile
Technologies Ltd. (supra) incorporated as it were „by reference‟ by the
learned Single Judge in the impugned order does not set out any prima facie
view. On the contrary, it records in para 9 that „at this stage, it is not possible
to form an opinion, even prima facie‟. As regards the other two elements
viz., balance of convenience and irreparable hardship, there is no mention of
these, even impliedly in the impugned order.
</p>

<p id="p_46">34. Although, there are special features in litigation involving infringement
of patents, that still would not obviate the Court dealing with the question of
grant of interim injunction to record the three important elements as have
been stressed in a large number of decisions of the Supreme Court. It is not
necessary that the order granting or refusing interim injunction should

 FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                                 Page 17 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                                 20</span>
 expressly state about the above elements but a reading of the order should
indicate the forming of an opinion by the Court on the said aspects. A
reading of the impugned order does not reflect that the Court has formed
such an opinion on the aforementioned elements.
</p>

<p id="p_47">35. Again, each case of alleged infringement of patent, particularly a
pharmaceutical patent, would turn on its own facts. It is not possible to
conceive an „across-the-board‟ blanket approach that would apply to all such
cases, where as a matter of routine at the first hearing there would be a grant
of injunction in favour of the Plaintiff. The decision in the application of
interim injunction has to necessarily indicate the view of the Court on the
three elements mentioned hereinbefore and the additional features when it
involves a case of alleged infringement of a patent, and in particular, a
pharmaceutical patent. It is not the length of the order or its precise wording
that matters. It is necessary, however, that the factors mentioned
hereinbefore must be discernible from the order which comes to a
conclusion one way or the other regarding the grant of an interim injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_48">36. The Court would also like to add here that the impugned order which
restrains the Defendant from infringing the suit patent does not lend itself to
sufficient clarity. In fact it has already resulted in the Plaintiffs filing an
application under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of CPC in the suit alleging
violation of the interim injunction by the Defendant. Such an allegation is of
course being denied by the Defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_49"> FAO (OS) (COMM) 160/2019                                              Page 18 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                              20</span>
</p><p id="p_50"> 37. This Court hastens to clarify that it should not be understood as having
expressed any opinion one way or the other on the respective contentions of
the parties noted hereinbefore. These have been set out only to highlight
what their respective cases at this stage for grant of interim injunction are.
These necessarily have to be considered. A reading of the impugned order
does not reflect a consideration of the above issues placed before the Court
by the parties. It must be added that the broad aspects of the submissions are
indeed contained in the plaint, pleadings and documents which were
available to the learned Single Judge when the impugned interim order was
passed.
</p>

<p id="p_51">38. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that the
impugned interim order requires to be set aside and the application for
interim injunction be heard once again by the learned Single Judge on
merits.
</p>

<p id="p_52">39. During the course of hearing this Court made it clear to the parties that it
was not expressing any view one way or the other even on the allegations
contained in IA 9421 of 2019, except to indicate that with this Court
proposing to restore the status quo ante the passing of the impugned order,
the said application may be considered to be rendered infructuous.
</p>

<p id="p_53">40. In that view of the matter, Mr. Sibal, on instructions stated that the
Plaintiffs will withdraw IA No.9421 of 2019 in which notice has been issued
by the learned Single Judge, reserving their right to seek appropriate

 remedies in accordance with law at a later point in time, if so warranted.
</p>

<p id="p_54">41. The impugned interim order dated 5th July 2019 is hereby set aside. The
status quo as on 5th July 2019, prior to the passing of the impugned order
will be maintained by the Defendant. IA 8873 of 2019 shall be listed on 23rd
July 2019 before the learned Single Judge. The Defendant will, on or before
19th July 2019, file its reply to the said application with an advance copy to
the Plaintiffs. It will be open to the Plaintiffs to file a rejoinder thereto, if
any, on or before 22nd July 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_55">42. The learned Single Judge, will after hearing the parties, pass a fresh
order uninfluenced by the order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (Supra) or the
order dated 5th July 2019, which has been set aside by this Court by the
present order.
</p>

<p id="p_56">43. The appeal and application are disposed of in the above terms.
