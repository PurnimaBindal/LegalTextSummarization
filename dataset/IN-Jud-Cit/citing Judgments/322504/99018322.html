Reportable   BY THE COURT: (Per Hon'ble Dinesh Maheshwari),J.</pre>


<p id="p_1">                   By way of this writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the

             constitutional validity of Sub-section (6) of Section 19 of the

             Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973

             ('the Act of 1973') wherein it is provided that the amount of

             acquisition, payable to a person for surplus land vesting in the State

             Government, shall carry simple interest at two and a half per cent per

             annum from the date of surrender of surplus land or of ejectment

             therefrom.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                   Having regard to the subject matter of this writ petition, it

             appears appropriate to put a glance, at the outset, over the relevant

             background aspects concerning the subject enactment. The Act of

             1973 was promulgated on 28.03.1973 as a consolidating and

             amending law for imposition of ceiling on agricultural holdings,

             disposal of surplus land, and the matters ancillary thereto. Its

             forerunner had been Chapter III-B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act,
                                               D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_2">1998
                                             Gopal Singh v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      -2-</span><p id="p_3">

1955 ('the Act of 1955') that was ultimately repealed. In this

enactment, provisions have been made, inter alia, for fixation of

ceiling on land holdings, computation of ceiling area, furnishing of

returns, vesting of surplus land, and the amount of acquisition.

Section 19 of the Act of 1973 deals with the aspects relating to

determination    of   amount     of    acquisition     whereby        the    State

Government has been made liable to pay the amount of acquisition

for all lands vesting in it,      to the person upon whom the final

statement was served. Every such person is entitled to submit, within

the prescribed time, a detailed statement of claim for the amount of

acquisition in the prescribed form; and upon receipt of such

statement of claim, the Authorised Officer is to determine the amount

of acquisition payable in accordance with the prescribed scales.

Leaving aside the other aspects, being not relevant for the present

purpose, the questioned provision of Sub-section (6) of Section 19,

whereby it is provided that the amount of acquisition shall                   carry

simple interest at two and a half per cent per annum from the date of

surrender of surplus land or of ejectment, could be noticed as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "(6) The amount of acquisition shall carry simple interest at two
      and a half per cent, per annum from the date of surrender of
      surplus land under sub-section (2) of section 16 or of ejectment
      therefrom under sub-section (3) of that section as the case may
      be, till the date of payment."</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      Since the core issue in this writ petition pertains to the

constitutional validity of the aforesaid provision contained in Sub-

section (6) of Section 19 of the Act of 1973, it is not necessary to

make a detailed reference to the facts of the case, which are more or

less indisputable; and only a brief reference to the relevant

background aspects leading to this petition would suffice. The

petitioner's father, late Shri Devi Singh, was holding certain parcels
                                             D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_3">1998

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -3-</span><p id="p_6">

of agricultural land in Tehsil Ahore and Tehsil Pali. The respondent

State initiated the ceiling proceedings under Chapter III-B of the Act

of 1955 against the father of the petitioner whereunder, the surplus

agricultural land available with him was ordered to be acquired by an

order dated 03.01.1976, as passed by the Sub-Divisional Officer,

Jalore ('the SDO');     and     possession of the surplus land was

surrendered on 01.02.1976, 03.02.1976 and 14.07.1976. Thereafter,

by an order passed by the SDO on 12.01.1984, the compensation for

the land so acquired was determined at Rs. 74,464.20; and it was

ordered that this amount shall be payable in ten equated installments

and interest at the rate of two and half per cent as per section 19(6)

ibid., shall be     payable from the date of last surrender i.e.,

14.07.1976.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        The petitioner and his mother (the original assessee having

expired) preferred an appeal (No. 237/1986) against the aforesaid

order dated 12.01.1984 before the Revenue Appellate Authority-II,

Jodhpur ('the RAA'). During the pendency of this appeal, the amount

assessed by the SDO (principal along with interest amounting to Rs.

84,702.45) was paid to the petitioner on 19.02.1987. Then, by an

order    dated    02.06.1987,   the     learned    RAA       enhanced         the

compensation to a sum of Rs.3,99,050/- and also awarded interest at

the prescribed rate of two and half per cent per annum. Aggrieved

by this order, the State preferred a revision petition before the Board

of Revenue for Rajasthan, Ajmer that was dismissed by an order

dated 20.10.1994.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        When the petitioner did not receive the enhanced amount as

ordered despite conclusion of the matter in the Board of Revenue, he

made an application dated 05.05.1995 to the SDO seeking payment.
</p><p id="p_9">                                             D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_4">1998

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  -4-</span><p id="p_10">

Then, by an order dated 20.03.1998, the SDO ordered for the

payment of the due amount of Rs. 4,54,997/- through the Tehsildar,

Ahore. Ultimately, the amount of compensation along with interest at

the rate of two and half per cent per annum, to the tune of Rs.

4,54,997/- was paid to the petitioner through a demand draft (D.D.

No. 00488838) on 25.03.1998. At this stage, the petitioner felt

aggrieved by the interest paid to him at the rate of two and half per

cent per annum as per the provisions of the Act of 1973 and hence,

preferred this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Questioning the provision contained in Sub-section (6) of

Section 19 ibid. it is contended on behalf of the petitioner that such a

provision, allowing interest at the rate only of two and a half per cent

per annum,      remains entirely arbitrary, illusory and unjust.             It is

submitted that such an abnormally low rate of interest at two and a

half per cent per annum directly results in denial of economic justice

which is one of the basic features of the Constitution of India as

contained in its Preamble whereby, the objectives have, inter alia,

been specified as to secure to all the citizens social, economic and

political justice. It is submitted that per <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_5">Article 300A</a> of the

Constitution of India, no person can be deprived of his property save

by authority of law; and when the State has withheld the money

payable    to   an   individual for a long period of time without any

justification, adequate and reasonable rate of interest ought to be

allowed in the range of 12% per annum to 18% per annum. It is

submitted that the petitioner cannot be deprived of his property by

such provisions as contained in Section 19(6) ibid.;                 and      not

awarding of adequate amount of interest is clearly violative of very

fundamentals of the Constitution.       It is also submitted that Section
                                            D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_6">1998
                                          Gopal Singh v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  -5-</span><p id="p_12">

19(6) of the Act abridges the right of equality of opportunity to get

interest on the money withheld by the State Government and the

rate of interest as fixed is illusory and arbitrary. Hence, the provision

is, according to the petitioner, unconstitutional and deserves to be

declared invalid; and reasonable rate of interest           deserves to be

allowed for the period the State withheld the money payable. The

learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the decisions in: <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_7">I.R.

Coelho (Dead) By LRs v. State of T.N. &amp; Ors</a>.: (1999) 7 SCC 580;

SCC 708.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent has raised

the preliminary objections that the writ petition has been filed after an

inordinate delay of 11 years; that the petitioner neither challenged

the rate of interest before the RAA in the appeal nor preferred any

revision petition before the Board of Revenue; and that he has

challenged the rate of interest for the first time in the year 1998 in

this writ petition and that too, after receiving complete payment on

25.03.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      The learned counsel for the respondent has also raised the

objection that the Act of 1973, having been placed at entry 79 in

Ninth Schedule to the Constitution of India, is immune from judicial

review, per <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_10">Article 31B</a> of the Constitution. It is also submitted that

the questioned provisions do not, in any manner, interfere with or

disturb the basic structure of the Constitution of India and hence,

cannot be said to be open to judicial review.
</p><p id="p_15">                                           D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_11">1998

         Apart from the above, the ground of unconstitutionality and

arbitrariness in the interest rate as provided in the impugned

provision has been refuted with the submissions that the questioned

interest rate has been provided in the Act of 1973, which is a special

enactment, made by the competent legislature with an objective of

socio-economic welfare and for acquisition of surplus land for its

distribution amongst the landless and other persons amongst the

rural population. It is submitted that when the Act of 1973 provides

for and deals with such social and economic welfare objectives, the

rate of interest over the amount payable against the acquisition of

land thereunder cannot be compared with the rate applicable to other

enactments or transactions; and in its context and object, the rate of

interest as provided cannot be said to be unjustified.         In support of

the arguments, the learned counsel for the respondents has referred

to and relied upon the decisions in <a href="/doc/1772440/" id="a_12">Union of India v. Chajju Ram</a>

be dismissed.

of delay, laches, and omissions on the part of the petitioner on the

Leaving such objections at that only and having regard to the

circumstances, it appears just and proper to deal with the

contentions on their merits.
</p>
<p id="p_20">         As regards the questions posed in this matter, we may

observe in the first place that the Act of 1973, as promulgated on

28.03.1973, came to be inserted as Entry 79 in the Ninth Schedule to

the Constitution of India by the Constitution (Thirty-Fourth)

Amendment Act, 1974 on 07.09.1974.                 Ninth Schedule to the

Constitution of India itself came to be introduced by the Constitution

(First Amendment) Act, 1951 with effect from 08.06.1951 together

with Articles 31A and 31B. Essentially, the said provisions had been

to assist the process of legislation to bring about agrarian reforms

and to confer upon all such measures immunity from a possible

attack on the ground of contravention of fundamental rights. <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_19">Article

31B</a> reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "31B Validation of certain Acts and Regulations.-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained
       in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_20">article 31A</a>, none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the
       Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be
       deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground
       that such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or
       takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any
       provisions of this Part, and notwithstanding any judgment,
       decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, each of
       the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any
       competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force."</blockquote><p id="p_21">


</p><p id="p_22">         The object and philosophy behind such constitutional

amendments has been indicated in several of the decisions of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court. For the present purpose, we may refer to

the following observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in I.R.

<p id="p_32">         Coming to the question as to whether the impugned

provision suffers from any such vice of destroying or damaging the

basic structure of the Constitution, the salient features of the doctrine

of basic structure may be usefully referred to, as explained by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in several of the decisions. It could be

summed up for the present purpose that the basic structure of the

Constitution involves those parts of the Constitution without which, it

may lose its fundamental character. The doctrine envisages that the

Constitution of India has certain basic features           which cannot be

altered or destroyed through amendments in laws. In the landmark

decision in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_37">Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala &amp; Anr</a>. AIR 1973

SC 1471, the following, amongst others, were pointed out as the

"basic foundation and structure" of the Constitution: 1. Supremacy of

the Constitution; 2. Separation of Powers between the legislature,

the executive and the judiciary; 3. Republican and the democratic

form of Government; 4. Secular character of the Constitution; 5.

Federal character of the Constitution; 6. The dignity of the individual

secured by the various Fundamental Rights and the mandate to build

a welfare state contained in the Directive Principles; 7. The unity and

integrity of the nation; and 8. Parliamentary system.

the balance between the Fundamental Rights and Directive

<p id="p_36">         For the questions involved in this matter, we need not

expand much on the different facets of basic structure doctrine but,

in the context of the law aforesaid, we may examine the scheme of

the Act of 1973 itself before entering into the questions relating to

one of its provisions i.e., Sub-section (6) of Section 19. The intent of

the legislature behind enacting the Act of 1973 can be gathered by a

plain reading of its preamble as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">            "An Act to provide for the imposition of ceiling on agricultural
   holdings acquisition and disposal of surplus land and matters
   ancillary thereto.
</p><p id="p_39">            Whereas, under clauses (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_42">Article 39</a> of the
   Constitution of India, the State should, in particular, direct its policy
   towards securing that the ownership and the control of the material
   resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve
   the common good and that the operation of the economic system
   does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of
   production to the common detriment;
</p><p id="p_40">            And whereas, the area of the agricultural land available for
   cultivation in the State is limited;
</p><p id="p_41">            And whereas, there is great disparity in the holding of
   agricultural land leading to the concentration of such land in the
   hands of certain persons;
</p><p id="p_42">            And whereas, it is necessary to acquire the agricultural land
   in excess of the ceiling area and to distribute such land to the
   landless and other persons among the rural population or to utilise
   it for carrying out other measures of agrarian reform;
</p><p id="p_43">            And whereas, such distribution will best subserve the
   common good, increase agricultural production and promote
   justice, social and economic;
</p><p id="p_44">            And whereas, it is expedient to provide for all these and
   other matters connected therewith;"
</p>
<p id="p_45">

     Evident it is that the Act of 1973, a special socio-economic law,

was framed with an aim of carrying out agrarian reforms and to

promote social and economic justice by removing out disparity in the

holdings of the agricultural land. For the said purpose, the legislature

made a fair balance of acquisition of surplus land and compensation

therefor. Chapter-II of the Act has vested the State with power to

acquire surplus land and to distribute it amongst the landless;

whereas Chapter-III provides for computation and payment of the

amount of acquisition and, of course, the rate of interest thereupon.
</p><p id="p_46">                                              D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_43">1998

</p>
<p id="p_48">      The questioned provision as contained in Sub-section (6) of

Section 19 of the Act of 1973 regarding the rate of interest has been

reproduced hereinbefore. The rate of interest as prescribed therein

may, at the first blush and in isolation, appear a bit restrictive and on

the lower side but then, the matter cannot be examined and viewed

with an abstract reference only to the quantum of interest rate, away

and apart from the other features of the enactment in which such

right occurs. Under the Act of 1973, the interest is paid to a land

holder whose such land is acquired which is of surplus and thereby,

against the socio-economic requirements of the society.                       Until

surrender, the person concerned had been in use of the land and

then, the land is to be given to the other landless persons so as to

proceed in the direction of equal distribution of the resources and

wealth as far as possible. The rate of interest as provided and as

sought to be questioned herein, is required to be visualized in the

context of all the surrounding factors; and the legislature would be

deemed to have taken into consideration all such relevant aspects

while deciding as to what would be the reasonable compensation

including interest for the person whose surplus land beyond the

ceiling limit is to be acquired.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      It has been noticed during the course of submissions that in

such kind of other land reforms laws like the Rajasthan Land

Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 and alike enactments

of other States, the rate of interest over the amount of compensation

has been provided only at or in the range of 2.5% per annum.

</p><p id="p_50">      Though the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the

then applicable provisions of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act,

1953, the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 and the Land

had been in the range of 4% to 6% and in various enactments, it has

been enhanced too but then, payment of interest on the amount of

compensation paid for compulsory acquisition of the property for

other nature public purposes is required to be put at a different

pedestal.       The enactments like the Act of 1973, making provisions

for resumption of excess land, for their very nature, have provided

for a comparatively lesser rate of interest on the amount payable

towards acquisition and in the background in which such amount is

paid,      the differentiation is obviously that of a valid classification

based on intelligible differentia. Thus, the assumed hardship alone

cannot be a ground to treat such so-called lower rate of interest as

violating the constitutional scheme of ensuring social, economic and

political justice to the citizens.
</p>
<p id="p_53">        In Chajju Ram (supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court upheld the

absence of provision for payment of solatium and interest for

acquisition of requisitioned property under the Defence of India Act,

1971 and said,-

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">    "30. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the classification sought

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        In an overall comprehension of the Scheme of 1973, we are

clearly of the view that the provisions as contained in Sub-section (6)

of <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_47">Section 19</a>, merely for providing a comparatively lesser rate of

interest on the amount of compensation payable, cannot be

considered violating the constitutional ideals of securing economic

</p><p id="p_55">      Viewed from any angle, we do not find any reason or basis to

agree on the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner

that such assumed lower rate of interest, by itself, damages the

basic structure of the Constitution. Contrary to the submissions as

made, in our view, the enactment rather strengthens the basic

structure of the Constitution by proposing to bring about a socio-

economic order with reasonable distribution of the land. The person

who was earlier holding excessive land is being obliged to part with

the land beyond the permissible limits and even for this deprivation,

he is paid compensation. In the context of enactment, the interest

rate over such amount of compensation, even if on the lower side,

cannot be said to be in any manner violating the requirements of

economic justice.
</p>
<p id="p_56">      The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that under

the provisions of 19(6) of the Act of 1973, the petitioner has been

denied the legitimate compensation by way of adequate interest for

withholding of the amount by the State and hence, deprived of his

right to property. On this issue, we may only say that the right of

property is not as such of the basic feature or the structure of the

Constitution. It is only a constitutional right; and remains subject to

valid laws. The argument made by the counsel for the petitioner that

he was entitled to get a higher interest rate to the extent of 12% or

18% per annum, and the State by awarding 2½%interest rate has

deprived him of economic justice and, therefore, there is violation of

his fundamental right enshrined under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_49">Article 14</a> of the Constitution,

is not a well founded one.     As noticed above, the acquisition of

surplus land under the Act of 1973 and the monetary rights arising

from such an acquisition cannot be considered as similar vis-a-vis
                                               D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4572/<a href="/doc/130689350/" id="a_50">1998

</p>
<p id="p_58">other laws prescribing higher rate of interest or of commercial

transactions. As observed, this particular provision occurs in the

enactment that deals with such rights which, by their very nature,

stand at a different footing; and wherein higher rate                 of interest

herein cannot be claimed with reference to other laws or

transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_59">      We are, therefore, of the opinion that under <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_51">Section 19</a> (6)

ibid., prescribing simple interest at the rate of two and half per cent

per annum on the amount of compensation for acquiring surplus

land under the Act of 1973 vis-a-vis higher rate of interest for

compensation under other laws or under other transactions is a

reasonable classification and a valid one. The difference of rate of

interest is founded on intelligible differentia and has a rational

relation with the object sought to be achieved by the Act of 1973.

Hence, question does not arise of violation of the right of equality.

</p><p id="p_60">      We may also point out that a Larger Bench of this Court in

Dr.Prahlad Singh's case (supra) considered the provisions of the

Act of 1973 when the reference was made upon the claimants

seeking higher rate of interest than that prescribed in <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_52">Section 19</a>

(6). The question referred to the Larger Bench was:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      In view of what has been found and discussed hereinabove,

the decisions as cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner do

not appear making out any case in his favour so far Sub-section (6)

of <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_54">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1973 is concerned. In Rajiv Sarin (supra),

the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the question arising in the

backdrop of the provisions where the forest land of the appellants

was sought to be acquired by the Government with no

compensation. The observations made in Rajiv Sarin's case about

the requirement of reasonable and just compensation and that the

compensation     cannot be illusory do      not make out a case for

declaring Sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_55">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1973 as

unconstitutional merely for providing lesser rate of interest. So far

the order passed in I.R.Coelho's case, as reported in (1999) 7 SCC

580 is concerned, that had been the order drawing reference and

we have referred hereinabove to the conclusions ultimately reached

by the Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.                           The

observations in Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar's case (supra) as regards

the challenge to the Bombay Land Revenue Code and Land Tenure

Abolition Laws (Gujarat Amendment) Act are also not of direct

bearing in the present case. Similarly, the decision in Committee

for Protection of Democratic Rights's case (supra) on the law that

fundamental rights cannot be extinguished by any constitutional or

statutory provision; and that any law which in its actual effect and

impact abridges or abrogates the fundamental rights is violative of

basic structure, are neither of any doubt nor could be. However, as

noticed hereinabove, the questioned provision does not appear in

any manner offending any fundamental right or any feature that

relates to the basic structure of the Constitution.
