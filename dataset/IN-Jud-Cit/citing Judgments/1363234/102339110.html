</p>
<p id="p_4">               The facts in brief are that on 30.9.1969, the petitioner was

appointed as Upper Division Clerk in the office of Accountant General,

Himachal Pradesh, Shimla in the General Category.           After passing the

Departmental examination, he was promoted as Section Officer. On

7.5.1983 he was appointed to the post of Accounts Officer in the Central

Tool Room, Ludhiana, which is a Government of India Society, .

</p><p id="p_5">              On 13.8.1990, the Government of India issued Instructions for

providing 27% reservation for socially and economically backward classes

in civil posts and services under the Government of India. On 8.9.1993, the

Government of India issued a notification categorising the creamy layer

amongst the OBCs to whom the benefit of reservation of Backward Class

would not be applicable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              As the petitioner belongs to Chhimba community, which was

notified as a Backward Class by the State of Punjab he applied for and was

issued OBC certificate by Tehsildar (West) Ludhiana on 24.10.1997.          In

January, 1998, the Central Tool Room Ludhiana (respondent No.3)

advertised one post of Administrative Manager in the pay scale of

Rs.10000-325-15200 which was reserved for the OBC category.                The

petitioner applied for the same on the basis of OBC certificate issued to

him. He appeared for the interview on 9.6.1998. The Central Tool Room

Employees Union, Ludhiana submitted a representation to the Sub-

Divisional Magistrate, Ludhiana and the Chairman, Central Tool Room for

cancelling OBC certificate of the petitioner stating that his salary earned on

his existing job was more than Rs.1,00,000/- per annum and he fell within

the creamy layer. The petitioner was selected for the post of Administrative

Manager, subject to the condition that his certificate be got verified before

issue of appointment letter. Thereafter, the petitioner appeared before the

Tehsildar and also represented to the Deputy Commissioner to verify his

OBC certificate but no action was taken by them.            The petitioner was

issued appointment letter for the post of Administrative Manager, subject to

verification of the OBC certificate. He joined on the said post on 6.7.1999

after resigning from the post of Assistant Manager (Accounts).

</p><p id="p_7">            The Central Tool Room Employees Union, Ludhiana filed

CWP No.16754 of 1999 titled "<a href="/doc/9817665/" id="a_1">CTR Ministerial Staff Welfare Association

vs. Union of India</a>, etc." in the nature of a PIL praying for quashing the

OBC certificate issued to the petitioner and for declaring his appointment

as Administrative Manager as illegal.           In the said writ petition, an

additional affidavit dated 14.9.2001 was filed by the Deputy Commissioner,

Ludhiana stating that the OBC certificate had been issued to the petitioner

without getting the facts verified and that it had not been countersigned by

the District Magistrate. The writ petition was disposed of on 14.2.2002

with a direction to the Central Tool Room            to pass appropriate order

keeping in view the fact that the OBC certificate produced by the petitioner

was not genuine.    In compliance therewith, the services of the petitioner

were terminated on 2.3.2002.             Later on   an application filed by the

petitioner the order dated 14.2.2002 was recalled. The petition was heard

again and finally disposed of on 12.11.2002 with a direction to Deputy

Commissioner, Ludhiana to enquire into the genuineness of the OBC

certificate issued to the petitioner.       It was further directed that if the

certificate is not genuine, it would be cancelled. If the certificate is found

to be genuine, then the concerned Authority of the Central Tool Room shall

pass appropriate order for restoring the appointment of the petitioner on the

post of Administrative Manager with retrospective date and all

consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            The Deputy Commissioner initially vide his order dated

13.3.2003 concluded that the OBC certificate issued to the petitioner was

rightly cancelled. The petitioner filed CWP No.7423 of 2003 assailing the

said determination and also the order dated 02.03.2002 vide which his

services were terminated.      Meanwhile, the Government of India issued

circular dated 14.10.2004 clarifying that creamy layer status of a candidate

is to be determined on the basis of the status of his parents and not on the

basis of his own status or income or on the basis of status or income of

his/her spouse.    Relying on the aforesaid clarification the petitioner

submitted a representation to the Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana to

determine his status in the light of the clarification. The Tehsildar,

Ludhiana vide his order dated 29.7.2005 clarified that the OBC certificate

issued to the petitioner was valid. The Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana

vide his order dated 19.4.2006 also affirmed that the OBC certificate issued

to the petitioner was valid and genuine. Thereafter, the petitioner submitted

representations to respondent No.3 for restoration of his appointment as

per the directions of the High Court dated 12.11.2002 in CWP No.16754 of

1999. Respondent No.3 decided the said representation on 5.9.2006 after

much delay and after directions issued by the Court in a Contempt Petition.

It was held that the reinstatement in service of the petitioner could not be

       C.W.P. No.16764 of 2009 and connected matter                     [5]


considered as CWP No.7423 of 2003 filed by the petitioner was pending.

The petitioner thereafter amended the writ petition to incorporate a

challenge to the said order of respondent No. 3 denying his claim for

reinstatement.      Meanwhile, the Central Tool Room was notified under

<a href="/doc/1934424/" id="a_2">Section 14(3)</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 as an Authority to

which the said Act would apply w.e.f. 01.11.2007.           Hence, the case was

transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench.

Respondent No.3 filed CWP No.5503 of 2007 with a prayer to quash the

orders dated 29.7.2005 and 19.4.2006 of the Tehsildar, Ludhiana and

Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana certifying the genuineness of the OBC

certificate of the petitioner. This was also transferred to the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_9">              The question before the Tribunal thus was regarding the

validity of the OBC certificate issued to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_10">              The primary ground for challenge to the validity of the

certificate   by respondent No.3 was that at the time of issue of OBC

certificate to him, the petitioner was earning salary of Rs.20,000/- per

month i.e., more than One lakh per annum and hence formed a part of the

creamy layer and was not entitled to the benefit of reservation.             The

learned Tribunal relying on a decision of this Court in CWP No.8551 of

2008 titled <a href="/doc/85394408/" id="a_3">Dr.Kamal Kishore and others vs. State of Punjab and others</a>

decided on 12.11.2008 held that as the petitioner at the time when he

applied for the post of Administrative Manager was earning a handsome

salary, he had to be excluded from the category of OBC. It was held that

the creamy layer status is to be determined not only by the income of the

parents, but also the income of the candidate himself.         Accordingly, the

      C.W.P. No.16764 of 2009 and connected matter                    [6]


Tribunal held that the OBC certificate issued to the petitioner by the

Tehsildar and the Deputy Commissioner was illegal and invalid. In terms

of the order of the Hon'ble High Court in CWP No.16754 of 1999, the

certificate was directed to be cancelled and prayer for reinstatement of the

petitioner was declined.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Assailing the aforesaid order, learned counsel for the petitioner

has relied on a decision of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/22081445/" id="a_4">Surinder Singh

vs. Punjab State Electricity Board, Patiala</a>, 2014(15) SCC 767              to

contend that the creamy layer status of a candidate is to be determined on

the basis of status or income of the parents and not on the basis of his own

status or income or that of his spouse and the Tribunal has erred in holding

otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             We have heard Ld. Counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             In Surinder Singh v. Punjab SEB, (2014) 15 SCC 767 the

Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to the relevant Government instructions

and earlier decisions in detail and concluded that there is no manner of

doubt that it is only the parents' income, which has to be taken into

consideration in computing the total income for determining whether an

individual falls within the creamy layer. The Hon'ble Court also held that

it was not open to the High Court, to include the individual's income in

determining his eligibility for being declared as backward class, by reading

down the policy instructions on the subject.

</p><p id="p_14">             The relevant observations are:
</p>
<p id="p_15">             "6. In the present appeal, the appellant seeks to assail the
             aforesaid determination rendered by the High Court. It was the
             vehement contention of the learned counsel for the appellant,
             that the judgment referred to by the High Court, for arriving at

     the conclusion, that the personal income of the individual
     concerned had to be taken into consideration, was a
     misreading of the judgment rendered by this Court. It is in the
     aforesaid background, that we shall endeavour to examine the
     policy instructions regulating the determination of the
     backwardness of candidates, and the judgments relied upon by
     the High Court.
</p><p id="p_16">     7. First and foremost, reference needs to be made to the Office
     Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 issued by the Government of
     India, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension
     (Department of Personnel and Training). It is not a matter of
     dispute between the rival parties, that the aforesaid office
     memorandum is applicable to the present controversy. Under
     the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993, the claim of the
     appellant for grant of a backward class certificate was
     determinable under Category IV thereof, since it is not a
     matter of dispute that the appellant is a qualified Chartered
     Accountant. However, in Column 3 to the Schedule relating to
     Category IV, it is mentioned that the criteria specified against
     Category VI would be applicable to those who fall under
     Category IV. In the above view of the matter, our interpretation
     on the eligibility of the appellant for being declared as
     belonging to the backward class, would be determinable on the
     basis of the description relatable to Category VI. Category VI
     and the depiction to whom the same would be applicable, are

</pre><p id="p_25">      7.1 Having minutely examined Category VI, as also the
      description contained in the Schedule, to whom the same
      would apply, there is really no room for any doubt, that in
      clauses (a) and (b) thereof, it is the income/wealth of the
      parents of the individual concerned, which is of relevance. The
      description is clearly silent about the individual's own income.
      It is not possible for us to accept, that the individual's own
      income could have been taken into consideration. The above
      determination of ours, is with reference to Categories IV and
      VI. Therefore, even with reference to Category IV, which
      includes professionals, the income of the professional, has not
      been included. Thus viewed, we are satisfied, that on the plain
      reading of Category VI of the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-
      1993, that it was not the income of the individual concerned,
      but that of his parents, that would determine whether he would
      fall within the creamy layer or not.
</p><p id="p_26">      8. The question which still arises is, whether it was open to the
      High Court, to include the individual's income in determining
      his eligibility for being declared as backward class, by reading
      down the policy instructions on the subject? Insofar as the
      instant aspect of the matter is concerned, there can be no
      doubt that the issue is determinable with reference to the
      decision rendered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_6">Indra Sawhney v. Union of
      India [Indra Sawhney</a> v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC

            "10. We have carefully examined the criteria for
            identifying the 'creamy layer' laid down by the

            Government of India in Para 2(c) read with the
            Schedule of the Office Memorandum quoted above. The

            It is apparent from the observations recorded by this
            Court, as have been extracted hereinabove, that the
            Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 had been examined
            by this Court, specifically with reference to the decision
            rendered         in Indra      Sawhney         case [<a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_10">Indra

            1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] . Having
            done so, this Court expressly approved and confirmed
            the Schedule to the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993.
</p><p id="p_28">      9. Based on the aforesaid declaration of law, we are of the
      view that it was not open to the High Court to evaluate the
      Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 from any other
      parameters. It also needs to be noticed, that the issue which
      came up for determination in Ashoka Kumar Thakur
      case[<a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_11">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar</a>, (1995) 5 SCC

      9.1 Here again, this Court expressly approved the Office
      Memorandum dated 8-9-1993. In view of the decisions
      rendered by this Court in both Ashoka Kumar Thakur
      cases[<a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_16">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar</a>, (1995) 5 SCC

      Kumar Thakur v. Union of India</a>, (2008) 6 SCC 1 : 3 SCEC 35]
      , we are of the view that the High Court clearly erred in
      reading down the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 and to
      include therein the income of the individual concern while
      determining whether or not he fell within the "creamy layer".
</p><p id="p_34">      10. Despite the declaration of law in the judgments, referred to
      hereinabove, it is also necessary to take into consideration the
      clarification issued by the Government of India, Ministry of
      Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (Department of
      Personnel and Training) dated 21-11-2002. The aforesaid
      clarification was with reference to the Office Memorandum
      dated 8-9-1993. Relevant extract of the clarificatory letter
      dated 21-11-2002 is being reproduced below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "I am directed to refer to your Letter No. 2/25/2001 RC-
            1/670 dated 17-10-2002 on the abovenoted subject and
            say that determination of creamy layer for an OBC
            candidate is done with reference to the income of
            parents as per instructions contained in DoPT's OM No.
            36012/22/93-Estt(res) dated 8-9-1993."

      10.1 Based on the aforesaid conclusion, there is really no
      room for any doubt, that the exposition with reference to
      Category VI in the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993
      related only to the income of the parents of the individual
      concerned. And that, the income of the individual concerned
      was not to be taken into consideration.
</blockquote><p id="p_35">      11. The above issue came to be examined yet again by the
      Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public
      Grievances and Pensions (Department of Personnel and
      Training) through its memorandum dated 14-10-2004. In the
      above memorandum, a large number of queries were clarified.
      Queries at Serial Nos. (vi) and (vii) of Para 4 are relevant to

</blockquote><p id="p_36">             11.1 The aforesaid queries came to be answered in Para 8 by
             observing as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                   "8. In regard to clauses (vi), (vii) and (viii) of Para 4, it
                   is clarified that the creamy layer status of a candidate is
                   determined on the basis of the status of his parents and
                   not on the basis of his own status or income or on the
                   basis of status or income of his/her spouse. Therefore,
                   while determining the creamy layer status of a person
                   the status or the income of the candidate himself or of
                   his/her spouse shall not be taken into account.</blockquote><p id="p_37">

             11.2 In view of the above, there is no room for any further
             consideration, whether or not the individual's income is to be
             taken into consideration, while computing the total income
             relevant to determine whether an individual belongs to the
             "creamy layer". The above clarification reveals, that it is only
             the parents' income, which has to be taken into consideration."
             In view thereof the order of the Tribunal cannot sustain and is

hence set aside. The OBC certificate issued to the petitioner is held to be

valid and the petitioner is held entitled to reinstatement.

</p><p id="p_39">             It has come on record that even before the filing of this writ

petition the petitioner would have superannuated on 31.12.2008. Hence he

has   prayed for directions to respondent No.3 to pass an order of deemed

reinstatement on the post of Administrative Manager with all consequential

benefits.

            During the course of hearing, it was pointed out that after his

termination, the petitioner had joined at Eveline International, Dhandari

Kalan, Ludhiana.      Accordingly, he was directed to file an affidavit as

regards the appointment during the period from 2.3.2002 to 31.12.2008

giving details of the salary and other benefits he received from his

employer.    Pursuant thereto, an affidavit dated 21.9.2015 was filed as per

which the total salary plus other benefits during the period 2.3.2002 to

31.12.2008 (minus short periods during which he was not employed) was

Rs.14,17,462/-, which after deductions on account of P.F, TDS and Gratuity

was Rs.14,04,349/-.
</p>
<p id="p_42">            Respondent No.3 also filed affidavit dated 10.9.2015 giving

details of the salary and other perks including increments, which the

petitioner would have received had he continued in service from 3.3.2002

to 31.12.2008 and the consequential benefits, which would have been

payable to him.       The total of pay and allowances was calculated at

Rs.24,28,381/-.
</p>
<p id="p_43">            In the order dated October 9, 2015 this Court recorded its

prima facie view that the petitioner was entitled to reinstatement.       It

noticed the contention of the petitioner that had he continued in service of

respondent No.3 he would have earned Rs.24,00,000/- which would amount

to Rs.28,00,000/- if the benefit of the 6th Pay Commission recommendations

been extended to the employees of Respondent No.3. As against this he

had earned only Rs.14,00,000/- through his private employment. The matter

was referred to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court to

resolve the dispute with regard to back wages to be payable.

              In the order dated 26.02.2016 while recording that the

mediation has failed it was noticed that the petitioner stuck to his demand

of difference in pay of about Rs.14 lacs whereas the respondent No.3 was

willing to pay Rs.4 lakhs only. There has thus been no agreement on the

amount to be paid to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_45">              In our view, in the facts and circumstances of this case, it

would be fair and just, if the respondents are directed to pay a sum of Rs.8

lakhs to the petitioner as a final settlement of all claims. It is so ordered.

</p><p id="p_46">              The amount be released to the petitioner within four weeks

from today.
