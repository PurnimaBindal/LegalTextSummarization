</p> 
<p id="p_17">17.	Heard Sri Dileep Kumar, learned counsel for the appellant and Awadhesh Kumar Saxena, learned AGA for the State. 
</p> 
<p id="p_18">18.	It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the marriage between the accused appellant Greesh Chandra and deceased was performed on 24.6.1988 and from their wedlock two children were born, namely daughter Rubi and son Atul. He submitted that the daughter of the appellant Greesh was born on 1.1.1990. Hence, the case of the prosecution, the marriage of the deceased with appellant Greesh was solemnized about six years ago is absolutely false and just in order to bring the case within the purview of dowry death the said version has been set up by the prosecution. He argued that none of the witnesses neither P.W. 1, who is uncle of the deceased nor P.W. 2 father of the deceased have disclosed the date of marriage and they have only stated that the marriage was performed about 5 to 6 years prior to the incident. He argued that as the elder daughter of the appellant Greesh and deceased was born on 1.1.1990, therefore, the marriage is presumed to have taken place beyond seven years. Thus, the case does not come within the purview of dowry death as the basic ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_18">Section 304-B</a> I.P.C. are not fulfilled. In order to bring a case under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_19">Section 304-B</a> I.P.C. the death of a woman must have taken place within seven years of the marriage. He urged that in defence D.W. 3 Bhupendra, who is Principal of Saraswati Gyan Mandir at Jalalabad has been produced who has stated before the trial court that the certificate which was issued from the college i.e. Ex. Kha-3 paper no. 16-B/8 by Vijendra Singh, an employee of said institution and working under him. The date of birth has been mentioned as 1.1.1990 and further Rubi daughter of accused appellant Greesh Chandra was a regular student of said institution from the year, 1995 to 1999 and her date of birth was filled by her parents and there is no reason to doubt about the testimony of the said witness. He submitted that the deceased after giving birth to three children out of which two were alive, namely Rubi and Atul as she was weak and had fallen ill and she died on account of illness for which she was also taken to a doctor at Jalalabad, who has issued some medical slips regarding her treatment which is also on record has been proved by his son D.W. 2 Sriniwas as the said doctor had died. He contended that the said doctor was no doubt an Aurvedic doctor but in the village he was only available to treat and attend the villagers from any illness. He further argued that P.W. 1 is uncle of deceased was an Army man and when he came to the village after receiving the information about the death of the deceased then he lodged the present F.I.R. after due consultation and deliberation with the lawyer as has come in his evidence with an ulterior motive to extract money from the appellants, who are husband and father-in-law of the deceased and also falsely implicated the accused appellant Memo Devi (since deceased) with whom he had enmity. The deceased died a natural death and her information about her death was also sent by in laws of the deceased through Bankey Mehtar and other persons of the village. The father of the deceased arrived and the last rites were also performed in the presence of the father of the deceased and other family members. He submitted that P.W. 2 father of the deceased also did not lodge the F.I.R. about the incident though he has received information on 13.11.1997 and he only on written report of his brother P.W. 1 Satish Chandra, who lodged the F.I.R. on 19.11.1997 in consultation with an Advocate at Fatehgarh which shows that the said F.I.R. is after thought. Moreover, there appears to be no explanation for delay in lodging the F.I.R. of the incident.  The case of the prosecution the deceased was done to death is absolutely a false case and has no legs to stand. He further argued that the deceased was living at her parents house for the last two years and she had come 3 to 4 months prior to the incident and there is no evidence to show that the deceased was subjected to death and cruelty and harassment by the appellant for demand of dowry. Hence, the finding recorded by the trial court and presumption drawn under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_20">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act is absolutely incorrect, therefore, the appellants conviction under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_21">Sections 498-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_22">304-B</a> by the trial court is liable to be set aside by this Court.
</p> 
<p id="p_19">19.	Learned counsel for the appellants also pointed out that the accused Jagat Pal, whose is about 80 years of age whereas accused appellant Greesh Chandra, who is husband of the deceased has already served out more than 5 years in jail out of maximum sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment awarded to him under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_23">Section 304-B</a> I.P.C.
</p> 
<p id="p_20">20.	Learned AGA on the other hand has argued that the deceased died in an unnatural circumstances in her matrimonial home within seven years of marriage. Hence, the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court is absolutely correct and the appeal be dismissed as it is devoid of merits. 
</p> 
<p id="p_21">21.	Considering the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 
</p> 
<p id="p_22">22.	It appears from the record that the deceased no doubt died in her matrimonial home but whether the death of the deceased was a natural or she died unnatural death in her matrimonial home is to be adjudged from the evidence which has been produced by the prosecution. In this regard the evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 is to be considered in order to bring out a case of dowry death against the accused appellants. From perusal of the evidence of P.W. 1, who is uncle of the deceased and was employed an Army man appears to be not present at the time of incident and he had come on leave after receiving the information about the death of the deceased. His evidence shows that he has only stated that the marriage of deceased with Greesh Chandra was performed six years ago prior to the incident. He was not aware of the date of marriage. Moreover, he has stated in F.I.R. that he came to know from the villagers that deceased was strangulated to death and her dead body was disposed of. His evidence further shows that he along with his brother P.W. 2 Omkar and other persons of the village on receiving the information from his brother-in-law Jimi Pal had reached in the house of in-laws of the deceased on 13.11.1997 at 7 to 8 p.m. Whereas P.W. 2, who is father of the deceased has stated that they came to know about the incident after receiving the information about the death of the deceased on 13.11.1997 and they reached the village of the deceased and no person went to the in-laws of the deceased. On the next date even he has denied going with P.W. 1 to the village of the deceased on the next date. P.W. 1 further stated that he had contacted a private counsel for doing pairvi in the present case and he after due consultation has moved an application to S.S.P. Fatehgarh on 15.11.1997 for lodging the F.I.R.  as his F.I.R. was not lodged.  P.W. 2 Omkar, father of the deceased has also deposed before the trial court that the marriage of his daughter with accused appellant Greesh Chandra was performed five years ago prior to the incident and from wedlock of accused appellant Greesh Chandra and deceased, two children were born and the daughter Rubi was eldest. He has stated before the trial court that the marriage was performed in the month of June but he did not remember the date of marriage nor the year of the marriage. He further denied the date of birth of Rubi also to be 1.1.1990. He further deposed that he along with P.W. 1 had gone to the concerned police station to give information about the death of the deceased and both the witnesses P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 have denied the suggestion of the defence that the marriage has taken place beyond seven years i.e. 24.6.1988. Further they have also denied the suggestion about the death of birth of the daughter Rubi i.e. on 1.1.1990. They have further tried to give some explanation regarding the delay in lodging the F.I.R. and further they have denied the suggestion that the deceased died on account of illness as has been suggested by defence. It was denied by them that they participated in the last rites of the deceased and they made illegal demand from the husband and father-in-law of the deceased then they refused they lodged F.I.R. with due consultation and deliberation under a legal mind from Asharfi Lal, Advocate. From the evidence of the said two witnesses, their conduct shows that they have not come up with a true case and they have conceal the actual incident and it is highly improbable that both the witnesses does not remember the date of marriage neither year of marriage of the deceased with accused appellant Greesh Chandra. Further they have also denied the date of birth of Rubi which goes to show that the marriage was performed beyond seven years prior to the incident as the same was also proved by P.W. 3 D.R. Arya and from school record. Moreover, the case which was set up by the prosecution that the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment for want of dowry by her husband and father-in-law, does not inspire confidence.
</p> 
<p id="p_23">23.	The finding which has been recorded by the trial court for conviction of the appellants under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_24">Sections 498-A</a>, <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_25">304-B</a> I.P.C. drawing presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_26">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act does not appear to be correct as the basic ingredients of 304-B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">I.P.C</a>. are also not fulfilled in the instant case. Particularly, it has not been established by the prosecution that the marriage between the deceased Omwati and accused appellant Greesh Chandra was performed within seven years and further she was soon before her death was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and any other relative in connection with any demand of dowry, so as to bring the present case to be a case of dowry death. 
</p> 
<p id="p_24">24.	The Apex Court in the case of Rajinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in (2015) 6 SCC 477 has dealt with the meaning of "Dowry Death" in para nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 which are quoted herein below :
</p> 
<p id="p_25">"7. The primary ingredient to attract the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28">Section 304B</a> is that the death of a woman must be a "dowry death". "Dowry" is defined by <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_29">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, which reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_28">(b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before [or any time after the marriage] [in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include] dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies. 
</p> 
<p id="p_29">Explanation I.- [***] Explanation II.-The expression "valuable security" has the same meaning as in <a href="/doc/1320984/" id="a_30">Section 30</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)." 
</p> 
<p id="p_30">8. A perusal of this Section shows that this definition can be broken into six distinct parts. 
</p> 
<p id="p_31">1) Dowry must first consist of any property or valuable security 
 
</p><p id="p_32">- the word "any" is a word of width and would, therefore, include within it property and valuable security of any kind whatsoever. 
</p> 
<p id="p_33">2) Such property or security can be given or even agreed to be given. The actual giving of such property or security is, therefore, not necessary. 
</p> 
<p id="p_34">3) Such property or security can be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly. 
</p> 
<p id="p_35">4) Such giving or agreeing to give can again be not only by one party to a marriage to the other but also by the parents of either party or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person. It will be noticed that this clause again widens the reach of the Act insofar as those guilty of committing the offence of giving or receiving dowry is concerned. 
</p> 
<p id="p_36">5) Such giving or agreeing to give can be at any time. It can be at, before, or at any time after the marriage. Thus, it can be many years after a marriage is solemnised. 
</p> 
<p id="p_37">6) Such giving or receiving must be in connection with the marriage of the parties. Obviously, the expression "in connection with" would in the context of the social evil sought to be tackled by the <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_31">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> mean "in relation with" or "relating to". 
</p> 
<p id="p_38">9. The ingredients of the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_32">Section 304B</a> have been stated and restated in many judgments. There are four such ingredients and they are said to be: 
</p> 
<p id="p_39">(a) death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; 
</p> 
<p id="p_40">(b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage; 
</p> 
<p id="p_41">(c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and 
 
</p><p id="p_42">(d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand for dowry. 
</p> 
<p id="p_43">10. This has been the law stated in the following judgments: 
</p> 
<p id="p_44"><a href="/doc/634160/" id="a_33">Ashok Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>, (2010) 12 SCC 350 at pages 360-361; <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_34">Bachni Devi &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a>, (2011) 4 SCC 427 at 431, <a href="/doc/79816183/" id="a_35">Pathan Hussain Basha v. State of A.P</a>., (2012) 8 SCC 594 at 599, <a href="/doc/640713/" id="a_36">Kulwant Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, (2013) 4 SCC 177 at 184-<a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_37">185, Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, (2014) 4 SCC 129 at 137, <a href="/doc/52659938/" id="a_38">Raminder Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (2014) 12 SCC 582 at 583, <a href="/doc/752705/" id="a_39">Suresh Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, (2013) 16 SCC 353 at 361, <a href="/doc/36736141/" id="a_40">Sher Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, 2015 1 SCALE 250 at 262." 
</p> 
<p id="p_45">	Thus,  if the basic ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_41">Section 304-B</a> I.P.C. are not fulfilled then the conviction of the accused is not sustainable.
</p> 
<p id="p_46">25.	The evidence of D.W. 3, Bhupendra who is Principal of Saraswati Gyan Mandir, goes to shows that the date of birth of Rubi was endorsed in the school record on 1.1.1990 by her parents which shows that marriage between the appellant Greesh Chandra and deceased Omwati was performed beyond seven years of the incident and there is no material to discard the testimony of D.W. 3. Moreover, the case set up by the defence that the deceased after giving birth three children out of which one died and two survive. She was of weak physique and on account of illness she died for which she also taken for medical treatment by Dr. Yashwant Lal Sharma, who was an Ayurvedic doctor in the village. The deceased was taken by her husband for treatment which is corroborated by the evidence of D.W. 4 Chavi Ram, who was the neighbour has also stated that he was attending the wife of the appellant Greesh Chandra when she was suffering from dehydration and vomiting and she was died on account of the same and was taken to Jalalabad for medical treatment. Moreover, D.W. 2 Sri Sriniwas, who happens to be the son of the Dr. Yashwant Lal Sharma, who was no more has proved his father's medical slip which was filed by the defence shows that the deceased died a natural death and the P.W. 1 lodged a false F.I.R. against the appellants along with accused Memo Devo (since deceased) with whom he had some earlier litigation and enmity taking advantage of the present incident. P.W. 2 also colluded with his brother P.W. 1 which shows that the prosecution has not set up a true case against the appellants and their false implication in the present case cannot be ruled out.
</p> 
<p id="p_47">26.	Thus, from the above foregoing discussion, it is clear that the present case does not fall within the category a case of "dowry death" as the basic ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_42">Section 304-B</a> I.P.C. are missing and the testimony of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 is not at all worthy to be believed, hence, the conviction and sentence of the appellants on the basis of evidence recorded and the law enunciated by the Apex Court in the catena of decisions referred above is not sustainable in the eyes of law, therefore, the impugned judgement and order passed by the trial court the convicting and sentencing of the appellants, Greesh Chandra and Jagat pal Singh for offences in question is hereby set aside and the appellants are acquitted. 
</p> 
<p id="p_48">27.	The accused appellant Jagat Pal Singh, is on bail and he need not surrender. The bail bond and sureties are discharged. The accused appellant Greesh Chandra is stated to be in jail. He shall be released from jail forthwith, if not wanted in any other case.
</p> 
<p id="p_49">28.	The accused appellant Memo Devi has died as is evident from the report of C.J.M., Farrukhad dated 8.10.2015. Hence, the appeal of accused appellant Memo Devi wife of late Veer Pal stands abated.
</p> 
<p id="p_50">29.	The Criminal Appeal No. 7316 of 2010 (Gresh Chandra and State of U.P.) is allowed and Criminal Appeal No. 6549 of 2010 (Jagatpal Singh and another Vs. State of U.P.) is partly allowed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_51">Order Date :- 06.01.2016
