</p>
<p id="p_3">     2.     The Government of Kerala by GO(P)No.18/2018/SJD

dated 18/11/2018 issued instructions to all appointing authorities

of aided institutions to ensure 3% and 4% reservation with

reference to the total number of vacancies in the cadre strength

by making appointments in aided schools and aided colleges

including professional colleges to the posts which are identified

as suitable for persons with disabilities. By virtue of the aforesaid

order, backlog vacancies were directed to be filled up from

7/2/1996 to 18/4/2017          as per the provisions of Persons with

Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full

Participation) Act, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the 1995 Act)

and 4% of the vacancies in such institutions w.e.f. 19/4/2017 as

per the provisions of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

(hereinafter referred to as the 2016 Act). The Consortium of

Catholic   School   Managements             in   Kerala    filed   WP(C)   No.

1806/2019 and the NSS Colleges Central Committee filed WP(C)

No. 2800/2019        challenging the Government Order dated

18/11/2018 (hereinafter referred to as Ext.P8), (as referred in

WP(C) No. 1806/2019).
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3.    Two other writ petitions were filed. A differently abled

person has filed WP(C) No. 4753/2020 seeking for a direction to

the NSS Colleges Central Committee to implement Ext.P8

Government Order. WP(C) No. 224/2019 has been filed by yet

another differently abled person seeking for a direction to

implement Ext.P8 Government Order in the institutions run by

Guruvayoor Devaswom and NSS College.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4.    The    learned      Single   Judge      after    considering    the

respective contentions dismissed WP(C) Nos. 1806/2019 and

2800/2019. WP(C) Nos. 224/2019 and 4753/2020 were disposed

of directing the respective managements to conduct the selection

1242/2020, Sri.R.T.Pradeep, learned counsel appearing on behalf

appearing on behalf of the 2nd respondent in WA No.1242/2020.

</p><p id="p_7">     6.      The    main    contention        urged   on   behalf    of   the

Consortium of Catholic School Managements in Kerala is that

Ext.P8 order cannot be enforced since no posts had been

identified to be filled up in terms of Sections 32 and 33 of the

1995 Act and Sections 33 and 34 of the 2016 Act. It is pointed

out that in Ext.P8 order, the Government while directing backlog

vacancies from 7/2/1996 to be filled up, the posts which are

identified    are   in     terms     of      Government    Orders     GO(P)

14/9/2017. These Government Orders have been produced           as

Exts.P3 to P7 in WP(C) No. 1806/2019. The contention urged by

the learned counsel is that the posts which had been notified are

relating to Government departments, Government schools and

colleges and do not have any relation to the creation of posts

with reference to aided schools and colleges.       It is therefore

argued that unless the posts in such aided schools and colleges

are notified in terms of the statutory provision, incorporating

Exts.P3 to P7 Government Orders will not suffice. It is also argued

based on Section 102 of the 2016 Act that when the 1995 Act has

been repealed, sub-section (2) will not save the Government

Orders Exts.P3 to P7.

<p id="p_8">     7.     Sri.R.T.Pradeep, learned counsel appearing for the

appellants especially the NSS Colleges Central Committee argued

that Private Aided Educational Institutions will not come under

the purview of S.34 of the 2016 Act. It is also contended that

S.2(k) of the 1995 Act and 2016 Act cannot be extended by the

Government by an executive order especially when 1995 Act had

been repealed.     It is the further argument that non minority

educational agencies are protected under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1">Art.19(g)</a> of the

constitution of India. As per the law laid down in <a href="/doc/512761/" id="a_2">T.M.A. Pai

Foundation v. State of Karnataka</a> (AIR 2003 SC 351), such

institutions can be regulated by the Government only with

reference to the terms and conditions of employment of the

teaching   staff   and   non   teaching      staff   and    therefore   the

Government is precluded from bringing reservation to the

appointment of teaching and non teaching staff. It is argued that

though Clause 5 was inserted in <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_3">Art.15</a> of the Constitution of India

to implement reservation in private educational institutions,

Clauses 4 and 5 in <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_4">Art.15</a> operates in different fields. Clause 4

permits reservation in the matter of admission in private

educational institutions other than aided or unaided. It is argued

that <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_5">Art.15(4)</a> is in pari materia with <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_6">Art.16(4)</a> and unless there is

appearing in WA No. 131/2021. On the other hand, Sri.Abraham

appropriate directions to the respective State Governments to

ensure compliance of the provisions of the 2016 Act within a

specified time. It is submitted that when the Apex Court had

come to notice that most of the State Governments have not

identified the posts or made arrangements to provide reservation

to disabled persons, the Apex Court had while deprecating such

necessary directions. Therefore, the contention is that none of the

judgment of the Apex Court in Government of India through

<a href="/doc/1454707/" id="a_10">Secretary and Another v.Ravi Prakash Gupta</a> [(2010) 7 SCC

ensure filling up of backlog vacancies which had accumulated

due to delay in identification of posts under S.32 of the 1995 Act.

Counsel argued that the Apex Court is keen to ensure that the

aforesaid Act is implemented in letter and spirit and therefore

several such directions had been issued. It is pointed out that

even if the posts which had been stated by the State Government

initially was made applicable only to Government institutions,

that did not preclude the aided institutions in applying the very

same principle. Once the provisions of the Statute had come into

force, every institution which comes within the parameters of

Government establishment under the Act is bound to comply with

the same. Ext.P8 order came to be passed only when it was

noticed that the aided institutions were not complying with the

statutory provisions. Learned counsel therefore supports the view

taken by the learned Single Judge. Learned Government Pleader

several directions in the aforesaid matter. He made reference to

two judgments of the Apex Court in Dalco Engineering Private

<p id="p_11">     10.    The primary argument which requires to be considered

is whether the provisions of the 1995 Act and 2016 Act will apply

to aided colleges. Under Section 32 of the 1995 Act, it is

incumbent on the part of the appropriate Government to identify

posts in the establishments, which can be reserved for persons

with disability. Definition of S.2(k) &quot;establishment&quot; includes, an

authority or a body owned or controlled or aided by the

Government. Now coming to S.33 of the 2016 Act, here again the

appropriate    Government        has       to   identify   posts   in   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     -:19:-</span>

establishments which can be held by respective category of

persons with benchmark disabilities in respect of the vacancies

reserved in accordance with the provisions of S.34. As per S.34,

the appropriate Government shall appoint in every Government

establishment, not less than 4% of the total number of vacancies

in the cadre strength. &#x27;Establishment&#x27; is defined u/s 2(i) of the

2016 Act, as including Government establishment and private

establishment. &#x27;Government establishment&#x27; is defined u/s 2(k)

which includes an authority or a body owned or controlled or

aided by the Government. Apparently the appellant institutions

are aided by the Government insofar as the salary of the teachers

and other payments are made by the Government under a direct

payment system and therefore they come within the definition of

&#x27;establishment&#x27;    under       the     1995    Act   and   &#x27;Government

establishment&#x27; under the 2016 Act. Once the Act applies, they

are bound to comply with the relevant provisions.

       greater opportunities to PWD. Therefore, as detailed in the
       first part of our analysis, the identification exercise under
       Section 32 is crucial. Once a post is identified, it means that a

       with the identified post. Once found to be so capable,

       three per cent must follow. Once the post is identified, it must

An analysis of the aforesaid judgment indicates that the very

purpose    of   the   enactment       is     authorizing    the   appropriate

Government to identify the post suitable to be filled up by

differently abled persons which apparently is the policy of the

State. It is the State policy that is reflected under the 1995 Act

and the 2016 Act. Once the posts are identified, there is

obligation cast on all the employers coming within the scheme of

the Act to comply with the same. Though the learned counsel

Sri.R.T.Pradeep had placed reliance on several judgments of the

Apex Court, we do not think it necessary to place much emphasis

on the earlier judgments especially in the light of the law laid

down in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) when it is clearly held

that the basis for providing reservation for differently abled is

colleges of various Universities in the identified posts is violative

of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 15 r/w

<a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_45">Art.41</a> of the Constitution of India. After referring to various other

judgments on the point and having found that most of the State

Governments         were lagging       behind       in     complying     with    the

provisions of the Act, the following directions are issued at

paragraphs 24, 25 and 26:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      &quot;24. We have referred to certain provisions only to highlight
      that the 2016 Act has been enacted and it has many salient
      features. As we find, more rights have been conferred on the
      disabled persons and more categories have been added. That
      apart, access to justice, free education, role of local authorities,
      National fund and the State fund for persons with disabilities
      have been created. The 2016 Act is noticeably a sea change in
      the perception and requires a march forward look with regard
      to the persons with disabilities and the role of the States, local
      authorities, educational institutions and the companies. The
      statute operates in a broad spectrum and the stress is laid to
      protect the rights and provide punishment for their violation.</blockquote><p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">      25. Regard being had to the change in core aspects, we think
      it apposite to direct all the States and the Union Territories to
      file compliance report keeping in view the provisions of the
      2016 Act within twelve weeks hence. The States and the Union
      Territories   must   realise   that   under    the    2016   Act   their
      responsibilities have grown and they are required to actualise
      the purpose of the Act, for there is an accent on many a sphere
      with regard to the rights of those with disabilities. When the

      law is so concerned for the disabled persons and makes
      provision, it is the obligation of the law executing authorities to
      give effect to the same in quite promptitude. The steps taken
      in this regard shall be concretely stated in the compliance
      report within the time stipulated. When we are directing the
      States, a duty is cast also on the States and its authorities to
      see that the statutory provisions that are enshrined and
      applicable to the cooperative societies, companies, firms,
      associations and establishments, institutions, are scrupulously
      followed. The State Governments shall take immediate steps to
      comply with the requirements of the 2016 Act and file the
      compliance report so that this Court can appreciate the
      progress made.
</p><p id="p_33">      26. The compliance report to be filed by the States shall be
      supplied to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned
      counsel for the Union of India as well as to the learned counsel
      for the applicant/intervenor so that they can assist the Court.&quot;
Probably it is pursuant to the aforesaid directions that the State

Government      had    come      forward     with    Ext.P8    order        dated

18/11/2018 in order to fill up the backlog vacancies in aided

educational institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_34">     15.   The next contention urged is that when the posts were

not identified, the posts had already been identified in different

establishments including educational institutions run by the

Government. But the Government did not chose to direct the

aided institutions to comply with the provisions of the Act. In fact,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                               -:29:-</span>

when posts in schools and colleges were notified, it equally

applies to aided institutions as well. But they did not comply with

the provisions of the Act. Ext.P8 is only intended to ensure that

the identification of posts which has already been done under the

provisions of the 1995 Act, would apply to aided educational

institutions as well, and they have been directed to fill up the

backlog vacancies.
</p>
<p id="p_35">     We have also perused the judgment of the learned Single

Judge. The entire matter had been considered in detail and for

the reasons stated by us, we do not find any ground to interfere

with the judgment of the learned Single Judge. Appeals are

therefore dismissed.
