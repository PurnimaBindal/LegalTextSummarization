                             JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">A.K. SIKRI, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Prologue

           All these appeals arise out of the judgment dated August 04, 2016

     rendered by the High Court of Delhi in writ petitions filed before it under

     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. We would refer to the subject

     matter of those writ petitions and the manner in which the High Court

     dealt with and decided the same at the appropriate stage. However, it

     would be pertinent to point out that in the said impugned judgment, main

     issue related to the status of National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD)

     and in, particular, about administration of NCTD, powers exercisable by

     and functions of the elected Government of NCTD (GNCTD) vis-a-vis

     the Central Government (or to put it more precisely, in juxtaposition to

     the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of GNCTD, as nominee of the President of

     India). This issue centered around the interpretation that needed to be

     given to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_3">  2) Undoubtedly, NCTD was and remains Union Territory and continues to

     be governed by Part VIII of the Constitution which pertains to ‘the Union

     Territories’.   <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_3">Article 239</a>, which substituted the original Article by the

     Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, w.e.f., 01 November, 1956

     deals with administration of Union Territories. As the nomenclature itself

     suggests, such territories are that of ‘Union”, i.e., Union of India. That is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     3</span>

  why <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_4">Article 239</a> stipulates that every Union Territory is to be

  administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit,

  through an Administrator to be appointed by him with such designation

  as he may specify. The opening words of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_5">Article 239</a>, however, are

  ‘save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law’, which meas that

  Parliament by law can provide different schemes of administration for

  such Union Territories, i.e., different than what is stated in <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_6">Article 239.</a> In

  the year 1962, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_7">Article 239A</a> was inserted, providing a little departure

  from the Scheme of administration contained in <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_8">Article 239</a>, insofar as

  Union Territory of Puducherry is concerned. Likewise by the Constitution

  (Sixty Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 special provision with respect to

  Delhi stood incorporated.       This Article, inter alia, provides for a

  Legislative Assembly for NCTD, Legislative Assembly which comprises

  of Members who are elected representatives. It means that voters of

  NCTD elect their representatives to the Legislative Assembly.


</p><p id="p_4">3) The seminal issue which arose for consideration before the High Court

  in the writ petitions concerned the powers exercisable by such elected

  Government and the manner in which NCTD is to be administered. As

  noted above, as per <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_9">Article 239</a>, it is the President of India which

  administers a Union Territory and he can do so through an Administrator

  to be appointed by him with appropriate designation.                 Such a

  designation generally is that of Administrator or Lieutenant Governor. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>

  respect of Delhi, designation bestowed is that of Lieutenant Governor.

  With the aforesaid special provision inculcated by the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_10">Article

  239AA</a> and by providing for Legislative Assembly, the moot question

  arose as to what are the powers of the elected government of Delhi

  vis-a-vis the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4) To state in a nutshell and in precise manner, the High Court of Delhi held

  that since NCTD remains a Union Territory, it is the President who

  continues to administer NCTD as well as Territory of the Union, i.e., the

  Central Government and his nominee, namely, the Lieutenant Governor

  enjoys the overlapping powers. When these appeals came up before the

  Division Bench of this Court, the Division Bench found that issues raised

  are of seminal constitutional importance and needed to be referred to a

  Constitution Bench in terms of the provisions contained in Clause 5(5) of

  <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_11">Article 143</a> of the Constitution. The matters were, accordingly, referred

  to the Constitution Bench to answer the aforesaid question, namely,

  ambit and scope of the powers of the GNCTD in juxtaposition to that of

  the Lieutenant Governor.       The Constitution Bench has given the

  answers to the various nuances of the otherwise thorny and ticklish

  issues, vide its judgment dated July 04, 2018. There are three opinions.

  The majority opinion is penned by Justice Dipak Misra, Chief Justice of

  India (as his Lordship then was) to which Justice Khanwilkar and one of

  us (Justice A.K. Sikri) concurred.     Two other separate opinions are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       5</span>

     rendered by Justice Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and one of us (Justice Ashok

     Bhushan). After giving answers to the moot questions that arise, all

     these appeals were directed to be listed before the Regular Bench for

     deciding the individual issues and disputes that arise in these appeals.

     This is how the matters were heard, on its own merits, depending upon

     subject matter of each of these appeals, by this Bench. We propose to

     decide these disputes by means of the present judgment.

<p id="p_7">  5) At this juncture, we would like to state in brief the precise subject matter

     of these appeals:
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">  6) As pointed out above, Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017 arises out of the

     common judgment dated August 04, 2016 passed by the High Court in a

     batch of writ petitions. In these writ petitions, number of notifications

     passed by the Government of India, or by the GNCTD were questioned

     by the writ petitioners. Some writ petitions were filed by GNCTD; one by

     Union of India and few others by some individuals. The orders and/or

     actions, validity whereof was questioned by the petitioners before the

     High Court is stated by the High Court in the impugned judgment itself in

     a tabulated form. It would be convenient to reproduce the same as that

     captures the essence of subject matter of dispute in each of the writ

     petition.

                              Manawat   under Section 24 of Cr.P.C.
                                        appointing a Special Public
                                        Prosecutor to conduct the trial
                                        in FIR No.21/2012 in the
                                        Special Court under PC Act


</pre><p id="p_18">7) From the above, it can be discerned that following issues arise for

  consideration:
</p>
<p id="p_19">  (i)        The powers of GNCTD vis-a-vis Lieutenant Governor in respect of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   8</span>

matters connected with ‘services’. It may be mentioned, at this juncture

itself that in Delhi there is no Public Service Commission. Since it is the

Union Territory, the manpower/public servants which are assigned to

Delhi are either those who belong to All India Services like Indian

Administrative Service, Indian Police Service etc. or those who are

recruited for Union Territories, commonly known as NCT of Delhi,

Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman &amp; Diu and Dadra &amp;

Nagar Haveli Civil Service (DHANICS). Admittedly these officers/public

servants do not belong to Union Territory of Delhi exclusively or, for that

matter, at all. They are placed at the disposal of NCTD by the Central

Government.      To this extent there is no dispute.      However, bone of

contention is about their mobility, i.e. their posting within Delhi itself from

one place/department to other. To put it otherwise, the issue is as to

whether such posting orders are to be passed by the President of India

(or for that matter the Lieutenant Governor) or it is the Government of

NCTD which is competent to exercise such a power once the manpower

is assigned to it.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(ii)   Other issue relates to the setting up of Anti-Corruption Bureau

Police Station (ACB Police Station). Vide Notifications dated May 21,

2015 and July 23, 2014 the Government of India, Ministry of Home

Affairs empowered the Lieutenant Governor to exercise such a power

and directed ACB Police Station not to take cognizance of offences
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9</span>

against officials of Central Government.     These Notifications were

challenged by the GNCTD on the ground that ACB Police Stations are

empowered to take cognizance of offences against officials of the

Central Government as well, so long as they are posted in Delhi.

</p><p id="p_21">(iii)   Another dispute between the GNCTD and the Central Government

arises out of <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_18">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952 (COI Act). It is : Whether

GNCTD is empowered to set up Commission of Inquiry under the said

Act of its own and without placing the matter before the Lieutenant

Governor for his views/concurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(iv)    Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2011 is enacted which is State

Legislative. Delhi Electricity Reforms (Transfer Schemes) Rules, 2001

have also been framed under this Act. The GNCTD issued orders under

     interpreted by the Constitution Bench judgment dated July 04, 2018

     (hereinafter referred to as CB Judgment).
</p>
<p id="p_26">  9) Relevant Articles of the Constitution, which need to be noted amongst

     others in this behalf, are Articles 239 and 239AA, which read as under :

<p id="p_27">(c) The provisions of Articles 324 to 327 and 329 shall apply in
relation to the National Capital Territory, the Legislative Assembly
of the National Capital Territory and the members thereof as they
apply, in relation to a State, the Legislative Assembly of a State

Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the
Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision and
act according to the decision given thereon by the President and

       Governor in any case where the matter, in his opinion, is so

</p><p id="p_35">10)    As pointed above, the Court in aforesaid Constitution Bench

  judgment took note of the fact that with insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_26">Article 239AA</a>, which

  gave special status to the Union Territory of Delhi known as National

  Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), the NCTD has its own Legislative

  Assembly which is elected body through the election process by the

  voters of NCTD. The principal question, therefore, was as to whether

  this amended constitutional provision had transformed the status of

  Delhi and what is the extent and power which are to be accorded to the

  Legislative Assembly as well as the Executive as a result of these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    13</span>

  elections, i.e., Government of NCT of Delhi. In the majority opinion, it

  was emphasised at the beginning itself that while entering into the

  process of interpretation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_27">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution, the Court is

  supposed to take aid of new tools such as constitutional pragmatism

  having due regard for sanctity of objectivity, realisation of the purpose in

  truest    sense by constantly reminding one and all about the

  sacrosanctity of democratic structure envisaged by our Constitution,

  elevation of the precepts of constitutional trust and morality, and the

  solemn idea of de-centralisation of power. This method of understanding

  is described in the judgment as ‘confluence of the idea and spirit of the

  Constitution’. The court also emphasised that interpretation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_28">Article

  239AA</a> of the Constitution is not to be done in an exclusive compartment

  but in the context in which it has been introduced and also keeping in

  view the conceptual structure of the other relevant Articles of the

  Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">11)    In this process, the Court recapitulated brief history of Delhi from

  its inception as Capital of India in the year 1911 upto       the stage of

  insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_29">Article 239AA</a> in the Constitution, which was the result of a

  detailed report submitted by Balakrishnan Committee. This narration in

  the judgment is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "15. On 12-12-1911, Delhi became the capital of India. Delhi
       Tehsil and Mehrauli Thana were separated from Punjab and
       annexed to Delhi headed by a Commissioner and it came to be
       known as the Chief Commissioner's province. In 1912, the Delhi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              14</span>

<a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_30">Laws Act</a>, 1912 came into force with effect from 1-10-1912 making
certain laws prevalent in Punjab to be applicable to Delhi. <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_31">The
Delhi Laws Act</a>, 1915 empowered the Chief Commissioner, Delhi
to determine application of laws by issuing appropriate notification
in the Gazette of India. The Government of India Act, 1919 and
the Government of India Act, 1935 retained Delhi as a Centrally
administered territory. On coming into force of the Constitution of
India on 26-1-1950, Delhi became a Part C State. In the year
1951, the Government of Part C States Act, 1951 was enacted
providing, inter alia, for a Legislative Assembly in Delhi. <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_32">Section
21(1)</a> of the 1951 Act empowered the Legislative Assembly to
make laws on all matters of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution except (i) public order; (ii) police (including railway
police); (iii) constitution and powers of municipal corporations and
local authorities, etc. — public utility authorities; (iv) lands &amp;
buildings vested in/in possession of the Union situated in Delhi or
New Delhi; (v) offences against laws about subjects mentioned
from (i) to (iv); and (vi) jurisdiction of courts with respect to the
above matters and court fee thereon.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">16. On 19-10-1956, the Constitution of India (Seventh
Amendment) Act, 1956 was passed to implement the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1211891/" id="a_33">States Reorganisation Act</a>, 1956 which did away with Part A,
B, C and D States and only two categories, namely, States and
Union Territories remained and Delhi became a Union Territory to
be administered by an Administrator appointed by the President.
The Legislative Assembly of Delhi and the Council stood
abolished. In the year 1953, the <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_34">Government of Union Territories
Act</a>, 1963 was enacted to provide for Legislative Assemblies and
Council of Ministers for various Union Territories but the
provisions of the said Act were not made applicable to Delhi. The
Delhi Administration Act, 1966 was enacted to provide for limited
representative Government for Delhi through a Metropolitan
Council comprising of 56 elected Members and five nominated
Members. In the same year, on 20-8-1966, the Ministry of Home
Affairs issued S.O. No. 2524 that provided, inter alia, that the
Lieutenant Governor/Administrator/Chief Commissioner shall be
subject to the control of the President of India and exercise such
powers and discharge the functions of a State Government under
the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_35">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952 within the Union Territories.
In the year 1987, the Balakrishnan Committee was set up to
submit its recommendations with regard to the status to be
conferred on Delhi and the said Committee recommended that
Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory but there must be a
Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers responsible to the
said Assembly with appropriate powers; and to ensure stability,
appropriate constitutional measures should be taken to confer the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                             15</span>

National Capital a special status. The relevant portion of the
Balakrishnan Committee Report reads as follows:

  “6.5.5. In Paras 6.5.2. and 6.5.3. we have briefly
  summarised the arguments for and against making Delhi a
  constituent State of the Union. After the most careful
  consideration of all the arguments and on an objective
  appraisal, we are fully convinced that most of the arguments
  against making Delhi a State of the Union are very
  substantial, sound and valid and deserve acceptance. This
  was also the view expressed before us by some of the
  eminent and knowledgeable persons whom we interviewed.
  As these arguments are self-evident we find it unnecessary
  to go into them in detail except those relating to
  constitutional and financial aspects covered by them.

  6.5.6. The important argument from the constitutional angle
  is based on the federal type of our Constitution under which
  there is a constitutional division of powers and functions
  between the Union and the State. If Delhi becomes a
  full-fledged State, there will be a constitutional division of
  sovereign, legislative and executive powers between the
  Union and the State of Delhi. One of the consequences will
  be that in respect of matters in the State List, Parliament will
  have no power on jurisdiction to make any law except in the
  special and emergency situations provided for under the
  Constitution and to that extent the Union Executive cannot
  exercise executive powers or functions. The constitutional
  prohibition on the exercise of powers and functions will make
  it virtually impossible for the Union to discharge its special
  responsibilities in relation to the National Capital as well as
  to the nation itself. We have already indicated in an earlier
  chapter the special features of the National Capital and the
  need for keeping it under the control of the Union
  Government. Such control is vital in the national interest
  irrespective of whether the subject-matter is in the State field
  or Union field. If the administration of the National Capital is
  divided into rigid compartments of State field and Union field,
  conflicts are likely to arise in several vital matters,
  particularly if the two Governments are run by different
  political parties. Such conflicts may, at times, prejudice the
  national interest….
</p>
<p id="p_39">                     xx        xx           xx

  6.5.9. We are also impressed with the argument that Delhi
  as the National Capital belongs to the nation as a whole and
  any constituent State of the Union of which Delhi will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                             16</span>

become a part would sooner or later acquire a predominant
position in relation to other States. Sufficient constitutional
authority for Union intervention in day-to-day matters,
however vital some of them may be, will not be available to
the Union, thereby prejudicing the discharge of its national
duties and responsibilities.

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL OF MINISTERS

6.7.19. As a necessary corollary to the establishment of a
responsible Government for Delhi the structure of the
executive should be more or less on the pattern provided by
the Constitution. Accordingly, there should be a Head of the
Administration with a Council of Ministers answerable to the
Legislative Assembly. As Delhi will continue to have the
status of a Union Territory, <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_36">Article 239</a> will apply to it and so it
will have an Administrator with such designation as may be
specified. The present designation of the Lieutenant
Governor may be continued and recognised in the
Constitution itself. …

                    xx        xx            xx

6.7.21. The Administrator should be expressly required to
perform his functions on the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers. The expression “to aid and advice” is a
well-understood term of art to denote the implications of the
Cabinet system of Government adopted by our Constitution.
Under this system, the general rule is that the exercise of
executive functions by the Administrator has to be on the aid
and advice of his Council of Ministers which means that it is
virtually the Ministers that should take decisions on such
matters. However, for Delhi, the following modifications of
this general rule will have to be adopted:
</p>
<p id="p_41">(i) Firstly, the requirement of acting on the aid and advice of
the Council of Ministers cannot apply to the exercise by the
Administrator of any judicial or quasi-judicial functions. The
reason is obvious because in respect of such functions there
is no question of acting on the advice of another person.

</p><p id="p_42">(ii) Secondly, the requirement is only in relation to matters in
respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the powers to
make laws. This power will be subject to the restrictions
already dealt with earlier in the Report. Accordingly, the
Council of Ministers will not have jurisdiction to deal with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     17</span>

         matters excluded from the purview of the Legislative
         Assembly.
</p>
<p id="p_43">         (iii) Thirdly, there is need for a special provision to resolve
         differences between the Administrator and his Council of
         Ministers on any matter concerning the administration of
         Delhi. Normally, the general principle applicable to the
         system of responsible Government under the Constitution is
         that the Head of the Administration should act as a mere
         constitutional figurehead and will have to accept the advice
         of the Council of Ministers except when the matter is left to
         his discretion. However, by virtue of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_37">Article 239</a> of the
         Constitution, the ultimate responsibility for good
         administration of Delhi is vested in the President acting
         through the Administrator. Because of this the Administrator
         has to take a somewhat more active part in the
         administration than the Governor of a State. It is, therefore,
         necessary to reconcile between the need to retain the
         responsibility of the Administrator to the Centre in this regard
         and the need to enforce the collective responsibility of the
         Council of Ministers to the Legislature. The best way of
         doing this is to provide that in case of difference of opinion
         which cannot be resolved between the Administrator and his
         Council of Ministers, he should refer the question to the
         President and the decision of the President thereon will be
         final. In cases of urgency, if immediate action is necessary,
         the Administrator may direct action to be taken pending such
         decision of the President. A provision of this kind was made
         for this very reason not only in the 1951 Act, but also in the
         1963 Act relating to the Union Territories as well as in the
         1978 Bill.”


</p><p id="p_44">12)    The majority opinion thereafter took note of the arguments of both

  sides. Discussion that followed thereafter was on the following aspects:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">          •   Ideals/principles of representative governance
          •   Constitutional morality
          •   Constitutional objectivity
          •   Constitutional governance and the conception of legitimate
              constitutional trust
          •   Collective responsibility
          •   Federal functionalism and democracy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     18</span>

           •   Concept of federal balance
           •   Interpretation of the Constitution
           •   Purposive interpretation
           •   Constitutional culture and pragmatism

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">13)    After discussing in detail the aforesaid tools necessarily required

  for proper and just interpretation of the concerned provisions, the Court

  undertook the exercise of interpreting Articles 239, 239A and 239AA of

  the Constitution.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_45">14)    Since, this interpretation is material and significant for deciding

  specific issues which have been raised in these appeals, we would like

  to incorporate the portions of the majority judgment which have

  interpreted these Articles:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "Interpretation of Articles 239 and 239-A:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       174. The aforesaid passages set two guidelines. First, it permits
       judicial creativity and second, it mentions one to be conscious of
       pragmatic realism of the obtaining situation and the controversy.
       That apart, there is a suggestion to take note of the behavioural
       needs and norms of life. Thus, creativity, practical applicability and
       perception of reality from the societal perspective are the warrant
       while engaging oneself with the process of interpretation of a
       constitutional provision.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       175. To settle the controversy at hand, it is imperative that we dig
       deep and perform a meticulous analysis of Articles 239, 239-A,
       239-AA and 239-AB all of which fall in Part VIII of the Constitution
       bearing the heading, “The Union Territories”. For this purpose, let
       us reproduce the aforesaid Articles one by one and carry out the
       indispensable and crucial task of interpreting them.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                             19</span>

<p id="p_46">176. <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_38">Article 239</a> provides for the administration of Union
Territories. It reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_47">  “239. Administration of Union Territories.—(1) Save as
  otherwise provided by Parliament by law, every Union
  Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to
  such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be
  appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.

  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Part VI, the
  President may appoint the Governor of a State as the
  Administrator of an adjoining Union Territory, and where a
  Governor is so appointed, he shall exercise his functions as
  such Administrator independently of his Council of
  Ministers.”
                                         (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_48">177. The said Article was brought into existence by the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956. Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_39">Article
239</a>, by employing the word “shall”, makes it abundantly clear that
every Union Territory is mandatorily to be administered by the
President through an Administrator unless otherwise provided by
Parliament in the form of a law. Further, clause (1) of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_40">Article 239</a>
also stipulates that the said Administrator shall be appointed by
the President with such designation as he may specify.

</p><p id="p_49">178. Clause (2) thereafter, being a non obstante clause, lays
down that irrespective of anything contained in Part VI of the
Constitution, the President may appoint the Governor of a State to
act as an Administrator of a Union Territory which is adjacent
and/or contiguous to the State of which he is the Governor. The
Governor of a State who is so appointed as an Administrator of an
adjoining UT shall exercise his functions as an Administrator of
the said UT independently and Autonomously and not as per the
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State of which he
is the Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_50">179. In this regard, the Court, in the case of Shamsher Singh
(supra), has observed thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_51">
“54. The provisions of the Constitution which expressly require the
Governor to exercise his powers in his discretion are contained in
Articles to which reference has been made. To illustrate, <a href="/doc/398881/" id="a_41">Article

of an adjoining Union Territory he shall exercise his functions as
such Administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.”

India and others v. Surinder S</a>. observed:-
</p><p id="p_53">  “The unamended <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_44">Article 239</a> envisaged administration of the
  States specified in Part C of the First Schedule of the
  Constitution by the President through a Chief Commissioner
  or a Lieutenant Governor to be appointed by him or through
  the Government of a neighbouring State. This was subject to
  other provisions of Part VIII of the Constitution. As against
  this, amended <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_45">Article 239</a> lays down that subject to any law
  enacted by Parliament every Union Territory shall be
  administered by the President acting through an
  Administrator appointed by him with such designation as he
  may specify. In terms of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_46">Article 239 (amended</a>),
  the President can appoint the Governor of a State as an
  Administrator of an adjoining Union Territory and on his
  appointment, the Governor is required to exercise his
  function as an Administrator independently of his Council of
  Ministers. The difference in the language of the unamended
  and amended <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_47">Article 239</a> makes it clear that prior to
  1-11-1956, the President could administer Part C State
  through a Chief Commissioner or a Lieutenant Governor,
  but, after the amendment, every Union Territory is
  required to be administered by the President through an
  Administrator appointed by him with such designation
  as he may specify. In terms of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_48">Article 239
  (amended</a>), the President is empowered to appoint the
  Governor of State as the Administrator to an adjoining Union
  Territory and once appointed, the Governor, in his capacity
  as Administrator, has to act independently of the Council of
  Ministers of the State of which he is the Governor.”

"181. Now, let us proceed to scan <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_49">Article 239-A</a> of the Constitution
which deals with the creation of local legislatures or Council of
Ministers or both for certain Union Territories. It reads as follows:

  “239-A. Creation of local legislatures or Council of
  Ministers or both for certain Union Territories.—(1)
  Parliament may by law create for the Union Territory of
  Puducherry—

</p><p id="p_54">  (a) a body, whether elected or partly nominated and partly
  elected, to function as a legislature for the Union Territory, or

</p><p id="p_55">  (b) a Council of Ministers, or both with such constitution,
  powers and functions, in each case, as may be specified in
  the law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                             21</span><p id="p_56">

  (2) Any such law as is referred to in clause (1) shall not be
  deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the
  purposes of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_50">Article 368</a> notwithstanding that it contains any
  provision which amends or has the effect of amending this
  Constitution.”

</p><p id="p_57">182. The aforesaid Article was brought into force by the
Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962. Prior to the year
1971, under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_51">Article 239-A</a>, Parliament had the power to create by
law legislatures and/or Council of Ministers for the then Union
Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur, Goa and
Daman and Diu. Thereafter, on 25-1-1971, Himachal Pradesh
acquired Statehood and consequently, Himachal Pradesh was
omitted from Article 239-A. Subsequently, on 21-1-1972, Tripura
and Manipur were granted Statehood as a consequence of which
both Manipur and Tripura were omitted from Article 239-A.

</p><p id="p_58">183. Likewise, with the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu
Reorganisation Act, 1987 on 30-5-1987, both Goa and Daman
and Diu were omitted from <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_52">Article 239-A.</a> Parliament, under the
<a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_53">Government of Union Territories Act</a>, 1963, created legislatures for
the then Union Territories and accordingly, even after 30-5-1987,
the applicability of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_54">Article 239-A</a> stands limited to UT of
Puducherry.
</p>
<p id="p_59">184. As a natural corollary, the Union Territory of Puducherry
stands on a different footing from other UTs of Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli,
Lakshadweep and Chandigarh. However, we may hasten to add
that Puducherry cannot be compared with the NCT of Delhi as it is
solely governed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_55">Article 239-A.</a>

P. Interpretation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_56">Article 239-AA</a> of the Constitution


</p><p id="p_60">185. We shall now advert to the interpretation of Articles 239-AA
and 239-AB of the Constitution which are the gravamen of the
present batch of appeals. The said Articles require an elaborate
interpretation and a thorough analysis to unearth and discover the
true intention of Parliament while inserting the said Articles, in
exercise of its constituent power, by the Constitution (Sixty-ninth
Amendment) Act, 1991. The said Articles read as follows:
  “239-AA. Special provisions with respect to Delhi.—(1)
  As from the date of commencement of the Constitution
  (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991, the Union Territory of
  Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi

<a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_57">Article 239</a> shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.
(2)(a) There shall be a Legislative Assembly for the National
Capital Territory and the seats in such Assembly shall be
filled by Members chosen by direct election from territorial
constituencies in the National Capital Territory.

</p><p id="p_61">(b) The total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly,
the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, the
division of the National Capital Territory into territorial
constituencies (including the basis for such division) and all
other matters relating to the functioning of the Legislative
Assembly shall be regulated by law made by Parliament.

</p><p id="p_62">(c) The provisions of Articles 324 to 327 and 329 shall apply
in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Legislative
Assembly of the National Capital Territory and the Members
thereof as they apply, in relation to a State, the Legislative
Assembly of a State and the Members thereof respectively;
and any reference in Articles 326 and 329 to “appropriate
Legislature” shall be deemed to be a reference to
Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_63">(3)(a) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the
Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the
whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or
in the Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is
applicable to Union Territories except matters with respect to
Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and
66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2
and 18.
</p>
<p id="p_64">(b) Nothing in sub-clause (a) shall derogate from the powers
of Parliament under this Constitution to make laws with
respect to any matter for a Union Territory or any part
thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(c) If any provision of a law made by the Legislative
Assembly with respect to any matter is repugnant to any
provision of a law made by Parliament with respect to that
matter, whether passed before or after the law made by the
Legislative Assembly, or of an earlier law, other than a law
made by the Legislative Assembly, then, in either case, the
law made by Parliament, or, as the case may be, such
earlier law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislative
Assembly shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void:

  President and has received his assent, such law shall prevail
  in the National Capital Territory:

<p id="p_66">  Provided further that nothing in this sub-clause shall prevent
  Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to
  the same matter including a law adding to, amending,
  varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislative

<p id="p_67">  (4) There shall be a Council of Ministers consisting of not
  more than ten per cent of the total number of Members in
  the Legislative Assembly, with the Chief Minister at the head
  to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of
  his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the
  Legislative Assembly has power to make laws, except
  insofar as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his
  discretion:

  competent for the Lieutenant Governor in any case where
  the matter, in his opinion, is so urgent that it is necessary for
  him to take immediate action, to take such action or to give
  such direction in the matter as he deems necessary.

(5) The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the President and
other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice
of the Chief Minister and the Ministers shall hold office during the
pleasure of the President.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(6) The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the
Legislative Assembly.
</p>
<p id="p_70">(7)(a) Parliament may, by law, make provisions for giving effect to,
or supplementing the provisions contained in the foregoing
clauses and for all matters incidental or consequential thereto.

</p><p id="p_71">(b) Any such law as is referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not be
deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes
of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_58">Article 368</a> notwithstanding that it contains any provision which
amends or has the effect of amending, this Constitution.

(8) The provisions of <a href="/doc/1144754/" id="a_59">Article 239-B</a> shall, so far as may be, apply
in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Lieutenant
Governor and the Legislative Assembly, as they apply in relation
to the Union Territory of Puducherry, the Administrator and its
legislature, respectively; and any reference in that Article to
“clause (1) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_60">Article 239-A</a>” shall be deemed to be a reference to
this Article or <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_61">Article 239-AB</a>, as the case may be.

National Capital Territory cannot be carried on in accordance with
the provisions of Article 239-AA or of any law made in pursuance
of that Article; or

Territory it is necessary or expedient so to do, the President may
by order suspend the operation of any provision of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_62">Article 239-AA</a>
or of all or any of the provisions of any law made in pursuance of
that Article for such period and subject to such conditions as may
be specified in such law and make such incidental and
consequential provisions as may appear to him to be necessary
or expedient for administering the National Capital Territory in
accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_63">Article 239</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_64">Article 239-AA</a>.”
                                                    (emphasis supplied)

"186. We deem it appropriate to refer to the Statement of Objects
and Reasons for the amendment which reads thus:

  “1. The question of reorganisation of the administrative
  set-up in the Union Territory of Delhi has been under the
  consideration of the Government for some time. The
  Government of India appointed on 24-12-1987 a Committee
  to go into the various issues connected with the
  administration of Delhi and to recommend measures inter
  alia for the streamlining of the administrative set-up. The
  Committee went into the matter in great detail and
  considered the issues after holding discussions with various
  individuals, associations, political parties and other experts
  and taking into account the arrangements in the national
  capitals of other countries with a federal set-up and also the
  debates in the Constituent Assembly as also the reports by
  earlier Committees and Commissions. After such detailed
  inquiry and examination, it recommended that Delhi should
  continue to be a Union Territory and provided with a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                        25</span>

             Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible
             to such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with
             matters of concern to the common man. The Committee also
             recommended that with a view to ensure stability and
             permanence the arrangements should be incorporated in the
             Constitution to give the National Capital a special status
             among the Union Territories.
</p>
<p id="p_74">             2. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals.”

                 The aforesaid, as we perceive, really conceives of
             conferring special status on Delhi. This fundamental
             grammar has to be kept in view when we penetrate into the
             interpretative dissection of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_65">Article 239-AA</a> and other articles
             that are pertinent to understand the said provision.

</p><p id="p_75">             187. The aforesaid, as we perceive, really conceives of
             conferring special status on Delhi. This fundamental
             grammar has to be kept in view when we penetrate into the
             interpretative dissection of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_66">Article 239-AA</a> and other articles
             that are pertinent to understand the said provision.”


</p><p id="p_76">    15)    After interpreting the provisions in the manner aforesaid, the Court

      concentrated on the status of NCTD, in particular. In the process, it

      referred to earlier judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/105502591/" id="a_67">Samsher Singh vs. State of

      Punjab1</a>, from which it culled out the powers of the Governor in a State

      where the Governor was empowered to act ‘in his discretion’.               It

      observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           "192. Thereafter, A.N. Ray, C.J. discussed the provisions of the
           Constitution as well as a couple of paragraphs of the Sixth
           Schedule wherein the words “in his discretion” are used in relation
           to certain powers of the Governor to highlight the fact that a
           Governor can act in his discretion only when the provisions of the
           Constitution so permit.</blockquote><p id="p_77">

</p><p id="p_78">           193. In this context, we may refer with profit to the authority in
           <a href="/doc/126775/" id="a_68">Devji Vallabhbhai Tandel v. Administrator of Goa</a>, <a href="/doc/126775/" id="a_69">Daman &amp; Diu
           [Devji Vallabhbhai Tandel v. Administrator of Goa, Daman &amp; Diu</a>,
           (1982) 2 SCC 222 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 403] . In the said case, the
1                 (1974) 2 SCC 831
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                             26</span>

issue that arose for consideration was whether the role and
functions of the Administrator stipulated under the <a href="/doc/1544448/" id="a_70">Union
Territories Act</a>, 1963 is similar to those of a Governor of a State
and as such, whether the Administrator has to act on the “aid and
advice” of the Council of Ministers. The Court considered the
relevant provisions and after comparing the language of Articles
74 and 163 of the Constitution with the language of <a href="/doc/1544448/" id="a_71">Section 44</a> of
the Union Territories Act, 1963, it observed that the Administrator,
even in matters where he is not required to act in his discretion
under the Act or where he is not exercising any judicial or
quasi-judicial functions, is not bound to act according to the
advice of the Council of Ministers and the same is manifest from
the proviso to <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_72">Section 44(1)</a>. The Court went on to say: (SCC pp.
229-30, paras 14-15)


  “14. … It transpires from the proviso that in the event of a
  difference of opinion between the Administrator and his
  Ministers on any matter, the Administrator shall refer the
  matter to the President for decision and act according to the
  decision given thereon by the President. If the President in a
  given situation agrees with what the Administrator opines
  contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers, the
  Administrator would be able to override the advice of the
  Council of Ministers and on a reference to the President
  under the proviso, obviously the President would act
  according to the advice of the Council of Ministers given
  under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_73">Article 74.</a> Virtually, therefore, in the event of a
  difference of opinion between the Council of Ministers of the
  Union Territory and the Administrator, the right to decide
  would vest in the Union Government and the Council of
  Ministers of the Union Territory would be bound by the view
  taken by the Union Government. Further, the Administrator
  enjoys still some more power to act in derogation of the
  advice of the Council of Ministers.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">15. The second limb of the proviso to <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_74">Section 44(1)</a> enables the
Administrator that in the event of a difference of opinion between
him and the Council of Ministers not only he can refer the matter
to the President but during the interregnum where the matter is in
his opinion so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate
action, he has the power to take such action or to give such
directions in the matter as he deems necessary. In other words,
during the interregnum he can completely override the advice of
the Council of Ministers and act according to his light. Neither the
Governor nor the President enjoys any such power. This basic
functional difference in the powers and position enjoyed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                        27</span>

           Governor and the President on the one hand and the
           Administrator on the other is so glaring that it is not possible to
           hold on the analogy of the decision in Samsher Singh case
           [<a href="/doc/105502591/" id="a_75">Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (1974) 2 SCC 831 : 1974 SCC
           (L&amp;S) 550] that the Administrator is purely a constitutional
           functionary bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers
           and cannot act on his own.”
                                                                (emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_81">    16)    Thereafter, various other judgments were taken note of including

      Nine Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/50919315/" id="a_76">NDMC v. State of Punjab2</a> case which specifically

      deal with the status of NCTD. Following paragraphs on this aspect need

      a reproduction:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           "199. The Governor of a State, as per <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_77">Article 163</a>, is bound by the
           aid and advice of his Council of Ministers in the exercise of his
           functions except where he is, by or under the Constitution,
           required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.
           Thus, the Governor may act in his discretion only if he is so
           permitted by an express provision of the Constitution.</blockquote><p id="p_82">

</p><p id="p_83">           200. As far as the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is concerned, as
           per <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_78">Article 239-AA(4</a>), he is bound by the aid and advice of his
           Council of Ministers in matters for which the Delhi Legislative
           Assembly has legislative powers. However, this is subject to
           the proviso contained in clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_79">Article 239-AA</a> which gives
           the power to the Lieutenant Governor that in case of any
           difference between him and his Ministers, he shall refer the same
           to the President for a binding decision. This proviso to clause (4)
           has retained the powers for the Union even over matters falling
           within the legislative domain of the Delhi Assembly. This
           overriding power of the Union to legislate qua other Union
           Territories is exposited under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_80">Article 246(4).”</a>


</p><p id="p_84">    17)    The Court, thereafter, specifically focused on the executive power

      of the Council of Ministers of Delhi and made following remarks on this

      particular aspect:
</p>
<p id="p_85">
</p><p id="p_86">2                (1997) 7 SCC 339
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                     28</span>

       "204. Drawing an analogy while interpreting the provisions of
       <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_81">Article 239-AA(3)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_82">Article 239-AA(4)</a> would reveal that the
       executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is
       conterminous with the legislative power of the Delhi
       Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_83">Article 239-AA(3)</a>
       and which extends over all but three subjects in the State
       List and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_84">Article
       239-AA(4)</a> confers executive power on the Council of Ministers
       over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly
       has legislative power.
</p>
<p id="p_87">       205. The legislative power conferred upon the Delhi Legislative
       Assembly is to give effect to legislative enactments as per the needs
       and requirements of Delhi whereas the executive power is conferred on
       the executive to implement certain policy decisions. This view is also
       strengthened by the fact that after the Seventh Amendment of the
       Constitution by which the words “Part C States” were substituted by the
       words “Union Territories”, the word “State” in the proviso to <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_85">Article
       73</a> cannot be read to mean Union Territory as such an
       interpretation would render the scheme and purpose of Part VIII
       (Union Territories) of the Constitution infructuous.”


</p><p id="p_88">18)    Next facet of discussion was on the essence of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_86">Article 239AA</a> of

  the Constitution.    It would be of use to take note of the following

  discussion on this aspect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "207. At the outset, we must declare that the insertion of Articles
       239-AA and 239-AB, which specifically pertain to NCT of Delhi, is
       reflective of the intention of Parliament to accord Delhi a sui
       generis status from the other Union Territories as well as from the
       Union Territory of Puducherry to which <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_87">Article 239-A</a> is singularly
       applicable as on date. The same has been authoritatively held by
       the majority judgment in NDMC case [<a href="/doc/50919315/" id="a_88">NDMC v. State of Punjab</a>,
       (1997) 7 SCC 339] to the effect that the NCT of Delhi is a class by

       emphasise the intention of Parliament, while inserting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_89">Article
       239-AA</a> in the exercise of its constituent power, to treat the
       Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi as a
       set of elected representatives of the voters of NCT of Delhi and to
       treat the Government of NCT of Delhi as a representative form of
       Government.

<p id="p_89">216. The Legislative Assembly is wholly comprised of elected
representatives who are chosen by direct elections and are sent
to Delhi's Legislative Assembly by the voters of Delhi. None of the
Members of Delhi's Legislative Assembly are nominated. The
elected representatives and the Council of Ministers of Delhi,
being accountable to the voters of Delhi, must have the
appropriate powers so as to perform their functions effectively and
efficiently. This is also discernible from the Balakrishnan
Committee Report which recommended that though Delhi should
continue to be a Union Territory, yet it should be provided with a
Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible to
such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with matters of
concern to the common man.

</p><p id="p_91">217. Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_90">Article 239-AA</a> establishes
the power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly to enact laws for NCT
of Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the State List
and/or Concurrent List except insofar as matters with respect to
and which relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List.


</p><p id="p_92">218. Sub-clause (b) of clause (3) lays down that Parliament has
the powers to make laws with respect to any matter for a Union
Territory including NCT of Delhi or any part thereof and
sub-clause (a) shall not derogate such powers of Parliament.
Sub-clause (c) of clause (3) gives Parliament the overriding power
to the effect that where any provision of any law made by the
Legislative Assembly of Delhi is repugnant to any provision of law
made by Parliament, then the law made by Parliament shall
prevail and the law made by the Delhi Legislative Assembly shall
be void to the extent of repugnancy.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">219. Thus, it is evident from clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_91">Article 239-AA</a> that
Parliament has the power to make laws for NCT of Delhi on any of
the matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List
and at the same time, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has
the legislative power with respect to matters enumerated in the
State List and the Concurrent List except matters with respect to
entries which have been explicitly excluded from <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_92">Article 239-AA(3)</a>

</p><p id="p_97">220. Now, it is essential to analyse clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_93">Article 239-AA</a>,
the most important provision for determination of the controversy
at hand. Clause (4) stipulates a Westminster style Cabinet
system of Government for NCT of Delhi where there shall be a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                              30</span>

Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and
advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in
relation to matters with respect to which the Delhi Legislative
Assembly has power to enact laws except in matters in respect of
which the Lieutenant Governor is required to act in his discretion.


</p><p id="p_98">221. The proviso to clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_94">Article 239-AA</a> stipulates that in
case of a difference of opinion on any matter between the
Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers, the Lieutenant Governor
shall refer it to the President for a binding decision. Further,
pending such decision by the President, in any case where the
matter, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, is so urgent
that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, the proviso
makes him competent to take such action and issue such
directions as he deems necessary.

239-AA(4)</a> reveals that the executive power of the Government of
NCT of Delhi is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi
Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_97">Article 239-AA(3)</a>
and which extends over all but three subjects in the State List
and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_98">Article

Ministers over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative
Assembly has legislative power.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">223. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_99">Article 239-AA(3)(a)</a> reserves Parliament's legislative power
on all matters in the State List and Concurrent List, but clause (4)
nowhere reserves the executive powers of the Union with
respect to such matters. On the contrary, clause (4) explicitly
grants to the Government of Delhi executive powers in relation to
matters for which the Legislative Assembly has power to legislate.
The legislative power is conferred upon the Assembly to
enact whereas the policy of the legislation has to be given
effect to by the executive for which the Government of Delhi
has to have coextensive executive powers. Such a view is in
consonance with the observation in <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_100">Ram Jawaya Kapur [Ram
Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1955 SC 549] which has
been discussed elaborately in the earlier part of the judgment.


</p><p id="p_103">224. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_101">Article 239-AA(4)</a> confers executive powers on the
Government of NCT of Delhi whereas the executive power of
the Union stems from <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_102">Article 73</a> and is coextensive with
Parliament's legislative power. Further, the ideas of pragmatic
federalism and collaborative federalism will fall to the ground if we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                      31</span>

       are to say that the Union has overriding executive powers even in
       respect of matters for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has
       legislative powers. Thus, it can be very well said that the
       executive power of the Union in respect of NCT of Delhi is
       confined to the three matters in the State List for which the
       legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been
       excluded under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_103">Article 239-AA(3)(a).</a> Such an interpretation would
       thwart any attempt on the part of the Union Government to seize
       all control and allow the concepts of pragmatic federalism and
       federal balance to prevail by giving NCT of Delhi some degree of
       required independence in its functioning subject to the limitations
       imposed by the Constitution.

       not to be treated as bones and flesh without nerves and neurons
       that make the nerves functional. We feel, it is necessary in the
       context to read the words of the provision in the spirit of citizenry
       participation in the governance of a democratic polity that is
       republican in character. We may hasten to add that when we say
       so, it should not be construed that there is allowance of enormous
       entry of judicial creativity, for the construction one intends to place
       has its plinth and platform on the Preamble and precedents
       pertaining to constitutional interpretation and purposive
       interpretation keeping in view the conception of sense and spirit of
       the Constitution. It is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to
       the functionalism of the Constitution. And we call it constitutional
       pragmatism.”


</p><p id="p_107">19)    The majority opinion also concentrated on the GNCTD Act, 1991

  as well as Transaction of Business of the GNCTD Rules, 1993.                    Its

  analysis of various provisions of the said Act and Rules led to, inter alia,

  the following discussion:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "244. Upon scanning the anatomy of the 1991 Act, we find
       that the Act contains fifty-six sections and is divided into five
       Parts, each dealing with different fields. Now, we may refer to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                            32</span>

some of the provisions contained in Part IV of the 1991 Act titled
“Certain Provisions relating to Lieutenant Governor and Ministers”
which are relevant to the case at hand. <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_105">Section 41</a> deals with
matters in which the Lieutenant Governor may act in his
discretion and reads thus:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_108">  “41. Matters in which Lieutenant Governor to act in his
  discretion.—(1) The Lieutenant Governor shall act in his
  discretion in a matter—

</p><p id="p_109">  (i) which falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on
  the Legislative Assembly but in respect of which powers or
  functions are entrusted or delegated to him by the President;
  or

</p><p id="p_110">  (ii) in which he is required by or under any law to act in his
  discretion or to exercise any judicial or quasi-judicial
  functions.
</p>
<p id="p_111">  (2) If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is
  not a matter as respects which the Lieutenant Governor is
  by or under any law required to act in his discretion, the
  decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be
  final.
</p><p id="p_112">  (3) If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is
  not a matter as respects which the Lieutenant Governor is
  required by any law to exercise any judicial or quasi-judicial
  functions, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon
  shall be final.
</p>
<p id="p_113">  245. A careful perusal of Section 41 of the 1991 Act shows
  that the Lieutenant Governor can act in his discretion only
  in matters which fall outside the legislative competence
  of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi or in respect of
  matters of which powers are entrusted or delegated to
  him by the President or where he is required by law to
  act in his discretion or to exercise any judicial or
  quasi-judicial functions and, therefore, it is clear that the
  Lieutenant Governor cannot exercise his discretion in each
  and every matter and by and large, his discretionary powers
  are limited to the three matters over which the legislative
  power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly stands excluded by
  clause (3)(a) of Article 239-AA.
</p>
<p id="p_114">253. Another important provision is <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_106">Section 49</a> of the 1991 Act
which falls under Part V of the Act titled “Miscellaneous and
Transitional Provisions” and stipulates the relation of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                    33</span>

       Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers to the President. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_107">Section
       49</a> reads thus:
</p>
<p id="p_115">         “49. Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers
         to President.—Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
         Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers shall be
         under the general control of, and comply with such particular
         directions, if any, as may from time-to-time be given by the
         President.”

       "254. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_108">Section 49</a> of the 1991 Act discloses that the set-up in NCT
       of Delhi is one where the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
       Minister on one hand and the Lieutenant Governor on the other
       are a team, a pair on a bicycle built for two with the President as
       its rider who retains the general control. Needless to say, the
       President, while exercising this general control, acts as per
       the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers.”


</p><p id="p_116">20)    We would now like to reproduce, in entirety, the conclusions which

  the majority judgment arrived at. These are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "The conclusions in seriatim

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       284. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we record our conclusions
       in seriatim:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       284.1. While interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, the
       safe and most sound approach for the constitutional courts to
       adopt is to read the words of the Constitution in the light of the
       spirit of the Constitution so that the quintessential democratic
       nature of our Constitution and the paradigm of representative
       participation by way of citizenry engagement are not annihilated.
       The courts must adopt such an interpretation which glorifies the
       democratic spirit of the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">       284.2. In a democratic republic, the collective who are the
       sovereign elect their law-making representatives for enacting laws
       and shaping policies which are reflective of the popular will. The
       elected representatives being accountable to the public must be
       accessible, approachable and act in a transparent manner. Thus,
       the elected representatives must display constitutional objectivity
       as a standard of representative governance which neither
       tolerates ideological fragmentation nor encourages any utopian
       fantasy, rather it lays stress on constitutional ideologies.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                              34</span>

<p id="p_117">284.3. Constitutional morality, appositely understood, means the
morality that has inherent elements in the constitutional norms
and the conscience of the Constitution. Any act to garner
justification must possess the potentiality to be in harmony with
the constitutional impulse. In order to realise our constitutional
vision, it is indispensable that all citizens and high functionaries in
particular inculcate a spirit of constitutional morality which negates
the idea of concentration of power in the hands of a few.

284.4. All the three organs of the State must remain true to the
Constitution by upholding the trust reposed by the Constitution in
them. The decisions taken by constitutional functionaries and the
process by which such decisions are taken must have normative
reasonability and acceptability. Such decisions, therefore, must be
in accord with the principles of constitutional objectivity and
symphonious with the spirit of the Constitution.

284.5. The Constitution being the supreme instrument envisages
the concept of constitutional governance which has, as its twin
limbs, the principles of fiduciary nature of public power and the
system of checks and balances. Constitutional governance, in
turn, gives birth to the requisite constitutional trust which must be
exhibited by all constitutional functionaries while performing their
official duties.
</p>
<p id="p_118">284.6. Ours is a parliamentary form of Government guided by the
principle of collective responsibility of the Cabinet. The Cabinet
owes a duty towards the legislature for every action taken in any
of the Ministries and every individual Minister is responsible for
every act of the Ministry. This principle of collective responsibility
is of immense significance in the context of “aid and advice”. If a
well-deliberated legitimate decision of the Council of Ministers is
not given effect to due to an attitude to differ on the part of the
Lieutenant Governor, then the concept of collective responsibility
would stand negated.
</p><p id="p_119">284.7. Our Constitution contemplates a meaningful orchestration
of federalism and democracy to put in place an egalitarian social
order, a classical unity in a contemporaneous diversity and a
pluralistic milieu in eventual cohesiveness without losing identity.
Sincere attempts should be made to give full-fledged effect to
both these concepts.
</p><p id="p_120">284.8. The constitutional vision beckons both the Central and the
State Governments alike with the aim to have a holistic edifice.
Thus, the Union and the State Governments must embrace a
collaborative federal architecture by displaying harmonious
coexistence and interdependence so as to avoid any possible
constitutional discord. Acceptance of pragmatic federalism and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                               35</span>

achieving federal balance has become a necessity requiring
disciplined wisdom on the part of the Union and the State
Governments by demonstrating a pragmatic orientation.
284.9. The Constitution has mandated a federal balance wherein
independence of a certain required degree is assured to the State
Governments. As opposed to centralism, a balanced federal
structure mandates that the Union does not usurp all powers and
the States enjoy freedom without any unsolicited interference from
the Central Government with respect to matters which exclusively
fall within their domain.
</p><p id="p_121">284.10. There is no dearth of authorities with regard to the
method and approach to be embraced by constitutional courts
while interpreting the constitutional provisions. Some lay more
emphasis on one approach over the other, while some emphasise
that a mixed balance resulting in a unique methodology shall
serve as the best tool. In spite of diverse views on the said
concept, what must be kept primarily in mind is that the
Constitution is a dynamic and heterogeneous instrument, the
interpretation of which requires consideration of several factors
which must be given their due weightage in order to come up with
a solution harmonious with the purpose with which the different
provisions were introduced by the Framers of the Constitution or
Parliament.
</p><p id="p_122">284.11. In the light of the contemporary issues, the purposive
method has gained importance over the literal approach and the
constitutional courts, with the vision to realise the true and
ultimate purpose of the Constitution not only in letter but also in
spirit and armed with the tools of ingenuity and creativity, must not
shy away from performing this foremost duty to achieve
constitutional functionalism by adopting a pragmatic approach. It
is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to the functionalism of
the Constitution which we call constitutional pragmatism. The
spirit and conscience of the Constitution should not be lost in
grammar and the popular will of the people which has its
legitimacy in a democratic set-up cannot be allowed to lose its
purpose in simple semantics.
</p><p id="p_123">284.12. In the light of the ruling of the nine-Judge Bench
in <a href="/doc/50919315/" id="a_109">NDMC [NDMC v. State of Punjab</a>, (1997) 7 SCC 339] , it is
clear as noonday that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi
can be accorded the status of a State under our present
constitutional scheme. The status of NCT of Delhi is sui generis, a
class apart, and the status of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is
not that of a Governor of a State, rather he remains an
Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of
Lieutenant Governor.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                             36</span><p id="p_124">

284.13. With the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_110">Article 239-AA</a> by virtue of the
Sixty-ninth Amendment, Parliament envisaged a representative
form of Government for NCT of Delhi. The said provision intends
to provide for the Capital a directly elected Legislative Assembly
which shall have legislative powers over matters falling within the
State List and the Concurrent List, barring those excepted, and a
mandate upon the Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers except when he decides to refer
the matter to the President for final decision.
284.14. The interpretative dissection of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_111">Article 239-AA(3)(a)</a>
reveals that Parliament has the power to make laws for the
National Capital Territory of Delhi with respect to any matters
enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List. At the same
time, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the power to
make laws over all those subjects which figure in the Concurrent
List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State List.
284.15. A conjoint reading of clauses (3)(a) and (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_112">Article
239-AA</a> divulges that the executive power of the Government of
NCTD is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi
Legislative Assembly and, accordingly, the executive power of the
Council of Ministers of Delhi spans over all subjects in the
Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State
List. However, if Parliament makes law in respect of certain
subjects falling in the State List or the Concurrent List, the
executive action of the State must conform to the law made
by Parliament.
</p><p id="p_125">284.16. As a natural corollary, the Union of India has exclusive
executive power with respect to NCT of Delhi relating to the three
matters in the State List in respect of which the power of the Delhi
Legislative Assembly has been excluded. In respect of other
matters, the executive power is to be exercised by the
Government of NCT of Delhi. This, however, is subject to the
proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_113">Article 239-AA(4)</a> of the Constitution. Such an
interpretation would be in consonance with the concepts of
pragmatic federalism and federal balance by giving the
Government of NCT of Delhi some required degree of
independence subject to the limitations imposed by the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_126">284.17. The meaning of “aid and advise” employed in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_114">Article
239-AA(4)</a> has to be construed to mean that the Lieutenant
Governor of NCT of Delhi is bound by the aid and advice of
the Council of Ministers and this position holds true so long
as the Lieutenant Governor does not exercise his power under
the proviso to clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_115">Article 239-AA.</a> The Lieutenant
Governor has not been entrusted with any independent
decision-making power. He has to either act on the “aid and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                             37</span>

advice” of Council of Ministers or he is bound to implement
the decision taken by the President on a reference being made
by him.
</p><p id="p_127">284.18. The words “any matter” employed in the proviso to clause
(4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_116">Article 239-AA</a> cannot be inferred to mean “every matter”.
The power of the Lieutenant Governor under the said proviso
represents the exception and not the general rule which has to be
exercised in exceptional circumstances by the Lieutenant
Governor keeping in mind the standards of constitutional trust and
morality, the principle of collaborative federalism and
constitutional balance, the concept of constitutional governance
and objectivity and the nurtured and cultivated idea of respect for
a representative Government. The Lieutenant Governor should
not act in a mechanical manner without due application of mind so
as to refer every decision of the Council of Ministers to the
President.
</p><p id="p_128">284.19. The difference of opinion between the Lieutenant
Governor and the Council of Ministers should have a sound
rationale and there should not be exposition of the phenomenon
of an obstructionist but reflection of the philosophy of affirmative
constructionism and profound sagacity and judiciousness.
284.20. The Transaction of Business Rules, 1993 stipulate the
procedure to be followed by the Lieutenant Governor in case of
difference between him and his Ministers. The Lieutenant
Governor and the Council of Ministers must attempt to settle any
point of difference by way of discussion and dialogue. By
contemplating such a procedure, the 1993 TBR suggest that the
Lieutenant Governor must work harmoniously with his Ministers
and must not seek to resist them at every step of the way. The
need for harmonious resolution by discussion is recognised
especially to sustain the representative form of governance as
has been contemplated by the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_117">Article 239-AA.
284.21.</a> The scheme that has been conceptualised by the
insertion of Articles 239-AA and 239-AB read with the provisions
of the GNCTD Act, 1991 and the corresponding the 1993 TBR
indicates that the Lieutenant Governor, being the administrative
head, shall be kept informed with respect to all the decisions
taken by the Council of Ministers. The terminology “send a copy
thereof to the Lieutenant Governor”, “forwarded to the Lieutenant
Governor”, “submitted to the Lieutenant Governor” and “cause to
be furnished to the Lieutenant Governor” employed in the said
Rules leads to the only possible conclusion that the decisions of
the Council of Ministers must be communicated to the Lieutenant
Governor but this does not mean that the concurrence of the
Lieutenant Governor is required. The said communication is
imperative so as to keep him apprised in order to enable him to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                    38</span>

       exercise the power conferred upon him under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_118">Article 239-AA(4)</a>
       and the proviso thereof.
</p><p id="p_129">       284.22. The authorities in power should constantly remind
       themselves that they are constitutional functionaries and they
       have the responsibility to ensure that the fundamental purpose of
       administration is the welfare of the people in an ethical manner.
       There is requirement of discussion and deliberation. The fine
       nuances are to be dwelled upon with mutual respect. Neither of
       the authorities should feel that they have been lionised. They
       should feel that they are serving the constitutional norms, values
       and concepts.
</p><p id="p_130">       284.23. Fulfilment of constitutional idealism ostracising anything
       that is not permissible by the language of the provisions of the
       Constitution and showing veneration to its sense, spirit and
       silence is constitutional renaissance. It has to be remembered that
       our Constitution is a constructive one. There is no room for
       absolutism. There is no space for anarchy. Sometimes it is
       argued, though in a different context, that one can be a “rational
       anarchist”, but the said term has no entry in the field of
       constitutional governance and rule of law. The constitutional
       functionaries are expected to cultivate the understanding of
       constitutional renaissance by realisation of their constitutional
       responsibility and sincere acceptance of the summon to be
       obeisant to the constitutional conscience with a sense of
       reawakening to the vision of the great living document so as to
       enable true blossoming of the constitutional ideals. The
       Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers headed by the
       Chief Minister are to constantly remain alive to this idealism.

</p><p id="p_132">21)    The lucid and equally well considered opinions have been

  rendered by Justice Dhananjay Y. Chandrachud and one of us (Justice

  Ashok Bhushan) which are substantially on the same lines as the

  majority opinion. There is, however, a slight difference in approach and

  to some extent discordant note is expressed in the opinion of Justice

  Ashok Bhushan. We would advert to these opinions and as well as the

  area of difference at the appropriate stage.

  Ratio of the Judgment:
</p>
<p id="p_134">22)    There is some dispute as to the exact ratio laid down in the

  judgment of the Constitution Bench as well as the precise principles set

  out therein.   As per the the appellants, the Constitution Bench has

  accepted that in a democratic setup where a Government is formed on

  the basis of elections by the people, it is that Government, through

  Council of Ministers, which has the right to govern.        Accepting this

  fundamental principle as enshrined in the Constitution, the Constitution

  Bench has recognised that Legislative Assembly for NCTD has the

  power to make laws for the whole or any part of the NCTD, with respect

  to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent

  List. The only exclusion where the Legislative Assembly of NCTD is

  debarred from making laws, are the subject matters of Entries 1, 2 and

  18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65, 66 of the State List insofar as

  these Entries related to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18. The CB judgment

  specifically addressed the issue of the executive power of the GNCTD,

  viz., whether it is co-extensive with the legislative power. To that extent,

  the principle of such co-extensive executive power, which is recognised

  for the Union/Central Government as well as State Governments, has

  been accepted in the case of GNCTD as well. Thus, in this hue, the

  Constitution Bench has also accepted that the Lieutenant Governor is to

  act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in all his acts,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                    40</span>

  except those functions where the Lieutenant Governor is permitted to

  exercise his own discretion.
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">23)    Since this executive power is co-extensive with legislate power, the

  appellants emphasised before us that the Constitution Bench has

  categorically held that this power extends over all the subjects except

  three subjects in the State List, i.e., Entries 1, 2 and 18. The executive

  power also extends to all subjects in the Concurrent List. The appellants

  also submitted that this executive power is to the exclusion of the

  executive power of the Union with respect to such matters, meaning

  thereby such power exclusively vests with the GNCTD.


</p><p id="p_137">24)    The aforesaid manner of reading the Constitution Bench judgment

  is disputed by the respondents. Insofar as legislative domain of the

  Legislative Assembly of Delhi is concerned, though the respondents

  accept that the Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws in

  respect of all the Entries in List II except matters with respect to Entries

  1,2 and 18 and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of List II insofar as they relate to

  said Entries 1, 2 and 18 and also power to legislate in respect of subject

  matters contained in the Concurrent List (List III).        However, their

  submission is that this power is not exclusive to the Legislative

  Assembly of Delhi. On the contrary,         the power of the Union, i.e.,

  Parliament to legislate on any entries of List II as well as List III remains
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                  41</span>

  intact. Further, wherever Union has exercised the power by making laws

  in respect of any such subject matter, it is the Union’s law which shall

  prevail in case of any repugnancy in the light of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_119">Article 246</a> of the

  Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_138">
</p><p id="p_139">25)     Insofar as executive power of the GNCTD is concerned, the

  submission of the respondents is that though the Constitution Bench has

  held that such executive power is co-extensive with the legislative

  power, but it has nowhere held that such a power is exclusively

  conferred upon the GNCTD, i.e., to the exclusion of the Union. Here

  also, according to the respondents, power of the Union remains intact,

  which is clear from the plain language of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_120">Article 239AA</a> of the

  Constitution itself.
</p>
<p id="p_140">
</p><p id="p_141">26)     The detailed submissions which were made by M/s. C.A.

  Sundaram, Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh, learned Senior

  Counsel who appeared for Union of India in different appeals are of the

  following nature:
</p>
<p id="p_142">
</p><p id="p_143">27)     It is submitted that two primary contentions had been raised on

  behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi before the Delhi High Court as

  well as before this Court. It had been contended that:-

</p><p id="p_144">  (i)   Article 239 has no applicability whatsoever in the case of NCT of

  Delhi; and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                     42</span>

</p><p id="p_145">  (ii)   NCT Delhi deserves to be treated as a State and not as a Union

  Territory because it has an elected Council of Ministers like any other

  State.
</p>
<p id="p_146">
</p><p id="p_147">28)      It is argued that the above-mentioned contentions had been raised

  on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi only with a view to claim

  exclusive Executive jurisdiction in relation to Entries in List II and List III

  of the 7th Schedule of the constitution of India (except matters with

  respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66

  of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries a, 2 and 18). This

  claim was founded on its basic contention that since there is an elected

  Council of Ministers in NCT Delhi, it should be treated as equivalent to a

  State. It was in support of this contention raised by GNCTD that the

  prayer for non-applicability of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_121">Article 239</a> in the case of NCT Delhi had

  also been made.
</p>
<p id="p_148">
</p><p id="p_149">29)      On the other hand, on behalf of the Union of India, it had been

  contended before this Court that the Scheme in the Constitution of India

  envisages at the threshold – vestige of executive power in the President

  of India under <a href="/doc/1597349/" id="a_122">Article 53</a> of the Constitution of India to be exercised by

  the President on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers. It

  is only after the vestige of the executive power takes place under <a href="/doc/1597349/" id="a_123">Article

  53</a> of the Constitution of India that the subsequent provisions of <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_124">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                    43</span>

  73</a> and <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_125">Article 246</a> define the extent of Executive and Legislative powers

  of the Union by dividing the Entries in the 3 Lists of the 7 th Schedule,

  between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other. In the

  same manner, the provision of <a href="/doc/1471143/" id="a_126">Article 152</a> applies the same rule of

  vesting of the executive power in relation to all items mentioned in List II

  of the 7th Schedule, in the Governor of any State to be exercised by the

  Council of Ministers of the said State Government. In other words, it

  had been submission of both Government of NCT of Delhi and Union of

  India before the constitution Bench of this court that unless and until this

  Court accepts the claim of the Government of NCT of Delhi that NCT

  Delhi would deserve to be treated as a State, the claim that Exclusive

  Executive Jurisdiction in relation to all items in List II (except matters

  with respect of Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65

  and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18

  would vest in NCT Delhi – could not be accepted and would deserve to

  be rejected.   It is argued that the claim of GNCTD that a ‘State’ is

  specifically rejected by the Constitution Bench.


</p><p id="p_150">30)    Further, having regard to the critical fact of the NCT Delhi being the

  National Capital and all eventual responsibilities rest on the shoulders of

  the Union Government, the President of India shall continue to exercise

  Exclusive Executive Jurisdiction with regard to Item Nos. 1, 2 and 18 of

  the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                          44</span>

      to the said Entries e,w and 18 and shall continue to possess the

      non-exclusive executive jurisdiction in relation to all other entries in List

      II as well as List III of the Seventh Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_151">
</p><p id="p_152">    31)       The respondents further argued that there are three prominent

      features of the judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_127">Rai Sahib Ram

      Jawaya Kapur &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab3</a>. Those prominent three

      features are:-
</p>
<p id="p_153">      (i)     There has to be a vestige of executive power in any Government

      before it makes any claim to exercise the said executive power before

      framing of any legislation. It paragraphs 12 and 14 of the said judgment

      in Ram Jawaya Kapur’s case, this Court has referred to the vestige of

      executive power in the President of India under <a href="/doc/1597349/" id="a_128">Article 53</a> and in the

      Governor of each State under <a href="/doc/1471143/" id="a_129">Article 152</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_154">      (ii)    Having considered the above-mentioned aspect of vestige of

      executive power in the Government, this Court held that with reference

      to all the Entries in List I, the Union Government shall have the

      Exclusive Executive Jurisdiction co-extensive with the legislative power

      and would be able to exercise the said executive power without framing

      any legislation.    Similarly, the State shall have executive power in

      relation to subjects in List II and List III of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_155">      (iii)   However, once the Parliament and/or any State Legislature frames


3                  AIR 1995 SC 549
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                    45</span>

  any legislation, the executive power of the respective governments shall

  be strictly in accordance with the provisions of any said legislation. [Para

  12 of the judgment in Ram Jawaya Kapur]


</p><p id="p_156">32)    The above-mentioned third proposition as has been held by this

  Court in Ram Jawaya Kapur’s judgment, has been reiterated in various

  subsequent judgments of this Court including in the judgment of the

  Constitution Bench of this court in the present case on July 04, 2018

  where the following dictum had been incorporated:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       "……..277 ….(xv)…..However, if the Parliament makes law in
       respect of certain subjects falling in the State List or the
       Concurrent List, the executive action of the State must conform to
       the law made by the Parliament…….”


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">33)    The respondents point out that in all the three opinions constituting

  the judgment dated July 04, 2018, this Court has specifically and

  categorically rejected both the above-mentioned contentions raised on

  behalf of the NCT Delhi and has categorically held that <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_130">Article 239</a>

  continues to apply to NCT Delhi and further that NCT Delhi is not a State

  but continues to remain a Union Territory. Reference in this regard may

  be made to the following paras:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       "196. <a href="/doc/50919315/" id="a_131">Thus, NDMC [NDMC v. State of Punjab</a>, (1997) 7 SCC 339]
       makes it clear as crystal that all Union Territories under our
       constitutional scheme are not on the same pedestal and as far as
       NCT of Delhi is concerned, it is not a State within the meaning of
       <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_132">Article 246</a> or Part VI of the Constitution. Though NCT of Delhi
       partakes a unique position after the Sixty-ninth Amendment, yet in
       sum and substance, it remains a Union Territory which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                               46</span>

governed by <a href="/doc/493558/" id="a_133">Article 246(4)</a> of the Constitution and to which
Parliament, in the exercise of its constituent power, has given the
appellation of the “National Capital Territory of Delhi”.

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">                          xx        xx   xx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">201. In the light of the aforesaid analysis and the ruling of the
nine-Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/50919315/" id="a_134">NDMC [NDMC v. State of Punjab</a>, (1997) 7
SCC 339] , it is clear as noonday that by no stretch of imagination,
NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under our
present constitutional scheme and the status of the Lieutenant
Governor of Delhi is not that of a Governor of a State, rather he
remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the
designation of Lieutenant Governor.

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">Authored by Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud:
</blockquote><p id="p_157"><a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_135">The Government of Union Territories Act</a>, 1963
</p><p id="p_158">373. On 10-5-1963, the <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_136">Government of Union Territories Act</a>, 1963
was enacted. The 1963 Act defined the expression “Administrator”
in Section 2(1)(a) as:
</p><p id="p_159">  “2. (1)(a) “Administrator” means the administrator of a
  Union Territory appointed by the President under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_137">Article
  239</a>;”

"<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_138">Section 3</a> provided for a Legislative Assembly. <a href="/doc/755307/" id="a_139">Section 18</a>
provided for the extent of legislative power in the following terms:

  “18. Extent of legislative power.—(1) Subject to the
  provisions of this Act, the Legislative Assembly of the Union
  Territory may make laws for the whole or any part of the
  Union Territory with respect to any of the matters
  enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List in the
  Seventh Schedule to the Constitution insofar as any such
  matter is applicable in relation to Union Territories.

  (2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall derogate from the powers
  conferred on Parliament by the Constitution to make laws
  with respect to any matter for the Union Territory or any part
  thereof.”

Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/755307/" id="a_140">Section 18</a> was similar in language to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_141">Article
239-AA(3)(a</a>), without the exclusion of matters relating to Entries
1, 2 and 18 and Entries 64, 65 and 66. Sub-section (2) was similar
in language to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_142">Article 239-AA(3)(b).</a> <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_143">Section 21</a> provided that if
there was any inconsistency between a law made by Parliament
and a law made by the Legislative Assembly, the law made by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                              47</span>

Parliament would prevail to the extent of repugnancy [this
provision is similar in nature to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_144">Article 239-AA(3)(c)].</a>

</p><p id="p_160">453. The judgment of the majority also holds that all Union
Territories are not situated alike. The first category consists of
Union Territories which have no legislature at all. The second
category has legislatures created by a law enacted by Parliament
under the <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_145">Government of Union Territories Act</a>, 1963. The third
category is Delhi which has “special features” under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_146">Article
239-AA.</a> Though the Union Territory of Delhi “is in a class by
itself”, it “is certainly not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_147">Article 246</a>
or Part VI of the Constitution”. Various Union Territories — the
Court observed — are in different stages of evolution. However,
the position remains that these Union Territories, including the
NCT are yet Union Territories and not a State.
</p>
<p id="p_161">Authored by Justice Ashok Bhushan:
</p><p id="p_162">559. After examining the constitutional scheme delineated by
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_148">Article 239-AA</a>, another constitutional principle had been laid
down by the Constitution Bench that Union Territories are
governed by <a href="/doc/493558/" id="a_149">Article 246(4)</a> notwithstanding their differences in
respective set-ups and Delhi, now called the “National Capital
Territory of Delhi” is yet a Union Territory. The Constitution Bench
had also recognised that the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class
by itself, certainly not a State. Legislative power of Parliament was
held to cover Union Territories including Delhi.

</p><p id="p_163">583. The submission of the appellants that proviso to clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_150">Article 239-AA</a> envisages an extreme and unusual situation and is
not meant to be a norm, is substantially correct. The exercise of
power under the proviso cannot be a routine affair and it is only in
cases where the Lieutenant Governor on due consideration of a
particular decision of the Council of Ministers/Ministers, decides to
make a reference so that the decision be not implemented. The
overall exercise of administration of the Union Territory is
conferred on the President, which is clear from the provisions
contained in Part VIII of the Constitution. Although, it was
contended by the appellant that <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_151">Article 239</a> is not applicable with
regard to NCTD after <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_152">Article 239-AA</a> has been inserted in the
Constitution. The above submission cannot be accepted on
account of the express provisions which are mentioned under
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_153">Article 239-AA</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_154">Article 239-AB</a> itself. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_155">Article 239-AA</a> clause (1)
itself contemplates that Administrator appointed under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_156">Article 239</a>
shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor. Thus the
Administrator appointed under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_157">Article 239</a> is designated as the
Lieutenant Governor. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_158">Article 239-AB</a> is also applicable to NCTD.
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_159">Article 239-AB</a> in turn refers to any apply <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_160">Article 239.</a> The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                     48</span>

       provisions contained in Part VIII of the Constitution have to be
       looked into in its entirety. Thus, all the provisions of Part VIII have
       to be cumulatively read while finding out the intention of the
       Constitution-makers, which makes it clear that <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_161">Article 239</a> is also
       applicable to NCTD.”


</p><p id="p_164">34)    From the above, contention raised is that the necessary and

  inevitable position which emerges is that when in paragraph 217, 218

  and 219, the majority judgment, acknowledged the exclusive Executive

  jurisdiction of the Union Government in relation to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of

  List II (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the

  said Entries 1,2 and 18) of the Seventh Schedule, this Court did not and

  could not have held that “exclusive” executive jurisdiction vests with the

  Government of NCT of Delhi in relation to all other entries in List II of the

  Seventh Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_165">
</p><p id="p_166">35)    On the contrary, argued the appellants, this Court has held the

  existence and vestige of non-exclusive Executive Jurisdiction in relation

  to the remaining entries of List II that of List III for NCTD, since this

  court has categorically held that NCTD is a Union Territory and not a

  State, <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_162">Article 239</a> continues to apply in relation to NCTD and further the

  same principle of Ram Jawaya Kapur of co-extensive executive power

  with the legislative power of any Government also applies to the Union

  government in relation to the Union Territory of NCTD.


</p><p id="p_167">36)    After highlighting the above aspect, submission on behalf of Union
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                         49</span>

      of India/Lieutenant Governor is that the true and correct scope and

      interpretation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_163">Article 239AA</a> in relation to NCTD in the entire

      constitutional scheme (and as laid down in the judgment dated July 04,

      217, 218 and 219 of the majority judgment), brings into existence the

   37)       It is also submitted that it is neither compatible nor can the

</pre><p id="p_169">      argument co-exist that even when the Constitution Bench categorically

      rejected the contentions of Government of NCTD, including the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                     50</span>

  contention that it is a State and <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_164">Article 239</a> would not apply in the case of

  NCT Delhi, it can still be said that Government of NCTD would possess

  the exclusive Executive jurisdiction in relation to all Entries in List II

  (except matters with respect to Entries 1,2 and 18 of the State List and

  Entries 64,65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries

  1,2 and 18) of the Seventh Schedule. Such a contention would lead to

  an anomalous reading of the judgment dated July 04, 2018 passed by

  the Constitution Bench of this court and would deserve rejection by this

  Court.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171">38)    It is further submitted that the intention of Parliament to confer

  overriding executive powers to the Central Government is evident from

  the provisions of <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_165">Section 49</a> of the 1991 Act which empowers the

  President to exercise general control and to issue directions to the

  Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_166">Section 52</a> stipulates

  that all contracts relating to the administration of the Capital are made in

  exercise of the executive power of the Union and suits and proceedings

  in connection with the administration can be instituted by or against the

  Union Government. Reliance is placed on paras 86 ad 87 of the opinion

  authored by Justice D.Y., Chandrachud, which are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">       "86. <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_167">Section 49</a> establishes the principle of the “general control” of
       the President over the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of
       Ministers:</blockquote><p id="p_172">
</p><p id="p_173">         “49. Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers
         to Presi-dent.—Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the

  under the general control of, and comply with such particular
  directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by the
  President.”

"As an incident of control, the Lieutenant Governor and Council of
Ministers must comply with the particular directions issued by the
President. Such directions are obviously issued on the aid and
advice of the Union Council of Ministers.
</p>
<p id="p_174"><a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_168">Section 52</a> stipulates that all contracts relating to the
administration of the Capital are made in exercise of the executive
power of the Union and suits and proceedings in connection with
the administration can be instituted by or against the Union
Government.
</p>
<p id="p_175">87. This survey of the provisions of the GNCTD Act, 1991 indicates
that there is a significant interface between the President and the
Lieutenant Governor in matters relating to the administration of
the Capital. The Lieutenant Governor has been conferred with
certain specific powers by the provisions of the Act including,
among them, requirements of seeking the prior recommendation
of the President to the introduction of financial Bills. As we have
seen, the Lieutenant Governor has been subjected to a wider
obligation to reserve Bills for the consideration of the President
and in regard to withholding of his assent to a Bill which has been
passed by the Legislative Assembly in comparison with the duties
of a Governor of a State. Matters such as the presentation of the
annual financial statement or supplementary, additional or excess
grants require previous sanction of the President. The President
has been conferred with the power to issue directions in regard to
the official language of the National Capital Territory. The
Lieutenant Governor has been vested with the power to act in his
own discretion in matters which fall outside the ambit and power
of the Legislative Assembly and which have been delegated to
him by the President as well as in regard to those matters where
he is required under law to exercise his own discretion or to act in
exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Rules for the
Conduct of Business are framed by the President in relation to the
National Capital Territory, including for the allocation of business.
They would include the procedure to be followed where there is a
difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the
Council of Ministers. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_169">Section 49</a>, which has a non obstante
provision, subjects the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of
Ministers to the general control of the President and to such
directions as may be issued from time to time.”

       any provision of this Constitution relating to High Courts…..”


</p><p id="p_179">40)    On the strength of these provisions it is argued that it is abundantly

  clear that in the case of States, the Constitution envisages that in a case

  of failure of constitutional machinery, the President (i.e., the Union

  Executive) shall ‘assume to himself” the functions of the State

  Government and the powers vested in the Governor. However, in the

  case of Union Territory of Delhi, since the executive power remains

  vested in the President and there is no independent exclusive vestage of

  executive power in the Council of Ministers of NCTD – there was neither

  any occasion nor any requirement for the Constitution makers to provide

  for in the provisions of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_173">Article 239AB</a> – any “assumption of functions” by

  the Union Executive since the executive power vests in the Union

  Executive itself.   Since there is never any exclusive vestage in the

  Council of Ministers of NCT Delhi, there is no need to assume/take it

  back by the President. Further, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_174">Article 239AB</a> provides that in the case

  of NCT of Delhi the President can suspend the operation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_175">Article

  239AA</a> even in a case where the President [i.e. the Union Executive] is

  satisfied that it is necessary to do so for proper administration of NCTD.


</p><p id="p_180">41)    In nutshell, submission on behalf of the Union of India is that when

  the judgment dated July 04, 2018 passed by the Constitution Bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                   54</span>

  comprising three separate opinions is read as a whole in the manner

  projected above and there is a harmonization of the three opinions to

  discern the law which has been laid down by this Court – the legal

  position projected by the respondents gets strengthened. As per the

  appellant, such a reading of the judgment dated July 04, 2018 would

  also be in consonance with the observation made in para 144 of the

  opinion authored by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, wherein it has been

  observed that there is a broad coalescence (“coming together to form

  one mass or whole; process of merger of two or more droplets of

  particles to become one single droplet”) between the view expressed in

  the three opinions in the said judgment dated 04.07.2018.


</p><p id="p_181">42)    We may record at this stage that Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi,

  learned Senior Advocate who appeared for the intervenor, Reliance

  Industries Limited supported the aforesaid stand taken by the Union of

  India. He also submitted that no exclusive executive power has been

  conferred upon the GNCTD, i.e, to the exclusion of the Central

  Government. He argued that the Scheme behind <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_176">Article 239AA</a> of the

  Constitution was ‘hybrid’ in nature relatable to Lists II and III. Detailed

  submission of Dr. Singhvi in this behalf would be taken note of while

  dealing with the issue pertaining to ACB.
</p>
<p id="p_182">
</p><p id="p_183">43)    We may point out at this stage that learned senior counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                   55</span>

  appearing for the Union of India have also argued, in the alternative, that

  if the interpretation suggested by them to the aforesaid judgment of the

  Constitution Bench is not acceptable, the matter needs to be referred to

  the Constitution Bench again. To put it differently, the submission is that

  if this Bench interprets that the Constitution Bench has held that the

  executive power conferred upon the GNCTD under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_177">Article 239AA</a> of the

  Constitution is to the exclusion of the power of the Union, then such an

  interpretation given by the Constitution Bench is contrary to the scheme

  of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_178">Article 239AA.</a> Efforts were made to show as to how such a view (if it

  is the view of the Constitution Bench) would be contrary to not only the

  constitutional scheme, but contrary to specific provisions of the GNCTD

  Act, 1991, particularly <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_179">Sections 44</a> as well as Rule 23 of the Transaction

  of Business Rules.     However, we are of the opinion that no such

  reference to the larger Bench is required and, therefore, we have not

  reproduced submissions of the learned senior counsel of Union of India

  on this aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_184">
</p><p id="p_185">44)    M/s. Kapil Sibal, P.C. Chidambaram, Shekhar Naphade and Ms.

  Indira Jaising argued the matter on behalf of NCTD, appearing in

  different appeals. Insofar as the aforesaid interpretation suggested by

  learned counsel appearing for the Union of India is concerned, a strong

  refutation on behalf of the NCTD is that the judgment, in no uncertain

  terms, holds that the executive power of NCTD is co-extensive with its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                      56</span>

  legislative power.     According to them, the Constitution Bench has

  specifically held that this executive power pertains to all the Entries in

  List II, (except Entries 1, 2 and 18, which are specifically excluded), as

  well as all the Entries in the Concurrent List, i.e. List III. Such a power is

  ‘exclusive’ which belongs to GNCTD to the exclusion of the Central

  government. Specific reference was made to the discussion contained

  in paragraphs 217 to 219 as well as Conclusions (xv), (xvi) and (xvii) of

  the majority opinion.      Attention was also drawn to the discussions

  contained in paragraphs 174 to 176, 187 and 239 of the said judgment,

  which have already been reproduced above.
</p>
<p id="p_186">
</p><p id="p_187">45)     Expanding the proposition that the Constitution Bench has already

  held that apart from the three explicitly excluded Entries (i.e. Entries 1, 2

  and 18 in List II), the Delhi Assembly and GNCTD have legislative and

  executive powers over all other Entries in List II and III, it was argued

  that specific contention of the Union of India to the contrary was clearly

  repelled by the Constitution Bench. Submission in this behalf was that

  the majority judgment clearly records the submission of the Central

  Government in para 38 which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        "38. The respondents also contend that although <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_180">Article 239AA</a>
        confers on the Legislative Assembly of Delhi the power to legislate
        with respect to subject matters provided in List II and List III of the
        Seventh Schedule, yet the said power is limited by the very same
        Article when it employs the phrase “in sofaras any such matter is
        applicable to Union Territories...” and also by specifically
        excluding from the legislative power of the Assembly certain
        entries as delineated in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_181">Article 239AA(3)(a).</a> This restriction, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                      57</span>

        per the respondents, limits the power of the Legislative Assembly
        to legislate and this restriction has to be understood in the context
        of conferment of special status.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">46)     The above contention is answered specifically in para 214 of the

  majority judgment of the Constitution Bench, where it is held that the

  Delhi Assembly has Legislative Power with respect to all matters in the

  State and Concurrent List except “matters with respect to entries which

  have been explicitly excluded from <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_182">Article 239AA(3)(a)”.</a>              Thus, the

  contention of the Union of India was that matters in List II and List III can

  be excluded in two different ways, explicitly and implicitly, on account of

  use of the phrase “insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union

  Territories” and the Constitution Bench has negated that argument and

  held that power of the Delhi Assembly and Government spans over all

  subjects except what has been excluded explicitly.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_188">47)     The learned counsel also submitted that at least at seven other

  places,   the   majority   judgment      has   made     it   clear   that     Delhi

  Assembly/Government has Legislative/Executive Competence over all

  subjects except three subjects and as a corollary, the executive power of

  the Union Government in Delhi is limited to three excluded subjects in

  List II. These paragraphs are:
</p>
<p id="p_189">  (a)   In Para 199, it is observed that executive power of Delhi

  Government is co-terminus with executive power on “all but three

  subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List”.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                  58</span>

</p><p id="p_190">(b)   In Para 212, it is held that “sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_183">Article

239AA</a> establishes the power of Delhi Legislative Assembly to enact

laws for the NCT of Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the

State List and/or Concurrent List except insofar as matters with

respect to and which relate to entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List.”

</p><p id="p_191">(c)   Again, in Para 217, the Court held that on a conjoint reading of

clause 3(a) and clause 4 of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_184">Article 239AA</a>, it becomes clear that the

Delhi Government has executive power which extends over “all but

three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List”.

</p><p id="p_192">(d)   To the similar effect are the observation in Para 219 where the

Court observed that “Executive Power of the Union in respect of NCT of

Delhi is confined to the three matters in the State List for which the

Legislative Power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been excluded

under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_185">Article 239AA(3)(a)”.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_193">(e)   This is again reiterated in the conclusions contained in Para 277

</p><p id="p_194">(xiv), (xv) and (xvi) as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      "(xiv) The Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the power to
      make laws over all those subjects which figure in the concurrent
      list and all but three excluded subjects, in the State List”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">      (xv) The executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi
      spans over all subjects in the Concurrent List and all, but three
      excluded subjects, in the State list”.</blockquote><p id="p_195">

</p><p id="p_196">      (xvi) The Union of India has exclusive executive power with
      respect to the NCT of Delhi relating to the three matters in the
      State List in respect of which the power of the Delhi
      Legislative Assembly has been excluded.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                    59</span>

</p><p id="p_197">48)    This submission was sought to be supported from the concurring

  judgment of Justice Chandrachud (by referring to paras 127 to 130)

  which holds that the term “insofar as any such matter is applicable to a

  Union Territory” in not a terms of exclusion. Similarly, in paras 71 and 72

  of the judgment of Justice Bhushan, it has been held that the said

  phrase “is not exclusionary phrase but has been used to facilitate

  conferment of power on the Delhi Assembly even in respect of entry that

  begin with the term State”.
</p>
<p id="p_198">
</p><p id="p_199">49)    It was further submitted that reliance placed by the learned

  counsel appearing for the Union of India on Balakrishnan Committee

  report for interpreting the provisions of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_186">Article 239AA</a> was totally

  misconceived inasmuch as that aspect has already been considered in

  the judgment of the Constitution Bench.           It was argued that the

  Constitution Bench has interpreted the provisions of Articles 239, 239AA

  and 239AB as they apply to NCT of Delhi based on first principles of

  constitutionally mandated representative democracy, which is based on

  popular will.   The Constitution Bench has not been constrained by

  textual limitations in giving the interpretation. This is best stated in Para

  11 of the Constitution Bench judgment, the relevant portion of which

  reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">       "11. ...In the context of the case at hand, the democratic nature of
       our Constitution and the paradigm of representative participation
       are undoubtedly comprised in the “spirit of the Constitution”.
       While interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, the safe and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                     60</span>

       most sound approach is to read the words of the Constitution in
       light of the avowed purpose and spirit of the Constitution so that it
       does not result in an illogical outcome which would have never
       been the intention of the Constituent Assembly or the Parliament
       while exercising its constituent power. Therefore, a Constitutional
       Court, while adhering to the language employed in the provision,
       should not abandon the concept of the intention, spirit, the holistic
       approach and the constitutional legitimate expectation which
       combinedly project a magnificent facet of purposive interpretation.</blockquote><p id="p_200">
</p><p id="p_201">       The Court should pose a question to itself whether a straight,
       literal and textual approach would annihilate the sense of the
       great living document which is required to be the laser beam to
       illumine. If the answer is in the affirmative, then the constitutional
       courts should protect the sense and spirit of the Constitution
       taking aid of purposive interpretation as that is the solemn duty of
       the constitutional courts as final arbiters of the Constitution...”
                                                         (Emphasis Supplied)

</p><p id="p_202">50)    Thereafter, in para 15, some portions of the Balakrishnan

  Committee are extracted.        Then, in para 36, the Court notes the

  argument of the Union of India seeking literal/textual interpretation and

  reliance on Balakrishnan Report.         Similar reliance on Balakrishnan

  Report by the Union of India is noted in para 47.              Thereafter, the

  Constitution Bench from Page 45 to Page 135 has discussed the

  principles of constitutional interpretation that will be used to interpret

  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_187">Article 239AA.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_203">
</p><p id="p_204">51)    In the light of those principles, the Court thereafter has interpreted

  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_188">Article 239AA</a> and its various provisions.           Insofar as Balakrishnan

  Committee Report is concerned, it is not accepted as interpretative tool,

  as is clear from the following discussion:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">       "270. There can be no quarrel about the proposition that the
       reports of the Committee enacting a legislation can serve as an

</p><p id="p_206">       However, in the instant case, as we have elaborately dealt with
       the meaning to be conferred on the constitutional provision that

       the report of the Committee.”

</p><p id="p_207">52)    In this context, another submission of the learned counsel for the

  appellants was that, in fact, respondents were trying to re-argue the

  entire matter and attempt was to impress this Bench to depart from the

  view taken by the Constitution Bench, which was impermissible having

  regard to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_189">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution

  and in particular the proviso thereof, which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">       "<a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_190">Article 145(3):</a> The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for
       the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question
       of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the
       purpose of hearing any reference under <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_191">Article 143</a> shall be five:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">             Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any
       of the provisions of this chapter other than <a href="/doc/783690/" id="a_192">Article 132</a> consists of
       less than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the
       appeal the Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial
       question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the
       determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal,
       such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court
       constituted as required by this clause for the purpose of deciding
       any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of the
       opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion”


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">53)    The argument advanced is that after settling the legal position with

  respect to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_193">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution, the Constitution Bench has

  referred the matter back to this Bench for deciding individual cases.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_208">  This Bench was, therefore, to decide these individual issues in

  ‘conformity’ with the opinion of the Constitution Bench and, therefore, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                    62</span>

  was not open to the Union of India to re-argue the case.


</p><p id="p_209">54)    We have considered the aforesaid submissions with deep sense of

  sincerity, objectivity and also keeping in mind various specific issues that

  arise for determination in these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_210">
</p><p id="p_211">55)    Indubitably, NCTD was, and still remains, a Union Territory. This

  was held by a nine Judge Bench judgment in the NDMC case, which

  legal position is reiterated by the Constitution Bench in the instant case

  as well. However, in spite of NCTD being a Union Territory, it has been

  given special constitution status under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_194">Article 239AA.</a> Clause (1) of the

  said Article creates and recognises such a status. This status is to

  accord Legislative Assembly in NCTD with certain powers that are also

  rcognised in the same provision. The nature of Legislative Assembly is

  enumerated in clause (2)(a) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_195">Article 239AA</a> as per which seats in the

  Assembly are to be filled by the Members chosen by direction election.

  In this manner, even when NCTD remains a Union Territory, it is given a

  different status than other Union Territories in respect of which

  provisions of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_196">Article 239</a> apply. It is also different from the status given

  to Puducherry, another Union Territory which is governed by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_197">Article 239A</a>

  of the Constitution. Even for the Union Territory of Puducherry, provision

  is made for creation of Legislative Assembly. Such a power is given to

  the Parliament to enact this kind of law. In exercise of that power, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                    63</span>

  Parliament has enacted an Act which creates a Legislative Assembly

  which is partly elected and partly nominated. In contrast, conferment of

  status upon NCTD is by the Constitution itself and is not left to the

  Parliament. At the same time, NCTD remains a Union Territory and is

  not elevated to the status of a ‘State’ governed by Part VI of the

  Constitution (Articles 152 to 237). Thus, with the creation of Legislative

  Assembly as well as elected Government and conferment of all

  legislative and executive powers, concept of federalism has been

  incorporated in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_198">Article 239AA.</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_199">Article 239AA</a> has been interpreted by the

  Constitution Bench keeping in view this principle of federalism. All these

  aspects have been kept in view by the Constitution Bench while deciding

  the status of the NCTD as well as conferment of legislative and

  executive powers to the Legislative Assembly and GNCTD respectively.

  The CB judgment, therefore, has to be read keeping in view all these

  parameters as well as the constitutional principles adopted in

  interpreting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_200">Article 239AA.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_212">
</p><p id="p_213">56)     Insofar as legislative power of the NCTD is concerned, there is no

  dispute that it extends to all the subject matters contained in various

  Entries of List II with the specific exclusion of Entries 1, 2 and 18.

  Likewise, it extends to all the Entries in the Concurrent List, i.e. List III.

  At the same time, it is also an undisputed fact that power of the

  Parliament to legislate on any subject matter contained in List II is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                  64</span>

excluded. In fact, in respect of Union Territories, it is the Union, i.e. the

Parliament, which has the power to legislate on all subjects contained in

List II and List III. However, there is a conferment of such legislative

power upon the Legislative Assembly of NCTD as well. This power is

specifically conferred upon the Legislative Assembly under sub-clause

</p><p id="p_214">(a) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_201">Article 239AA(3).</a> Sub-clause (b) thereof, in no uncertain terms,

provides that conferment of powers upon Delhi Legislative Assembly

under sub-clause (a) shall not derogate the powers of Parliament under

the Constitution to make laws in with respect to any matter for a Union

Territory or any part thereof.    This sub-clause, therefore, retains the

supremacy of Parliament to make laws. What follows is that Parliament

has not only concurrent power in respect of List III, but in respect of List

II as well. Insofar as Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II are concerned, the

Parliament retains its exclusive domain on those subject matters. To

this extent, there is a departure from the principle of fedaralism

inasmuch as Parliament has no power to make any laws in respect of

the States for the matters enumerated in List II. Sub-clause (c) of clause

(3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_202">Article 239AA</a> takes care of the situation of repugnancy if it arises

between the law made by the Parliament and the Legislative Assembly

of NCTD. In that event, the law made by Parliament shall prevail and

the law made by Delhi Legislative Assembly, shall, to the extent of

repugnancy, be void. First proviso to sub-clause (c), however, saves law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                   65</span>

  made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi if law made by it has been

  reserved for the consideration of President and has received his assent.

  In that event, such law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi shall

  prevail in NCTD. Notwithstanding, second proviso thereto recognises

  the supremacy of the Parliament by giving it power to enact law with

  respect to same subject matter as the law made by the Delhi Legislative

  Assembly and it includes power to make law adding to, amending,

  varying or even repealing the law made by the Legislative Assembly.


</p><p id="p_215">57)    As mentioned earlier, insofar as this power of Parliament to make

  laws in respect of NCTD is concerned, there is no quarrel.          In this

  conspectus, we have to find as to whether the CB Judgment held that

  insofar as the executive power of GNCTD is concerned, it is to the

  exclusion of the Centre, or, as contended by the learned senior counsel

  appearing for the Union of India, such executive power given to Delhi

  Government is co-extensive with that of Central Government.


</p><p id="p_216">58)    It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the observations of the

  Constitution Bench, particularly the majority view, have to be discerned

  and given an appropriate meaning. Undoubtedly, the majority judgment

  in the Constitution Bench decides that the executive power of GNCTD is

  co-extensive with legislative power and it extends over all the subjects of

  the lis to accept subjects mentioned in Entries 1, 2 and 18 and it also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                   66</span>

extends to all subjects in List III.    This is the clear mandate of the

Constitution Bench. The controversy, however, is on the issue as to

whether such executive power of GNCTD is to the exclusion of the

power of the Union Government. In this behalf, it may be noted that the

majority judgment has held that such executive power of the Delhi

Government is to the exclusion of the executive power of the Union. On

the other hand, in a separate judgment rendered by one of us (Ashok

Bhushan, J.), it has been clearly held that the executive power of the

Union Government is co-extensive with that of the Delhi Government.

Discussion on this aspect, in the opinion of Ashok Bhushan, J., goes as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">     "84. The appellant relying on <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_203">Article 73</a> of the Constitution had
     submitted that <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_204">Article 73</a> lays down the principle that while there
     may exist under the Constitution concurrent legislative powers on
     two different federal units, there can never be any concurrent
     executive powers. It was further submitted that the above principle
     equally applies to matters listed in List II and List III of the
     Constitution of India for NCTD. Referring to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_205">Article 239-AA(3)(b</a>), it
     is contended that the said provision confers power on Parliament
     to enact legislations in matters in both State List and Concurrent
     Lists Such power is also available under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_206">Article 246.</a> However, it
     does not follow from the above that the said provision also confers
     executive powers in relation to matters in the State List and
     Concurrent List. It is further submitted that Parliament may by law
     confer executive powers in relation to matters in the Concurrent
     List on the Union Government for States, it may also do so in
     relation to NCTD. But, if such thing is not done, the Union
     Government will, as a general rule, have no executive powers in
     respect of matters under List II (except the excluded entries) and
     it is the GNCTD, which shall enjoy exclusive executive powers. We
     are of the view that the above interpretation as put up by the
     appellant on constitutional provisions cannot be accepted. The
     principle is well established that executive powers coexist with the
     legislative powers. Reference to <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_207">Article 73</a> has been made in this
     context, which need to be noted.<a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_208">Article 73</a> provides as follows:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                              67</span>


<p id="p_217">  “73. Extent of executive power of the Union.—(1) Subject
  to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of
  the Union shall extend—

</p><p id="p_218">  (a) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has
  power to make laws; and

</p><p id="p_219">  (b) to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as
  are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any
  treaty or agreement:
</p>
<p id="p_220">  Provided that the executive power referred to in sub-clause
</p><p id="p_221">  (a) shall not, save as expressly provided in this Constitution
  or in any law made by Parliament, extend in any State to
  matters with respect to which the legislature of the State has
  also power to make laws.
</p>
<p id="p_222">  (2) Until otherwise provided by Parliament, a State and any
  officer or authority of a State may, notwithstanding anything
  in this Article, continue to exercise in matters with respect to
  which Parliament has power to make laws for that State
  such executive power or functions as the State or officer or
  authority thereof could exercise immediately before the
  commencement of this Constitution.”

</p><p id="p_223">85. The proviso to <a href="/doc/1584119/" id="a_209">Article 73(1)</a> provides that the executive power
referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not, save as expressly provided
in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in
any State to matters with respect to which the legislature of the
State has also power to make laws. Obviously, the proviso refers
to the Concurrent List where both Parliament and State have
power to make laws. Executive power in reference to Concurrent
List has been deliberately excluded to avoid any duplicacy in
exercise of power by two authorities. <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_210">Article 73</a> as it stood prior to
the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 contained the
expression after the word State “specified in Part A or Part B of
the First Schedule”. Thus, the executive power was excluded of
the Union only with regard to Part A and Part B States alone.
Thus, when the Constitution was enforced, executive power of
Union in reference to Part C States was not excluded with regard
to Concurrent List also. Part C States having been substituted as
now by the Union Territories by the Constitution (Seventh
Amendment) Act. The word “State” in proviso to <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_211">Article 73</a> cannot
be read to include Union Territory. Reading the words “Union
Territory” within the word “State” in proviso to <a href="/doc/1584119/" id="a_212">Article 73(1)</a> shall
not be in accordance with Scheme of Part VIII (Union Territories)
of the Constitution. Union Territories are administered by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                             68</span>

President. Exercise of executive power of the Union through
President is an accepted principle with regard to Union Territories.
The above interpretation is also reinforced due to another reason.
Under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_213">Article 239-AA(4)</a> proviso, the Lieutenant Governor, in case
of difference of opinion, can make a reference to the President for
decision and has to act according to the decision given thereon.
The President, thus, with regard to a particular executive action,
which has been referred, has exclusive jurisdiction to take a
decision, which both Council of Ministers as well as Lieutenant
Governor has to follow. The provision does not indicate that power
of the President is confined only to executive actions which are
mentioned in List II. When the President, as provided by the
constitutional scheme, is entitled to take executive decision on
any matter irrespective of the fact whether such executive
decision taken by the Council of Ministers or Ministers related to
matters covered by List II and List III, the executive power to
Union through President cannot be confined to List II. Overriding
power to the Union even on the executive matters has to be
conceded to be there as per constitutional scheme. It is another
matter that for exercise of executive powers by the Union through
the President and by the Council of Ministers, headed by the
Chief Minister of NCTD, the Constitution itself indicates a scheme
which advances the constitutional objectives and provide a
mechanism for exercise of executive powers, which aspect shall
be, however, further elaborated while considering clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_214">Article 239-AA.</a> Legislative power of the Union is coextensive with
its executive power in relation to NCT is further indicated by the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/978436/" id="a_215">Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi
Act</a>, 1991. The insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_216">Article 239-AA</a> by the Constitution
Sixty-ninth Amendment has been followed by enactment of the
<a href="/doc/978436/" id="a_217">Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act</a>, 1991 which
Act was enacted by Parliament in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_218">Article
239-AA(7)(a)</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_219">Section 49</a> of the Act, 1991
provides as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_224">  “49. Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers
  to President.—Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the
  Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers shall be
  under the general control of, and comply with such particular
  directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by the
  President.”

</p><p id="p_225">86. Legislative power of the Union is exercised by the President
as per the constitutional scheme and <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_220">Section 49</a> itself indicates
that Parliament clearly envisaged the Council of Ministers and the
Lieutenant Governor shall be under the general control of, and
comply with such particular directions issued by the President
from time to time. The power of the President to issue direction is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                     69</span>

       not limited in any manner so as to put any restriction on the
       executive power of the Union.
</p>
<p id="p_226">       87. The President further is empowered under <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_221">Section 44</a> of the
       1991 Act to make rules for the allocation of business to the
       Ministers insofar as it is business with respect to which the
       Lieutenant Governor is required to act on the aid and advice of his
       Council of Ministers. As per <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_222">Article 239-AA</a> sub-clause (4) read
       with business rules, the manner and procedure of conduct of
       business including executive functions of GNCTD has to be
       administered. Although the Union ordinarily does not interfere with
       or meddle with the day-to-day functions of the GNCTD which is in
       tune with the constitutional scheme as delineated by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_223">Article
       239-AA</a> and to give meaning and purpose to the Cabinet form of
       Government brought in place in the National Capital of Territory.
       But as the overriding legislative power of Parliament is conceded
       in the constitutional scheme, overriding executive power has also
       to be conceded even though such power is not exercised by the
       Union in the day-to-day functioning of the GNCTD. We thus
       conclude that executive power of the Union is coextensive on all
       subjects referable to List I and List II on which Council of Ministers
       and NCTD has also executive powers.”


</p><p id="p_227">59)    Insofar as opinion of Chandrachud, J. is concerned, there is no

  categorical discussion on this aspect, though insofar as legislative power

  of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi is concerned, that has been

  recognised, which is in conformity with the other two opinions, the

  aspect of executive power of the Delhi Government has not been

  elaborated. Instead, there is a detailed discussion on the construction of

  the proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_224">Article 239AA(4).</a> As we have seen, clause (4) deals with

  the executive power of the Council of Ministers of GNCTD. Proviso

  thereto deals with the situation where there would be a difference of

  opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any

  matter. It provides that in such an eventuality the Lieutenant Governor is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                  70</span>

supposed to refer the matter to the President for decision and act

according to the decision given thereon by the President.          It gives

supremacy to the President in the matter of executive decisions.

Chandrachud, J. has noted that NCTD continues to be a Union Territory

and the Union Government has a special interest in the administration of

its affairs, which stands exemplified by the provisions of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_225">Article 239</a> and

Section 49 of the GNCTD Act.            Therefore, the provision to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_226">Article

239AA(4)</a> must be given an interpretation which is marked with a sense

of fine constitutional balance.        The balance which is drawn must

preserve the vital interest of the Union Government in the governance of

the National Capital while supporting the legitimacy and constitutional

status of the Council of Minister, which owes collective responsibility to

the Legislative Assembly and which, in its capacity of the executive arm

of the Government, tenders aid and advise to the Lieutenant Governor

under a cabinet form of governance. According to the learned Judge,

three lines of reasoning emerge in this behalf which are mentioned in

the opinion. The first line of interpretation would have the Court interpret

the expression ‘difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor

and his Council of Ministers on any of the matter’ without reservation or

qualification, which would be a purely literal or textual construction. In

this sense ‘any matter’ would mean any matter without restriction.

Second interpretation would be to read the aforesaid expression to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                   71</span>

  read and confined to specific categories. Third interpretation has two

  facets. As per the first facet, a reference can be made to the President

  only after the Lieutenant Governor has made an effort to resolve a

  difference with a Minister or with Council of Ministers by seeking a

  resolution through dialogue and discussion. This is to be done after

  following the procedure contained in the Transaction of Business Rules.

  Second facet relates to the substantive meaning of the expression ‘any

  matter’, which would not mean ‘every matter’ or ‘every trifling matter’ but

  only those rare and exceptional matters where the difference is so

  fundamental to the governance of the Union Territory that it deserves to

  be escalated to the President.
</p>
<p id="p_228">
</p><p id="p_229">60)    After suggesting the aforesaid three lines of interpretations, the

  judgment suggests that there is a kernel of substance in each of them,

  but pitfalls have to be avoided. It emphasises that the functioning of the

  institutions must establish a constitutional balance which facilitates

  cooperative governance.      Read in this way, the proviso has to be

  operated and applied in a manner which facilitates and does not obstruct

  the governance of NCTD. This judgment, thereafter, again emphasises

  that though Delhi has a special status, it continues to be a Union

  Territory. In that context, the nine Judge Bench decision in NDMC as

  well as the scheme contained in <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_227">Article 239</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_228">239AA</a> as well as the

  principle of repugnancy mentioned in <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_229">Article 254</a> of the Constitution are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                   72</span>

discussed. Discussion thereafter would be of some relevance and is,

therefore, reproduced below, verbatim:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">     "138...The principle of repugnancy which <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_230">Article 254</a> recognises
     between the Union and State legislation on matters in the
     Concurrent List is extended by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_231">Article 239-AA [(3)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1470645/" id="a_232">(3)(c</a>)],
     both with reference to State and Concurrent List subjects for NCT.
     Moreover, certain subjects have been expressly carved out from
     the ambit of the legislative authority of the Legislative Assembly
     and vested exclusively in Parliament. Executive powers of the
     Government of NCT being coextensive with legislative powers,
     the aid and advice which is tendered to the Lieutenant Governor
     by the Council of Ministers is confined to those areas which do not
     lie outside the purview of legislative powers. These provisions
     demonstrate that while adopting the institutions of a Cabinet form
     of Government, the Constitution has, for NCT, curtailed the ambit
     of the legislative and executive powers, consistent with its status
     as a Union Territory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">     139. The exercise of the constituent power to introduce <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_233">Article
     239-AA</a> was cognizant of the necessity to protect national
     interests inherent in the governance of a National Capital. A sense
     of permanence and stability was sought to be attributed to the
     arrangements made for governing Delhi by bringing in a
     constitutional amendment. Both in terms of the reach of the
     legislative power, as well as in relation to the exercise of executive
     power, the special constitutional arrangements for Delhi recognise
     that the governance of Delhi implicates a sense of national
     interest. When matters of national interest arise, they would
     predicate a predominant role for institutions of national
     governance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">     140. Consistent with the need to preserve national interest, it
     would not be appropriate to restrict the ambit of the proviso to
     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_234">Article 239-AA(4)</a> to situations where the action of the
     Government is ultra vires the limits of its executive powers. This
     becomes evident on a construction of the provisions of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_235">Section
     41(1)(i)</a> and Section 44(1)(a) of the GNCTD Act. Clause (i) of

     discretion on a matter which falls outside the purview of the

     which powers or functions are entrusted or delegated to him by
     the President. Under <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_237">Section 44(1)(a)</a>, Rules of Business are
     made on matters on which the Lieutenant Governor is required to
     act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_238">Section
     44(1)(a)</a> covers business which is not a part of <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_239">Section 41(1)(i)</a>.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                              73</span>

<p id="p_230">This is because matters which fall within <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_240">Section 44(1)(i)</a> are not
governed by the principle of aid and advice.
</p>
<p id="p_231">141. There is much to be said for not laying down an exhaustive
catalogue of situations to which the proviso applies. Governance
involves complexities. In the very nature of things, it would not be
possible for a court delivering judgment in the context of the
problems of the day to anticipate situations which may arise in
future. It would be unsafe to confine a constitutional provision to
stated categories which may affect the resilience of the
Constitution to deal with unforeseen situations. Some of the
illustrations which may warrant the exercise of the power under
the proviso may shed light on the purpose of the proviso and the
object which it seeks to achieve.
</p>
<p id="p_232">142. There are two constitutional perspectives: first, the operation
of the proviso should preserve the national concerns underlying
the conferment of such a power, and second, the exercise of the
power under the proviso must not destroy the essential
democratic values recognised in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_241">Article 239-AA.</a> Thus, it is
necessary to lay down the steps which need to be adopted before
recourse is taken to the proviso. The Transaction of Business
Rules indicate in sufficiently elaborate terms that when there is a
difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and a
Minister, primarily, an effort should be made to resolve it by mutual
discussion. If this process does not yield a satisfactory result, the
matter can be referred to the Council of Ministers with whom an
attempt is made to seek a satisfactory solution. It is when these
two stages are crossed and a difference still persists that the
proviso can be taken recourse to by referring the matter to the
President. These stages which are enunciated in the Transaction
of Business Rules must be read in conjunction with the authority
conferred by Section 44 of the GNCTD Act which was enacted in
pursuance of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_242">Article 239-AA(7).</a> Hence the proviso must be read
in conjunction with the law enacted by Parliament and the
Transaction of Business Rules made by the President, to give
clarity to the operating procedure for invoking the proviso.
Moreover, once a reference is made to the President, the
Lieutenant Governor is bound by the decision of the President.
The Lieutenant Governor has the authority to take action which is
warranted by emergent circumstances until the President has
taken a decision. But before recourse is taken to the proviso, the
Lieutenant Governor must make every effort with the Minister or,
as the case may be, the Council of Ministers to resolve a matter of
difference. The nature of the differences which may warrant a
reference to the President cannot be exhaustively catalogued. But
it would be appropriate to construe the proviso as a protector of
national concerns in regard to governance of the NCT. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                             74</span>

Lieutenant Governor is a watchdog to protect them. The
Lieutenant Governor may, for instance, be justified in seeking
recourse to the proviso where the executive act of the
Government of the NCT is likely to impede or prejudice the
exercise of the executive power of the Union Government. The
Lieutenant Governor may similarly consider it necessary to invoke
the proviso to ensure compliance with the provisions of the
Constitution or a law enacted by Parliament. There may well be
significant issues of policy which have a bearing on the position of
the National Capital Territory as a national Capital. Financial
concerns of the Union Government may be implicated in such a
manner that it becomes necessary for the Lieutenant Governor to
invoke the proviso where a difference of opinion remains
unresolved. A situation of the nature indicated in Rule 23 of the
Transaction of Business Rules may well justify recourse to the
proviso. The touchstone for recourse to the proviso is that the
difference of opinion is not a contrived difference. The matter on
which a difference has arisen must be substantial and not trifling.
In deciding whether to make a reference, the Lieutenant Governor
must always bear in mind the latitude which a representative
Government possesses to take decisions in areas falling within its
executive authority. The Lieutenant Governor must bear in mind
that it is not he, but the Council of Ministers which takes
substantive decisions and even when he invokes the proviso, the
Lieutenant Governor has to abide by the decision of the
President. The Lieutenant Governor must also be conscious of
the fact that unrestrained recourse to the proviso would virtually
transfer the administration of the affairs of the NCT from its
Government to the Centre. If the expression “any matter” were to
be read so broadly as to comprehend “every matter”, the
operation of the proviso would transfer decision-making away
from the Government of the NCT to the Centre. If the proviso
were to be so read, it would result in a situation where the
President would deal with a reference on every matter, leaving
nothing but the husk to the administration of the Union Territory.
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_243">Article 239-AB</a> makes a provision where there is a failure of the
constitutional machinery in the Union Territory. The proviso to
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_244">Article 239-AA(4)</a> does not deal with that situation. Hence, in the
application of the proviso it would be necessary to bear in mind
that the Council of Ministers for the NCT has a constitutionally
recognised function, as does the Legislative Assembly to whom
the Council is collectively responsible. The role of the Lieutenant
Governor is not to supplant this constitutional structure but to
make it workable in order to ensure that concerns of a national
character which have an innate bearing on the status of Delhi as a
national Capital are not bypassed. If these fundamental precepts
are borne in mind, the operation of the proviso should pose no
difficulty and the intervention of the President could be invoked in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                    75</span>

       appropriate cases where a matter fundamental to the governance
       to the Union Territory is involved.”


</p><p id="p_233">61)    Insofar as executive power of the GNCTD is concerned, we find

  that the majority judgment authored by Dipak Misra, CJI (as he then

  was) clearly holds that it is to the exclusion of the executive power of the

  Central Government.      That is the effect of the combined reading of

  paragraphs 214 to 218 of the Constitution judgment. The argument of

  the respondents to the contrary is an attempt to reargue the case.

  However, judicial discipline prevents us from embarking upon such a

  journey. In fact, it is for this reason the learned counsel appearing for

  the Union of India have also argued that the majority opinion is not

  correct and matter needs to be referred to the larger Bench for

  reconsideration.   This course of action would also not be advisable

  having regard to the provisions of <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_245">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution. We,

  thus, have to proceed on the premise that the executive power of the

  Delhi Government extends to all Entries of List II (except Entries 1, 2

  and 18) and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to

  said Entries 1, 2 and 18 as well as all the Entries in List III. This power

  of GNCTD is also to be exclusive, i.e. to the exclusion of the executive

  power of the Central Government. At the same time, we may also clarify

  that while dealing with the specific issues which arise in these appeals,

  this Court would keep in mind the provisions of GNCTD Act as well as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                       76</span>

     the Transaction of Business Rules inasmuch as for deciding these

     issues this Court cannot be oblivious of the specific provisions contained

     in the Act and the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_234">
</p><p id="p_235">  62)        Of course, while construing     those   provisions   and   applying

     these     and other       provisions in the context of specific issues, the

     letter and spirit behind the Constitution Bench judgment on various

     aspects, to which all the three opinions concur, would be kept in mind. It

     is for this reason we have discussed other two opinions as well, in detail.

The Appeals

</p><p id="p_236">  63)        To recapitulate, there are a total of nine appeals which have to be

     decided by this Court in the present batch of appeals. Seven out of

     these nine appeals have been filed by the GNCTD and remaining two

     have been filed by the Union of India. Eight out of these nine appeals

     are Civil Appeals and one appeal filed by the Union of India is a Criminal

     Appeal. All the appeals are against the impugned order of the High

     Court of Delhi dated August 04, 2016. The issues which are raised in

     different appeals are summed up below:
</p>
<p id="p_237">
</p><p id="p_238">  64)        The first issue is whether the exclusion of “Services” relatable to

     Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and

     executive domain of the NCT of Delhi, vide Notification of the

     Government of India dated May 21, 2015,            is unconstitutional and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                   77</span>

  illegal?
</p>
<p id="p_239">
</p><p id="p_240">65)     The second issue is whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the

  Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) of the NCT of Delhi to investigate offences

  committed under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_246">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1987 by the officials

  of Central Government and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the

  employees of GNCTD alone is legal? (These two issues arise in Civil

  Appeal No. 2357 of 2017).
</p>
<p id="p_241">
</p><p id="p_242">66)     The third issue is raised in Civil Appeal Nos. 2358, 2359 and 2360

  of 2017. In all these three appeals, the common issue is whether the

  GNCTD is an “Appropriate Government” under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_247">Commission of

  Enquiry Act</a>, 1952?
</p>
<p id="p_243">
</p><p id="p_244">67)     The fourth issue, which is raised in Civil Appeal 2363 of 2017, is:

  whether under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_248">Section 108</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 and under Section

  12 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000, the power to issue

  directions with the State Commission is with the Government of NCT of

  Delhi?
</p>
<p id="p_245">
</p><p id="p_246">        Similar issue is the subject matter of Civil Appeal 2361 of 2017,

  viz. whether the orders of the GNCTD nominating Directors to

  Distribution Companies in Delhi under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act,

  2000 read with Delhi Electricity Reforms (Transfer Scheme) Rules,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                      78</span>

     2001, without obtaining the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor are

     valid?
</p>
<p id="p_247">
</p><p id="p_248">  68)     The fifth issue is common to Civil Appeal No. 2362 of 2017 filed by

     the GNCTD and Civil Appeal No. 2364 of 2017 filed by Union of India,

     wherein the issue is whether the Revenue Department of the GNCTD

     has the power to revise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle

     Rates) under the provisions of <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_249">Indian Stamp Act</a>, 1899?


</p><p id="p_249">  69)     The sixth issue, which is the subject matter of Criminal Appeal No.

     277 of 2018, pertains to the appointment of Special Public Prosecutors,

     viz., whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the GNCTD which has the

     power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor under <a href="/doc/378047/" id="a_250">Section 24</a> of the

     Cr.PC.?
</p>
<p id="p_250">
Discussion and Conclusions on the Issues Raised

</p><p id="p_251">  70)     We now proceed to decide these issues.
</p>
<p id="p_252">     Issue No.1: Whether the exclusion of ‘Services’ relatable to Entry 41 of
     List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and executive
     domain of the NCTD, vide Notification dated May 21, 2015, is
     unconstitutional and illegal?
</p>
<p id="p_253">
</p><p id="p_254">  71)     Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule reads as under:

</p><p id="p_255">          "41. State public services; State Public Service Commission.”


</p><p id="p_256">  72)     Mr. Chidambaram, learned senior counsel who argued the case on

     behalf of the GNCTD on this issue, submitted that the majority judgment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                    79</span>

  of the Constitution Bench specifically holds that exclusion of

  legislative/executive power in List II for Assembly/ GNCTD is limited to

  only three subjects, i.e. Entry 1 (Public order), Entry 2 (Police) and Entry

  18 (Land). Therefore, the issue of exclusion of any other additional

  Entry either in List II or in List III would not arise. As a consequence, not

  only legislative power of the Assembly, even the co-extensive executive

  power in respect of Entry 41 rests with GNCTD.            Mr. Chidambaram

  argued that Entry 41 has two components, namely, State public service

  and State Public Service Commission. Since there is no State Public

  Service Commission in Delhi, insofar as service personnel in Delhi are

  concerned, that would come within the expression ‘State public services’

  and it is the GNCTD which would exercise its administrative power over

  such employees.
</p>
<p id="p_257">
</p><p id="p_258">73)    Learned counsel drew attention of this Court to the earlier

  Notification dated September 24, 1998 and submitted that the said

  Notification was perfectly in order. We reproduce the same hereunder:

Entry 41 of the State List which deals with the State Public

the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

Union Territories of Daman &amp; Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Andaman
and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep including the National Capital
Territory of Delhi which is also administered by the Central
Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. As such, it is
clear that the National Capital Territory of Delhi does not have its
own State Public Services. Thus, ‘Services’ will fall within this
category.
</p>
<p id="p_265">And whereas it is well established that where there is no

</p><p id="p_271">74)    Pertinently, this Notification in respect of ‘Services’, mentions about

  Union Territories cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service and

  Indian Police Service personnel. There is no dispute that this cadre is

  common to all the Union Territories and Delhi is only one of them. It is

  also not in dispute that this cadre is administered by the Central

  Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Notification also

  refers to DANICS and DANIPS, which are again common services

  catering to the requirement of various Union Territories, including NCTD.

  These services are also administered by the Central Government

  through the Ministry of Home Affairs. As is clear from the aforesaid

  Notification, the aforesaid reasons are given therein thereby making

  these services subject to the control and further orders of the Lieutenant

  Governor of NCTD.
</p>
<p id="p_272">
</p><p id="p_273">75)    Submission of Mr. Chidambaram, however, is that being common

  cadres, which apply to all Union Territories, undoubtedly, the Central

  Government has the power to allocate the personnel to NCTD as well.

  Likewise, it is also within the powers of the Central Government to

  transfer such personnel from one Union Territory to other, which would

  mean even from NCTD to any other Union Territory. According to him,

  that was the only function of the Joint Cadre Authority under the All India

  Services (Joint Cadre) Rules, 1972 inasmuch as Rule 5(1) therein

  stipulates to: “determine the names of the members of All India Services

  who may be required to serve from time to time in connection with

  affairs of each of the constituent States and the period or purpose for

  which their services shall be available to that Government”. However,

  submits the counsel, once particular officers are allocated to NCTD,

  during their tenure in NCTD, it is within the powers of the GNCTD to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                   84</span>

assign them to particular departments. In support of this submission, he

referred to the following Rules:

       Submission was that as per the aforesaid Rules, posting is done

  by the State Government once the Central Government allocates

  particular employees to a particular State and since this principle of

  federalism is accepted and given imprimatur by the Constitution Bench

  in case of NCTD as well, the aforesaid principle shall equally apply.


</p><p id="p_276">76)    As per him, the complete scheme which becomes clear from the

  above is that while it is the Joint Cadre Authority where Delhi has its own

  separate representative which allocates officers of the AGMUT Cadre to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                      86</span>

  NCT of Delhi, the post to which such officer is posted/deputed is

  determined by the GNCTD. Consequently, if within the GNCTD, the said

  officer has to be posted from one post to the another, it is the GNCTD

  alone which has the powers under the Service Rules. This is in

  consonance with the position that prevails in the states of Arunachal

  Pradesh, Mizoram and Goa which are also members of the Joint Cadre

  in the AGMUT Cadre and who like the NCTD and unlike other Union

  Territories have a representative in the Joint Cadre Authority.


</p><p id="p_277">77)     Likewise, insofar as DANICS is concerned, the submission is that

  under the Delhi, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Lakshasweep, Daman &amp;

  Diu and Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli Civil Services Rules, 2003, same

  consequence follows. Following Rules were referred to:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">      “11. Appointment to the Service -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">           All appointment to the Service shall be made by the Appointing
           Authority to the Junior Administrative Grade-I or Junior
           Administrative Grade-II or Selection Grade or Entry Grade of the
           Service and not against any specific post included in the
           Service.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">      12. Posting -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">          Every member of the Service allocated to an Administration
          shall, unless he is appointed to an ex-cadre post, or is otherwise
          not available for holding a duty post owing to the exigencies of
          the public service, be posted against a duty post under the
          Administration by the Administrator concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">      13. Allocation of members of the Service -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">          The Government shall, from time to time, allocate a member of
          the Service to any Administration for posting in terms of rule 12.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">78)     It is argued that under the DANICS Rules, as per Rule 2(a)

  ‘Administration’ means the GNCTD, as per Rule 2(b) ‘Administrator’
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                   87</span>

  means the Administrator of NCTD and as per Rule 2(k) ‘Government’

  means the Government of India. Thus, while it is the Government of

  India that makes an officer available to GNCTD under Rule 13, the

  posting of that DANICS officer within the NCTD is to be made by the

  Administrator on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_278">79)    Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel who argued on behalf

  of the Union of India on this particular issue, submitted that Entry 41 in

  List II cannot be applied to the NCTD as the said Entry is confined to

  ‘State public services’ and ‘State Public Service Commission’.

  Indubitably, there was no Public Service Commission in NCTD. The

  other part refers to State Public Services whereas the services in

  respect of which the impugned Notification dated May 21, 2015 is

  issued, pertains to other All India Services or combined/joint cadre of

  Union Territories which are not State public services. He also argued

  that certain matters fall within the discretionary powers of the Lieutenant

  Governor where he does not have to act on the aid and advise of the

  Council of Ministers of GNCTD. This was such a discretionary matter

  and, therefore, fell outside NCTD. In the alternative, he submitted that

  even if the Lieutenant Governor has no discretion, since the subject

  matter is not covered by Entry 41 of List II, the Lieutenant Governor is

  not supposed to act on the aid and advise of the Central Government

  and not that of GNCTD. Focusing on the aspect of discretionary power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                    88</span>

  of the Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Sundaram referred to Section 41 of the

  GNCTD Act which stipulates the matters wherein the Lieutenant

  Governor can act in his own discretion. This provision reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">       "41. Matters in which Lieutenant Governor to act in his discretion:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">       (1) The Lieutenant Governor shall act in his discretion in a
       matter:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">          (i) which falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on
          the legislative Assembly but in respect of which powers or
          functions are entrusted or delegated to him by the President;
          or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">          (ii) in which he is required by or under any law to act in his
          discretion or to exercise any judicial functions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">       (2) If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is not a
       matter as respects with the Lieutenant Governor is by or under
       any law required to act in his discretion, the decision of the
       Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be final.</blockquote><p id="p_279">

</p><p id="p_280">       (3) If any questions arises as to whether any matter is or is not a
       matter as respects with the Lieutenant Governor is by or under
       any law required by any law to exercise any judicial or
       quasi-judicial functions, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor
       thereon shall be final.”


</p><p id="p_281">80)    According to Mr. Sundaram, discretion was conferred upon the

  Lieutenant Governor in respect of this subject matter by virtue of clause

</p><p id="p_282">  (i) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_260">Section 41</a> as the matter falls outside the purview

  of the powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly. Therefore, the

  President was competent to issue Notification dated May 21, 2015

  thereby entrusting the powers and functions in respect of ‘Services’ to

  the Lieutenant Governor. According to him, this was supported by Rule

  46 of the Transaction of Business Rules which reads as under:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                    89</span>

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">       "46. (1) With respect to persons serving in connection with the
       administration of the National Capital Territory, the Lieutenant
       Governor shall, exercise such powers and perform such functions
       as may be entrusted to him under the provisions of the rules and
       orders regulating the conditions of service of such persons or by
       any other order of the President in consultation with the Chief
       Minister, if it is so provided under any order issued by the
       President under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_261">article 239</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">       (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (1) the
       Lieutenant Governor shall consult the Union Public Service
       Commission on all matters on which the Commission is required
       to be consulted under clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_262">article 320</a> of the Constitution;
       and in every such case he shall not make any order otherwise
       than in accordance with the advice of the Union Public Service
       Commission unless authorised to do so by the Central
       Government.</blockquote><p id="p_283">

</p><p id="p_284">       (3) All correspondence with Union Public Service Commission
       and the Central Government regarding recruitment and conditions
       of service of persons serving in connection with the administration
       of National Capital Territory shall be conducted by the Chief
       Secretary or Secretary of the Department concerned under the
       direction of the Lieutenant Governor.”


</p><p id="p_285">81)    Insofar as Notification dated September 24, 1998 is concerned, Mr.

  Sundaram pointed out that this Notification was issued under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_263">Article 239</a>

  of the Constitution. In any case, this was also issued by the President

  and was almost to the same effect as Notification dated May 21, 2015,

  inasmuch as here also the President had delegated the powers to the

  Lieutenant Governor in respect of ‘Public order’, ‘Police’ as well as

  ‘Services’. Therefore, all these subjects were put at par. The only other

  requirement specified in the said Notification was that the Lieutenant

  Governor was to exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the

  Central Government ‘in consultation with the Chief Minister of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                       90</span>

    NCTD’. It was only a ‘consultation’ which would not mean ‘concurrence’.

    The Notification dated May 21, 2015 brought about change only in

    respect of such consultative process, i.e. ‘consultation’ with the Chief

    Minister, as being done away with.             This became necessitated,

    according to him, because of the problems which the Lieutenant

    Governor was facing even in undertaking consultations with the Chief

    Minister.   Therefore, now it is entirely within the discretion of the

    Lieutenant Governor to have the views of the Chief Minister or not. To

    that extent this Notification is only clarification of the earlier Notification

    dated September 24, 1998 and in substance the legal implications of

    this Notification were exactly the same as Notification dated September

    24, 1998. Learned counsel also argued that the Constitution provides

    for services of the States and services of the Union. All Union Territories

    services are services of the Union, as held in a recent judgment of this

    Court in <a href="/doc/50417182/" id="a_264">Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board and Others</a> 4. For example, in

    Delhi, IAS, DANICS &amp; DASS cadre, as also teachers and doctors, are

    services of the Union and the recruitment rules have been framed with

    the approval of the President or of Lieutenant Governor as a nominee of

    the President. The learned counsel also pointed out that Rule 46 of the

    Transaction of Business Rules, along with the delegation made by the

    President under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_265">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution from time to time, has

    always been governing the process of transfer/posting of officers

4               (2018) 10 SCC 312
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                   91</span>

  working with the GNCTD.
</p>
<p id="p_286">
</p><p id="p_287">82)    Fervent plea of Mr. Sundaram was that a just and fair mechanism

  could be similar to the one which prevailed in earlier years prior to 2015,

  viz. that the transfers and postings of Secretaries, HoDs and other

  officers in the scale of Joint Secretary to the Government of India and

  above can be done by the Lieutenant Governor and the file submitted to

  him directly. For other levels, including DANICS officers, the files can be

  routed through the Chief Minister to Lieutenant Governor. In case of

  difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief

  Minister, the view of the Lieutenant Governor should prevail and the

  Ministry of Home Affairs can issue a suitable notification in this regard.

  However, for Grade IV, III, II and I DASS officials, there is an existing

  delegation of powers where for Grades IV and III, all transfers and

  postings are done by the Secretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the

  transfers and postings are done by the Chief Secretary. For greater

  transparency, a Civil Services Board can be formed which can be

  headed by the Secretary (Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the

  Chief Secretary for Grades II and I level officers. The Board can decide

  on the transfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers. He also

  pointed out that for IAS officers, a Civil Services Board headed by the

  Chief Secretary already exists and the recommendations of the same

  are being sent to the Lieutenant Governor. Similar Board can also be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                                          92</span>

      formed for DANICS officers. His suggestion was that similar mechanism

      of Services Boards can be made for other departments such as

      Education and Health. Likewise, the services of the Union Territories

      being under the Ministry of Home Affairs, an advisory can be given to

      that Ministry to make these guidelines under the Transaction of Business

      Rules and to provide consultation by the Lieutenant Governor with the

      Chief Minister up to certain level of officers.


</p><p id="p_288">    83)     In rejoinder, Mr. Chidambaram submitted that the aforesaid

      argument of the Union ignores the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/42187/" id="a_266">Union of

      India v. Prem Kumar Jain and Others</a> 5 wherein a four Judge Bench of

      this Court held that the ‘State’ includes a Union Territory for the purposes

      of <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_267">Article 312</a> of the Constitution in the following manner:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_83">            "8. It follows therefore that, as and from November 1, 1956, when
            the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, came into force,
            the President had the power to adapt the laws for the purpose of
            bringing the provisions of any law in force in India into accord with
            the provisions of the Constitution. It was under that power that the
            President issued the Adaptation of Laws (No. 1) Order, 1956,
            which, as has been shown, substituted a new clause (58) in
            <a href="/doc/922427/" id="a_268">Section 3</a> of the General clauses Act providing, inter alia, that the
            expression “State” shall, as respects any period after the
            commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act,
            1956, mean “a State specified in the First Schedule to the
            Constitution and shall include a Union Territory”. It cannot be
            said with any justification that there was anything repugnant in the
            subject or context to make that definition inapplicable. By virtue of
            <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_269">Article 372A(1)</a> of the Constitution, it was that definition of the
            expression “State” which had effect from the first day of
            November, 1956, and the Constitution expressly provided that it
            could “not be questioned in any court of law”. The High Court
            therefore went wrong in taking a contrary view and in holding

5                 (1976) 3 SCC 743
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                      93</span>

        that “Union territories are not ‘States’ for purposes of <a href="/doc/801524/" id="a_270">Article
        312(1)</a> of the Constitution and the preamble to the Act of
        1951”. That was why the High Court erred in holding that the
        definition of “State” in the Cadre Rules was ultra vires the <a href="/doc/1820745/" id="a_271">All India
        Services Act</a>, 1951 and the Constitution, and that the Union
        territories cadre of the service was “not common to the Union and
        the States” within the meaning of <a href="/doc/801524/" id="a_272">Article 312(1)</a> of the
        Constitution, and that the Central Government could not make the
        Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 in consultation
        with the State Governments as there were no such governments
        in the Union territories.</blockquote><p id="p_289">
</p><p id="p_290">                                                      (emphasis supplied)”

        The above decision has also been noted, with approval, in

  paragraph 125 in the opinion of Chandrachud J. in the Constitution

  Bench judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_291">
</p><p id="p_292">84)     From the respective arguments of the parties reproduced above, it

  becomes clear that following aspects are undisputed:

</p><p id="p_293">  (a)   The matter pertains to the ‘Services’ which consists of Indian

  Administrative Service, Indian Police Service. Likewise, DANICS and

  DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of various

  Union Territories including NCTD.
</p>
<p id="p_294">  (b)   These are All India Services and the cadre in question is Union

  Territory Cadre which is common of all Union Territory and Delhi is one

  of them. Therefore the Cadre does not pertain to GNCTD itself. This

  cadre is administered by the Central Government through Ministry of

  Home Affairs.
</p>
<p id="p_295">  (c)   There is no dispute that insofar as allocation of personnel

  belonging to the aforesaid services is concerned, it is the Central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                     94</span>

  Government thorough Ministry of Home Affairs which has to pass the

  necessary orders.      Similarly, Central Government is empowered to

  transfer such personnel from one Union Territory to other.


</p><p id="p_296">85)     The fulcrum of dispute pertains to the control of GNCTD over

  these personnel after they are allocated to the NCTD. As per GNCTD, it

  has the power to post such work force at different places and the LG is

  to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.             For this

  purpose, the executive power is sought to be drawn by virtue of Entry 41

  of List II in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The submission on

  behalf of the Union of India is that it comes within the discretionary powers of

  the LG as the subject matter is not covered by Entry 41 of List II and,

  therefore, by virtue of Section 41 of GNCTD Act, the LG is empowered to

  act in his discretion in such a matter.
</p>
<p id="p_297">86)     In the aforesaid backdrop, the first and foremost question is

  whether ‘services’ fall outside the purview of legislative assembly of

  NCTD? To put it otherwise, whether Entry 41 of List II does not cover the

  subject matter? Entry 41 of List II deals with ‘State Public Services’ and

  ‘State Public Service Commission’. It is undisputed that State Public

  Service Commission does not exist in NCTD. When we are dealing with

  All India Services and DHANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to

  mention it as State Public Service.
</p>
<p id="p_298">87)     The further issue, however, is to see as to whether it is within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                    95</span>

  powers of GNCTD to assign such officers to particular departments,

  once they are allocated to the NCTD by the joint cadre authority. As per

  Rule 2(c) of Indian Administrative Services (Cardre) Rules, 1954, State

  includes a Union Territory. Rule 7 deals with posting and, inter alia,

  stipulates that in the case of joint cadre, posting shall be by the State

  Government concerned.         In the context of <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_273">Article 312</a> of the

  Constitution, this Court has held in Prem Kumar Jain that Union

  Territories are States for the purpose of the said Article.

</p><p id="p_299">88)     Similar is the position in respect of DANICS. Rule 11 of DANICS

  Rules, 2003 empowers Administrator of the administration concerned

  i.e. Union Territory, to make these postings. On the other hand, in the

  context of NCTD, the Administrator, namely, LG is supposed to function

  in this behalf on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. That is

  the dicta of Constitution Bench judgment. Therefore, it becomes equally

  doubtful as to whether it falls within the discretionary powers of the L.G.

</p><p id="p_300">89)     The aforesaid discussion leads to a very peculiar situation. The

  appellant has endeavoured to assume the executive power in respect of

  ‘services’ by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, which may be doubtful.

  That situation may give discretionary powers to the L.G. On the other

  hand, it also cannot be said that once the manpower is allocated to

  Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTD should not have any power to deal

  with such employees, in view of C.B. Judgment. In such a scenario, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                    96</span>

  to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers between the LG on the one

  hand (as representative of the Central Government) and the Council of

  Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, we are of the

  opinion that for the smooth functioning of the system, it is necessary to

  carve out a just and fair mechanism. Therefore, we are inclined to

  accept the suggestion of Mr. Sundaram in this behalf as recorded above.

  In this behalf, we reiterate the position as under:

</p><p id="p_301">90)    The transfers and postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers

  in the scale of Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can

  be done by the Lieutenant Governor and the file submitted to him

  directly. For other levels, including DANICS officers, the files can be

  routed through the Chief Minister to Lieutenant Governor. In case of

  difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief

  Minister, the view of the Lieutenant Governor should prevail and the

  Ministry of Home Affairs can issue a suitable notification in this regard.

  However, for Grade IV, III, II and I DASS officials, there is an existing

  delegation of powers where for Grades IV and III, all transfers and

  postings are done by the Secretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the

  transfers and postings are done by the Chief Secretary. For greater

  transparency, a Civil Services Board can be formed which can be

  headed by the Secretary (Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the

  Chief Secretary for Grades II and I level officers. The Board can decide
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                     97</span>

  on the transfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers. He also

  pointed out that for IAS officers, a Civil Services Board headed by the

  Chief Secretary already exists and the recommendations of the same

  are being sent to the Lieutenant Governor. Similar Board can also be

  formed for DANICS officers. His suggestion was that similar mechanism

  of Services Boards can be made for other departments such as

  Education and Health. Likewise, the services of the Union Territories

  being under the Ministry of Home Affairs, an advisory can be given to

  that Ministry to make these guidelines under the Transaction of Business

  Rules and to provide consultation by the Lieutenant Governor with the

  Chief Minister up to certain level of officers.


</p><p id="p_302">91)     We may add that insofar as disciplinary authorities are concerned,

  the same are already prescribed as per the CCA (CCS) Rules and the

  Rules applicable for different services including IAS &amp; DANICS. The

  appointing and disciplinary authority is the President of India, as per the

  powers delegated by the President from time to time. Vigilance matters

  would get covered by the applicable disciplinary rules in terms of officers

  competent to initiate and take vigilance action.


</p><p id="p_303">92)     In the interest of good governance and smooth Governmental

  function, we expect that efforts will be made by both the Chief Minister

  as well as the LG for a harmonious working relation.

Issue No.2: Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-Corruption
Branch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed under the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_274">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1987 by the officials of the Central Government
and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone
is legal?
</p>
<p id="p_304">  93)      On this issue, validity of few notifications is in question. It may be

     mentioned    that   vide   Notification   dated August    01,   1986,   the

     Administrator declared ACB of Delhi Administration as a Police Station

     under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_275">Section 2(s)</a> of Cr.P.C. for the purpose of certain corruption related

     offences under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_276">IPC</a> and the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_277">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947. As

     per this notification, the ACB had “jurisdiction all over the whole of Union

     Territory of Delhi”. In supersession of this notification vide Notification

     dated November 08, 1993, the GNCTD through the Lieutenant Governor

     declared the ACB of NCTD at Old Secretariat as a police station under

     <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_278">Section 2(s)</a> of the Cr.P.C. for offences under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_279">Prevention of

     Corruption Act</a>, 1988. Thereafter, two Notifications dated July 23, 2014

     and May 21, 2015 came to be issued by the Central Government as per

     which the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees of GNCTD only.

                New Delhi, the 21st May, 2015

S.O. 1368(E) – Whereas <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_281">Article 239</a> of the Constitution provides
that every Union Territory shall be administered by the President
acting, to such extent as he things fit, through an administrator to
be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify;

And whereas <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_282">Article 239AA</a> inserted by the Constitution
(Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 provides that the Union
Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of
Delhi and the administrator thereof appointed under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_283">Article 239</a>
shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                              100</span>


And whereas sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_284">Article 239AA</a> states
that the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for
the whole or any pat of the National Capital Territory with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the
Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union
Territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of
the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they
relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18; and whereas Entry 1 relates
to ‘Public Order’, Entry 2 relates to ‘Police’ and Entry 18 relates to
‘Land’.
</p>
<p id="p_307">And whereas sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_285">Article 239AA</a> also
qualifies the matters enumerated in the State List or in the
Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union
Territories. Under this provision, a reference may be made to
Entry 41 of the State List which deals with the State Public
services, State Public Service Commission which do not exist in
the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_308">Further, the Union Territories Cadre consisting of Indian
Administrative Service and Indian Police Service personnel is
common to Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Dadra and
Nagar Haveli, Puducherry and States of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa
and Mizoram which is administered by the Central Government
through the Ministry of Home Affairs; and similarly DANICS and
DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of the
Union Territories of Daman and Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli,
Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep including the
National Capital Territory of Delhi which is also administered by
the Central Government through the Minister of Home Affairs. As
such, it is clear that the National Capital Territory of Delhi does not
have its own State Public Services. Thus, ‘Services’ will fall within
this category.
</p>
<p id="p_309">And whereas it is well established that where there is no
legislative power, there is no executive power since executive
power is co-extensive with legislative power.

And whereas matters relating to Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18 of the State List
being ‘Public Order’, ‘Police’ and ‘Land’ respectively and Entries
64, 65 &amp; 66 of that list insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18
as also ‘Services’ fall outside the purview of Legislative Assembly
of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and consequently the
Govt. of Nct of Delhi will have no executive power in relation to
the above and further that power in relation to the aforesaid

subjects vests exclusively in the President or his delegate, i.e. the
Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.
</p>

<a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_286">Article 239</a> and sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_287">Article 239AA</a>, the

</p><p id="p_318">94)    The validity of these Notifications is challenged on three grounds:

  First, post the 69th Amendment, the Central Government is not the “State

  Government” within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_289">Section 2(s)</a> of Cr.P.C. Second, the

  impugned notifications create a class of offenders immune from the

  jurisdiction of ACB, even though they are accused of committing the

  same offence as other public servants and in the same territory. Such

  classification is not permissible under the Constitution and has been

  held to violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_290">Article 14.</a> Third, the notifications have the effect of

  amending various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_291">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988

  including the definition of “Public Servant”, which is not permissible.


</p><p id="p_319">95)    It is argued that power under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_292">Section 2(s)</a> of Cr.P.C. relates to

  ‘Criminal Procedure’ and not ‘Police’. <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_293">Section 2(s)</a> of the Cr.P.C.

  empowers the State Government to notify a Police Station. However, the

  impugned notifications are issued by the Central Government.              It is

  argued that post the 69th Amendment, the Central Government is not the

  State Government for the purpose of exercising the powers u/s. 2(s) of

  the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_294">Cr.P.C</a>. It is submitted that though a cursory reading of the definition

  of the ‘State Government’ contained in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_295">Section 3(6)</a> of the General

  Clauses Act, 1897 (GC Act) includes the Central Government and

  makes it a State Government in respect of Delhi for the purpose of

  exercising power under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_296">Section 2(s)</a> of the Cr.P.C., but that is not the

  correct legal position. The contention is that Section 3(60) of the GC Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                    103</span>

  containing the definition of the ‘State Government’ was enacted prior to

  the 69th Amendment to the Constitution. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_297">Article 239AA</a> and the cognate

  Articles were inserted/amended by the said Constitutional amendment.

  Pursuant to the aforesaid amendment, the Parliament enacted the

  GNCTD Act. The said amendment and the said Act came in force on

  February 01, 1992. In view of the aforesaid change in the Constitution

  and enactment of the GNCTD Act, the Central Government is not the

  State Government in respect of territory of Delhi for the purpose of

  <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_298">Section 2(s)</a> of Cr.P.C. The power to issue notification under <a href="/doc/1400425/" id="a_299">Section 2(s)</a>

  is now vested with the Delhi Government. Reference is made to Entry 2

  of List III of the Seventh Schedule, which reads as under:

</p><p id="p_320">      “2. Criminal procedure, including all matters included in<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_300"> the Code</a> of
      Criminal Procedure at the commencement of this Constitution.”


</p><p id="p_321">96)     It is, therefore, submitted that the Legislative Assembly for Delhi

  has legislative competence in respect of Cr. P.C, which is directly

  relatable to Entry 2 of List III. Further the Delhi Government has

  exclusive executive power in respect of criminal procedure, in terms of

  Para 218 and 219 of the Constitution Bench Judgment. Section 3(58) of

  the GC Act defines the expression “State”. The definition inter alia lays

  down that the Union Territory is a State. From this, it is sought to be

  buttressed that it logically follows that any Government which

  administers affairs of the Union Territory of Delhi is a State Government.

</p><p id="p_322">    97)    To support the aforesaid plea, certain judgments are relied upon.

      <a href="/doc/1136229/" id="a_301">In Ukha Kolhe v. State of Maharashtra6</a>, a Constitution Bench of this

      Court has held as under:

</blockquote>

<p id="p_323">    98)    Arguments on this issue, on behalf of the Union, were addressed

      by Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel. His submission was

      that the entire matter has to be looked into from a historical perspective.

      He, thus, traced the development of establishment of ACB of Delhi

      Police.   Historically, ACB of Delhi Police        appears to have been

      constituted in the year 1957.          On December 6, 1963, the Chief

      Commissioner Delhi placed it under the control of Chief Secretary, Delhi

      Administration. On May 24, 1965, the Superintendent of Police, ACB

      was declared to be the head and Drawing and Disbursing Officer (DDO).

      Thereafter, exercising power under <a href="/doc/291560/" id="a_304">Section 5(1)</a>, first proviso of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_305">PC Act</a>,

      the administrator of UT, Delhi authorised the inspectors of police serving

      in ACB to investigate offences under the said Act in the whole of the

6                (1964) 1 SCR 926 : AIR 1963 SC 1531
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                 105</span>

territory. This was reiterated by the order of the Administrator issued on

May 19, 1970. Additionally, with respect to <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_306">Section 161</a>, <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_307">165</a> and <a href="/doc/54942699/" id="a_308">165A</a>

of IPC power of arrest without warrant was given.              During the

aforementioned period, the police force was governed by the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_309">Police Act</a>,

1861, <a href="/doc/1422492/" id="a_310">Section 40</a> of the Punjab Laws Act, 1872 as in force in Delhi and

the Bombay Police Act, 1951 as in force in Delhi.            The criminal

procedure was governed by<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_311"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>, 1898. The<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_312">

Criminal Procedure Code</a>, 1973 came into force w.e.f. April 1, 1974

though it was gazetted on January 25, 1974.          In this context, the

President of India issued the notification dated March 20, 1974. A series

of notifications, beginning from the year 1974, in respect of

establishment and functioning of the ACB have been issued by the

President and Administrator/LG in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/148903/" id="a_313">Article

239(1)</a> of the Constitution and <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_314">Section 2(s)</a> Cr.P.C., 1973 read with <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_315">Delhi

Police Act</a>. Significantly, notifications issued prior to July 23, 2014 have

not been challenged.     Some of these notifications were issued even

before the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_316">Article 239AA (February 01</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_317">, 1992).</a>        The first

notification was issued by the President on March 20, 1974 in exercise

of powers under <a href="/doc/148903/" id="a_318">Article 239(1)</a> of the Constitution.       The notification

directs the Administrators of all UTs other than Arunachal Pradesh and

Mizoram to exercise, subject to control of the President and until further

orders, the powers and functions under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_319">Cr.P.C</a>., 1973 as mentioned in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                 106</span>

the annexed schedule. The notification has a condition that the Central

Government may itself exercise all or any of those powers and functions

if it deems necessary.       This notification confers powers on the

Administrator of UT Delhi to exercise powers under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_320">Section 2(s)</a> Cr.P.C.,

1973. In pursuance of the delegation of powers by the President of

India vide notification dated March 20, 1974 and in exercise of powers

under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_321">Section 2(s)</a> of Cr.P.C., 1973 the Lieutenant Governor declared

ACB of Delhi Administration at Tis Hazari, Delhi to be a police station for

offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_322">Section 161</a> and <a href="/doc/54942699/" id="a_323">165A</a> IPC, and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_324">PC Act</a>, 1947 with

jurisdiction over whole of UT, Delhi vide notification dated May 20, 1975.

Thus, ACB was established as a police station by Administrator UT

Delhi. Thereafter, the Rules of Procedure for inquiries and investigation

by ACB were revised on February 17, 1977. Rule 2 declared that all the

Rules and Regulations applicable to the Delhi Police are also applicable

to the ACB. Rule 3 prescribed the functions of ACB. Rule 5 mentioned

that ACB would be under the direct charge of a Superintendent of

Police. Rule 15(v) provides that ordinarily no inquiries should be made

by ACB in case of Central Government employees. The Rules also

provided for prosecution sections. At this stage, Parliament enacted the

<a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_325">Delhi Police Act</a>, 1978 to amend and consolidate the law relating to the

Regulation of Police in Delhi. <a href="/doc/288458/" id="a_326">Section 4</a> vests superintendence of the

  Additional Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police.

  Vide <a href="/doc/127256/" id="a_328">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/490402/" id="a_329">11</a>, the Commissioner of Police constitutes police

  districts, police sub-divisions and specifies the police stations and their

  limits and extents. Each police station is to be under the charge of an

  Inspector of Police who is appointed by the Additional Commissioner. All

  this is to be done subject to the control of the Administrator and his

  orders. Vide <a href="/doc/223624/" id="a_330">Section 15</a>, the Commissioner of Police distributes duties

  and the mode of fulfillment of their duties. The disciplinary powers vest

  with the Commissioner of Police who also makes regulations subject to

  the orders of the Administrator. It also covers preservation of public

  order and peace through provisions under Chapter IV and V.            The

  Administrator can make rules under <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_331">Section 147</a>.              <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_332">Section 149</a>

  contemplates cessation of old laws regulating police mentioned in

  Schedule II but it preserves the Rules and Standing Orders,

  appointments made etc. insofar as they are consistent with the Act. It

  also preserves the pending investigation and legal proceedings. Vide

  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_333">Section 150</a> the police force functioning in Delhi was deemed to be the

  police force constituted under the <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_334">Delhi Police Act</a>, 1978 with

  and conspiracies in relation to said offences. It was to have jurisdiction

  over the whole of UT Delhi. After the enforcement of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_340">Prevention of

  Corruption Act</a>, 1988 which also omitted <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_341">Section 161-165A</a> of IPC, the

  LG of NCTD issued notification dated November 08, 1993 in exercise of

  power under <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_342">Section 2(s)</a> CRPC read with notification dated March 20,

  1974 of GOI. This notification provided that ACB of NCT Delhi at Old

  Secretariat would be police station for offences under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_343">PC Act</a> 1988

  and attempts, abetment and conspiracies in relation to or in connection

  with the said offences and any other offence committed in the course of

  the same transaction rising out of the same set of facts. Its jurisdiction

  was to be over the whole of NCT Delhi. This notification was issued

  after the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_344">Article 239AA</a> in the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_325">100)    On September 24, 1998, the President issued a notification under

  Article 239(1) of the Constitution directing that subject to his control and

  until further orders the LG OF NCT Delhi shall exercise powers and

  discharge functions of the Central Government, to the extent delegated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                   109</span>

  in respect of matters connected with ‘public order’, ‘police’ and ‘services’

  in consultation with Chief Minister except in those cases where, for

  reasons to be recorded in writing, he does not consider it expedient to

  do so.
</p>
<p id="p_326">
</p><p id="p_327">101)   After tracing the aforesaid history, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that

  Notification dated July 23, 2014, which is now impugned, came to be

  issued by the Central Government to amend the earlier Notification

  dated November 08, 1993 which was also issued by the Central

  Government and that too post <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_345">Article 239AA</a> era. According to him, the

  object behind issuing this Notification is to implement the guidelines

  issued by the CVC in respect of the jurisdiction of CBI and ACB. It is

  this position which is restated in another Notification dated May 21, 2015

  which has also been challenged by the Delhi Government. According to

  Mr. Dwivedi, an analysis of all the notifications shows that from May 20,

  1975 itself the ACB Delhi administration was intended to be a police

  station for investigating offences in relation to the personnel exercising

  powers and functions in connection with UT Delhi. The notification dated

  August 1, 1986 had also invoked powers under Government of India

  notification dated March 20, 1974. Though the notifications territorially

  covered the whole of UT Delhi but the context was evidently to deal with

  corruption in the    Administration of UT Delhi.        The nomenclature

  ‘Anti-corruption branch, Delhi administration’ also indicates the same.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">                                  110</span>

  The subsequent notification dated November 8, 1993 merely made

  consequential changes on account of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_346">P.C. Act</a> 1988 and change in

  status of administration of Delhi as NCTD.        What was necessarily

  implicit in the said notifications was made clear by the subsequent

  notification dated July 23, 2014 and May 21, 2015 with a view to avoid

  parallel exercise of powers by CBI and ACB over officers, employees

  and functionaries of the Central Government.           This was also

  recommended by CVC. Here it may be noted that while CBI is a police

  force created under <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_347">DSPE Act</a> 1946 and ACB is established under <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_348">Delhi

  Police Act</a> 1978. The establishment of ACB is with respect to Entry 1

  and 2 List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.         The

  establishment of CBI and its power of investigation falls under Entry 8/

  80 list I of Schedule VII whereas the establishment of ACB would be

  under the <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_349">Delhi Police Act</a>, 1978.
</p>
<p id="p_328">
</p><p id="p_329">102)   He also submitted that <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_350">Section 5</a> of PC Act, 1947 and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_351">Section of

  PC Act</a>, 1988 envisage investigations of offences done by CBI/Delhi

  Police. Hence, Union or Administrator acting under <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_352">DSPE Act</a> and <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_353">Delhi

  Police Act</a>, 1978 can decide which of the two would investigate officers,

  employees and functionaries of the Central Government. In short five

  parliamentary Acts-<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_354">Cr.P.C</a>., 1973, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_355">PC Act</a>, 1988, <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_356">DSPE Act</a>, <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_357">Delhi Police

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                     111</span><p id="p_330">

</p><p id="p_331">103)       In this hue, Mr. Dwivedi’s submission was that it now stands

  established, even by the judgment of the Constitution Bench, that NCTD

  is still a Union Territory to which <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_358">Article 239</a> is applicable,

  notwithstanding the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_359">Article 239AA.</a> He further submitted that

  admittedly Entry 2 in List II is outside the legislative competence of the

  Legislative Assembly of Delhi and, therefore, the Delhi Government

  could not exercise executive authority in respect of this entry. Moreover,

  Entries 8 and 80 of List I are also outside the domain of NCTD over

  which the Parliament and central executive has the exclusive

  jurisdiction.    It is, therefore, open to the Parliament and the Central

  Government to act in pursuance of Entries 8 and 80 of List I and provide

  certain exclusive jurisdiction to CBI as regards investigation to be done

  by it.
</p>
<p id="p_332">
</p><p id="p_333">104)       Mr. Dwivedi accepted that <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_360">Cr.P.C</a>. involves a field which is covered

  by Entry 2 List III of Seventh Schedule. His submission, however, is that

  List III is the concurrent field both for the Parliament and the States.

  Therefore, though the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has legislative

  competence in respect of matters covered by Entry 2, but it is not

  exclusive inasmuch as Parliament also has the legislative competence.

  In fact, competence of the Delhi Assembly is subservient to legislative

  competence of the Parliament.            Moreover, Parliament had already

  exercised its legislative power by enacting <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_361">Cr.P.C</a>. comprehensively and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                   112</span>

  exhaustively.    Therefore, the field becomes occupied.           In such

  circumstances,    the   legislative    competence   of   NCTD/Legislative

  Assembly would stand eroded, if not denuded, which happens on

  account of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_362">Article 239AA(b)(c)</a> of the Constitution.      In this scenario,

  argued the learned counsel, GNCTD can exercise only such executive

  power as <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_363">Cr.P.C</a>. confers on it and this conferment should be specific

  and express.
</p>
<p id="p_334">
</p><p id="p_335">105)   Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel who appeared for the

  intervenor/Reliance Industries, supported and added to the aforesaid

  submissions, which would be taken note of in our discussion.


</p><p id="p_336">106)   After considering the respective submissions, we find force in the

  arguments advanced by Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi predicated on the historical

  developments narrated by him, and extracted above.          We may also

  emphasise that the issue is limited, viz., whether ACB is empowered to

  register cases in respect of Central Government employees as well?


</p><p id="p_337">107)   We find that the challenge laid by the appellant to these

  Notifications is predicated on Entry 2 of List II. Even after conferment of

  the status of quasi-State upon Delhi (which though in constitutional term

  remains Union Territory), <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_364">Article 239AA (which gives such a status)</a> itself

  excludes Entry 2 from the domain of NCTD. Thus, in respect of ‘Police’,

  NCTD does not have either legislative or executive power. This Court is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                    113</span>

  required to look into the substance of such an exclusion and cannot be

  guided by hyper technicalities. Even in the Constitution Bench judgment

  it has been emphasised time and again, and in fact in all the three

  opinions of the Hon’ble Judges, that the text of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_365">Article 239AA</a> is to be

  read contextually.    Therefore, what has been specifically denied to

  GNCTD, it cannot venture to gain that power on such a plea.


</p><p id="p_338">108)   Dr. Singhvi rightly submitted that it is a settled principle that

  legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner

  consistent with imputing to them the widest amplitude and as including

  all ancillary and subsidiary matters. A narrow or pedantic reading of the

  entries has been repeatedly frowned upon. We are of the opinion that

  the scope of the term ‘Police’ as occurring in Entry 2 of List II cannot,

  therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to only constitution of the

  Police force, but would take within its fold the legislative (and, therefore,

  executive) power to exercise supervision and control over the

  functioning of the Police so constituted, including by way of issuance of

  executive directions delineating the powers, functions and jurisdiction of

  different wings/sections of the Police.       In essence, the impugned

  notifications, to the extent they are in the nature of administrative

  directions to the Police, are directly relatable to Entry 2 of List II and as

  such squarely within the competent of the Government of India. Even to

  the extent the executive power being exercised qua the Police may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                                   114</span>

  correspond to the functions of the Police as set out in the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_366">Cr.P.C</a>., the

  nature of the power would not for this reason stand altered or relatable

  to Entry 2 of List III. It is not metaphorsis from List II to List III. In

  substance, issuance of an administrative/executive direction to the

  Police is an exercise of executive power relatable to the legislative entry

  pertain to Police.
</p>
<p id="p_339">
</p><p id="p_340">109)    Additionally, as already noted above, various provisions of the

  <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_367">Delhi Police Act</a>, 1978 also demonstrate that power of control and

  supervision is invested with the Administrator. This includes defining the

  limits and extent of the police station and administrative control over

  police stations.     Moreover, Entry 2 List II would also include the

  determination as to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by

  the Police. Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it

  would be permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere

  of the ACB.
</p>
<p id="p_341">
</p><p id="p_342">110)    No doubt, <a href="/doc/1904461/" id="a_368">Section 2(s)</a> of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment

  of the police station by the State Government. However, the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_369">Cr.P.C</a>.

  also lays down the procedure for making arrest, conducting investigation

  and submitting final reports. It does not contain any provision which

  prescribes what offences would be investigated by which police force.

  <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_370">Section 156</a> of the Cr.P.C. merely provides that officers in the police
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                       115</span>

      station will investigate those cognizable cases which can be tried by the

      court having jurisdiction over the local area concerned would have

      power to inquire into or try. These provisions do not provide how parallel

      jurisdiction of two police stations is to be demarcated. In fact, parallel

      jurisdiction to investigate is not contemplated by <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_371">Cr.P.C</a>. as that would

      result in chaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose of

      investigation. This leads us to hold that the Government which has

      competence over Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and

      demarcate the jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces.

      Hence the impugned notifications are valid. This conclusion becomes

      inevitable when <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_372">Cr.P.C</a>. is read with the <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_373">Delhi Police Act</a>, 1978 and other

      cognate enactments.
</p>
<p id="p_343">
</p><p id="p_344">    111)   Here we have to keep mind the fact that Entry 1 of List II, subject

      matter whereof is ‘public order’, also stands excluded from the purview

      of GNCTD and is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central

      Executive. The term ‘public order’ has been assigned widest amplitude

      and connotation (See – <a href="/doc/1308071/" id="a_374">Stainislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> and

      <a href="/doc/37174/" id="a_375">Others7 and Zameer Ahmed Latifur Rehman Sheikh v. State of

      Maharashtra and Others8</a>). It is also held that ‘public order’ includes

      cognizance of offences, search, seizure and arrest, followed by

      registration of reports of offences (FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial

7                 (1977) 1 SCC 677
8                 (2010) 5 SCC 246
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                   116</span>

  and in the event of conviction, execution of sentences as well. All these

  aspects have to be construed conjointly.
</p>
<p id="p_345">
</p><p id="p_346">112)   In fact, there was a specific rational in excluding Entries 1, 2 and

  18 of List II from the jurisdiction of the Government of NCTD. The

  Balakrishnan Committee report which recommended exclusion of these

  Entries (and which part of the Report stands accepted by providing so

  specifically in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_376">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution) was of the view that

  duties and responsibilities pertaining to the Police and maintenance of

  public order be vested solely in the Central Government so that ‘there is

  no confusion or overlap of the jurisdiction in regard to the focal point of

  control and coordination’. This rationale behind the aforesaid exclusion

  directly flows from the unique position occupied by the NCTD as the

  nation’s capital and seat of the Central Government.



</p><p id="p_347">113)   Also, the opinion of Chandrachud, J. at paragraph 29 notes that

  exclusion of inter alia ‘police’ and ‘public order’ was a “constitutional

  indication of the fact that the NCT has been considered to be of specific

  importance from the perspective of the nation to exclude three important

  areas which have a vital bearing on its status as a national capital”.

  Following observations from the said opinion are also apt:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">       "The NCT embodies, in its character as a capital city the political
       symbolism underlying national governance. The circumstances
       pertaining to the governance of the NCT may have a direct and
       immediate impact upon the collective welfare of the nation. This
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">                                      117</span>

        is the rationale for exclusion of the subjects of police, public order
        and land from the legislative power and necessarily from the
        executive power of the NCT... (paragraph 55)”

                            xx              xx        xx

        “...national imperatives have led to the carving out of the areas of
        police, public order and land from the sphere of legislative
        authority of the legislative assembly and their entrustment to
        Parliament… (paragraph 74)”


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">114)    Pertinently, the appellant wants exclusive executive power in

  respect of the entries in List II, except Entries 1, 2 and 18, as well as all

  the subjects over List III. In this behalf, as noted above, contention of

  the appellant is that the Constitution Bench has so decided. However,

  when it comes to excepted matter in Entry 2 List II, though powers of

  NCTD are totally excluded, by indirect method the appellant wants

  concurrent jurisdiction over the same. It would be difficult to accept such

  a position. It is also pertinent to mention that insofar as Notification

  dated November 08, 1993 is concerned, whereby ACB of NCTD at Old

  Secretariat as police station was created by the Lieutenant Governor,

  the same has not been challenged. No doubt, there was no elected

  Government at that time. Fact remains that this Notification has held the

  field even thereafter throughout. The impugned Notifications are only a

  modification to the aforesaid Notification dated November 08, 1993 to a

  limited extent whereby it is clarified that this earlier Notification shall be

  applicable to ‘the officers and employees of that Government only

  (GNCTD)’. Thus, the only effect is that the ACB is not empowered to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">                                        118</span>

     investigate into the offences of Central Government employees under

     the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_377">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>. Admittedly, this investigation is carried

     out by the CBI.         Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict of

     jurisdiction as well.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_91">119)      Mr. Naphade submitted that while holding that the “State

  Government” in the above definition of “appropriate Government” does

  not include the Government of NCT of Delhi, the High Court has applied

  the definition of State Government under Section 3(60) of the GC Act

  and this is another issue where the said definition has been

  mechanically applied, without understanding the context or text of the

  enactment.

<p id="p_359">   120)      In respect of this issue, the High Court has held that “In the light of

      the clear and unambiguous definitions of the Central Government and

      State Government under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_381">Section 3(8)</a> and <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_382">Section 3(60)</a> respectively of

      the GC Act, we are of the view that the expression ‘appropriate

      Government’ in respect of Union Territories shall be the Central

      Government only” and further held that even if GNCTD is appropriate

      government, that the impugned notification appointing the Commission

      of Enquiry could not be sustained as the same was passed without

      seeking views/concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor. It was argued

      that as far as the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor is concerned,

      it has already been held by the Constitution Bench that no concurrence

      is required.9


</p><p id="p_360">   121)      Attention was also drawn to the Statement of Objects and

      Reasons appended to the original Bill No. 39 of 1952 introduced in

      Parliament to bring about the enactment the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_383">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>,

      1952. It reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_92">             "Commissions and Committees of Inquiry are at present
             appointed by Government under executive order; there is no
             central law to regulate the power of such bodies. Some of them
             have felt handicapped because of the absence of any
             statutory power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and
             the production of documents. In order to remove this
             difficulty, ad hoc legislation has been passed from time to
             time, such as for example, the Sugar Crisis Inquiring

9                   However, we may add here that even if no concurrence is required, the
matter has to be sent to the LG for his views, in terms of proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_384">Article 239AA(4</a>), which,
of course, has to be within the parameters specified in the opinion authored by Justice
Chandrachud and contained in paras 140-142 already extracted above.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                     121</span>

<p id="p_361">        <a href="/doc/32871775/" id="a_385">Authority Act</a>, 1950. It is felt that there should be a general
        law authorizing Government to appoint an inquiring authority
        on any matter of public importance, whenever considered
        necessary, or when a demand to that effect is made by the
        Legislature and that such law should enable the inquiring authority
        to exercise certain specific powers including the powers to
        summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and to compel
        persons to furnish information. The Bill is designed to achieve this
        object.”


</p><p id="p_362">122)    Another submission is that the power to appoint a commission of

  enquiry generally and even under the COI Act, 1952 is a power

  incidental to governance as it is a means of a government informing

  itself of matters of public importance. By its very nature and in the

  interest of good governance and in principle, such a power cannot be

  denied to any government. Furthermore, the power to appoint a

  commission of inquiry, whether dehors the COI Act, 1952 or in terms of

  the Act is traceable to Entry 45 of List III. Thus, the power simpliciter to

  appoint a Commission of Enquiry exists with the Council of Ministers of

  GNCTD by virtue of Entry 45. The COI Act, 1952 only facilitates and

  provides the procedure for conducting such an enquiry. It does not make

  any sense to deny the Government of NCT of Delhi this procedural

  benefit, when it otherwise has the power to appoint an enquiry under

  Entry 45 of List III. More so, when the Delhi Assembly can pass a law

  setting up a commission of inquiry for instance on transport, water

  resources or primary health centres in order to better inform itself for the

  formulation of policy.

</p><p id="p_364">123)   On the above basis, it is argued that reliance on Section 3(60) of

  the GC Act is unsustainable. The High Court has applied Section 3(60)

  of the GC Act without understanding the context of appointment of

  Commission of Inquiries and without appreciating that the COI Act is

  only a procedural mechanism for exercise of power which exists

  independent of this Act in the NCT of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_365">
</p><p id="p_366">124)   On this subject matter, Mr. Maninder Singh responded to the

  aforesaid arguments of Mr. Naphade. His first submission is that COI

  Act is a Parliamentary enactment and, therefore, implementation thereof

  has to be as per the provisions of the said Act. He referred to para 12 of

  the judgment in Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur’s case which reads as

  under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">       "12. It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of
       what executive function means and implies. Ordinarily the
       executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions
       that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">              The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the
       doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the
       functions of the different parts or branches of the Government
       have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very
       well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate
       assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that
       essentially belong to another. The executive indeed can exercise
       the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such
       powers are delegated to it by the legislature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">              It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions
       in a limited way. The executive Government, however, can never
       go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law. This is
       clear from the provisions of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_386">Article 154</a> of the Constitution but, as
       we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                        123</span>

            enable the executive to function there must be a law already in
            existence and that the powers of the executive are limited merely
            to the carrying out of these laws.”


            Adverting to the provisions of COI Act, he submitted that <a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_387">Section

       2(a)</a> defines “appropriate government”. According to him, clause 2(i)

       which defines “State Government” does not include GNCTD.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_367">     125)   Mr. Gautam Khazanchi, advocate who appeared on behalf of

       respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 2360 of 2017 also supported the

       stand taken by Mr. Maninder Singh. He added to the aforesaid

       contention by arguing that notification dated August 20, 1996, which

       gives power to the LG, remains unchanged. According to him, this

       notification dated August 20, 1966 is a specific statutory delegation

       which accorded the status of the competent authority on the LG under

       the COI Act. Therefore, it is the administrative of any Union Territory (LG

       in the case of NCTD) who is competent to exercise the discharge the

       function of the ‘State Government’ under this Act.       This position, he

       argued, has not changed even after the Constitutional amendment and

       enacting of GNCTD Act, 1991. The learned counsel submitted that in

       <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_388">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu Alias Afsan Guru</a> 10, one of the

       arguments raised by the defence was that valid sanction had not been

       obtained as per <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_389">Section 196</a> of the Cr.P.C. in order to prosecute the

       accused persons. However, the Court noted:
</p>
<p id="p_368">10                (2005) 11 SCC 600
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                    124</span>

       "11. As regards the sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_390">Section 196</a> CrPC it is recited
       in the sanction order (Ext. P-11/2) that the Lieutenant Governor
       acted in exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (1) of
       <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_391">Section 196</a> CrPC read with the Government of India, Ministry of
       Home Affairs notification dated 20-3-1974. Under that notification,
       there was delegation of powers to the Lieutenant Governor to
       grant sanction. The said notification which finds place in the
       annexures to the written submissions made on behalf of Gilani
       shows that it was issued under <a href="/doc/148903/" id="a_392">Article 239(1)</a> of the Constitution
       enabling the Administrator of the Union Territory to discharge
       powers and functions of the State Government under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_393">CrPC</a>. We
       accept the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the State
       that the delegation of power contained in the said notification will
       continue to operate unless Parliament by law provides otherwise.
       The Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991 does not in any way
       affect the validity of delegation contained in the presidential
       notification issued under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_394">Article 239</a>.”


</p><p id="p_369">126)   He pointed out that this judgment was also placed before the

  Constitution Bench while considering the proposition that the executive

  power of the State Government is limited under the Constitutional

  scheme, even after the enactment of the GNCTD Act. Chandrachud, J.

  opined that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_96">       "450. The issue as to whether the Lieutenant Governor of the
       NCT is competent to accord sanction for prosecution under the
       <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_395">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a> and the Code of Criminal Procedure
       was considered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_396">State (NCT
       of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu [State (NCT of Delhi</a>) v. Navjot Sandhu,
       (2005) 11 SCC 600 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715] (Navjot Sandhu). In
       that case, sanctions under both the statutes were accorded “by
       order and in the name of the Lieutenant Governor”. The sanction
       under <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_397">Section 50</a> of POTA was urged to be a nullity on the ground
       that in relation to the Union Territory only the Central Government
       was competent to accord it. <a href="/doc/1336555/" id="a_398">Section 2(1)(h)</a> of POTA defined the
       expression “State” in relation to a Union Territory, to mean the
       Administrator thereof. Rejecting the challenge, this Court held that
       under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_399">Article 239-AA</a>, the Administrator appointed under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_400">Article

       which is merged into the new designation of Lieutenant Governor
       “in keeping with the upgraded status of this particular Union
       Territory”. The Lieutenant Governor, who continues to be an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                                    125</span>

       Administrator, was held to derive authority to grant sanction under
       <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_401">Section 50</a> by reason of the legislative fiction under <a href="/doc/1231789/" id="a_402">Section 2(1)</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_97">       (h), the Administrator being deemed to be the State Government
       for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_403">Section 50</a>. Hence: (SCC p. 654, para 10)

          “10. … by virtue of specific statutory delegation in favour of
          the Administrator who is constitutionally designated as the
          Lieutenant Governor as well, the sanction accorded by the
          said authority is a valid sanction under <a href="/doc/1869380/" id="a_404">Section 50</a> of POTA.”

       The decision in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_405">Navjot Sandhu [State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot
       Sandhu</a>, (2005) 11 SCC 600 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715] turned upon
       a specific statutory delegation in favour of the Administrator to
       grant sanction. It is hence of no assistance to the present
       constitutional context.”


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_98">127)   The learned counsel also sought to draw sustenance from Section

  41(1)(ii) of the GNCTD Act which states that the LG shall act in his

  discretion in matters where he is required to, under any law. Since the

  LG is the ‘Appropriate Government’ under the COI Act, he is bound to

  exercise his discretion as envisaged under Section 41 of the GNCTD

  Act. The power of the LG to act in his own discretion where he is

  required to under any law has been affirmed by the Constitution Bench

  decision.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_370">128)   In the alternative, and without prejudice to the aforesaid

  arguments, the learned counsel argued that in any event, the notification

  dated August 11, 2015 constituting Commission of Inquiry is violative of

  GNCTD Act and ToBR.          To buttress this submission, he referred to

  Section 45 of the GNCTD Act as well as Rule 23 of ToBR as per which

  every decision taken by the Council of Ministers has to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                                   126</span>

  communicated to the LG to keep him apprised and to enable him to

  exercise the power conferred upon him under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_406">Article 239AA(4)</a> and the

  proviso thereof. Unless the LG is kept informed of all decisions, he

  cannot exercise the Constitutional power to disagree vested upon him, if

  need be, and thus, cannot make a reference to the President. Another

  submission of Mr. Gautam Khazanchi was that the notification dated

  August 11, 2015 was the result of malafide power of the GNCTD.

  According to him, the matter had been investigated by the ACB, dealt

  with by the LG and was also the subject matter of an Inquiry headed by

  a retired Chief Justice of a High Court. Initiation of a second round by

  constitution of Commission of Inquiry to look into the very same

  allegations investigated by the ACB was not only an abuse of the

  process but an excess of authority exercised by it to do indirectly what it

  could not do directly.
</p>
<p id="p_371">
</p><p id="p_372">129)    From the arguments noted above, it becomes apparent that the

  outcome of this issue hinges upon the meaning that is to be assigned to

  the expression ‘State Government’ occurring in Section 2(a) of the COI

  Act which defines ‘Appropriate Government’.         To put it otherwise,

  whether the term State Government would include ‘Union Territory’? For

  this purpose, one will have to fall back on the GC Act. Section 3(8) of

  the GC Act defines Central Government and relevant portion thereof is

  as under:

<p id="p_379">131)   The GC Act also defines ‘Government’, ‘State’ and ‘Union

  Territory’. We would like to reproduce these definitions as well:

            territory comprised within the territory of India but not specified in
            that Schedule;”


</p><p id="p_382">     132)   No doubt, definition of State as contained in <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_409">Section 3(58)</a> includes

       Union Territory. However, we are concerned with the meaning of ‘State

       Government’ which is defined in Section 2(60) of the GC Act. Here, it is

       specifically provided that in respect of Union Territory, the State

       Government would mean the Central Government.


</p><p id="p_383">     133)   It would be appropriate to remark that this aspect had come up for

       consideration in the case of Goa Sampling Employees’ <a href="/doc/1507353/" id="a_410">Association v.

       General Superintendence Co. of India11</a>, though in the context of

       definition of “Appropriate Government” contained in <a href="/doc/1737494/" id="a_411">Section 2(a)</a> of the

       Industrial Disputes Act. Goa was Union Territory at that point of time.

       The workman had raised dispute and reference in this respect was

       made by the Central Government to the industrial tribunal. This power

       of Central Government to make the reference was challenged by the

       management taking a specific plea that the Central Government was not

       the Appropriate Government in relation to the Union Territory.                This

       contention was repelled by the industrial tribunal but upheld by the High

       Court. High Court had held that the administrator of the Union Territory
11                (1985) 1 SCC 206
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                 129</span>

of Goa, Daman &amp; Diu shall be the administrator who could make the

reference. This Court set aside the order of the High Court and upheld

that of the industrial tribunal holding that Central Government was the

Appropriate Government in respect of Union Territory. After referring to

the definition of ‘Appropriate Government’ in <a href="/doc/1737494/" id="a_412">Section 2(a)</a> of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court relied upon the provisions of GC Act

contained in <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_413">Section 3(8)</a> and <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_414">Section 3(60)</a> thereof.            The Court

observed that there is a distinction between “States” and “Union

Territories” and also between “State Government” and “Administration of

a Union Territory”. It held that the “Administration of a Union Territory”

would not be comprehended in the expression “State Government”. It

was held that the “State Government” in a Union Territory would mean

the “Central Government”, in terms of Section 3(60) of the GC Act. It

would not be constitutionally correct to describe the Administration of a

Union Territory as a “State Government”. This conclusion is arrived at in

the following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">     "12. Parliament enacted the <a href="/doc/1154689/" id="a_415">Government of Union Territories Act</a>,

     underlying the enactment, namely, to provide for Legislative
     Assemblies and Council of Ministers for certain Union Territories
     and for certain other matters. Union Territory of Goa, Daman and
     Diu is governed by the 1963 Act [See <a href="/doc/1982675/" id="a_416">Section 2(h)</a>]. The
     expression “Administrator” has been defined in <a href="/doc/1982675/" id="a_417">Section 2(a)</a> of the
     1963 Act to mean “the Administrator of a Union Territory appointed

matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly of the
Union Territory has power to make laws except insofar as he is
required by or under the Act to act in his discretion or by or under
any law to exercise any judicial or quasi-judicial functions. There
is a proviso to <a href="/doc/936864/" id="a_421">Section 44(1)</a> which sheds light on the position of
the Administrator and powers of the Council of Ministers.

therein by the President etc. Thus the executive power of the
Administrator extends to all subjects covered by the legislative
power. But in the event of a difference of opinion the President
decides the point. When President decides the point, it is the
Central Government that decides the point. And that is binding on
the Administrator and also the Ministers. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_422">Section 45</a> provides that
“the Chief Minister of a Union Territory shall be appointed by the
President”. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_423">Section 46</a> confers power on the President to make
rules for the conduct of business. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_424">Section 55</a> provides that “all
contracts in connection with the administration of a Union Territory
are contracts made in the exercise of the executive power of the
Union and all suits and proceedings in connection with the
administration of a Union Territory shall be instituted by or against
the Government of India”. In exercise of the power conferred by
<a href="/doc/1823046/" id="a_425">Article 240</a>, the President has inter alia enacted the Goa, Daman
and Diu (Laws) Regulation, 1962. By clause (3) of the regulation,
the Acts enumerated in the Schedule appended to the Act were
extended to the Goa, Daman and Diu subject to the notifications,
if any, specified in the Schedule. The Schedule includes <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_426">Industrial
Disputes Act</a>, 1947 as a whole without any modification.

</p><p id="p_386">14. Would it be constitutionally correct to describe Administration
of a Union Territory as State Government? <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_427">Article 1</a> provides that
“India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States”. Sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_428">article (2)</a>
provides that “the States and the territories thereof shall be as
specified in the First Schedule”. Sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_429">article (3)</a> introduced a
dichotomy between the State as understood in the Constitution
and the Union Territory when it provides that “the territory of India
shall comprise— (a) the territories of the States; and (b) the Union
Territories specified in the First Schedule”. The provisions of Part
VI of the Constitution do not apply to the Union Territories. Part VI
of the Constitution which deals with States clearly indicates that
the Union Territory is not a State. Therefore, the Union Territory
constitutionally speaking is something other than a State. As far
as the States are concerned, there has to be a Governor for each
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">                             131</span>

State though it would be permissible to appoint the same person
as Governor of two or more States. Part VIII provides for
administration of Union Territories. <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_430">Article 239</a> conferred power on
the President for the administration of Union Territories unless
otherwise provided by an Act of Parliament. Therefore, apart from
the definitions of the expressions “Central Government”, “State
Government” and “Union Territory” as enacted in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_431">General
Clauses Act</a>, 1897, the Constitution itself makes a distinction
between State and its Government called the State Government
and Union Territory and the Administration of the Union Territory.
Unless otherwise clearly enacted, the expression “State will not
comprehend Union Territory” and the “State Government” would
not comprehend Administration of Union Territory. Now if we recall
the definition of three expressions “Central Government” [<a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_432">Section
3(8)</a>,] “State Government” [<a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_433">Section 3(60)</a>] and “Union Territory”
[<a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_434">Section 3</a>(62-A)] in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_435">General Clauses Act</a>, it would
unmistakably show that the framers of the Constitution as also the
Parliament in enacting these definitions have clearly retained the
distinction between State Government and Administration of
Union Territory as provided by the Constitution. It is especially
made clear in the definition of expression “Central Government”
that in relation to the Administration of a Union Territory, the
Administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority given
to him under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_436">Article 239</a> of the Constitution, would be
comprehended in the expression “Central Government”. When
this inclusionary part is put in juxtaposition with exclusionary part
in the definition of the expression “State Government” which
provides that as respects anything done or to be done after the
commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act,
1956, it shall mean, in a State, the Governor, and in a Union
Territory, the Central Government, the difference conceptually
speaking between the expression “State Government” and the
“Administration of a Union Territory” clearly emerges. Therefore,
there is no room for doubt that the expression “Administration of a
Union Territory”, Administrator howsoever having been described,
would not be comprehended in the expression “State
Government” as used in any enactment. These definitions have
been modified to bring them to their present format by Adaptation
of Laws (No. 1) Order, 1956. <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_437">Section 3</a> of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 provides that in all <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_438">Central Act</a>s and Regulations made
after the commencement of the Act unless there is
anythingrepugnant in the subject or context, the words defined
therein will have the meaning assigned therein. Indisputably the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_439">Central Act</a> enacted after the
commencement of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_440">General Clauses Act</a> and the relevant
definitions having been recast to meet the constitutional and
statutory requirements, the expressions “Central Government”,
“State Government” and “Union Territory” must receive the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">                             132</span>

meaning assigned to each in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_441">General Clauses Act</a> unless
there is anything repugnant in the subject or context in which it is
used. No such repugnancy was brought to our notice. Therefore,
these expressions must receive the meaning assigned to them.

</p><p id="p_387">15. The High Court after referring to the definitions of the
aforementioned three expressions as set out and discussed
herein first observed that on a careful reading of the definition, it
appears “that in relation to the administration of a Union Territory,
the Administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority
given to him under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_442">Article 239</a> of the Constitution is the Central
Government”. So far there is no dispute. The High Court then
observed that “it must follow that the Administrator is the State
Government insofar as the Union Territory is concerned, and it is
so provided in the definition of the State Government in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_443">Section
3(60)</a> of the General Clauses Act”. The High Court fell into an
error in interpreting clause (c) of <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_444">Section 3(60)</a> which upon its true
construction would show that in the Union Territory, there is no
concept of State Government but wherever the expression “State
Government” is used in relation to the Union Territory, the Central
Government would be the State Government. The very concept of
State Government in relation to Union Territory is obliterated by
the definition. Our attention was, however, drawn to the two
decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/542092/" id="a_445">Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev</a> [AIR
1954 SC 587 : 1955 SCR 549 : 1954 SCJ 764 : 10 ELR 103] and
the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/67432/" id="a_446">State of Madhya Pradesh v. Shri
Moula Bux</a> [AIR 1962 SC 145 : (1962) 2 SCR 794 : (1961) 2 SCJ
549] in which with reference to Part C States, some observations
have been made that “the authority conferred under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_447">Article 239</a>,
as it then stood, to administer Part C States has not the effect of
converting those States into the Central Government, and that
under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_448">Article 239</a> the President occupies in regard to Part C
States, a position analogous to that of a Governor in Part A States
and of a Rajpramukh in Part B States”. It was also observed that
“though the Part C States are centrally administered under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_449">Article 239</a>, they do not cease to be States and
become merged with the Central Government”. It was then urged
that by the amendment to Articles 239 and 240 by the Constitution
(Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 and introduction of Articles
239-A and 239-B by the Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment)
Act, 1962, only the nomenclature of the Part C States has
undergone a change, now being described as Union Territory, but
the position of the Union Territory is the same as it was as Part C
States and therefore, the view taken in the aforementioned
decisions that the administration of Part C States could
appropriately be described as State Government would mutatis
mutandis apply to the administration of Union Territories. In other
words, it was said that they can be appropriately described as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">                                     133</span>

       State Governments for various purposes. Both the decisions were
       rendered prior to the amendment of Part VIII of the Constitution in
       1956 and the insertion of the Articles 239-A and 239-B in 1962
       and more specifically after the enactment of the 1963 Act. The
       concept of Union Territory with or without a Legislative Assembly
       and with or without a Council of Ministers with specified legislative
       and executive powers have been set out in the 1963 Act. Coupled
       with this, modifications were made in the definitions of
       aforementioned three expressions. Therefore, the two decisions
       are of no assistance in resolution of the present controversy.”


</p><p id="p_388">134)   We may also usefully refer to the opinion of Chandrachud, J. in the

  Constitution Bench judgment, where the learned Judge has specifically

  dealt with the aforesaid case of              Goa Sampling Employees

  Association and held that there is no ‘State Government’ in the Union

  Territory and the State Government shall mean the Central Government.

  It is so stated in Para 448 of the opinion which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_111">       "448. Dealing with the provisions of <a href="/doc/936864/" id="a_450">Section 44(1)</a> of the 1963 Act,
       this Court observed thus: (Goa Sampling case [<a href="/doc/1507353/" id="a_451">Goa Sampling
       Employees' Assn. v. General Superintendence Co. of India (P)
       Ltd</a>., (1985) 1 SCC 206 : 1985 SCC (L&amp;S) 201] , SCC p. 213,
       para 12)

          “12. … According to the proviso in the event of a difference
          of opinion between the Administrator and the Ministers on
          any matter, the Administrator shall refer it to the President for
          decision given therein by the President, etc. Thus the
          executive power of the Administrator extends to all subjects
          covered by the legislative power. But in the event of a
          difference of opinion the President decides the point. When
          President decides the point, it is the Central Government
          that decides the point.”

       The Court noticed that the provisions of Part VI of the Constitution
       which deal with the States clearly indicate that a Union Territory
       administration is not a State Government. The Court observed
       that the Constitution makes a distinction between a State and its
       Government (called the State Government) on one hand and the
       Union Territory and its administration on the other hand. This
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                            134</span>

distinction, the Court observed, was carried in the definition
contained in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_452">General Clauses Act</a>: (SCC p. 214, para 14)

  “14. … Now if we recall the definition of three expressions
  “Central Government” [<a href="/doc/776860/" id="a_453">Section 3(8)</a>], “State Government”
  [<a href="/doc/776860/" id="a_454">Section 3(60)</a>] and “Union Territory” [<a href="/doc/776860/" id="a_455">Section 3</a>(62-A)] in the
  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_456">General Clauses Act</a>, it would unmistakably show that the
  Framers of the Constitution as also Parliament in enacting
  these definitions have clearly retained the distinction
  between State Government and Administration of Union
  Territory as provided by the Constitution. It is especially
  made clear in the definition of expression “Central
  Government” that in relation to the Administration of a Union
  Territory, the Administrator thereof acting within the scope of
  the authority given to him under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_457">Article 239</a> of the
  Constitution, would be comprehended in the expression
  “Central Government”. When this inclusionary part is put in
  juxtaposition with exclusionary part in the definition of the
  expression “State Government” which provides that as
  respects anything done or to be done after the
  commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment)
  Act, 1956, it shall mean, in a State, the Governor, and in a
  Union Territory, the Central Government, the difference
  conceptually speaking between the expression “State
  Government” and the “Administration of a Union Territory”
  clearly emerges. Therefore, there is no room for doubt that
  the expression “Administration of a Union Territory”,
  Administrator howsoever having been described, would not
  be comprehended in the expression “State Government” as
  used in any enactment.”

The view of the High Court that the Administrator is the State
Government insofar as the Union Territory is concerned under
<a href="/doc/776860/" id="a_458">Section 3(60)</a> was held to be in error. The decisions in <a href="/doc/542092/" id="a_459">Satya Dev
Bushahri [Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev</a>, AIR 1954 SC 587 :
</blockquote><p id="p_389">(1955) 1 SCR 549] and in State of Vindhya Pradesh v. Moula Bux
[State of Vindhya Pradesh v. Moula Bux, (1962) 2 SCR 794 : AIR
1962 SC 145] were distinguished since they were rendered prior
to the amendment of Part VIII of the Constitution in 1956 and
before the insertion of Articles 239-A and 239-B. The position in
law was set out as follows: (Goa Sampling case [<a href="/doc/1507353/" id="a_460">Goa Sampling
Employees' Assn. v. General Superintendence Co. of India (P)
Ltd</a>., (1985) 1 SCC 206 : 1985 SCC (L&amp;S) 201] , SCC p. 217,
para 17)

  “17. … On a conspectus of the relevant provisions of the
  Constitution and the 1963 Act, it clearly transpires that the
  concept of State Government is foreign to the administration
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                                    135</span>

         of Union Territory and <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_461">Article 239</a> provides that every Union
         Territory is to be administered by the President. The
         President may act through an Administrator appointed by
         him. Administrator is thus the delegate of the President. His
         position is wholly different from that of a Governor of a State.
         Administrator can differ with his Minister and he must then
         obtain the orders of the President meaning thereby of the
         Central Government. Therefore, at any rate the
         Administrator of Union Territory does not qualify for the
         description of a State Government. Therefore, the Central
         Government is the “appropriate Government”.”


</p><p id="p_390">135)   We, therefore, are unable to accept the submission of Mr.

  Naphade that the expression ‘State Government’ occurring in Section

  2(a) of the COI Act would mean GNCTD, a Union Territory.


</p><p id="p_391">136)   It is not for us to deal with the argument of Mr. Naphade that Entry

  45 of List III confers legislative and executive competence on GNCTD

  and, therefore, GNCTD can pass an appropriate order appointing a

  Commission of Inquiry in exercise of its executive power. In the instant

  case, we are concerned with notification dated August 11, 2015 which is

  passed under the COI Act. We, therefore, uphold the judgment of the

  High Court on this aspect.

</p><p id="p_399">139)   Certain definitions which were referred to by Mr. Sibal from DER

  Act may also be noted.         Under Section 2(d) of the DER Act, 2000

  “Government” means the Lieutenant Governor referred to in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_468">Article

  239AA</a> of the Constitution” and under <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_469">Section 2(g)</a> “Lieutenant Governor”

  means the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi

  appointed by the president under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_470">Article 239</a> read with <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_471">Article 239AA</a> of

</p><p id="p_400">140)   His submission on the conjoint reading of the aforesaid definitions

  was that Government is defined as LG referred to in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_474">Article 239AA</a> of the

  239AA</a> has categorically held that LG is to act on the aid and advice of

  the Council of Ministers, and only those matters are excepted where LG

  has to function in his own discretion, which was not the case here.

  Moreover, DER Act was passed by Delhi Legislative Assembly.

  Therefore, even the executive power of the Union will not be there.

       power of the Governor under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_476">Article 163</a> of the Constitution.          This

       judgment also provides instances of situations wherein Governor may

       exercise power “in his discretion” independent of, or, contrary to aid and

       advice of Council of Ministers. Based on that, Mr. Sibal submitted that

       exercise of powers under the DER Act does not fall within the domain of

       discretionary power of the LG and, therefore, he is supposed to act on

       the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.

       after the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_478">Article 239AA.</a> Under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_479">Section 108</a> of the Electricity

       Act, 2003, it is the jurisdiction of the ‘State Government’ to issue any

       direction to DERC and such State Government, in relation to Union

       Territory like Delhi, would mean Central Government as per Section

       3(60) of the GC Act.        He also referred to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_480">Section 83(1)(b)</a> of the

       Electricity Act, 2003 which makes it clear that for any Union Territory, it

  GNCTD. That conclusion is arrived at while interpreting the provisions

  <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_482">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 which also defines ‘Appropriate Government’.

  <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_483">Section 2(5)</a> thereof reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">        "5. "Appropriate Government" means,-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_121">        (a) the Central Government,-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_122">          (i) in respect of a generating company wholly or partly
          owned by it;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_123">          (ii) in relation to any inter-State generation, transmission,
          trading or supply of electricity and with respect to any mines,
          oil-fields, railways, national highways, airports, telegraphs,
          broadcasting stations and any works of defence, dockyard,
          nuclear power installations;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_124">          (iii) in respect of the National Load Despatch Centre and
          Regional Load Despatch Centre;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_125">          (iv) in relation to any works or electric installation belonging
          to it or under its control;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_126">        (b) in any other case, the State Government having jurisdiction
        under this Act;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_405">144)    As can be seen from clause (b) above, Appropriate Government is

  the State Government having jurisdiction under this Act in all those

  cases which do not come within the domain of ‘Central Government’.

  This definition contained in <a href="/doc/51837307/" id="a_484">Section 2(5)</a> of the Electricity Act is materially

  different from definition of Appropriate Government in Section 2(a) of the

  COI Act. Another important and distinguishing aspect is that in respect
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                     140</span>

  of Delhi, the DER Act has also been enacted by the State Legislative

  Assembly of NCT of Delhi to which President has accorded his consent.

  Under this Act, Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has

  been established to exercise the powers conferred on, and to perform

  the functions assigned to it under the said Act. It acts as a quasi-judicial

  body which is clear from Section 10 of the DER Act.                 <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_485">Section 11</a>

  stipulates various functions which DERC is supposed to perform which

  include determination of tariff for electricity, wholesale, bulk, grid or retail,

  as the case may be; and to determine the tariff payable for the use of

  transmission facility etc. In essence, such powers are almost the same

  powers which are given to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission

  (CERC).      Thus, insofar as NCTD is concerned, it has its own

  Commission, namely, DERC.             DER Act also stipulates powers of

  Government in Part IV thereof. General powers of the Government,

  inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC in matters of policy

  involving public interest, as the Government may issue from time to

  time. These powers are akin to the powers given under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_486">Section 108</a> of

  the Electricity Act, 2003. Government is defined in Section 2(d) of DER

  Act as under:
</p>
<p id="p_406">        "2(d) “Government” means the Lieutenant Governor referred to in
        <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_487">article 239AA</a> of the Constitution;
</p>
<p id="p_407">
</p><p id="p_408">145)    Reading the aforesaid definition in the context of the Constitution

  Bench judgment would clearly mean that LG here has to act on the aid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                      141</span>

  and advice of Council of Ministers, as such functions do not come within

  his discretionary powers.
</p>
<p id="p_409">
</p><p id="p_410">146)   What follows from the aforesaid is that insofar as DER Act is

  concerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly of

  NCTD. It operates within the NCTD. Government here means GNCTD

  i.e. LG who is supposed to act on the aid and advice of the Council of

  Ministers.     Under this Act, Delhi Government has power to issue

  directions to the DERC in matters of policies involving public interest.

  When such powers are conferred specifically to            Delhi Government

  under DER Act, it cannot be said that insofar as <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_488">Section 108</a> of the

  Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned, the expression ‘State Government’

  therein would mean the Central Government. If such an interpretation is

  given, there would clearly be a conflict of jurisdiction in the NCTD insofar

  as working of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_489">Electricity Act</a>/DER Act are concerned. As a result, and

  going by the dicta laid down by the Constitution Bench, we set aside the

  decision of the Delhi High Court on this aspect and hold that it was

  within   the    jurisdiction   of   GNCTD    to   issue    notification   No.

  F.11(58/2010/Power/1856) dated June 12, 2015. We may make it clear

  that we have not touched upon the merits of the said notification as that

  is not the issue before us.

<p id="p_413">148)      Validity of this notification was challenged on two counts, namely:

</p><p id="p_414">  (a) As the notification is issued in the name of LG, prior concurrence of

  LG was a pre-requisite for issuance of such a notification.

</p><p id="p_415">  (b)     Subject matter of the notification i.e. fixation of circle rates would

  fall under Entry 18 of List II over which the Parliament has the exclusive

  power inasmuch as it stands specifically excluded from the purview of

  GNCTD.
</p>
<p id="p_416">
</p><p id="p_417">149)      Argument of the appellant/GNCTD is that fixation of circle rate is

  not relatable to Entry 18 of List II i.e. ‘land’. It is the submission that

  stamp duty is imposed on an instrument with regard to the title of the

  land and not the land itself. Therefore, a stamp duty would be levied on

  an instrument and would affect the document evidencing the said

  transfer of the agricultural land, but not on the land itself. The occasion

  for levy of stamp duty is the execution of the document/conveyance, as

  distinguished from the immovable property which is the underlying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_142">                                    144</span>

  subject matter of the transaction dealt with in the document/conveyance.

  Thus, the order of 4th August, 2015 traceable to Entry 63 of List II, rather

  than Entry 18 of List II. Entry 63 of List II reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_132">        'Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than
        those specified in the provisions of List I with regard to rates
        of stamp duty.'

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_133">150)    The appellant has submitted that the phrase 'other than those

  specified in the provisions of List I ' in Entry 63 List II is of no assistance

  to the Union of India. An analysis of Entry 63 of List II and Entry 91 of

  List I (which is the concerned provision of List I) shows that a distinction

  can be observed between the powers of the central and state

  legislatures to impose/levy stamp duty. Entry 91 of List I reads as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_134">        '91. Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange, cheques,
        promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of
        insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts.'


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_135">151)    The Union is empowered to levy stamp duty ONLY on the specific

  types of instruments specified under Entry 91 of List I. But the State has

  been given the power to impose stamp duty on every other type of

  document/instrument not mentioned under Entry 91 of List I.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_136">152)    It is also argued that it is general practice all over the country for

  State Governments to set the circle rates for conveyance of immovable

  properties within the State. Examples of the same are Karnataka Stamp

  [Prevention of Undervaluation of Instrument Rules], 1977; Tamil Nadu

  Stamp [Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments] Rules, 1968;

</p><p id="p_420">153)   It was also pointed out that it was the Indian Stamp (Delhi

  Amendment) Act, 2001 which was passed by the Legislative Assembly

  of Delhi on 28th March, 2001 and received Presidential- assent on 18 th

  July, 2001 and the Indian Stamp (Delhi Amendment) Act, 2007 which

  was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi on 18th September,

  2007 and received     the Presidential assent on 5th November, 2007

  which in fact first dealt with the stamp duty payable on conveyance

  deeds in Delhi. Given that neither of these Acts have been challenged

  and in fact the Union has given its assent to these Acts, it is submitted

  that there can be no question of the Union now questioning the power of

  the GNCTD to collect such stamp duty and fix circle rates in respect of

  such collections.

</p><p id="p_422">     154)   The appellant also stated that <a href="/doc/180050689/" id="a_493">Section 27(3)</a> of the Indian Stamp

       Act, as amended in Delhi, that too with the express consent of the

       Union/President gives power to the Delhi Government to notify minimum

       rates for land for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty i.e. circle rate.

       <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_494">Section 27(3)</a> as amended for Delhi, reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_137">            "27. Facts affecting duty to be set forth in instrument

            (3) In the case of instruments relating to land, chargeable with

            valuation of land."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_138">                                                         [Emphasis Supplied]


            It is submitted that 'Government' under <a href="/doc/1426325/" id="a_495">Section 27(3)</a> must be read

       to mean "Government of NCT of Delhi".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_423">     155)   In reply, the respondents submit that <a href="/doc/180050689/" id="a_496">Section 27(3)</a> of the Indian

       Stamp Act is concerned with notifying minimum rates for valuation of

       land and it has nothing to do with ‘rates of stamp duty’. As per the

       respondents, power to notify minimum rates for valuation of land (circle

       rates) is relatable to Entry 18 of List II which falls within the exclusive

       domain of the Union. It is also argued that as per the law laid down in

       <a href="/doc/1612780/" id="a_497">State of Gujarat &amp; Ors. v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V.S. Mahamandal &amp;

       Ors</a>.13, entry in the Seventh Schedule is to be given its widest possisble

       interpretation. According to respondents, Entry 63 of List II only deals

       with ‘rates of stamp duty’ and, therefore, would not apply to ‘minimum

13                 (2004) 5 SCC 155
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">                                     147</span>

  rates for valuation of land’ which is relatable to Entry 18 of List II. It was

  also argued that by virtue of the Presidential Orders dated July 22, 1961

  and September 07, 1966 under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_498">Article 239</a>, the power of the Union

  under the <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_499">Indian Stamp Act</a>, 1899 for NCT Delhi had been delegated on

  the LG. All the previous notifications for notifying the circle rates in Delhi

  (July 18, 2007, March 14, 2008, November 15, 2011 etc.) had been

  issued by the LG in exercise of his delegated power under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_500">Article 239.</a>


</p><p id="p_424">156)    From the respective submissions, it becomes apparent that the

  entire controversy centers around the question as to whether the

  impugned notification is relatable to Entry 18 of List II i.e. ‘land’ or the

  subject matter falls within the scope of Entry 63 of List II. Entry 18 of

  List II reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_139">        "18. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures
        including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of
        rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land
        improvement and agriculture loans; colonization."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_425">  We may also note the language of Entry 63 List II:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_140">        "63. Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than
        those specified in the provisions of List I with regard to rates of
        stamp duty."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_426">157)    Insofar as Entry 91 of List I is concerned, subject matter thereof is

  within the exclusive domain of the Centre/Parliament. It deals with 'rates

  of stamp duty in respect of wills of exchange, cheques, promissory

  notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">                                   148</span>

  shares, debentures, proxies and receipts'.       It follows that insofar as

  instruments mentioned in Entry 91 of List I are concerned, rates of

  stamp duty of such documents are within the exclusive domain of the

  Union. In respect of other instruments, it is the State which has the

  necessary jurisdiction to fix the rates of stamp duty.


</p><p id="p_427">158)   It would be pertinent to note that the High Court in the impugned

  judgment has arrived at a conclusion that notification dated August 4,

  2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) is traceable to

  Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II. We are in agreement

  with this conclusion. Said notification is issued under the provisions of

  <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_501">Indian Stamp Act</a> and Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of

  Instruments) Rules, 2007. Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of

  payment of stamp duty. Therefore, they do not pertain to ‘land’ namely

  rights in or over land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of

  agricultural land etc. Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in

  reality a duty on transfer of property. In that sense, as rightly held by the

  High Court, the occasion for levy of stamp duty is the document which is

  executed as distinguished from the transaction which is embodied in the

  document.
</p>
<p id="p_428">
</p><p id="p_429">159)   Even after accepting the aforesaid plea of the GNCTD, the High

  Court has set aside the said notification on the ground that this decision

  of the Council of Ministers was without seeking views/concurrence of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">                                    149</span>

  LG. As per the High Court, such an order could not be issued unless the

  decision of the Council of Ministers is communicated to the LG.


</p><p id="p_430">160)   From the judgment of the Constitution Bench, it is clear that the

  Council of Ministers have a right to take such a decision. Discussion to

  this extent of the High Court is expressed in Paras 107, 108, 116 and

  117 of its judgment may not be entirely correct. These paras read as

  under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_141">       "107. In the light of the above-noticed provisions, we have no
       manner of doubt to conclude that every decision taken by the
       Council of Ministers shall be communicated to the Lt. Governor for
       his views. The orders in terms of the decision of the Council of
       Ministers can be issued only where no reference to the Central
       Government is required as provided in Chapter V of the
       Transaction of Business Rules.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_142">       108. Making a reference by the Lt. Governor to the Central
       Government as provided under Chapter V of the Transaction of
       Business Rules is possible only when the decision is
       communicated to the Lt. Governor. Therefore, there is no
       substance in the contention that an order can be passed pursuant
       to the decision of the Council of Ministers without communicating
       such decision to the Lt.Governor for his views/concurrence with
       respect to any of the matters enumerated in List-II or List-III
       except the three reserved matters in Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List-II.
       The emphasis sought to be laid by the learned Senior Counsels
       who appeared for GNCTD on Rule 23 of the Transaction of
       Business Rules to substantiate the contention that those
       proposals which are mentioned in Rule 23 alone are required to
       be submitted to Lt. Governor is misplaced. The word "essentially"
       employed in Rule 23 makes clear the legislative intent that the
       proposals specified (i) to (viii) therein are not exhaustive. Any
       interpretation contra would render the Transaction of Business

<blockquote id="blockquote_145">       117. Hence, the contention on behalf of the Government of
       NCT of Delhi that the Lt. Governor is bound to act only on the

       cannot be accepted.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_431">161)   The Constitution Bench judgment of this Court clarifies that in all

  those matters which do not fall within the discretionary jurisdiction of the

  LG, the LG is bound to act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.

  Further, majority opinion also holds that executive power of the GNCTD

  extends to all the subject matters contained in List II (except Entry 1, 2

  and 18) as well as List III (wherein it has concurrent jurisdiction along

  with the Central Government). That is the interpretation accorded to

  clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_503">Article 239AA.</a> At the same time, this clause contains a

  proviso as well which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_146">       "Provided that in the case of difference of opinion between the
       Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the
       Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision
       given thereon by the President and pending such decision it shall
       be competent for the Lieutenant Governor in any case where the
       matter, in his opinion, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to
       take immediate action, to take such action or to give such
       direction in the matter as he deems necessary.”
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_147">162)   Interpreting this proviso, it is held as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_148">       "215. Now, it is essential to analyse clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_504">Article 239-AA</a>,
       the most important provision for determination of the controversy
       at hand. Clause (4) stipulates a Westminster style Cabinet system
       of Government for NCT of Delhi where there shall be a Council of
       Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the
       Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to
       matters with respect to which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has

<blockquote id="blockquote_149">216. The proviso to clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_505">Article 239-AA</a> stipulates that in

shall refer it to the President for a binding decision. Further,
pending such decision by the President, in any case where the
matter, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, is so urgent that
it is necessary for him to take immediate action, the proviso
makes him competent to take such action and issue such
directions as he deems necessary.

<p id="p_432">217. A conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_506">Article 239-AA(3)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_507">Article
239-AA(4)</a> reveals that the executive power of the Government of
NCT of Delhi is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi
Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_508">Article 239-AA(3)</a> and
which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all
subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_509">Article 239-AA(4)</a>
confers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all those
subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative
power.
</p>
<p id="p_433">218. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_510">Article 239-AA(3)(a)</a> reserves Parliament's legislative power
on all matters in the State List and Concurrent List, but clause (4)
nowhere reserves the executive powers of the Union with respect
to such matters. On the contrary, clause (4) explicitly grants to the
Government of Delhi executive powers in relation to matters for
which the Legislative Assembly has power to legislate. The
legislative power is conferred upon the Assembly to enact
whereas the policy of the legislation has to be given effect to by
the executive for which the Government of Delhi has to have
coextensive executive powers. Such a view is in consonance with
the observation in <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_511">Ram Jawaya Kapur [Ram Jawaya Kapur v.
State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1955 SC 549] which has been discussed
elaborately in the earlier part of the judgment.

</p><p id="p_435">232. From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the words “any
matter” occurring in the proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_512">Article 239-AA(4)</a> do not
necessarily need to be construed to mean “every matter”. As
highlighted in the authorities referred to hereinabove, the word
“any” occurring in a statute or constitutional provision is not to be
mechanically read to mean “every” and the context in which the
word has been used must be given due weightage so as to
deduce the real intention and purpose in which the word has been
used.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                              152</span><p id="p_436">


</p><p id="p_437">233. It has to be clearly understood that though “any” may not
mean “every”, yet how it should be understood is extremely
significant. Let us elaborate. The power given to the Lieutenant
Governor under the proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_513">Article 239-AA(4)</a> contains the rule
of exception and should not be treated as a general norm. The
Lieutenant Governor is to act with constitutional objectivity
keeping in view the high degree of constitutional trust reposed in
him while exercising the special power ordained upon him unlike
the Governor and the President who are bound by the aid and
advice of their Ministers. The Lieutenant Governor need not, in a
mechanical manner, refer every decision of his Ministers to the
President. He has to be guided by the concept of constitutional
morality. There have to be some valid grounds for the Lieutenant
Governor to refer the decision of the Council of Ministers to the
President in order to protect the interest of NCT of Delhi and the
principle of constitutionalism. As per the 1991 Act and the Rules of
Business, he has to be apprised of every decision taken by the
Council of Ministers. He cannot change the decision. That apart,
there is no provision for concurrence. He has the authority to
differ. But it cannot be difference for the sake of difference. It
cannot be mechanical or in a routine matter. The power has been
conferred to guide, discuss and see that the administration runs
for the welfare of the people and also NCT of Delhi that has been
given a special status. Therefore, the word “any” has to be
understood treating as a guidance meant for the constitutional
authority. He must bear in mind the constitutional objectivity, the
needed advice and the realities.
</p>
<p id="p_438">234. The proviso to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_514">Article 239-AA(4</a>), we say without any fear of
contradiction, cannot be interpreted in a strict sense of the mere
words employed treating them as only letters without paying heed
to the thought and the spirit which they intend to convey. They are
not to be treated as bones and flesh without nerves and neurons
that make the nerves functional. We feel, it is necessary in the
context to read the words of the provision in the spirit of citizenry
participation in the governance of a democratic polity that is
republican in character. We may hasten to add that when we say
so, it should not be construed that there is allowance of enormous
entry of judicial creativity, for the construction one intends to place
has its plinth and platform on the Preamble and precedents
pertaining to constitutional interpretation and purposive
interpretation keeping in view the conception of sense and spirit of
the Constitution. It is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to
the functionalism of the Constitution. And we call it constitutional
pragmatism.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">                             153</span><p id="p_439">

</p><p id="p_440">235.    The authorities in power should constantly remind
themselves that they are constitutional functionaries and they
have the responsibility to ensure that the fundamental purpose of
administration is the welfare of the people in an ethical manner.
There is requirement of discussion and deliberation. The fine
nuances are to be dwelled upon with mutual respect. Neither of
the authorities should feel that they have been lionised. They
should feel that they are serving the constitutional norms, values
and concepts.
</p>
<p id="p_441">236.      Interpretation cannot ignore the conscience of the
Constitution. That apart, when we take a broader view, we are
also alive to the consequence of such an interpretation. If the
expressions “in case of difference” and “on any matter” are
construed to mean that the Lieutenant Governor can differ on any
proposal, the expectation of the people which has its legitimacy in
a democratic set-up, although different from States as understood
under the Constitution, will lose its purpose in simple semantics.
The essence and purpose should not be lost in grammar like the
philosophy of geometry cannot be allowed to lose its universal
metaphysics in the methods of drawing. And that is why, we
deliberated upon many a concept. Thus, the Administrator, as per
the Rules of Business, has to be apprised of each decision taken
by a Minister or Council of Ministers, but that does not mean that
the Lieutenant Governor should raise an issue in every matter.
The difference of opinion must meet the standards of
constitutional trust and morality, the principle of collaborative
federalism and constitutional balance, the concept of
constitutional governance and objectivity and the nurtured and
cultivated idea of respect for a representative Government. The
difference of opinion should never be based on the perception of
“right to differ” and similarly the term “on any matter” should not
be put on such a platform as to conceive that as one can differ, it
should be a norm on each occasion. The difference must meet the
concept of constitutional trust reposed in the authority and there
has to be objective assessment of the decision that is sent for
communication and further the rationale of difference of opinion
should be demonstrable and it should contain sound reason.
There should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an
obstructionist but reflection of the philosophy of affirmative
constructionism and a visionary. The constitutional amendment
does not perceive a situation of constant friction and difference
which gradually builds a structure of conflict. At the same time, the
Council of Ministers being headed by the Chief Minister should be
guided by values and prudence accepting the constitutional
position that NCT of Delhi is not a State.”

In a concurring opinion on this aspect, Chandrachud, J. has also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">                                  154</span>

  given lucid commentary.
</p>
<p id="p_442">163)   It becomes clear from the above that even when the executive

  wing of Delhi Government takes a decision, the LG is also empowered

  to form its opinion ‘on any matter’ which may be different from the

  decision taken by his Ministers. Any matter does not mean each and

  ‘every matter’ or ‘every trifling matter’ but only those rare and

  exceptional matters where the difference is so fundamental to the

  governance of the Union Territory that it deserved to be escalated to the

  President. Therefore, the LG is not expected to differ routinely with the

  decision of Council of Minister. Difference should be on cogent and

  strong reasons.    However, this limitation pertains to LG’s exercise of

  power. At the same time, the proviso recognises that there may be

  contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ.            In such

  circumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the President for

  decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the

  President. It means that final say, in case of different between LG and

  Council of Ministers, is that of the President. Such a scheme of things

  clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers is supposed to convey

  its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to form his view thereupon. The

  decision cannot be implemented without referring the same to the LG in

  the first instance. More pertinently, the decision here touches upon the

  governance of the UT. Therefore, we agree with the conclusion of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">                                   155</span>

  High Court that views of LG should have been taken before issuing

  circular dated August 4, 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_443">
</p><p id="p_444">       However, we would like to add that normally, and generally, the LG

  is expected to honour the wisdom of the council of ministers. He is also

  expected to clear the files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it

  unduly. He’s under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the

  subject matter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever

  situation so demands. That in fact is the facet of good governance.

  Likewise , the executive is also expected to give due deference to the

  unique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutional

  scheme. By and large, it demands a mutual respect between the two

  organs. Both should realise that they are here to serve the people of

  NCTD. Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for the effective

  working of the system.
</p>
<p id="p_445">  Issue No.6: Whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the GNCTD which
  has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor under <a href="/doc/378047/" id="a_515">Section
  24</a> of the Cr.PC.?
</p>
<p id="p_446">164)   Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as per the provisions of

  <a href="/doc/378047/" id="a_516">Section 24(8)</a> of Cr.P.C. which is to the following effect:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_150">       “24. Public Prosecutors. …

       (8) The Central Government or the State Government may
       appoint, for the purposes of any case or class of cases, a person
       who has been in practice as an advocate for not less than ten
       years as a Special Public Prosecutor.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">                                    156</span>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_151">165)    As is clear from the above, power to appoint Special Public

  Prosecutor is conferred both upon the Central Government and the

  State Government. The question, therefore, arises is as to whether the

  expression ‘State Government’ would include GNCTD.               As per the

  appellant, once the Government of NCT of Delhi is found to be the

  “State Government” under the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_517">Cr.P.C</a>., necessarily the power to appoint

  the Special Public Prosecutor will also lie with the Government of NCT

  of Delhi. If the contention of the Union of India is to be accepted then

  under the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_518">Cr.P.C</a>. both the Central Government and State Government

  will be the Central Government alone, which will be a completely absurd

  legal position, particularly in light of the fact that subsequent to the 69 th

  Amendment, various powers of the State Government under the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_519">Cr.P.C</a>.,

  including appointment of public prosecutors, have been exercised by the

  elected government of NCT of Delhi. Referring to the impugned

  judgment, on this issue, it is pointed out that the High Court has held

  that the definition of <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_520">Section 3(60)</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will

  apply to interpret the term “State Government” and it would thus be the

  Central Government, which would be the State Government.                 It is

  argued that this approach is wrong as the issue of appointment of public

  prosecutor relates to Criminal Procedure, i.e. Entry 2 of List II over which

  the Delhi Assembly and Executive exercise power, the Lt. Governor

  must act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the NCT of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">                                   157</span>

  Delhi. It is contended that this convoluted method of reasoning was not

  necessary and the entire issue could be resolved if the Government of

  NCT of Delhi was held to be a State Government of NCT of Delhi by

  application of definition of State in Section 3(58) of General Clauses Act,

  1897 to interpret State Government in the Cr.P.C., instead of definition of

  Section 3(60) of the GC Act which is obviously repugnant to the subject

  and context of Cr.P.C.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_447">166)   We may mention at this stage that writ petition was filed in the High

  Court by the GNCTD challenging the order of the Special Judge dated

  September 7, 2015 and order of LG dated September 4, 2015

  appointing Shri S.K. Gupta, Advocate as Special Public Prosecutor to

  conduct the prosecution in FIR No. 21 of 2012 dated December 17,

  2012. The GNCTD had appointed another lawyer as Special Public

  Prosecutor.   The High Court has held that under <a href="/doc/378047/" id="a_521">Section 24(8)</a> of

  Cr.P.C., State Government is empowered to appoint Special Public

  Prosecutor. However, as NCTD is a Union Territory, by virtue of Section

  3(60) of the GC Act, it is the Central Government which should be the

  State Government. Further, since by notification dated March 20, 1974,

  administrator is empowered to exercise powers and the expression

  ‘State Government’ would mean the LG. At the same time, the High

  Court has also observed that power to appoint Public Prosecutor is

  relatable to Entries 1 and 2 of List III in respect of which GNCTD has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">                                  158</span>

  legislative competence. Therefore, the LG must appoint Special Public

  Prosecutor on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.


</p><p id="p_448">167)   As is clear from the arguments of GNCTD noted above, it is

  aggrieved by that part of the impugned order of the High Court whereby

  State Government in respect of NCTD is held to be the Central

  Government by virtue of Section 3(60) of the GC Act. On the other

  hand, the Union Government is aggrieved by that portion of the order of

  the High Court where it is held that LG must appoint Special Public

  Prosecutor on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.


</p><p id="p_449">168)   Arguments on behalf of the Union of India is that by virtue of

  Notification dated March 20, 1974, President under Article 239 had

  empowered the Administrator to exercise all the powers conferred upon

  State Government by the Cr.P.C. except that conferred by Section 8 and

</p><p id="p_450">  477. Therefore, the power under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_522">Section 24</a> to appoint Prosecutor or

  Special Public Prosecutor vests with the LG and not the Government of

  NCT. So far as Entries 1 and 2, List III are concerned, it is argued that

  undoubtedly Legislative Assembly of NCT has legislative competence

  qua said entries but it is subservient to the legislative power of the

  Union. It is contended that legislative competence of NCT Delhi cannot

  derogate from or be repugnant to law of Parliament. And once <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_523">Cr.P.C</a>.,

  1973 has been made by the Parliament dealing exhaustively and

  comprehensively with criminal procedure the executive power of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_157">                                   159</span>

  GNCTD as well as the legislative power would stand eroded and

  become subservient to the central executive. Therefore, GNCTD can

  exercise executive power only upon an express conferment of power by

  <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_524">Cr.P.C</a>. There is no such conferment. It is the Central Government

  alone which would have independent power to appoint Special Public

  Prosecutor. It is also argued that assuming without admitting that under

  <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_525">Section 24</a> both Central Government are empowered to appoint Public

  Prosecutor/Special Public Prosecutor under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_526">Section 24(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_527">24(8)</a>, the

  Central Government cannot be prevented or restrained from making

  appointment, and wherever the Central Government has already made

  an appointment of a Public Prosecutor with respect to a case or a class

  of clases, the UT Government would not be competent to make a

  parallel appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_451">

</p><p id="p_452">169)   We find that in answering this question, the High Court has entered

  into the following discussion:

<blockquote id="blockquote_152">       “300. As could be seen, <a href="/doc/378047/" id="a_528">Section 24(8)</a> of Cr.P.C. empowers the

       the purposes of any case or class of cases. Admittedly, NCT of

</p><p id="p_460">171)   Though, we have accepted the interpretation, as given by the High

  Court in respect of the provisions of the GC Act mentioned above while

  discussing the expression ‘State Government’ in the context of COI Act,

  this position is clarified while dealing with the same expression occuring

  in <a href="/doc/51837307/" id="a_541">Section 2(5)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. We have made it clear that it

  would depend upon language used in defining State Government in a

  particular enactment. We have also pointed out the difference in the

  definitions of Appropriate Government, under the COI Act and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_542">Electricity

  Act</a>. This becomes important in the light of decision contained in the

  Constitution Bench judgment which clearly holds that under various

  circumstances, the expression State Government would be relatable to

  GNCTD, notwithstanding the fact that it continues to be the Union

  Territory. The Constitution Bench judgment has also not accepted the

  opinion of the High Court insofar as it treats State Government as the

  Lieutenant Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_461">
</p><p id="p_462">172)   In any case, it may not be necessary to dwell much upon this

  aspect. The High Court has also categorically held that the power to

  appoint a Public Prosecutor is relatable to Entries 1 and 2 of List III. In

  our opinion, the High Court has rightly held that in respect of these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">                                   162</span>

    entries, the Government of NCT of Delhi has legislative competence

    under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_543">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution and that the LG under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_544">Article

    239AA(4)</a> of the Constitution shall act on the aid and advice of the

    Council of Ministers. This conclusion of the High Court is in tune with

    the judgment of the Constitution Bench.        We, therefore, hold that

    Lieutenant Governor, while appointing the Special Public Prosecutor, is

    to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. This issue is

    answered accordingly.

of facts giving rise to these appeals, order passed in

these appeals referring it to the Constitution Bench and

the        judgment      of     Constitution          Bench    delivered    on

04.07.2018.               My    Brother        has    noted    the   elaborate

submissions made before us, after the Constitution Bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_162">                                       164</span>



has answered the reference and sent back the matter to

the    regular     Bench      for    deciding        these    appeals.           The

submissions made before us by learned counsel for the

parties having been elaborately noted in the opinion of

my esteemed Brother, I feel no necessity of burdening

this    judgment       by    reproducing        the    submissions          again.

Justice Sikri has framed six issues in paragraph Nos. 63

to 68 for consideration in these appeals, which are as

follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_472">       63) The    first      issue    is     whether       the     exclusion      of

“Services”       relatable      to    Entry     41    of     List      II   of   the

Seventh     Schedule        from     the     legislative         and    executive

domain of the NCT of Delhi, vide notification of the

Government        of        India     dated      May         21,       2015,      is

unconstitutional and illegal?
</p>
<p id="p_473">       64) The second issue is whether the exclusion of the

jurisdiction of the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) of the

NCT of Delhi to investigate offences committed under the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_545">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1987 by the officials of

Central Government and limiting the jurisdiction of the

ACB to the employees of GNCTD alone is legal? (These two

issues arise in Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017).

</p><p id="p_474">       65) The third issue is raised in Civil Appeal Nos.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_163">                              165</span>



    2358, 2359 and 2360 of 2017.                  In all these three
    appeals, the common issue is whether the GNCTD
    is    an     “Appropriate            Government”        under       the
    <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_546">Commission of Enquiry Act</a>, 1952?
</p><pre id="pre_8">66) The   fourth       issue,       which    is    raised       in    Civil
    Appeal     No.     2363      of   2017,      is:    Whether       under

    with the State Commission is with the Government
    of NCT of Delhi?
</p><p id="p_476">               Similar issue is the subject matter of
    Civil Appeal No. 2361 of 2017, viz. whether the
    orders     of    the    GNCTD        nominating       Directors      to
    Distribution Companies in Delhi under the Delhi
    Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 read with Delhi
    Electricity          Reforms      (Transfer        Scheme)       Rules,
    2001, without obtaining the concurrence of the
    Lieutenant Governor are valid?
</p><p id="p_477">67) The fifth issue is common to Civil Appeal No.
    2362 of 2017 filed by the GNCTD and Civil Appeal
    No.   2364      of    2017      filed    by    Union    of       India,
    wherein      the       issue      is    whether       the    Revenue
    Department of the GNCTD has the power to revise
    the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle
    Rates) under the provisions of <a href="/doc/74910796/" id="a_548">Indian Stamp Act</a>,
    1899?
</p><p id="p_478">68) The sixth issue, which is the subject matter of
    Criminal Appeal No. 277 of 2018, pertains to the
    appointment of Special Public Prosecutors, viz.,
    whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the

  although       before        the   Constitution          Bench   it     was

  emphatically          submitted      that    as    per   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_565">Article      239AA</a>

  sub-clause (3)(a) the Legislative Assembly shall have

  power to make laws with respect to any of the matters

  enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent

  List “in so far as any such matter is applicable to

  Union Territories”. It is submitted before us that

  emphasis before the Constitution Bench was that all

  matters enumerated in State List and Concurrent List

  shall    not    be     ipso    facto      available      to   Legislative

  Assembly of Delhi and Legislative power is given only

  of    those    matters       which       matters   are    applicable     to

  Union Territory of Delhi. It is submitted that the

  Constitution Bench has specifically noted the above

  argument but has neither considered nor decided the

  issue, hence, the issue has to be considered and

  decided by this Bench.

<p id="p_505">10.Entry 41 of List II which is the subject matter of

  speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he

  then was) as well as       two other opinions have noted

  that the controversy in individual appeals need not

  to be dwelled upon by the Constitution Bench as the

  Constitution     Bench     is    to    answer    only     the

  constitutional   issues.    In   the   opinion   of   Justice

  Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) following was

  stated in paragraph 13:
</p>
<p id="p_508">  “13. Having prefaced thus, we shall now proceed
  to state the controversy in brief since in this
  batch of appeals which has been referred to the
  Constitution Bench, we are required to advert
  to the issue that essentially pertains to the
  powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly of
  the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the
  executive power exercised by the elected
  Government of NCT of Delhi. The facts involved
  and the controversy raised in each individual
  appeal need not be dwelled upon, for we only
  intend to answer the constitutional issue.”


</p><p id="p_509">12.In paragraph 486 of the judgment (in my opinion)

  following was stated:
</p>
<p id="p_510">  “486. These appeals, thus, have been placed
  before this Constitution Bench. At the outset,
  it was agreed between the learned counsel for
  the parties that this Constitution Bench may
  only answer the constitutional questions and
  the individual appeals thereafter will be
  decided by appropriate regular Benches.”



</p><p id="p_511">13.The submissions which are being pressed before us by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_175">                            176</span>



  Shri Rakesh Dwivedi as well as Shri Maninder Singh

  were also pressed before the Constitution Bench, the

  specific submission was that the power of Legislative

  Assembly of Delhi on subject matter provided in List

  II and III of Seventh Schedule is limited by very

  same Article when it implies “in so far as any such

  matter is applicable to Union Territories”. It is

  useful to notice that in paragraph 39 of the judgment

  of   Justice   Dipak   Misra,   C.J.   (as   he   then   was)

  following has been noticed:
</p>
<p id="p_512">  “39. The respondents also contend that although
  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_566">Article 239-AA</a> confers on the Legislative
  Assembly of Delhi the power to legislate with
  respect to subject-matters provided in List II
  and List III of the Seventh Schedule, yet the
  said power is limited by the very same Article
  when it employs the phrase “insofar as any such
  matter is applicable to Union Territories…” and
  also   by  specifically   excluding  from   the
  legislative power of the Assembly certain
  entries as delineated in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_567">Article 239-AA(3)(a).</a>
  This restriction, as per the respondents,
  limits the power of the Legislative Assembly to
  legislate and this restriction has to be
  understood in the context of conferment of
  special status.”


</p><p id="p_513">14.The Constitution Bench speaking through Justice Dipak

  Misra, C.J. (as he then was) has in its judgment

  clearly accepted the position that NCT of Delhi is

  not a State and it remains a Union Territory. In this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_176">                            177</span>



  reference,    in   paragraph    Nos.   196   and   201   of   the

  judgment following has been laid down:
</p>
<p id="p_514">  “196. Thus, NDMC makes it clear as crystal that
  all Union Territories under our constitutional
  scheme are not on the same pedestal and as far
  as NCT of Delhi is concerned, it is not a State
  within the meaning of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_568">Article 246</a> or Part VI of
  the Constitution. Though NCT of Delhi partakes
  a   unique  position   after   the  Sixty-ninth
  Amendment, yet in sum and substance, it remains
  a Union Territory which is governed by <a href="/doc/493558/" id="a_569">Article
  246(4)</a> of the Constitution and to which
  Parliament, in the exercise of its constituent
  power, has given the appellation of the
  “National Capital Territory of Delhi”.
</p>
<p id="p_515">
</p><p id="p_516">  201. In the light of the aforesaid analysis and
  the ruling of the nine-Judge Bench in NDMC, it
  is clear as noonday that by no stretch of
  imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the
  status   of   a   State   under   our    present
  constitutional scheme and the status of the
  Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not that of a
  Governor of a State, rather he remains an
  Administrator, in a limited sense, working with
  the designation of Lieutenant Governor.”


</p><p id="p_517">15.Discussion being confined only to Legislative power

  conferred on the Delhi Legislative Assembly it is

  useful   to   notice   the      opinion   expressed      by   the

  Constitution Bench in the above regard. In paragraph

  Nos. 217 and 219 following has been laid down:
</p>
<p id="p_518">  “217. Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_570">Article
  239-AA</a> establishes the power of the Delhi
  Legislative Assembly to enact laws for NCT of
  Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">                             178</span>



  State List and/or Concurrent List except
  insofar as matters with respect to and which
  relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State
  List.
</p>
<p id="p_519">  219. Thus, it is evident from clause (3) of
  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_571">Article 239-AA</a> that Parliament has the power to
  make laws for NCT of Delhi on any of the
  matters enumerated in the State List and the
  Concurrent List and at the same time, the
  Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the
  legislative power with respect to matters
  enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent
  List except matters with respect to entries
  which have been explicitly excluded from
  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_572">Article 239-AA(3)(a).”</a>


</p><p id="p_520">16.In the above paragraphs Constitution Bench held that

  the power of the Legislative Assembly to make laws of

  NCT of Delhi is with respect to matters enumerated in

  State List and the Concurrent List except in so far

  as   matters   with    respect    to   and   which   relate   to

  entries 1,2 and 18 of the State List. What is noticed

  in paragraph No. 217 is what is stated in general

  terms in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_573">Article 239AA(3)(a)</a> of the Constitution. The

  Constitution Bench has not bestowed its consideration

  on the purpose and intent of expression “with respect

  to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or

  in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter

  is   applicable   to   Union     Territory    of   Delhi”.    The

  reason is not far to seek. Individual issues which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_178">                              179</span>



  had arisen in different appeals were not touched by

  the Constitution Bench leaving it open to be decided

  by the regular Bench after constitutional questions

  are   answered.   Whether     the   “services”   are    within

  legislative competence of Delhi Legislative Assembly

  is one of the issues which has directly arisen in

  C.A.No.2357 of 2017. Thus, there is no opinion of

  Constitution Bench as to whether Entry 41 of List II

  is available to Legislative Assembly of Delhi or not

  except a general statement that Legislative Assembly

  of Delhi shall have power to make laws with respect

  to any of the matters enumerated in List I and List

  II except Entries 1, 2 and 18 of State List.
</p>
<p id="p_521">17.We may also notice the conclusion recorded by the

  Constitution   Bench   speaking     through   Justice    Dipak

  Misra, C.J. (as he then was) in paragraph No.284. The

  conclusion in paragraph No.284.13 is as follows:

     “284.13. With the insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_574">Article 239-AA</a>
  by    virtue   of  the  Sixty-ninth   Amendment,
  Parliament envisaged a representative form of
  Government for NCT of Delhi. The said provision
  intends to provide for the Capital a directly
  elected Legislative Assembly which shall have
  legislative powers over matters falling within
  the State List and the Concurrent List, barring
  those    excepted,  and  a   mandate  upon   the
  Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and
  advice of the Council of Ministers except when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_179">                                  180</span>



  he decides to refer the matter to the President
  for final decision.”


</p><p id="p_522">18.As noticed above the Constitution Bench in paragraph

  No.39 extracted above has noticed the submissions of

  the counsel for the respondents that words “insofar

  as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories

  ...” in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_575">Article 239AA(3)(a)</a> restrict the Legislative

  power of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to only

  those   entries       which    are    only    applicable       to   Union

  Territories and not all.              The elaborate discussion on

  its    answer    is   not     found    in    the    majority     opinion

  expressed by Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then

  was).   The     submission      having      been    made   before     the

  Constitution Bench which submission was considered in

  other   two     opinions      expressed      by    Dr.   Justice      D.Y.

  Chandrachud and myself, it is useful to notice as to

  what    has been      said in        other two      opinions in       the

  Constitution Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_523">19.Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in his opinion has dealt

  with the submission under the separate heading as

  indicated     at   Serial      No.K(v)       in    the   Index   in   the

  beginning of the judgment which is to the following

  effect:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">                          181</span><p id="p_524">



  “K(v) “Insofar as any such matter is applicable
  to Union Territories”


</p><p id="p_525">20.In pages 736 and 737 of the judgment of Dr.Justice

  D.Y.   Chandrachud,   the     said   submission   has   been

  considered in paragraph Nos. 461, 462 and 463 and

  following has been laid down:
</p>
<p id="p_526">  “461.   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_576">Article    239-AA(3)(a)</a>   permits   the
  Legislative Assembly of the NCT to legislate on
  matters in the State List, except for Entries
  1, 2 and 18 (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 insofar
  as they relate to the earlier entries) and on
  the Concurrent List, “insofar as any such
  matter is applicable to Union Territories”. In
  forming an understanding of these words of
  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_577">Article 239-AA(3)(a</a>), it has to be noticed that
  since the decision in Kanniyan right through to
  the nine-Judge Bench decision in NDMC, it has
  been held that the expression “State” in
  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_578">Article 246</a> does not include a Union Territory.
  The expression “insofar as any such matter is
  applicable to Union Territories” cannot be
  construed to mean that the Legislative Assembly
  of NCT would have no power to legislate on any
  subject in the State or Concurrent Lists,
  merely by the use of the expression “State” in
  that particular entry. This is not a correct
  reading of the above words of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_579">Article 239-AA(3)</a>
</p><p id="p_527">  (a). As we see below, that is not how
  Parliament has construed them as well.
</p>
<p id="p_528">  462. Section 7(5) of the GNCTD Act provides
  that salaries of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker
  of the Legislative Assembly may be fixed by the
  Legislative   Assembly  by   law.  <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_580">Section   19</a>
  provides that the Members of the Legislative
  Assembly shall receive salaries and allowances
  as determined by the Legislative Assembly by
  law. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_581">Section 43(3)</a> similarly provides that the
  salaries and allowances of Ministers shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_181">                       182</span>



determined    by    the   Legislative    Assembly.
</p><p id="p_529">However, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_582">Section 24</a> provides that a Bill for
the purpose has to be reserved for the
consideration of the President. Parliament
would not have enacted the above provisions
unless legislative competence resided in the
States on the above subject. The subjects
pertaining to the salaries and allowances of
Members of the Legislature of the State
(including the Speaker and Deputy Speaker) and
of the Ministers for the State are governed by
Entry 38 and Entry 40 of the State List. The
GNCTD Act recognises the legislative competence
of the Legislative Assembly of NCT to enact
legislation on these subjects. The use of the
expression “State” in these entries does not
divest the jurisdiction of the Legislative
Assembly.   Nor    are  the   words   of   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_583">Article
239-AA(3)(a)</a>    exclusionary   or   disabling   in
nature.
</p>
<p id="p_530">463. The purpose of the above narration is to
indicate that the expression “State” is by
itself not conclusive of whether a particular
provision of the Constitution would apply to
Union Territories. Similarly, it can also be
stated that the definition of the expression
State in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_584">Section 3(58)</a> of the General Clauses
Act (which includes a Union Territory) will not
necessarily govern all references to “State” in
the Constitution. If there is something which
is repugnant in the subject or context, the
inclusive definition in <a href="/doc/65558287/" id="a_585">Section 3(58)</a> will not
apply. This is made clear in the precedent
emanating from this Court. In certain contexts,
it has been held that the expression “State”
will not include Union Territories while in
other contexts the definition in <a href="/doc/65558287/" id="a_586">Section 3(58)</a>
has   been  applied.   Hence,   the  expression
“insofar as any such matter is applicable to
Union Territories” is not one of exclusion nor
can it be considered to be so irrespective of
subject or context.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_182">                                183</span>



</p><p id="p_531">21.Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud while considering the

  expression    “in    so     far     as   any    such   matter    is

  applicable    to    Union    Territories”      as   occurring    in

  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_587">Article 239AA(3)</a> has held that the ability of the

  Legislative Assembly is circumscribed by the above

  expression.      In Paragraph No. 316 of the Constitution

  Bench judgment, he has observed following:-
</p>
<p id="p_532">   “316. Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_588">Article 239-AA</a> defines the
   legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly
   for the NCT. Sub-clause (a) empowers the
   Legislative Assembly for the NCT to enact law
   with respect to any of the matters contained in
   the State or Concurrent Lists of the Seventh
   Schedule to the Constitution. The ability of
   the   Legislative   Assembly   is  circumscribed
   “insofar as any such matter is applicable to
   Union Territories”. The Legislative Assembly
   can hence enact legislation in regard to the
   entries in the State and Concurrent Lists to
   the extent to which they apply to a Union
   Territory.   Of   equal   significance  is   the
   exception which has been carved out: Entries 1,
   2 and 18 of the State List (and Entries 64, 65
   and 66 insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2
   and 18) lie outside the legislative powers of
   the Legislative Assembly of NCT……………………………….”


</p><p id="p_533">22.Dr.   Justice     D.Y.     Chandrachud,       thus,   held     that

  expression “State” is by itself not conclusive of

  whether a particular provision of the Constitution

  would apply to Union Territories. His Lordship opined

  that the expression “insofar as any such matter is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">                                    184</span>



  applicable        to     Union    Territories”          is   not   one   of

  exclusion     nor        can     it     be     considered     to   be    so

  irrespective of subject or context.
</p>
<p id="p_534">

</p><p id="p_535">23.I   had   also        dealt   with      the    above    submission      in

  paragraph Nos. 500, 551 and 552 in following words:</p>
<p id="p_536">
   “500. It is submitted that even when <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_589">Article
   239-AA(3)(a)</a>      stipulates    that    Legislative
   Assembly of Delhi shall have the power to
   legislate     in    respect   of    subject-matters
   provided in List II and List III of the VIIth
   Schedule of the Constitution of India, it
   specifically restricts the legislative powers
   of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to those
   subject-matters which are “applicable to Union
   Territories”. The Constitution envisages that
   List II and List III of the VIIth Schedule of
   the Constitution of India contain certain
   subject-matters which are not applicable to
   Union    Territories.    The   intention   of   the
   Constitution-makers is that even when the
   subject-matters contained in List II and List
   III of the VIIth Schedule become available to
   the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi, the
   subject-matters in the said Lists which are not
   applicable to Union Territories would not
   become available to the Legislative Assembly of
   NCT   of    Delhi    and  would   be   beyond   its
   legislative powers.
</p>
<p id="p_537">   551. The provision is very clear which empowers
   the Legislative Assembly to make laws with
   respect to any of the matters enumerated in the
   State List or in the Concurrent List except the
   excluded entries. One of the issues is that
   power to make laws in State List or in
   Concurrent List is hedged by phrase “insofar as
   any   such  matter   is  applicable   to  Union
   Territories”.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">                           185</span><p id="p_538">




</p><p id="p_539">  552. A look at the entries in List II and List
  III indicates that there is no mention of Union
  Territory. A perusal of Lists II and III
  indicates that although in various entries
  there is specific mention of word “State” but
  there is no express reference of “Union
  Territory” in any of the entries. For example,
  in List II Entries 12, 26, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
  42 and 43, there is specific mention of word
  “State”. Similarly, in List III Entries 3, 4
  and 43 there is mention of word “State”. The
  above phrase “insofar as any such matter is
  applicable     to     Union     Territory”     is
  inconsequential. The reasons are twofold. On
  the commencement of the Constitution, there was
  no concept of Union Territories and there were
  only Part A, B, C and D States. After Seventh
  Constitutional Amendment, where First Schedule

  amended   which   included   mention   of   Union
  Territory both in <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_591">Article 1</a> as well as in First

  facilitate the automatic conferment of powers
  to make laws for Delhi on all matters including
  those   relatable   to   the   State   List   and

  that its applicability to the Union Territory
  is excluded by implication or any express

  excluded     by   implication      or    by     any   express

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_185">                                186</span>



  that    all   entries    of   List       II   and     List     III    are

  the     expression    “insofar      as    any    such        matter     is

  that no opinion has been expressed in the majority

<p id="p_552">30.It is to be noted that for Reorganisation of the

  administrative set up of Union Territory of Delhi,

  the Government of India has appointed a Committee,

  namely, Balakrishnan Committee, which had submitted

  its report on 14.12.1989 to the Home Ministry.                    The

  Report of the Balakrishnan Committee was the basis

Constitution Amendment, the Report of Balakrishnan

Committee    has     been   specifically    referred    to   and

relied on.    It is useful to notice the Statement of

Objects and Reasons of Constitution 69th Amendment,

which are as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_553"> “Statement of Objects and Reasons
   The   question   of   reorganisation  of the
administrative set-up in the Union Territory of
Delhi has been under the consideration of the
Government for some time. The Government of
India appointed on 24-12-1987 a Committee to go
into the various issues connected with the
administration of Delhi and to recommend
measures inter alia for the streamlining of the
administrative set-up. The Committee went into
the matter in great detail and considered the
issues after holding discussions with various
individuals, associations, political parties
and other experts and taking into account the
arrangements in the National Capitals of other
countries with a federal set-up and also the
debates in the Constituent Assembly as also the
reports by earlier Committees and Commissions.
After such detailed inquiry and examination, it
recommended that Delhi should continue to be a
Union Territory and provided with a Legislative
Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible
to such Assembly with appropriate powers to
deal with matters of concern to the common man.
The Committee also recommended that with a view
to    ensure   stability    and  permanence the
arrangements should be incorporated in the
Constitution to give the National Capital a
special status among the Union Territories.

  speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he

  then was) has also referred to and relied on the

  Balakrishnan’s Committee Report.             In Paragraph No. 16

  of     the    judgment,       several     paragraphs          of    the

  Balakrishnan Committee Report have been extracted by

  the Constitution Bench.             The Constitution Bench has

  further      held    that   Balakrishnan     Committee’s       Report

  serve as an enacting history and corpus of public

  knowledge relative to the introduction of Articles

<p id="p_556">   “206. It is perceptible that the constitutional

</p><p id="p_557">32.Balakrishnan’s Committee Report in Para No. 6.7.4 has

  noted the limitation on the Legislative power of the

  Delhi Legislative Assembly because of the difference

  between the Constitutional Status of Union Territory

  and that of the State.           Para No. 6.7.4 is to the

  following effect:-
</p>
<p id="p_558">  “6.7.4 As regards the Legislative Assembly to
  be created for Delhi. It should have full
  legislative power in relation to matters
  assigned to it. Subject to the specific
  exclusion of certain subjects set out in
  paragraphs 6.7.8 and 6.7.12 below, such powers
  should cover matters in the State List and the
  Concurrent List of the Constitution in so far
  as such matters are applicable in relation to
  Union territories. This last limitation is
  necessary because of the difference between the
  constitutional status of a Union territory and
  that of a State. The exercise of such
  legislative powers should, of course, be
  subject to the provisions of the Constitution
  and the relevant laws of Parliament.”


</p><p id="p_559">33.Balakrishnan Committee Report while elaborating the

  expression   “insofar     as         any     such    matters   are

  applicable   in   relation      to    Union    Territories”    has

  noticed   that    apart      from          entries   specifically
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_191">                                  192</span>



  excluded, there are other entries, which ipso facto

  fall outside the purview of the Delhi Legislative

  Assembly.      Following has been stated in Paragraph No.

  6.7.12:-
</p>
<p id="p_560">   “6.7.12 .....Another connected Entry in the
   State List is Entry No.35 which is “Works,

   extend to matters in the State List and the
   Concurrent List of the Constitution “in so far
   as such matters are applicable in relation to
   Union territories” Entry 35 will ipso facto
   fall outside the purview of the Assembly
   proposed for Delhi because that Entry is
   applicable   to  States   and   not  to   Union
   territories......”


</p><p id="p_561">34.Entry   41   of   List    II     of    VIIth    Schedule    of     the

  Constitution       was    specifically         considered    in     the

  Balakrishnan Committee Report and the Balakrishnan

  Committee Report opined that the said entry is not

  applicable to the Union Territory.                    On the above

  subject,      following    was        stated    in   the   Report    in

  Paragraph Nos. 8.1.2 and 8.1.3:-
</p>
<p id="p_562">   “8.1.2 Entry 41 of the State List mentions
   “State public services: State ‘Public Services
   Commission”. Obviously, this Entry is not
   applicable to Union territories because it
   mentions   only   “State”   and   not   “Union
   territories”. This view is reinforced by the
   fact that this Constitution divides public
   services in India into two categories, namely,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_192">                               193</span>



   services in connection with the affairs of the
   Union and services in connection with the
   affairs of the State as is clear from the
   various   provisions  in   Part  XIV   of  the
   Constitution. There is no third category of
   services covering the services of the Union
   territories. The obvious reason is that the
   administration of the Union territory is the
   constitutional responsibility of the Union
   under <a href="/doc/297117/" id="a_607">article 239</a> and as such comes under
   “affairs of the Union”. Consequently, the
   public services for the administration of any
   Union territory should form part of the public
   services in connection with the affairs of the
   Union.
</p>
<p id="p_563">   8.1.3   It is not, therefore, constitutionally
   possible to bring the subject matter of the
   services in the Union territory within the
   scope of the Legislative Assembly or the
   Council of Ministers of the proposed Delhi
   Administration. On the same reasoning it is not
   possible to provide for a separate Public
   Service Commission for a Union territory like
   Delhi because State Public Service Commission
   in Entry 41 aforesaid means only the body set
   up for the States.”


</p><p id="p_564">35.Balakrishnan    Committee    Report     further   opined    that

  services in connection with the administration of the

  Union Territory of Delhi will be part of the services

  of   the   Union   even    after       the   setting   up   of   a

  Legislative     Assembly   with    a    Council   of   Ministers.

  Following was stated in Paragraph No. 9.3.4 on the

  heading “SERVICES”:-
</p>
<p id="p_565">       “SERVICES

   administration of the Union territory of Delhi
   will be part of the services of the Union even
   after the setting up of a Legislative Assembly
   with    a    Council    of    Ministers.    This
   constitutional position is unexceptionable and
   should not be disturbed. There should, however,
   be adequate delegation of powers to the Lt.

   services or posts. In performing his functions
   under such delegated powers the Lt. Governor

   whenever possible, with the Chief Minister.”


</p><p id="p_567">36.The   Balakrishnan         Committee    Report   which      led   into

  passing       of    the   69th   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_608">Constitution     (Amendment)       Act</a>

  categorically has accepted the position that Entry 41

  of     List    II   shall    not    be   within   the    Legislative

  competence of Delhi Legislature, which conclusion was

  plausible, since the Legislative power of the Delhi

  Legislative         Assembly       was   circumscribed        by    the

  expression “insofar as any such matter is applicable

  in relation to Union Territories” as occurring in

  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_609">Article 239AA(3).</a> In Balakrishnan Committee Report,

  the    Committee      noticed      the   existence      of   services,

  which were in existence in the Union Territory of

  Territories constituted by Union. On 13.07.1959, the

  combined        to     different           Union       Territories.          The

  Constitution 69th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_612">(Amendment) Act</a> was enacted that

  the    term     ”services”          in     the       Union   Territories     are

  Union Services and there are no State services and

  the Commission for Services means the Union Public

  Services Commission.                 A Constitution Bench of this

  Court had occasion to consider various aspects of the

  services in Union Territory of Delhi in Bir Singh Vs.

  Delhi Jal Board and Others, (2018) 10 SCC 312.                                The

judgment in <a href="/doc/144413017/" id="a_613">Govt. of NCT of Delhi vs. Union of India</a>

(supra).       The   Constitution       Bench       of   this      Court

speaking through Justice Ranjan Gogoi (as he then

was)   has     noticed   details       of     all   Central        Civil

Services, Union Territories Services in reference to

NCT of Delhi, although with reference to question of

applicability of reservation in services. Services in

reference     to   NCT   of    Delhi    has     been     noticed     in

paragraph Nos. 64 to 66 under the heading “National

Capital      Territory   of     Delhi”,       which      is   to     the

following effect:-</p>
<p id="p_569">
  “National Capital Territory of Delhi

</p><p id="p_570">  64. In case of National Capital Territory of
Delhi, especially, to make the picture even
clearer, a reference may be made to “Delhi
Administration    Subordinate Service   Rules,
1967”. Rule 3 of the aforesaid Rules is to the
following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_571">    “3.   Constitution  of  service   and  its
  classification.—(1) On and from the date of
  commencement of these Rules, there shall be
  constituted one Central Civil Service, known
  as the Subordinate Service of the Delhi
  Administration.
</p>
<pre id="pre_9">    (2) The Service           shall    have    four      Grades,
  namely—
        Grade I
        Grade II
        Grade III
        Grade IV
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_196">                      197</span>




   (3) The posts in Grade I shall be Central
 Civil posts, Class II Group “B” (Gazetted)
 and those in Grades II, III and IV shall be
</pre><p id="p_572"> Central Civil posts Group “C” (Non-Gazetted).

   (4) Members of the service shall, in the
 normal course be eligible for appointment to
 various Grades of the service to which they
 belong and not to the other service.”
                        (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_573">  65. Subordinate services in the National
Capital Territory of Delhi are, therefore,
clearly Central Civil Services. The affidavit
of the Union of India also points out this
feature by stating that,

   “The posts in CCS Group C are in the
 subordinate services. The equivalent in the
 Union Territory of Delhi is the Delhi
 Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS)
 and the recruiting agency in the place of
 Staff Selection Commission is the Delhi
 Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSSB).
</p><p id="p_574"> Members    of   the    Delhi    Administrative
 Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre for
 Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It
 is for these reasons that the policy (of pan
 India eligibility) is consistently adopted.”

</p><p id="p_575">  66. A combined reading of these provisions of
the DASS Rules, 1967 and CCS Rules, 1965,
therefore, more than adequately explains the
nature of Subordinate Services in the NCT of
Delhi. These clearly are General Central
Services and perhaps, it is owing to this state
of affairs that the Union of India in its
affidavit has stated that,

   “Members   of   the   Delhi  Administrative
 Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre for
 Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_197">                                      198</span>



       is for these reasons that the policy (of pan
       India eligibility) is consistently adopted.”


</p><p id="p_576">38.The Constitution Bench in Bir Singh (supra), thus,

  has    opined      that     services       in       the    National       Capital

  Territory are clearly Central Civil Services.                                What

  has       been     held    by      the     Constitution          Bench       also

  reinforces that there are no State Public Services in

  the NCT, Delhi.                Learned counsel appearing for the

  appellant has placed much reliance on the Delhi Fire

  Services Act, 2007 to buttress his submission that by

  the aforesaid Act, State Services namely Delhi Fire

  Services has been created, which clearly means that

  Entry       41     of     List     II     is        applicable       to    Delhi

  Legislative Assembly. The Delhi Fire Services Act,

  2007 has been passed to provide for the maintenance

  of    a    fire        service     and     to       make    more     effective

  provisions for the fire prevention and fire safety

  measures in certain buildings and premises in the

  National Capital Territory of Delhi and the matter

  connected therewith.

<p id="p_577">39.We may first notice that the word “services” used in

  the    Act       has    been     used     in    a    manner     of   providing

  services         for      fire     prevention             and   fire      safety

  measures.      The word “services” has not been used in a

  sense of constitution of a service.                    It is to be

  noted   that    fire      service       is   a   municipal    function

  performed      by    local       authority.        Delhi     Municipal

  Council Act, 1957 contains various provisions dealing

  with prevention of fire etc.                 Further fire services

  is a municipal function falling within the domain of

  municipalities,          which    has    been    recognised    in   the

  Constitution        of    India.         <a href="/doc/452231/" id="a_614">Article    243(W)</a>     of   the

  Constitution         deals        with       functions        of    the

  municipalities in relation to matters listed in the

  12th Schedule.       Entry 7 of the 12th Schedule provides

  for “Fire Services” as one of the functions of the

  municipalities.          The nature of the enactment and the

  provisions clearly indicate that Delhi Fire Services

  Act falls under Entry 5 of List II and not under

  Entry 41 of List II.
