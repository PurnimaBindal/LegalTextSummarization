Since the plaintiff has separately applied for registration of the word mark KAYA,

it is entitled to protection not only of the whole of the trademarks, but also in

respect of their various parts. In fact, the word KAYA is the key and most

prominent part of the trademarks KAYA GLOW, KAYA SILKY LEGS NITE


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) 1549/2012                                                         Page 9 of 17</span>

plaintiffs in respect of the products which include hygienic, beauty care for human

beings, hair dressing salons, beauty salons, hair oil, hair growing preparations, hair

lotions, hair tonics, hair creams and conditioners, hair gel and other toilet and

toiletry preparations, lotions and creams and skin care preparations, as also in

respect of services comprising physical education and health club services, hair

dressing salons and beauty salons. Anyone seeking to buy the products being

manufactured and/or sold by the plaintiff company would ask for KAYA products

and if he comes across goods which bear the trademark KAYA, Kaya Kalp

Ayurveda, KAYA SUN SAFE etc, he/she is likely to be deceived into believing

that the products being offered to him was a product of the plaintiff company and

that is why the word KAYA was being used as a part of the trademark. Similarly, a

person coming across the outlet bearing the name Kayakalp Point or Kayakalp

Impact, Kayakalp Institute, Kaya Kalp Ayushchitiksa is also like to be deceived

into believing that the outlet belongs to the plaintiff company or is its franchisee

and that is why such a name is being used by the outlet. By using the word KAYA

as a part of its corporate name, its trademarks and domain name, the defendant is

using the most conspicuous and key component of the trademarks registered in

favour of plaintiff No. 2-company. The trademark KAYAKALP is being used by

the defendant in respect of products and services which are at least similar to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 1549/2012                                                          Page 10 of 17</span>
 products and services being offered by the plaintiff-company. The mark being

used by the defendant though not absolutely identical is similar to the registered

trademark of the plaintiff on account of use of the word of the word KAYA as part

of the trademark. Same is the position with respect to the corporate name and the

domain name being used by the defendant. Thus, the plaintiff has been able to

establish that a trademark similar to its registered trademarks is being used by the

defendant in respect of goods and services which are similar to those which are

covered by the plaintiffs registered trademarks. The defendants have, therefore,

clearly infringed the trademark of the plaintiff.

[1960 (1) SCR 968], the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that absolute identity of

the two competing marks or their close resemblance was only one of the tests for

determining the question of likelihood of deception or confusion. Trade connection

between different goods is another such test. The Court was of the view that these

are independent tests and there is no reason why the test of trade connection

to contest the suit and tell the Court as to why they chose to use the name which

comprises the word KAYA as a key component.                The plaintiffs are large

companies and plaintiff No.2 is stated to be running about 100 clinics in India and

abroad. The plaintiffs had turnover of Rs.117.97, Rs.125.65, Rs.108.01 crore in

the years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively from use of the brand name

KAYA and have incurred promotional expenditure of Rs 17.10 crore, 22.76 crore

and Rs 13.21 crore respectively during these years. Thus, KAYA is now a well-

established brand name in respect of care products and beauty skin care clinics. It

is obvious that by using the word KAYA as a part of its trade name, domain name

and trademark, the defendant is seeking to encash upon the goodwill and reputation

which the brand of the plaintiff enjoys in the market. The use of the word KAYA

by the defendant as a part of its domain name, corporate name, trademark/trade

name besides being injurious to the financial interest of the plaintiffs-companies is

also like to deceive the members of the public who may buy the products or avail

the services being offered by the defendant under a false impression that they were

buying the products/services of the plaintiff-companies.      If the quality of the

product or the services which the defendant is selling or providing is not as good as

those of the products and/or services of the plaintiff, that would substantially

               it is likely to deceive or cause confusion and that the user of the
               impugned trademark is in relation to the goods in respect of
               which the plaintiff has obtained registration in his favour. It
               will be sufficient if the plaintiff is able to show that the
               trademark adopted by the defendant resembles its trademark in
               a substantial degree, on account of extensive use of the main
               features found in his trademark. In fact, any intelligent person,
               seeking to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of a well-
               established trademark, would make some minor changes here
               and there so as to claim in the event of a suit or other
               proceeding, being initiated against him        that the trademark
               being used by him, does not constitute infringement of the
               trademark, ownership of which vests in some other person.

               resemblance in the two trademarks is found to be substantial, to
               the extent that the impugned trademark is found to be similar to
               the registered trademark of the plaintiff. But, such malpractices

                on account of such deceptive use of the registered trademark
               may end up buying the product of the infringer, though after
               knowing, either on account of difference in packaging etc. or on
               account of use of prefixes or suffixes that the product which he
               is buying is not the product of the plaintiff, but is the product of
               the defendant.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               14. As held by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/368264/" id="a_2">Amritdhara Pharmacy v.
               Satyadeo Gupta</a>, AIR 1963 SC 449, whether a trade name is
               likely to deceive or cause confusion by its resemblance to
               another mark already registered is a matter of first impression
               and the standard of comparison to be adopted in judging the
               resemblance is from the point of view of a man of average
               intelligence and imperfect recollection. What is important to
               keep in mind that the purchaser does not have both the marks
               lying side by side for comparison and, therefore, chances of
               deception are rather strong.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               16. ..The words TOTAL EFFECTS are an essential and integral
               component of plaintiff‟s registered trademark OLAY TOTAL
               EFFECTS. The defendants have virtually lifted two of the
               three words out of the registered word trademark OLAY
               TOTAL EFFECTS of the plaintiff-company and are using
               those two words as part of their trademark JOY ULTRA LOOK
               TOTAL EFFECTS. It is, therefore, difficult to dispute that the
               defendants by use of the words TOTAL EFFECTS as an
               essential part of their trademark JOY ULTRA LOOK TOTAL
               EFFECTS have infringed the registered trademark OLAY

                TOTAL EFFECTS of the plaintiff.            It is true that words
               TOTAL EFFECTS are only a part of the composite trademark
               of the defendants, but, that to my mind would make no
               difference since an essential and integral part of the plaintiff's
               registered trademark is being used by them for selling their
               product.   Neither deletion of a part of a registered trademark
               nor the prefix or suffix of another word to it would validate the
               use of the registered mark by an unlicensed user, once it is
               shown that the part used by the infringer is an essential part of
               the registered trademark.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">               Another important aspect in the case before the Court is that the
               words TOTAL EFFECTS use the last two words in the mark of
               the plaintiff as well as of the defendant, which in turn, indicates
               that adoption and use of these two words from the mark of the
               plaintiff was deceptive, intended to confuse the consumer and
               encash upon the goodwill enjoyed by plaintiff‟s trademark
               OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS. The trademark JOY ULTRA
               LOOK TOTAL EFFECTS, on account of incorporation of the
               words TOTAL EFFECTS in it has become deceptively similar
               to the registered trademark OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS of the
               plaintiff company.
