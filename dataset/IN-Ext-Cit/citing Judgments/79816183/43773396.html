<p id="p_1">1                   Brief facts, as per case of the prosecution, are that  deceased 

Meenu was married to accused Dilbag Singh on 18.04.2009 as per Hindu 

Rites and Ceremonies.   It is alleged that accused Dilbag Singh and his 

mother   i.e   accused   Daya   Devi   used   to   make   dowry   demands   from 

deceased Meenu and also used to cause cruelty and harassment to her.  It 

is further alleged that due to persistent dowry demands and the beatings 

given   by   accused   Dilbag,   the   deceased   Meenu   started   living   with   her 

parents. Further that about one week before the alleged incident, accused 

Dilbag Singh visited the house of complainant and used filthy and abusive 

language.   Thereafter Meenu became silent and stopped interacting with 

the family members and ultimately she committed suicide in her parental 

house by hanging with ceiling fan on 30.12.2009. A complaint was made 

by mother of the deceased and present FIR was registered.   Accused was 

arrested   and   after   completion   of   investigation,   charge­sheet   u/s 

498A/304B/34  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> was filed.  </p><pre id="pre_2">

5                   After completion of prosecution evidence, the statements of 

</pre><p id="p_4">accused persons were recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a> on 09.01.2015. Both the 

accused persons denied the case of prosecution in general and they opted 

to lead defense evidence and examined six witnesses including accused 

Dilbagh in their defense. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">

6                   I   have   heard   Ld.   Addl.   PP   for   the   State     assisted   by   ld. 

counsel for complainant and ld. counsel for  the accused persons.   I have 

also carefully perused the record including the written submission filed on 

behalf of parties.

<p id="p_6">

7                   It is argued on behalf of State that case against the accused 

persons has been duly proved on record beyond any reasonable doubts. 

Further that discrepancies/contradictions if any in the case of prosecution 

are minor and natural.   It is argued that it is duly proved on record that 

soon   after   her   marriage   with   accused   Dilbagh   deceased   Meenu   was 

subjected to dowry demands, cruelty and harassment.     Further that it is 

proved that on 19.06.2009 and 13.09.2009 the accused Dilbag abused and

                                                                               P.S Janak Puri


beaten  the deceased  for not  bringing  sufficient  dowry.   Further that  on 

28.06.2009, the deceased had written a suicide note and under the fear to 

her life and limbs, she left her matrimonial home and came to her parents 

home on 28.11.2009.  Further that it is proved that on 24.12.2009, accused 

Dilbagh  came at the house of complainant  and abused  the deceased  in 

front   of   her   family   members   and   from   that   day   the   deceased   started 

remaining silent and ultimately she committed suicide on 30.12.2009.  It 

is   further   argued   that   the   death  of  deceased  had  occurred  in  unnatural 

circumstances within seven years of her marriage and the burden was on 

the accused  persons  to  show that  she was not  subjected  to cruelty and 

harassment and that the accused persons have failed to discharge the onus. 

It  is submitted  that   the  case has  been duly  proved  against  the  accused 

persons for all the alleged offences.  Written submissions have been filed 

on behalf of the complainant  and reliance is placed upon on following 

judgments of different superior courts.

8                   On the other hand, it is submitted on behalf of the accused 

</pre><p id="p_8">persons   that   the   case   of   prosecution   is   full   of   discrepancies   and 

contradictions  and same is based on false evidence.   The credibility of 

witnesses has also been challenged. It is submitted that the statements of 

the witnesses are full of contradictions, discrepancies and improvements 

and  have affected the core of the prosecution  case. Further that  all  the 

allegations have been levelled only after the unfortunate incident. Further 

that it is admitted case that the deceased committed suicide at her parents 

house   and   it   is   also   there   in   evidence   that   she   had   gone   there   on 

28.11.2009   to   attend   her   brother's   ring   ceremony   and   the   marriage 

scheduled to be held on 30.11.2009 and 02.12.2009. Further that since, 

she committed suicide at her parental house on 30.12.2009, the provisions 

of   <a href="/doc/714962/" id="a_22">section   113</a>­B   of   the   Evidence   Act   r/w   <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_23">section   304</a>   B   IPC   are   not 

attracted.    Further that  the marriage between the accused   Dilbagh  and 

deceased   was   arranged   pursuant   to   newspaper   advertisement   dt. 

14.12.2008   and   the   same   was   a   dowry   less   marriage   and   even   after 

marriage, there was no demand of dowry at any point of time.  Further that 

the documents relied upon by the prosecution have not been proved as per 

<a href="/doc/83327418/" id="a_24">State vs. Dilbagh Singh &amp; Anr.                                                      Page No</a>.  8/71

law   in   a   conclusive   manner   and   there   are   also   other   defects   in   the 

investigation carried out by the IO.  Further that the ingredients of none of 

the offences are made out on record.  Further that the deceased was living 

with her parents at her parental  home for about   more than one month 

prior to her death and she has committed suicide due to behaviour and 

misconduct   of   her   family   members.     It   is   argued   that   prosecution   has 

failed to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubts and 

therefore   the   accused   persons   are   entitled   to   be   acquitted.   Written 

arguments were also filed on behalf of accused persons and Ld. Counsel 

for     accused   persons   has   relied   upon   following   judgments   of   superior 

courts in support of his contentions.

why Meenu committed  suicide was immediate refusal  of his brother to

earlier   statements   of   these   witnesses   recorded   by   the   SDM/police   i.e 

Ex.PW­1/DX­1, PW­1/DX­2, PW­1/DX­3 and Ex.PW­8/A to which the 

witnesses have been duly confronted during cross­examination.   Further 

there are contradictions in between the testimonies of PW­1 &amp; PW­11 on 

this aspect.  The PW­1 talks about demand of flat by the accused Dilbag 

on 24.12.2009 while PW­11 has not referred to any such demands while 

deposing   about   the   above   incident.   Further   PW­11   has   described   the 

alleged words used by the accused Dilbag on 24.12.2009 but on the other 

hand, the PW­1 has not specified any such words. It is also strange that on 

the one hand, the PW­11 says that Dilbag had come to their house for 

taking Meenu and on the other hand as per PW­11 the accused used the 

language as mentioned above. If he had come there to take Meenu, why 

would he use such a language.

several times asked about the specimen handwriting of Meenu in Hindi

the death has occurred on 30.12.2009 i.e after more than six months from 

the date of writing  of the note.   Several developments  had taken place 

during  the period  of six  months  as the accused  and the deceased lived 

together and even attended the engagement ceremony of PW­1 also. It is 

also there on record that the deceased Meenu was detected with pregnancy 

of   several   weeks   when   examined   by   doctor   on   04.11.2009.   DW­5   Dr. 

Arbinder   Dang,   Senior   Consultant,   Gyne,   Sant   Parmanand   Hospital

she   was   having   pregnancy   of   about   eight   weeks   and   treatment   was

Conclusions qua facts/ingredients no. C &amp; D



17                  In view of discussions under above circumstances, it is clear 

that   the   material   brought   on   record   by   the   prosecution   including   the 

statements of the different witnesses has not been able to establish that 

deceased Meenu was subjected to cruelty and harassment in connection 

with dowry by the accused persons. 
</p>
<p id="p_109">                    There were no allegations regarding dowry demands in any of 

the statements of the relatives of deceased recorded by the SDM and it 

seems that the facts have been twisted subsequently  to give a different 

dimension to the case. The case put forward by the prosecution by way of 

charge­sheet has remained unproved as per legal requirement during trial. 

The witnesses other than PW­1, PW­4  &amp; PW­11 are incidental witnesses 

who are not directly related to the allegations. PW­4 has deposed in very

general terms and his statement lacks specification.   The contradictory, 

improvised   and   uncorroborated  testimonies  of  PW­1  &amp;  PW­11  are  not 

sufficient to prove the allegations against the accused persons.   There is 

total   lack   of   definite   and   specific   evidence   qua   demand   of   dowry   or 

cruelty/harassment related to such demand.  
</p>
<p id="p_110">                    The evidence brought on record shows at the most that there 

was some conflict between husband and wife but the same does not fall 

within the ambit of cruelty and harassment.  If the instances of conflict are 

interpreted liberally and it is assumed for a moment that it tantamounts to 

cruelty and harassment, the same is not at all related to demand of dowry. 

Further   such   cruelty   and   harassment   was   not   soon   before   death   of 

deceased as required by law. There is no definite evidence to show dowry 

demands on part of the accused persons or cruelty and harassment related 

to such demands soon before the death of deceased Meenu.

prosecution has not been able to prove that the deceased was subjected to 

cruelty and harassment related to dowry soon before her death.  In the case 

in   hand,   the   prosecution   has   actually   failed   to   prove   even   cruelty   and 

harassment against the deceased much less the dowry related cruelty   or 

harassment and that too soon before the death of deceased Meenu.  



19                  It is argued on behalf of prosecution that the accused persons 

are liable to be convicted by virtue of the presumption laid down under 

section 113 B of The Evidence Act. On the other hand, it is submitted on 

behalf of accused persons that in the given facts and circumstances, the 

said   presumption   is   not   there   in   force/operation   against   the   accused 

persons.

<p id="p_115">                    As   per   section   113   B   of   the   Evidence   Act,   there   is   one 

presumption against the accused persons in cases related to dowry death.

</p><p id="p_118">                    The presumption u/s 113B of the Evidence Act comes into

things   were   actually     not   in   their   direct   control.     There   can   be   numerous 

reasons which could have forced the deceased to take such an extreme step.  It 

was the duty of the investigating agency to unearth the truth but the IO has not 

properly investigated the matter and it seems that he has relied heavily on the 

version of complainant and  presumptions attached with the offence u/s 304B 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_98">IPC</a> r/w section 113 B Evidence Act. It is not investigated as to what actually 

happened   between   28.11.2009   and   30.12.2009.     The   presumption   u/s   113B 

Evidence Act is a rebutable presumption.   Though, the basic requirement for 

invoking the presumption u/s 113B Evidence Act have not been fulfilled as 

discussed earlier, the said presumption has been otherwise rebutted to a great 

extent by the fact itself that the deceased Meenu was at her parental home for 

more   than   one   month.     The   other   lacunas/deficiencies   in   the   case   of 

prosecution have done the rest for the accused persons. 



20                  It is explained on behalf of accused that deceased Meenu might 

have committed suicide as she wanted to go with her brother and Bhabhi for 

tourism   but   she   was   not   taken  with  them.     In  this   regard,   the   accused  has 

examined DW­2 Sh. Rajpal and DW­3 Sh. Balkishan who deposed that they 

attended   the   postmortem   and   cremation   of   deceased 

<a href="/doc/83327418/" id="a_99">State vs. Dilbagh Singh &amp; Anr.                                                         Page No</a>.  65/71

Meenu and they overheard the mother of the deceased saying to her son  Vivek 

(PW­1)   " Vivek agar tu Meenu ko apne sath le jata to yeh ghatna nahi 

hoti".  Since, there is no detailed investigation about the things happened 

at the parental house of the deceased from 28.11.2009 to 30.12.2009, the 

above explanation given by the accused cannot be simply rejected. 



21                  There is ample evidence on record to show that the relations 

between   accused   Dilbag   and   deceased   Meenu   were   generally   cordial. 

Admittedly, the accused had taken a house on rent which was at a walking 

distance from the workplace of deceased i.e Kamla Nehru College.   The 

accused Dilbag had admittedly gone to Manali in Himachal Pradesh with 

deceased  Meenu   after   their  marriage  for  tourism/honeymoon.  The land 

lord (DW­1) and neighbourer (DW­6) have deposed categorically that the 

relations   between   accused   Dilbag   and   his   wife   Meenu   were   cordial. 

Further she has stayed with accused Dilbag for a considerable period of 

time from the date of her marriage till her death.  Further she was pregnant 

at one point of time as discussed above in light of the testimony of DW­5.

22                  Further   there   was   no   complaint   at   any   point   of   time   that 

deceased   Meenu   was   subjected  to  dowry  demands   till  her  death.    The 

</pre><p id="p_120">conduct   of  accused  persons  on the date  of  death  of  Meenu is also  not 

unusual.  The accused was informed about the health of deceased Meenu 

by her maternal uncle PW­4 just after the incident and there is evidence 

that   accused   Dilbag,   his   family   members   and   friends   reached   at   the 

hospital on 30.12.2009 itself and they also remained present at hospital 

during postmortem of deceased Meenu and also during her cremation. 



23                  The possibility of manipulation of things after recording of 

statements by the SDM cannot be ruled out because PW­1 Vivek Kumar 

who  is brother of deceased was not  probably  present  at  the spot  when 

statements   of   mother,   father   and   maternal   uncle   of   the   deceased   were 

recorded  by  the SDM.   PW­1 claims to be present  there but  his  claim 

seems to be doubtful as his statement would have been definitely recorded 

by the SDM if he was present at the spot. Further, if he was present at the 

spot, it is not explained as to why he did not offer himself for recording of 

his statement by SDM, particularly when he claims to be witness to all the

alleged incidents of cruelty/harassment etc.  Admittedly, the PW­1 was at 

Chittorgarh with his wife at the time of incident and he reached Delhi only 

on next day i.e 31.12.2009. It is reflected from the record that PW­1 might 

have   reached   only   after   recording   of   statements   by   the   SDM   and   the 

things were, thereafter twisted to give a different colour.  The bonafide of 

the PW­1 has been challenged by the defense as it is claimed that he is 

indulged in making of false complaints as his complaints dt. 09.01.2010 

and 26.04.2011 regarding threats were found to be false.  In this regard, 

the accused persons have relied upon the reply received from the office of 

Addl. DCP under RTI i.e Ex.DW­4/E.

24                  The complainant has also tried to discredit the accused Dilbag

pleas   are   mentioned.   However,   the   documents   relied   upon   by   the

25                  There were no allegations of dowry demand in the statements 

</pre><p id="p_122">recorded by the SDM.   There are no independent witnesses qua alleged 

incidents   of   cruelty/harassment/dowry   demands.     No  police   complaints 

were   made   by   the   family   members   of   the   deceased   before   her   death. 

Statements of the prosecution witnesses, particularly PW­1 &amp; PW­11 are 

suffering   from   improvements,   contradictions   and   discrepancies.     The 

statements   are   conflicting   and   inconsistent   as   well.     There   is   no   just 

explanation   for   the   improvements   in   the   statements   of   the   witnesses. 

There is no live link or proximity between the death of the deceased and 

the allegations against the accused.  The defense witnesses have rebutted 

the evidence of the prosecution to a great extent.

Conclusion

27        In   view   of   discussions   under   ingredients/facts   from   A   to   E   as 

</pre><p id="p_127">mentioned above, it can be said that the prosecution has failed to prove the

was   subjected   to   cruelty,   harassment   or   dowry   demands   or   that   she 

committed suicide due to such cruelty, harassment or dowry demands.  It 

is   also   not   established   against   the   accused   persons   that   they 

misappropriated   the   Istridhan   articles   of   the   deceased   or   committed
