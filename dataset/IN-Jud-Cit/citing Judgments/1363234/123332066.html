<p id="p_1">        Latika, having been denied selection to the post of Constable
(General Duty) on account of late submission of Other Backward Class
(OBC) certificate, has filed the present writ petition impugning order dated
8th July, 2016, returning the OBC certificate submitted by her. She has
prayed for a direction to the respondents to include her name in the final list
of successful candidates for the post of Constable (General Duty).
</p><p id="p_2">2.      Relevant facts, in brief, may be noted. Staff Selection Commission
(SSC, for short) vide notification dated 24th January, 2015 had invited
applications for recruitment of 62,390 Constables (General Duty) in the
Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and other organizations. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                      Page 1 of 16</span>
 recruitment process consisted of Physical Standards Test, Physical
Efficiency Test, Written Examination and Medical Examination.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      The petitioner having qualified the Physical Standards Test and
Physical Efficiency Test and also having cleared the written examination,
was called for Detailed Medical Examination, which was held on 11th May,
2016.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      There is a dispute as to what happened and transpired on 11th May,
2016 at the time of Detailed Medical Examination. The respondents, in the
counter affidavit, have submitted that the petitioner was asked to submit
caste certificate in the prescribed format for she was seeking age relaxation.
The petitioner had given an undertaking that she would furnish the said
certificate by 26th May, 2016 and if she failed to do so, either her
candidature would be cancelled or she would be treated as a general
category candidate, subject to her fulfilling eligibility criteria, and that she
would forgo her claim as a reserved category candidate in the interview.
The petitioner, however, asserts that she had received a telephone call on
24th June, 2016 from the office of the third respondent, Deputy Director
General of Police, Regional Recruitment Centre, Central Reserved Police
Force(CRPF), requiring her to submit caste certificate issued by the
Government of India within one week. She had immediately applied and
obtained an OBC certificate dated 28th June, 2016 issued by the District
Magistrate. She had then tried to submit the same in the office of the third
respondent on 30th June, 2016, but the same was not received on the ground
that the last date of submision of the certificate was 29th June, 2016. On
refusal by the third respondent, the petitioner had gone to the office of the
second respondent, Director General, CRPF, and handed over the same with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                      Page 2 of 16</span>
 an application to the concerned officer posted there on 30th June, 2016. The
petitioner submits that she had already furnished her OBC certificate dated
11th October, 2013, issued by the office of Deputy Commissioner, North-
East District, Delhi, at the time of the Detailed Medical Examination.
</p><p id="p_5">5.      At the outset, we may record that the petitioner belongs to „Gujjar‟
community. It is an undisputed position that she is an OBC candidate and is
entitled to benefit of reservation. The question primarily relates to late
submission of the OBC certificate.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      We would first begin by referring to the counter affidavit filed by the
second and the third respondent. They have elucidated that in response to
the recruitment notification, admit cards of as many as 57,44,100 candidates
were uploaded on the website on 20th April, 2015 for conducting Physical
Standard Test and Physical Efficiency Test which were to be held at 183
different locations from 25th May, 2015 to 30th July, 2015. The candidates,
who had qualified the said test, had appeared for written examination
conducted by the SSC on 4th October, 2015. The results were declared on
14th March, 2016 and 7th April, 2016. The details of the candidates, who had
qualified for Detailed Medical Examination was uploaded on the website of
CRPF on 29th March, 2016. It was informed that Detailed Medical
Examinations would be held from 10th May, 2016 onwards. The candidates
were advised to download their admit cards for Detailed Medical
Examination with effect from 15th April, 2016 from www.crpfindia.co.in.
This notice had mentioned details of documents required to be brought by
the candidates at the time of Detailed Medical Examination. Detailed
Medical Examination of 1,44,802 candidates, who were issued admit cards,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                     Page 3 of 16</span>
 was held at 78 different centers of CAPFs between 10th May, 2016 and 7th
June, 2016.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      The respondents have highlighted that as large number of applicants
were expected to apply, the certificates and documents were to be examined
at the stage of Detailed Medical Examination of only those candidates, who
had qualified for the medical examination. In view of the anticipated large
number of applicants, the scrutiny of the eligibility and other aspects was
not to be undertaken before the two tests and the written examination. The
candidates were required to go through the requirements of educational
qualification, age, physical standards, etc. and satisfy themselves that they
were eligible for the post they were applying.
</p><p id="p_8">8.      However, there are some significant admissions made by the second
and the third respondent in the counter affidavit. It is admitted that for
facilitation of the qualified candidates, who had appeared for Detailed
Medical Examination, the CAPFs and Detailed Medical Examination
Boards were directed not to refuse examination or reject a candidate due to
lack of documents and that candidates should be given time to produce the
same till the last date of Detailed Medical Examination. It is also stated by
the respondents that the OBC caste certificate should have been issued with
non-creamy layer status within three years of the closing date i.e. on or after
23rd February, 2012. Thus, certificates issued on or before 22 nd February,
2012 would not be accepted as valid. There was another stipulation that the
caste certificate of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or OBC for
reservation or age relaxation should be in the prescribed format vide
Annexures VI and VII. The caste should have been notified in the Central
List published by the Government of India. For the sake of completeness,

 we would reproduce the relevant clauses of the notification issued by the
SSC, dated 24th January, 2015, which were as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               Candidates who wish to be considered against vacancies
         reserved/or seek age-relaxation must submit requisite certificate from
         the competent authority. Otherwise, their claim for SC/ST/OBC/ExS
         status will not be entertained and their candidature/applications will
         be considered under General (UR) category. The formats of the
         certificates are annexed. Certificates obtained in any other format
         will not be accepted. Candidates claiming OBC status may note that
         the OBC certificate should have been obtained within three years
         before the closing date i.e. 23.02.2015. The Commission has
         decided to accept OBC certificate, in the prescribed format, issued
         after the closing date for receipt of application but issued on or
         before the date of their document verification, as valid proof of
         belonging to OBC.

                   and, therefore, the candidature will be accepted only

<p id="p_9">Annexure VII to the said notification relates to the form of certificate to be
produced by the OBC candidate.
</p><p id="p_10">9.      Keeping in view the enormous task, we would accept the contention
of the respondents that the procedure mentioned in the notification was just,
fair and proper. Possibly, there was no other method which could have been
adopted and applied, given the numbers and mammoth task. Thus, as a
sequitor, the respondents seek to justify their stand and submit that the
submission of the certificate cannot be open-ended. Specified dates were
fixed and schedule must be adhered to. Notice and warnings were given.
Failure to submit relevant certificate in prescribed format by the specified
date would have consequences and to hold otherwise would lead to
administrative chaos and mess.
</p><p id="p_11">10.     When we turn to the facts of the present case, we would first refer to
the controversy on the question of the undertaking given by the petitioner on
11th May, 2016 at the time of Detailed Medical Examination. The
respondents have enclosed the undertaking (Annexure R-1), which bears the
signature of the petitioner. It states that if the petitioner was unable to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                     Page 6 of 16</span>
 produce the original certificate/document by 26th May, 2016, her
candidature might be treated as cancelled or she may be treated as a general
category candidate. The said undertaking is in a printed proforma which has
different clauses relating to documents or certificates found to be deficient
or missing. Annexure R-1 indicates that clause V relating to caste certificate
was ticked or marked. The petitioner submits that she was made to sign the
said document but she was not told and informed orally that she was
required to submit the certificate. She had for the first time learnt about the
said requirement when she received a telephone call from the office of the
third respondent on 24th June, 2016. The petitioner had accordingly obtained
certificate dated 28th June, 2016 and had proceeded to the office of the third
respondent to submit the same. As the certificate was not accepted, she had
written an application and attached the caste certificate and submitted the
same to in the office of the second respondent, Director General, CRPF on
30th June, 2016.
</p><p id="p_12">11.     The petitioner relies upon Annexure P-8, which is a letter written by
her to the second respondent, Director General, CRPF, enclosing the caste
certificate. She has stated that she received the telephonic call on 24th June,
2016 and next two days being government holidays, she had applied for
caste certificate on 27th June, 2016 and had received the same on 29th June,
2016. Thereupon, she had proceeded to the office of the third respondent on
30th June, 2016 to submit the caste certificate, which was not received.
</p><p id="p_13">12.     The aforesaid dispute is a dispute relating to facts. Though it is not
possible to form an absolute and firm opinion, we would, on the basis of
probability, agree with the petitioner. The petitioner, it is obvious, was
extremely keen and desirous of joining employment as a Constable. She had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                     Page 7 of 16</span>
 sweated and worked hard to reach the final stage. She was conscious that
she required an OBC certificate and had accordingly obtained and relied on
the certificate from the office of the Deputy Commissioner, North-East
District, Delhi issued on 11th October, 2013. The said certificate states that
the petitioner belongs to „Gujjar‟ community, which was recognized as a
Backward Class in terms of the notification issued by the Government of
NCT of Delhi and she does not belong to creamy layer in terms of the
notification issued by the Government of India. In case, and if she had been
informed that this certificate was not as per the prescribed format and she
was required to procure caste certificate from the District Magistrate, she
would have done so immediately and not waited till 27 th June, 2016. Subtle
yet stultifying difference in the certificates may not be known and
understood by a many.
</p><p id="p_14">13.     There is one more aspect which has bothered us. As per Annexure R-
1, the petitioner was asked to get the caste certificate on or before 26 th May,
2016. However, as per the counter affidavit, for facilitation of all candidates,
the CAPFs and Detailed Medical Examination Boards were directed not to
refuse any candidate due to lack of documents and the candidate should be
given time to produce the same till the last date of Medical Examination.
The last date, we may note, as per the respondents themselves was 7 th June,
2016. It is apparent from the stand of the respondent before us that the
petitioner was not properly guided and asked to submit appropriate
certificate till the last date of the Detailed Medical Examination on 7th June,
2016. Apparently, the certificates were accepted even later.
</p><p id="p_15">14.     We also find that the issue in question has been dealt with and
examined by the Supreme Court in Ram Kumar Gijroya Vs. Delhi

        importance, the full text of his speech delivered in the Constituent
        Assembly on the point is appended to this judgment. But I shall now
        read a few passages from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "... firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly, that
        there shall be reservations in favour of certain communities which
        have not so far had a „proper look-in‟ so to say into the
        administration. ... Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in full
        the demand of those communities who have not been so far employed
        in the public services to the fullest extent, what would really happen
        is, we shall be completely destroying the first proposition upon which
        we are all agreed, namely, that there shall be an equality of
        opportunity. ... Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the reservation is
        to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_10">Article 10</a>, [Ed.: The matter
        between two asterisks has been emphasised in Indra Sawhney case,
        1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] must be confined to a minority of
        seats [Ed.: The matter between two asterisks has been emphasised
        in Indra Sawhney case, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] . It is then only that
        the first principle could find its place in the Constitution and effective
        in operation. ... we have to safeguard two things, namely, the
        principle of equality of opportunity and at the same time satisfy the
        demand of communities which have not had so far representation in
        the State...." [Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7, pp. 701-02
        (1948-1949).]
        These words embody the raison d'être of reservation and its
        limitations. Reservation is one of the measures adopted by the
        Constitution to remedy the continuing evil effects of prior inequities
        stemming from discriminatory practices against various classes of
        people which have resulted in their social, educational and economic
        backwardness. Reservation is meant to be addressed to the present
        social, educational and economic backwardness caused by purposeful
        societal discrimination. To attack the continuing ill effects and
        perpetuation of such injustice, the Constitution permits and empowers
        the State to adopt corrective devices even when they have
        discriminatory and exclusionary effects. Any such measure, insofar as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                        Page 10 of 16</span>

        "11. ... „15. The matter can be looked into from another angle also.
        As per the advertisement dated 11-6-1999 issued by the Board,
        vacancies are reserved for various categories including SC category.
        Thus in order to be considered for the post reserved for SC category,
        the requirement is that a person should belong to SC category. If a
        person is SC he is so by birth and not by acquisition of this category
        because of any other event happening at a later stage. A certificate
        issued by competent authority to this effect is only an affirmation of
        fact which is already in existence. The purpose of such certificate is
        to enable the authorities to believe in the assertion of the candidate
        that he belongs to SC category and act thereon by giving the benefit
        to such candidate for his belonging to SC category. It is not that
        petitioners did not belong to SC category prior to 30-6-1998 or that
        acquired the status of being SC only on the date of issuance of the
        certificate. In view of this position, necessitating upon a certificate
        dated prior to 30-6-1998 would be clearly arbitrary and it has no
        rationale objective sought to be achieved.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">        16. While taking a particular view in such matters one has to keep in
        mind the objectives behind the post of SC and ST categories as per
        constitutional mandate prescribed in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) which
        are enabling provisions authorising the Government to make special
        provisions for the persons of SC and ST categories. Articles 14(4) and
        16(4), therefore, intend to remove social and economic inequality to
        make equal opportunities available in reality. Social and economic
        justice is a right enshrined for protection of society. The right in

        society is to remove inequality in public employment, as candidates
        belonging to these categories are unable to compete with the
        candidates belonging to the general category as a result of facing
        centuries of oppression and deprivation of opportunity. The
        constitutional concept of reservation envisaged in the Preamble of the
        Constitution as well as Articles 14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the directive
        principles of State policy is to achieve the concept of giving equal
        opportunity to all sections of the society. The Division Bench, thus,
        erred in reversing the judgment and order passed by the learned
        Single Judge. Hence, the impugned judgment and order passed by the
        Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No. 562 of 2011 is not only
        erroneous but also suffers from error in law as it has failed to follow

Selection Commission and Anr. decided on 6th May, 2013, a Division
Bench of this Court had the occasion to examine the question of undertaking
taken from the petitioner/candidate, in the prescribed format, at the time of
interview. In the said undertaking the petitioner had agreed that she could

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                     Page 13 of 16</span>
 not furnish the OBC certificate in the prescribed proforma, therefore, her
candidature should be considered in the unreserved category instead of OBC
category. Keeping in view the nature of certificate it was observed that the
petitioner therein was faced with a Hobson‟s choice to take it or leave and
therefore, undertaking given was not voluntary. Similar undertakings were
taken from several other candidates. However, more important are the
observations of the court on the question of OBC certificate and its
relevance, which read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">          "17. The last decision dealt with the subject of an OBC certificate
          issued prior to three years preceding the cut off date and held that
          the stipulation in the advertisement that the OBC certificate had to
          be within the three preceding years of the last cut off date was legal
          and valid because as against SC and ST candidates, creamy layer
          OBC candidates are not entitled to benefit of reservation. In other
          words the decision explain that a person may be below the
          income/wealth level in a particular year and hence entitled to benefit
          of reservation as an OBC, but may be above the prescribed
          income/wealth level thereafter. The decision has no application in
          the facts of the instant case. As regards the other two the law
          declared is that certificates issued after prescribed cut off dates have
          to be ignored. The said two decisions have no application in the
          instant case because the advertisement inviting applications did not
          prescribed any cut off date by which the certificates had to be
          furnished.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">          18. Besides, the law declared in Ram Kumar Gijroya‟s case (supra)
          and Krishna Kumar‟s case (supra) overlooks a fundamental point.
          The two decisions seem to be influenced by the line of reasoning
          found in various decisions that eligibility has to be obtained prior to
          the cut off date. In these decisions the certificates such as degrees
          etc. were issued after the prescribed cut off dates by which
          applications had to be filed. The two decisions over looked that a
          person becomes a member of a caste by birth and the certificates are
          not akin to certificates certifying that a person has acquired a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">WP(C) 7695/2016                                                        Page 14 of 16</span>
           degree. Caste Certificates are more in the nature of a memorandum
          recording a fact pertaining to birth. This was the view correctly
          taken in the decision dated February 17, 2010 disposing of WP(C)
          13870/<a href="/doc/128608676/" id="a_26">2009 Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board &amp; Anr.vs.
          Anu Devi &amp; Anr. The Division</a> emphasized that reservations for SC,
          ST and OBC are beneficial legislations and that submission of an
          OBC certificate to claim reservation could not be equated with
          acquisition of Educational Qualifications."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">17.     Following the said reasoning, we would observe that the petitioner
herein had furnished the OBC certificate, which was not in the prescribed
proforma. We have observed on the basis of preponderance of probabilities
that the petitioner was informed about the subtle difference between the
certificate required to be furnished and thereupon had obtained a copy of the
relevant certificate which was then furnished on 30th June, 2016. The
Selection List had not yet been prepared. We have also referred to the
incongruity as to the date for submission of the certificate mentioned in the
undertaking i.e. 26th May, 2016 and the stand taken by the respondents in
the counter affidavit that the certificate could not have been submitted by 7 th
June, 2016. In fact, it appears that the certificates were accepted even on
subsequent dates.
</p><p id="p_19">18.     In view of the aforesaid discussion, we would allow the present writ
petition and direct the respondents to consider the petitioner‟s case as an
OBC candidate and not reject the same on the ground that petitioner had not
submitted the OBC certificate within the prescribed time. Petitioner‟s
candidature would be, accordingly, processed and considered and in case
she is found eligible and qualified on merits, she would be issued a letter of
offer of appointment within a period of two months from the date a copy of
this order is received. She will not be entitled to backwages and her

given notional seniority along with her batchmates. Her pay will be fixed
