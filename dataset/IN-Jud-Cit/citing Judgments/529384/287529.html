<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

</p><p id="p_2"> 1. The 1st plaintiff is a company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> of the United Kingdom with the object, inter alia, to protect and promote the interests of the scotch whisky trade generally, both in the United Kingdom and abroad. The status and locus standi of the 1st plaintiff to institute or defend proceedings to protect the reputation and goodwill of "Scotch Whisky" and the interest of scotch whisky trade is recognised by judicial decisions of this Court and English Courts. The 1st plaintiff has been adopting judicial proceedings for more than a decade to prevent non-scotch whisky being passed off as scotch whisky and to sue the tortfeasors who commit the economic tort of passing off of non-scotch whisky in one form or another by adopting device of colourable imitation of name, design, mark or any other indicia on its label so as to confuse or deceive the unwary purchaser in respect of its origin and source. The 1st plaintiff has about 116 members who carry on the business of distilling and/or blending and/or selling "scotch whisky". The business reputation and goodwill of scotch whisky is an acknowledged fact throughout the world. Since there are attempts on the part of manufacturers, distillers and blenders of other whiskies not connected with scotch whisky to damage the reputation and goodwill of scotch whisky by its colourable imitation or by adopting one or other of the devices, the 1st plaintiff is required to take action and adopt proceedings against the traders who imitate name, marks, labels, letters or pictures on their product and thus append false or misleading or confusing description thereon. The 1st plaintiff has adopted some such proceeding in the past in some of the High Courts in our country and also other countries of the world and succeeded in obtaining the reliefs sought for. The plaintiff No. 2 is a member of the 1st plaintiff. The 2nd plaintiff is incorporated as a company under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a> of the United Kingdom carrying on business, inter alia, as a distiller, blender and dealer of scotch whisky. The defendant is a Co-operative Society incorporated under the provisions of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 
(hereinafter referred to as the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_3">Societies Act</a>)
carrying on business, inter alia, as a manufacturer, distiller and dealer of Indian whisky.  
</p> 

<p id="p_3"> 2. The plaintiffs have instituted this passing off action (in its expanded/extended form as recognised by Modern Law of Torts) against the defendants for a declaration that by using the device of a Scottish Drummer wearing a kilt or the tartan band or the word 'Scotch' coupled with the description "Blended With Scotch" and by using the impugned label (being Exhibit 'G' and Exhibit 'H' to the plaint) on their Indian whisky marketed under the mark "Drum Beater", the defendant is passing off its whisky as "Scotch Whisky", misleading the other traders and customers and damaging the reputation and goodwill of Scotch Whisky' and its genuine distillers, blenders etc. The plaintiffs have also prayed for issue of a permanent injunction and interim injunction against the defendants from advertising or offering for sale or selling or distributing in any country whisky which is not "Scotch Whisky" bearing the impugned label (being Exhibit 'G' to the plaint) or the impugned carton (being Exhibit 'H' to the plaint) bearing the mark "Drum Beater" or the word "Scotch" or the device of a Scottish Drummer wearing a kilt or the tartan band or the words "Blended with Scotch" or the word "Scotch" or any other mark, label, carton, device or description suggesting Scottish origin, so as to pass off or enable others to pass off its whisky as "Scotch Whisky."  
</p>
 

<p id="p_4"> 3. The defendants manufacture various brands of Indian whiskies, out of which two are the subject-matter of this action, namely (1) DRUM BEATER and (2) GOLD TYCOON. The plaintiffs have prayed for similar declaration and injunction in respect of the whisky marketed by the defendants with the name "GOLD TYCOON" on the basis of the averments that the label and the carton used by the defendants in respect of the said product also amount to passing off their product as if "scotch whisky". The plaintiffs have claimed other reliefs in the plaint which need not be summarised. I am not setting out each and every averment made in the plaint and the supporting affidavits for sake of brevity.  
</p> 

<p id="p_5"> 4. It is not disputed, and it is not disputable, that scotch whisky is exported from United Kingdom to India on a fairly targe scale and is available in 5-Star Hotels and elsewhere, and is being consumed by various categories of consumers as noticed by Pendse, J. in Suit No. 1352 of 1986, decided on 17th/18th/19th November, 1986, <a href="/doc/838156/" id="a_4">The Scotch Whisky Association v. Mohan Meakin Limited</a>. The plaintfffs have annexed a statement to the plaint showing the exports of scotch whisky to India for the years 1937 to 1986. The 2nd plaintiff makets its scotch whisky in India as stated in paragraph 8 of the plaint. The brands sold by the 2nd plaintiff included "Chivas Regal", "Royal Salute", "100 Pipes" and "Passport". It emerges from the record of this case that the 2nd plaintiff has been making extensive export of scotch whisky to India and if necessary reference can be made in this behalf to copies of invoices annexed at Exhibits 1-1 to 1-25, being the sample invoices, showing such sales, forming part of the affidavit in rejoinder made by Mr. Ian Glen Barclay dated 22nd December, 1987. Thus the plaintiffs have sufficient interest and locus standi to prevent passing off of Indian whisky manufactured by the defendants as Scotch Whisky and damage reputation and goodwill of Scotch whisky trade.  
</p> 

<p id="p_6"> 5. It has been averred in paragraph 7 of the plaint that members of the 1st plaintiff, including the 2nd plaintiff, who distill scotch whisky and market it all over the world, use various well known brand names such as "Royal Salute", "Chivas Regal", "100 Pipes", "Red Label", "Johnnie Walker-Black Label" etc. or devices showing well known Scottish figures or Scottish soldiers or Scottish Headgears or Scottish emblems. The plaintiffs have annexed a copy of the booklet entitled "Scotch Whisky, Questions and Answers" published by the I st plaintiff, as Exhibit 'A' to the plaint. I propose to refer only to such part of the relevant material from the said booklet which has already received judicial imprimatur from Pendse, J. in his above-referred judgment. The expression "Scotch Whisky" has been defined by the Current British legislation as set out in paragraph 5 of <a href="/doc/657817/" id="a_5">Section 1</a> of the said booklet. In substance, the expression "Scotch Whisky" means whisky which has been distilled and matured in Scotland. It is directly relevant for purpose of this case to refer to the meaning of the words "Blended Scotch Whisky" as understood in the trade. The expression "Blended Scotch Whisky" is understood in the trade as explained in the said booklet and as explained also in some of the English judicial decisions cited at the Bar as "a blend of a number of distillates each of which separately is entitled to the description Scotch Whisky". Most of the scotch whiskies are marketed as blended scotch whiskies -- almost 97 per cent. It is well established and it is indisputable that blended scotch whisky consists of two or more scotch whiskies each of which is exclusively a scotch whisky and in practice it is a blend of as many as 50 different scotch whiskies. The expression "Blended Scotch Whisky" as known to the trade has been explained by the plaintiffs in the plaint as well as in the affidavit in rejoinder and there can hardly be any reasonable dispute about the trade meaning of the words "Blended Scotch Whisky". "Blended Scotch Whisky" does not mean mixture of part of "Scotch Whisky" with some other drink or some other whisky which by itself cannot be described as Scotch whisky. The defendant however has been contending that the defendant is entitled to use the words "Blended With Scotch" on the label or on the carton as the said words do not and cannot convey misleading impression to

the purchasers that the whisky marketed by the defendants is blended scotch whisky. It is the contentionn of the defendants that even if the defendants mix a small or negligible percentage of scotch whisky as an ingredient along with its Indian whiskies in the blend, the defendant would be justified in describing its product as a "whisky blended with scotch". This submission of the defendants is totally unconvincing and futile. The defendants have not proved it as a fact that the defendants blend scotch whisky with the whisky manufactured by it by the slightest evidence. Even if it is proved as a fact that the defendant mixes part of "scotch whisky" with its Indian whisky, the defendant cannot be permitted to market its product as blended scotch whisky merely by using the word "with" in between as the unwary customer with his average intelligence and imperfect recollection is bound to treat the product as Blended Scotch Whisky i.e. whisky of which each of the blends is exclusively scotch. The customer is not expected to compare the words used with due care and caution and serious risk of confusion and deception is sufficient to prove the tort of passing off subject to other ingredients being proved. In Parker Knoll Limited v. Knoll International Ltd., (1962)  RPC 265, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest observed as under :--  
</p><p id="p_7">  ".....  I think, to the straight forward principle that trading must not only be honest but must not be even unintentionally unfair."  
</p> 

<p id="p_8"> In the same case. Lord Devlin quoted the following passage from the judgment of Buckley L. J. in Brinsmead v. Brinsmead, (1913) 30 RPC 493 at p. 506 with approval, reading as under :--  
</p><p id="p_9">  "He cannot rely on the fact that his statement is literally and accurately true, if, notwithstanding its truth, it carries with it a false representation."  
</p> 

<p id="p_10"> These observations would clearly apply in this case. The Hon'ble Division Bench of High Court of Delhi has restated the relevant principles governing the law of passing off after considerable research and study of modern trends in this branch of law according to English, American, Australian and Canadian cases in the case of <a href="/doc/1097889/" id="a_6">B. K. Engineering Co. v. USHI Enterprises</a>, . Thus even if the defendants were to prove that they were mixing genuine scotch whisky of Scottish origin with their product, the defendants would not be entitled to market their product by describing the same "Blended with Scotch". Moreoever, the label considered as a whole shows fraudulent intention on the part of the defendants to pass off their goods as Scotch whisky and thus damage reputation and goodwill of 'scotch whisky trade'. This is my strong prima facie view at this stage.  
</p> 

<p id="p_11"> 6. As regards marketing of the whisky with the mark "DRUM BEATER" is concerned, the plaintiffs' grievance in the plaint appears to be that the defendant has deliberately adopted a label showing the device of a Scottish Drummar wearing a kilt and the said label also has a tartan band coupled with the false and misleading description of their goods as "Blended with Scotch" with an intention to mislead the customers of imperfect recollection and average intelligence who are bound to treat the product in question as if "Blended Scotch Whisky". The plaintiffs contend that the defendants have thus committed actionable wrong of passing off injuring substantially the reputation and goodwill of genuine scotch and its traders conferring cause of action on each one of the manufacturer, distiller and trader of genuine scotch and the 1st plaintiff Association. The plaintiffs have submitted in the plaint and in the affidavits filed on their behalf that the deliberate intention of the defendant in passing off their whisky as scotch whisky or as if substantially associated with scotch whisky would become clear if one observes the impugned label and considers the manner in which the word "with" is printed on the label in tiny letters so as to be almost completely illegible and compares the same with the word "Scotch" being the word printed in bold letter. It is the contention of the plaintiffs that if an overall view is taken of the impugned labels at Exhibits 'G' and 'H' of the plaint, it shall be clear that the defendant has deliberately attempted to pass off its Indian

whisky as Blended Scotch whisky both by reason of the words used on the label as well as by reason of the device and design adopted thereon, which devices are indicative of the association of the defendants' brand of whisky with Scotland. As regards the use of the devices and designs and the Scottish dress as a part of the label is concerned, the plaintiffs have relied upon an extract from the book "Scottish Highland Games" containing pictures of persons wearing Scottish dress, annexed at Exhibit 'I' to the plaint. On this aspect, the plaintiffs have also sought support from the observations made by the High Court of Delhi in its judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1408319/" id="a_7">Dyer Meakin Breweries Ltd. v. The Scotch Whisky Association, Edinburgh, Scotland</a>, AIR 1980 Delhi 125. The said judgment of the High Court of Delhi is on all fours on the point on which the plaintiff has relied upon the same. The plaintiffs have contended that the impugned label should be viewed as a whole and different parts thereof cannot be viewed in isolation. The plaintiffs have contended that neither the plaintiff No. 1 nor the plaintiff No. 2 need establish user of particular device or mark on a particular brand of scotch whisky and it would be enough if the defendants are misrepresenting their product to be scotch whisky or damaging the goodwill of scotch whisky trade in general. Prima facie, I agree. In my judgment, this is a case of deliberate and intentional passing off. Of course, it is only a strong prima facie view.  
</p> 

<p id="p_12"> 7. As regards the whisky marketed by the defendant with the mark "GOLD TYCOON" is concerned, the plaintiffs have submitted both in the plaint as well as in the supporting affidavits that the defendants are intentionally misrepresenting to the public that this brand of whisky marketed by the defendants is nothing but genuine "Blended Scotch Whisky", which it is not. On the carton (Ex. K), the words printed are "Blended with Six Year Old Vatted Malt SCOTCH". The plaintiffs have also annexed label used by the defendant in respect of whisky marketed under the brand name "GOLD TYCOON" as Exhibit 'J' to the plaint. In this respect, the plaintiffs have submitted in paragraph 13 of the plaint that the label around the neck of the bottle containing the words "Blended with Scotch Whisky" and the word "with" are bound to mislead or in any event bound to confuse as the word "with" is printed in tiny letters so as to be completely illegible. The plaintiffs have made various other submissions in this respect also in paragraph 13 of the plaint, and connected paragraphs of the plaint. The plaintiffs have submitted that in any event, intentional false representation is not the essence of the cause of action for passing off and on any view of the matter the plaintiffs are entitled to the interim injunction sought for as the defendant is passing off its whisky as if it is blended scotch whisky or as if it is substantially blended scotch whisky and the defendant is thus injuring and damaging the goodwill and business reputation of the scotch whisky trade in general and the plaintiffs in particular. I repeatedly requested the learned counsel for the defendants to place relevant date before the Court as to what percentage of scotch, if any, is mixed with Indian whisky and produce some documents or produce some proof in this respect. No answer was forthcoming for lack of instructions and the inference required to be drawn by the Court is, therefore, too obvious. The defendants do not mix up scotch whisky with their product and their representation is thus prima facie fraudulent and misleading. Even if some such blending was proved, it would have made no difference in law. Blended scotch whisky must consist of blend of different whiskies each of which is exclusively scotch and no one is entitled to misrepresent to the trade that their product is Blended Scotch Whisky in the sense in which this word is understood in trade when in fact it is not Scotch Whisky or Blended Scotch Whisky as stated above. The observations made by me in para 7 of the judgment are applicable mutatis mutandis to "Gold Tycoon" also.  
</p> 

<p id="p_13"> 8. This notice of motion was taken out by the plaintiffs on 24th April, 1987 for the interim reliefs in terms of the pemanent reliefs sought for. The suit was filed by the plaintiffs on 8th April, 1987. The plaintiffs served their Advocate's notices dated 30th September, 1986 and 1st October, 1986 on the defendant, copies whereof are annexed at Exhibits 'L'

and 'M' to the plaint. It is amazing that the defendants did not think it fit to reply to these important letters. During the pendency of this notice of motion, by their Advocate's letter dated 11th December, 1987, the plaintiffs called upon the defendant to give details as to from whom the defendant had purchased scotch whisky which is allegedly mixed with its own Indian whisky. No reply was sent by the defendants or their Advocates to this letter also. No particulars are given to the Court about the alleged mixing of scotch whisky with other ingredients of the whisky marketed by the defendants under the brand names of DRUM BEATER or GOLD TYCOON. The plaintiffs have rightly commented on evasive attitude on the part of the defendants. Prima facie, the plaintiffs are right and I must draw adverse inference against the defendants for their non-disclosure of relevant data and non-reply of important letters.  
</p> 

<p id="p_14"> 8A. It is unfortunate that this notice of motion remained pending for all these years lor no fault of either side. At one stage, this notice of motion was fully heard by one leaned Judge of this Court and the judgment was reserved. The judgment, however, could not be delivered by the learned Judge in the situation which need not be referred to in this order. The notice of motion has been reheard after lapse of some time when it was originally heard. This is enough explanation for judicial delay in disposal of this notice of motion.  
</p> 

<p id="p_15"> 9. Soon after the commencement of the hearing of this notice of motion, the learned counsel for the defendants made a with prejudice offer in writing, which reads as under :--  
</p>  

<p id="p_16"> "1. On the labels and cartons of the defendant's in respect of their 'Drum Beater' whisky, the Defendants shall : 
</p> 

<p id="p_17"> (a) write the words "Blended with Scotch" in such manner that all the 3 words shall have the same prominence; and  
 

</p><p id="p_18"> (b) the lettering in respect of the said 3 words shall be of the same size."  
</p> 

<p id="p_19"> This offer is not acceptable to the plaintiffs.  
</p> 

<p id="p_20"> 10. The learned counsel for the defendants made a similar with prejudice offer in writing in respect of their whisky marketed in the name of "GOLD TYCOON". The said offer is as under:--  
</p>  

<p id="p_21"> "1. The words 'Blended With Scotch' will be written with the same prominence and in lettering of the same size. 
</p> 

<p id="p_22"> 2. The size of the lettering in the marks 'Produce of India' will be increased, to have the same prominence and size as the words 'Blended with Scotch.'"  
</p> 

<p id="p_23"> This offer is also not acceptable to the plaintiffs.  
</p> 

<p id="p_24"> 11. Mr. Ashok Bhausaheb Mhaske, the Assistant Legal Officer of the defendants, filed an affidavit in reply to this notice of motion. I have read and reheard the said affidavit in reply. It appears to me that the said affidavit in reply is vague and contains denials, some of which can be easily described as 'denials for sake of denials'. In my view, the said affidavit does not and cannot inspire any confidence in the mind of the Court and no probative value can be attached to the averments made therein for the reasons indicated hereinafter. In paragraph 7 of the said affidavit, it is averred as under :--  
</p><p id="p_25">  "I deny that the whisky as an alcoholic beverage originated in Scotland and many years ago whisky distilled and manufactured in Scotland came to be described as Scotch Whisky as alleged. I deny that the whisky which is distilled and manufactured in Scotland has come to be known by the traders and members of the public all over the world including India as 'Scotch Whisky'." 
</p> 

<p id="p_26"> This denial on the part of the defendant is futile as the geographical origin of 'Scotch Whisky" as restricted to whisky emanating from Scotland is universally accepted by this time in judicial decisions of this Court as well as English Courts and even the British legislations have defined Scotch Whisky as whisky which has been distilled and matured in Scotland. I have carefully gone through the judgment of Brother Pendse, J. already referred to in the earlier part of this judgment. I respectfully agree with the view taken in the

said judgment. It is, therefore, too late in the day for the defendant to contend that scotch whisky is not what is distilled and manufactured in Scotland alone. It is further averred in paragraph 7 of the said affidavit in reply as under :--  
</p><p id="p_27">  "I deny that the distillers or blenders or Iraders in Scotch Whisky alone are entitled to describe their whisky as Scotch whisky or use such labels, device, marks, card case etc. so as to suggest that whisky to which it is applied is Scotch Whisky as alleged." 
</p> 

<p id="p_28"> The defence plea appears to be that the expression "Scotch Whisky" can be used by anyone and everyone and this description cannot be treated as a monopoly of the distillers or blenders or traders who distill the blend or trade in the scotch whisky i.e. whisky originated in Scotland. On this aspect also, the findings recorded by Pendse, J. in the above-referred judgment are a complete answer.  
</p> 

<p id="p_29"> 12. As regards the use of the Scottish figures or the Scottish emblems or devices or pictures on the label are concerned, it was submitted by the learned counsel for the defendants that there is no evidence before the Court to prove that the device adopted creates an impression that the picture put up on the label is of a Scottish gentleman with a Scottish dress or that the device or design used thereon corroborates the representation of whisky being Scottish whisky. It was submitted that the picture on the label could be of an Indian gentleman wearing lungie residing at Mohamedali Road, Bombay, and the use of the impugned design/device on the label cannot be construed as misrepresentation of whisky being Scottish in its origin. It is of considerable significance that no such plea is to be found in the affidavit in reply. On the contrary, what is stated in paragraph 7 of the said affidavit in reply is as under:--  
</p><p id="p_30">  "I deny that the device showing well known Scottish figures or Scottish soldiers or Scottish Headgears or Scottish Emblems like bag, bagpipes or tartans or any description so as to suggest that whisky emanates from Scotland when in fact it does not mislead or is likely to mislead the members of the public into believing that what they are buying is a Scotch whisky as alleged. ..." 
</p> 

<p id="p_31"> In other words, the defence plea in this paragraph of the affidavit in reply is that use of the device showing well known Scottish figures or Scottish emblems is not likely to mislead the members of the public into believing that they are buying scotch whisky. It is not stated in the affidavit that the impugned device or the impugned design on the label has nothing whatsoever to do with Scotland and incapable of misrepresenting the product as being of Scottish origin or that the impugned design or device depicts that the whisky in question is Indian. It is impossible for the Court to permit manufacturers of wine in India to market their goods as if they are producing and selling "Indian Scotch" as "Scotch Whisky" means whisky exclusively manufactured or distilled in Scotland.  
</p> 

<p id="p_32"> 13. It is contened in paragraph 10 of the said affidavit in reply that persons consuming whisky are choosy individuals and they carefully distinguish between Indian whisky and imported whisky. If the label or the carton used by the defendant is likely to mislead or confuse unwary purchasers of imperfect recollection on first blush, it is no answer to say that some of the persons who consume scotch whisky are from a particular class of society, say the affluent class of society. Pendse, J. in his judgment referred to hereinabove, has clearly stated that people from all strata of soiety consume whisky including scotch whisky and the plaintiffs are entitled to protect the reputation of trade of scotch whisky and obtain appropriate order of injunction against the defendants who attempt to injure such reputation or goodwill by passing off their goods as scotch whisky. In paragraph 11 of the said affidavit in reply it is contended that the defendant is blending their whisky with scotch whisky and the defendant therefore is entitled to describe its whisky as "Blended With Scotch". No particulars whatsoever are given of the alleged quantum of blending. It is not proved that defendants have purchased 'Scotch' or blended the same with their product. In any event, even if such

particulars would have been given perhaps the same would have been irrelevant having regard to the universally acknowledged trade meaning acquired by the words "Blended Scotch Whisky". The use of the word "with" would make no difference to the result of this notice of motion. The law of passing off is described by some of the jurists as a law designed to prevent unfair dishonest trading and appropriation of someone else's goodwill.  
</p> 

<p id="p_33"> 14. Before I deal with the rival contentions of the learned counsel for the parties, I must mention one more fact, though it does not appear to me to be much relevant for the disposal of this notice of motion. It has been stated in the affidavit in reply that the defendants have made applications for registration of trade marks "Drum Beater" and "Gold Tycoon" and the same are pending.  
</p> 

<p id="p_34"> 15. Mr. I. M. Chagla, the learned counsel for the defendant, has relied on the following judgments of the Hon'bie Supreme Court :-- 
</p> 

<p id="p_35"> (1) <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_8">Corn Products v. Shangrila Food Products</a>, ; (2) Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, ; (3) <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_9">Durga Dutt Sharma v. N. P. Laboratories</a>, ; (4) <a href="/doc/280042/" id="a_10">Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Ambal &amp; Co</a>, ; and (5) Raston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engg. Co., .  
</p> 

<p id="p_36"> Mr. Chagla has also relied on the judgment of the High Court of Delhi in the case of M/s. Johnson and Johnson v. Christine Hoden India (P) Ltd., AIR 1988 Delhi 249 Mr. Chagla distinguished the judgment of Pendse, J. dated 17th/18th/19th Nov., 1986 in Suit No. 1352 of 1986 and submitted that the said judgment was not on all fours on all the points arising in this case. Mr. Chagla also cited several passages from Chapter XVI of Kerly on Trade Marks at pages 344, 401, 404, 405, 406, 409 and 453 and heavily relied on passages from judgments of House of Lords in the case of Erven Warnik B. V. v. J. Towned and Sons (Hull) Ltd., 1979 WLR 68 and other English cases cited therein. Mr. Chaglu also relied on Division Bench judgment of oar High Court in Appeal No. 1024 of 1987 on the question of delay. 
</p> 

<p id="p_37"> 16. Mr. J. I. Mehta and Mr. Virendra Tulzapurkar heavily relied on the law of passing off as expanded from time to time as enunciated by the English Courts in three of the leading wine cases i.e. (1) <a href="/doc/1390540/" id="a_11">Bollinger J. v. Costa Brava Wine Co. Ltd</a>., (1960) RPC 16, (2) Vine Products Ltd. v. Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., (1969) RPC 1, and (3) John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Henry Cst &amp; Company Ltd., (1970) RPC 489, which were all approved by the House of Lords in the case of Erven Warnik B. V. v. J. Towned &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd. (supra) (also reported in (1980) RPC 31 at pages 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95). Mr. J. I. Mehta relied in particular on passages from judgment of Lord Diplock and submitted that the theory of added material as an escape route in passing off action was irrelevant when the cause of action pleaded was 'not passing off in its classic form but it its expanded form. Mr. Mehta submitted that in any event, the added material relied on by the defendant in this case was of no significance and it did not distinguish the defendants' goods from those of the plaintiffs or it could not exonerate the defendant from attempting to appropriate and damage the business reputation and goodwill of scotch or wipe out the glaring misrepresentation.  
</p> 

<p id="p_38"> 17. Mr. Chagla, the learned Counsel for the defendants, asserted that plaintiff No. 2 had not pleaded that it had established reputation in use of device or design as used by the defendant on "Drum Beater". Mr. Mehta submitted that it was not essential for the plaintiffs to aver or prove established user of particular Scottish device or design on the goods marketed by the plaintiff No. 2 and it was enough if the plaintiffs proved that the impugned label put by the defendants on their goods taken as a whole was misleading, deceptive or confusing and likely to injure the goodwill and the reputation of "Scotch Whisky trade". Mr. Virendra Tulzapurkar supplemented the submissions of Mr. Mehta with leave of the Court. Mr. Tulzapurkar cited the cases of <a href="/doc/1408319/" id="a_12">Dyer Meakin Breweries Ltd. v. Scotch Whisky Association</a>, AIR 1980 Delhi 125 and also the judgment of High  

Court of Delhi in the case of <a href="/doc/315836/" id="a_13">M/s. Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. India Stationery Products Co</a>.,  and several other reported and unreported judgments. It is also of some significance to refer to the case of Parker Knoll Ltd. v. Knoll International Ltd., reported in (1962) RPC 265, and one or two other cases referred to in later part of this judgment.  
</p> 

<p id="p_39"> 18. It is necessary to make a brief reference to the well-settled propositions of law governing actions for passing off in its extended form. In paragraph 16.02 of Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 12th Edition, "Passing off" is defined as "an actionable wrong for the defendant to represent, for trading purposes, that his goods are those or that his business is that of the plaintiffs..." Thus the essence of the cause of action for passing off in its classic form consists of misrepresentation by the defendant in respect of goods marketed by the defendant by colourable imitation and by using labels or badges resembling those of others in such manner as to be calculated to cause the goods to be taken by ordinary purchasers for the goods of the plaintiffs. "The law on this matter is designed to protect traders against that form of unfair competition which consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival traders". Salmond and Heuston "The Law of Torts", 19th Edition, page 450, explains the law on the subject in the terms aforesaid. Winfield and Jolowics have in their latest book on "Tort" (13th Edition) clearly explained, at page 537, the extended concept of Tort of passing off, in the following words :  
</p><p id="p_40">  "Although the classic form of the tort is one trader representing his goods as those of someone else, the basis of the liability is wider; it is the injury to the plaintiff's business goodwill 'the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business... the attractive force which brings in custom."  
</p> 

<p id="p_41"> 19. In the case of <a href="/doc/1390540/" id="a_14">Bollinger, J. v. Costa Brava Wine Co. Ltd</a>., (1961) RPC 116, Danckwerts, J. observed as under :--  
</p>  

<p id="p_42"> "There seems to be no reason why such licence should be given to a person, competing in trade, who seeks to attach to his product a name or description with which it has no natural association, so as to make use of the reputation and goodwill which has been gained by a product genuinely indicated by the name or description."  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_43"> In this case, the 12 plaintiffs who were producers of wine in the Champagne district of France objected to the use by the defendants of the name "Spanish Champagne" for wine produced in Spain. It was admitted in this case on behalf of the plaintiffs that the action was not a passing off action in the sense that there was no allegation that the defendants' product was passed off as one produced by any of the plaintiffs individually. The Court, however, held that the concept for passing off was not a restricted one and that the plaintiffs had a cause of action to obtain relief to prevent unlawful competition where the goodwill and trade reputation of the persons dealing in a particular product genuinely indicated by a trade description was damaged by the defendants by attaching to their product a name or description with which it had no natural association.  
</p> 

<p id="p_44"> 20. The extended meaning and content of tort of passing off was explained by the House of Lords in its judgment in the case of Erven Warnik B. V. v. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd. (1980) RPC 31. In this case, the House of Lords approved the statement of law laid down by the English Courts in the case of <a href="/doc/1390540/" id="a_15">Bollinger J. v. Costa Brava Wine Co. Ltd</a>. (supra) as well as in the later cases, and clearly explained at page 91 of its judgment that the action in passing off would be maintainable where the plaintiff could prove injury to its business or goodwill which could take a variety of forms even though the defendant was not passing off its goods as the goods of the plaintiff. It is possible that the defendant partly states the truth in its label or in the description and partly mixes it up with description and devices which are misleading or which are likely to confuse unwary purchaser of the product. In such a case, the

defendant cannot escape the liability for its misrepresentation or actionable wrong of passing off i.e. causing injury to the business reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs merely because while describing its product, the defendant partly states the truth and then mixes up the same with colourable device, marks, words or description with which the product has no natural association. This aspect of the law has been well explained in some of the Indian decisions. I have already referred to the judgment of Brother Justice Pendse on this subject, where Pendse, J. appears to have fully agreed with the statement of law laid down by the House of Lords in the above-referred case of Erven Warnik B. V. (supra). In the cae of Ellora Industries v. Banarasi Dass, . Avadh Behari Rohatgi J. has neatly summarised the modern trends in respect of the law of passing off including the various varieties of passing off and its extended concept. In this case, the plaintiffs were carrying on business in the name and style of M/s. Banarasi Das &amp; Brothers at Delhi by selling clocks with the trade mark "Flora" since 1955. Some years later, the defendants started a concern under the name of Ellora Industries. The defendants were marketing the same goods in their own name "Ellora Industries". The plaintiffs protested both on the ground of infringement of trade mark as well as on the ground of passing off. The plaintiffs averred that the defendants were attempting to deceive or confuse the customers by representing to the customers that the goods marketed by the defendants had their intimate connection with that of the plaintiffs. The learned District Judge granted relief to the plaintiffs in so far as the cause of action was based on infringement of trade mark, but denied relief in so far as the claim was based on passing off. In appeal, the High Court of Delhi traced the history of the law of passing off. In paragraph 12 of his judgment, the learned Judge stated that the purpose of this branch of law was to protect commercial goodwill and to ensure that people's business reputation are not exploited. After referring to the various definitions from standard works on the Law of Torts, the learned Judge referred to the recent extensions of passing off and the expanding development of the subject. After referring to English, American and Australian judgments, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that confusing customers as to source, as in that case, was an invasion of another's property rights. The learned Judge observed that this part of the law was developed to prevent dishonest trading and approved the dictim of law laid down by the Australian Court in Handerson's case to the effect that "the wrongful appropriation of another's professional or business reputation was an injury in itself. After referring to the "Spanish Champagne" case (popularly known as Bollinger's case) (supra), "Sherry" case i.e. <a href="/doc/103561/" id="a_16">Vine Products Ltd. v. Mc Kenzie &amp; Co. Ltd</a>., (1969) RPC Land "Scotch Whisky" case i.e. John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Herry Cst &amp; Co. Ltd., (1970) RPC 489, the learned Jedge came to the conclusion that it was no defence for the defendant to say that the defendant was using its own trade name while marketing its goods. In paragaph 35 of his judgment, the learned Judge observed that the purchasers were likely to be misled into thinking that the defendant's firm had an intimate connection with the plaintiffs and even misrepresentation of some connection with the plaintiffs was sufficient to constitute the tort of unfair trading now forming part of the law of passing off. I shall now refer to facts of the abovereferred case decided by the House of Lords in Erven Warnik B. V. v. J. Townend and Sons (Hull) Ltd. reported in (1970) RPC 31 as it is of considerable importance for decidin this case. It is also known as 'Advocaate case'.  
</p> 

<p id="p_45"> 21. In that case, the plaintiffs had been selling a drink called 'Advocaat' in the U. K. since 1911. All Advocaat sold in the U. K. was made in Holland and consisted of eggs, spirit, sugar, but no wine. The name 'Advocaat' was known as that of a drink with recognisable qualities, appearance, taste, strength and satisfaction. In 1974, the defendants started manufacturing 'Old English Advocaat' made out of eggs and a fortified Cyprus wine which proved to be a commercial success. The defendants did not represent their goods as goods of plaintiffs. It was held by the House of Lords that the action was maintainable not

in its classic form of a trader representing his own goods as the goods of somebody else, but in an extended form first recognised and applied by Danckwarts J. in the Champagne Case (Bollinger v. Costa Brava Wine Co.) (supra). Lord Diplock observed in the above-referred leading judgment of House of Lords In 'Advocate Case' that this principle was accepted as correct by cross in the Sherry case <a href="/doc/103561/" id="a_17">Vine Products Ltd. v. Mc Kanzie &amp; Co. Ltd</a>., (supra) and by Foster J. in the Scotch Whisky case (John Walkar and Sons Ltd. v. Henry Ost &amp; Co. Ltd. (supra). At page 91 of his judgment, Lord Diplock observed that unfair trading as a wrong actionable at the suit of other traders who thereby suffer loss of business or goodwill may take a variety of forms. At page 93 of the abovereferred judgment, Lord Diplock approved the statement of law laid down in Spalding v. Gamage, wherein it was laid down that a false suggestion by the defendants that their business were connected with one another would damage the reputation and thus goodwill of the plaintiff's business. The House of Lords granted the injunction in favour of the plaintiff. The ratio of this judgment is helpful more to the plaintiffs in this case than to the defendant. The ratio of this judgment is applied in Indian decisions as laying down correct law.  
</p> 

<p id="p_46"> 22. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Volume 48, para 144 at page 98, the essentials of the cause of action for passing off, as restated by the House of Lords in <a href="/doc/168910244/" id="a_18">Erven Warnink B. V. v. J. Townend &amp; Sons</a> (supra), are set out as follows:-- 
</p>  

<p id="p_47"> "1) a misrepresentation  
 

</p><p id="p_48"> 2) made by a trader in the course of trade  
 

</p><p id="p_49"> 3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him  
 

</p><p id="p_50"> 4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader, in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence, and  
 

</p><p id="p_51"> 5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or, in a quia timet action, will probaly do so."  
</p> 

<p id="p_52"> In the abovereferred judgment in Brven Warnink's case, Lord Diplock observed that the plaintiff was requird to prove each of the abovementioned five ingredients in an action for passing off. Lord Fraser has also formulated five ingredients of the action for passing off which are required to be proved by the plaintiff in the abovereferred judgment of the House of Lords at page 105. The said five ingredients formulated by Lord Fraser read as under:--  
</p>  

<p id="p_53"> "1. That his business consists of, or includes, selling in England a class of goods to which the particular trade name applies;  
</p> 

<p id="p_54"> 2. That the class of goods is clearly defined, and that in the minds of the public, or a section of the public, in England, the trade name distinguishes that class from other similar goods;  
</p> 

<p id="p_55"> 3. That because of the reputation of the goods, there is goodwill attached to the name;  
</p> 

<p id="p_56"> 4. That he, the plaintiff, as a member of the class of those who sell the goods, is the owner of goodwill in England which is of substantial value;  
</p> 

<p id="p_57"> 5. That he has suffered, or is really likely to suffer, substantial damage to his property in the goodwill by reason of the defendants selling goods which are falsely described by the trade name to which the goodwill is attached."  
</p> 

<p id="p_58"> 23. The learned Counsel for the defendant has submitted that the plaintiffs have failed to establish its goodwill in the impugned mark or device complained of. It has been submitted that the plaintiffs have failed to establish any of the five ingredients required to be established in connection with an action of passing off. It has been contended that the plaintiffs have no exclusive right to use a device evocative of Scotland and the plaintiffs have therefore no cause of action to complain in respect of user of the device or design of the Scottish gentleman on the label or on the carton in respect of the whisky marketed under the name Drum Beater. It has been

contended that there is no evidence before this Court to show that the public would associate any such device with Scotland or would be misled into believing that the goods in relation to which the design was used emanated from Scotland. It has contended that in any event, in an action for passing off, no relief can be granted to the plaintiff even at the stage of final hearing if it is proved that the added matter on the label or the carton of the goods marketed by the defendant is sufficient and adequate enough to distinguish the goods in question from those of the plaintiffs. On this aspect, the learned counsel for the defendant emphatically relied upon the statement of law laid down in paragraph 28 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_19">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. N. P. Laboratories</a>, . It has been submitted that the criteria to be applied by the Court is as to whether the unwary purchasers are likely to be deceived or confused by the label or the mark used and treat the product as if scotch whisky or as if blended scotch whisky or as if associated with scotch whisky. On this aspect of the matter, it has been emphasised on behalf of the defendant that in the instant case no confusion or deception is likely to be caused having regard to all the surrounding circumstances of the case including the class of customers who consume scotch whisky and the practice followed in the 5-Star Hotels by denoting separate rates on their cards for Indian whiskies and scotch whiskies etc. It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the defendant that the judgment of Pendse, J. referred to by me in the earlier part of this judgment dealt with a situation where the defendant was using the mark "Royal Scot" and in fact the Court was not required to consider the effect of the words "Blended with Scotch" or the mark, device or design on the label or carton alleging to indicate that the goods must have emanated from Scotland.  
</p> 

<p id="p_59"> 24. It has been contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that defendants are doing no wrong by describing their whisky as blended with scotch as in fact the defendants are blending their whisky with scotch whisky. The defendants have also emphasised that the plaintiffs will be amply protected by the "with prejudice" offer which has been made on behalf of the defendants to which I have already made a reference in the earlier part of this judgment. It has been contended on behalf of the defendants that the matter is being heard at an interlocutory stage and at this stage no interim relief should be granted to the plaintiffs as the defendants will suffer irreparable loss and serious inconvenience including loss of business if relief is to be granted as sought. It has been emphasised on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiffs have themselves admitted in the affidavit in rejoinder that the plaintiffs have no objection to the use of the mark "Drum Beater" and "Gold Tycoon" per se. It is submitted that the plaintiffs have at the most right to prevent the use of the words "Scotch Whisky" on the whisky marketed by others but it does not follow therefrom that the plaintiffs can seek an injunction to restrain the defendants from using a device or design indicating that the goods emanate from Scotland particularly when the plaintiff No. 2 does not use such design or device and plaintiff No. 1 does not carry on any business in India. It has also been submitted on behalf of the defendants that no interim relief should be granted to the plaintiffs as the plaintiffs have approached this Court rather late. It has been submitted that balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendants and not in favour of the plaintiffs.  
</p> 

<p id="p_60"> 25. It has been contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that ex facie the defendants have misrepresented to the members of the public that their goods are "Blended Scotch Whisky", or are closely associated with scotch whisky and there should be no doubt in the mind of the Court even at the prima facie stage that the defendants have passed off and are attempting to pass of their goods in a manner which injures the business reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff No. 1 and its members, scotch whisky trade in general and the trade of plaintiff No. 2 in particular. It has been submitted that the defendants have deliberately indulged in actionable wrong to the serious prejudice of the plaintiffs and the said wrong is a continuous wrong. It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that the

plaintiffs have proved every single ingredient required to be proved for a cause of action for passing off in its extended form. It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs, relying on various judgments of the Supreme Court as well as English judgments, that the added material on the labels used by the defendant in this case is of no significance and the same is totally inadequate to distinguish the defendants' goods from those of the plaintiffs. It has been contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that in a passing off action, the Court is not required to compare one word with another word, part of the device with another part of the device, but an overall view is required to be taken of the entire label or carton as a whole and the Court has to address itself to the question as to whether on taking such an overall view of the matter, the plea of misrepresentation leading to passing off or actionable wrong injuring business and goodwill or reputation of the plaintiffs is proved or not. It has been contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that it is not necessary for plaintiff No. 2 to prove that plaintiff No. 2 is itself using similar device or design on the label or carton of the whisky marketed by it. It has been contended that the delay, if any, in filing of this action has been adequately explained in the affidavit in rejoinder. It has been contended that in any event the decided cases have taken the view that in a matter of this nature if the plaintiffs make out a strong prima facie case, the delay, if any, by itself is of no consequence. It has been contended that the balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiffs and not in favour of the defendant, as the conduct of the defendant is vulnerable. It has been contended that if the Court is convinced that the plaintiffs have made out a strong prima facie case of tort of passing off havig been committed by the defendants intentionally or unintentionally the Court should not hesitate to grant interim relief as sought for.  
</p> 

<p id="p_61"> 26. <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_20">In Corn Products v. Shangrila Food Products</a>, , it has held that the test to be applied in such matters was as to whether a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection would be confused. It was held by the Apex Court in this case that to such a man, the overall structural and
phonetic similarity and the similarity of the
idea in the two marks "Gluvita" and "Gluco-
</p><p id="p_62">vita" was reasonably likely to cause a confu
sion. It was held that apart from the syllable
'co' in the appellant's mark, the two marks
were identical and the said difference was not
enough to distinguish the one mark from the
other. 
</p> 

<p id="p_63"> 27. In Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo, , a similar test was laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for the purpose of considering as to whether the purchasers were likely to be deceived or confused. In this case the question before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was whether the names "Amritdhara" and "Lakshmandhara" were likely to deceive or cause confusion. It was observed that what degree of resemblance was necessary to deceive or cause confusion could not be defined and the questions to be asked by the Court to itself were as to whether the customers were likely to be confused on the first impression, the customers being persons of average intelligence and imperfect recollection.  
</p> 

<p id="p_64"> 28. On the question of added material, somewhat similar arguments were advanced before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in <a href="/doc/1408319/" id="a_21">Dyer Meakin Breweries v. Scotch Whisky Association</a>, AIR 19SO Delhi 125. In that case, the Scotch Whisky Association, the 1st plaintiff herein, had opposed registration of the trade mark "Highland Chief" used by Dyer Meakin Breweries produced by it in India, the product having been described as "Malted Whisky" along with the device of the head and shoulders of a bonnet and plaid and the tartan edging. As regards printing of the words "Produce of India" and other added material, the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi had observed, in paragraph 15 of its judgment, that what mattered most was the first impression. It was observed by the Court that what mattered was the matter of impression from the eye-catching words. It was held by the Court as under :--  
</p><p id="p_65">  "It is difficult to hold that the words "Produce of India' and the other words just noted constitute worthy safeguard, remembering

its situation and the type of purchaser which alone are relevant when questions like these were considered." 
</p> 

<p id="p_66"> In our case also, the added material is of no significance when compared to the effect of imposing words, marks and design on each of the two labels/cartons which are found objectionable and injurious.  
</p> 

<p id="p_67"> 29. In my judgment, the plaintiffs have prima facie proved each of the ingredients of passing off as formulated by Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser referred to in paragraph 22 of this judgment. It is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the plaintiff No. 2 must establish user of some device or design or mark on its goods as are used by the defendant on Drum Beater and Cold Tycoon. It is enough to prove that the defendants are representing to the members of public by one device or another (taken as a whole) that their product has natural association with Scotch Whisky which representation is false and which representation is bound to affect or injure the business goodwill or reputation of scotch whisky trade and of the plaintiffs.  
</p> 

<p id="p_68"> 30. After having referred to most of the citations and the detailed arguments of the learned counsel on both sides, I must state that basically the questions which arise for consideration of the Court are questions of fact. After having given my careful consideration to the facts of this case and after applying the well-settled principles of law, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have made out a strong prima facie case that the defendants are passing off their goods as Blended Scotch Whisky or goods closely and substantially associated with Blended Scotch Whisky when in fact they are not. The plaintiffs have, therefore, made out a case for grant of an interim injunction on merits of the case.  
</p> 

<p id="p_69"> 31. I have given anxious consideration to the plea of the defendants regarding delay in institution of this suit. I am not convinced that interim relief can be denied to the plaintiffs merely because of alleged delay when as strong prima facie case is made out on merits. The wrong is a continuing wrong. The delay is explained in the affidavit in rejoinder. I accept the explanation for the delay. Moreover, I have found as a fact, although prima facie, that the defendants are deliberately and intentionally passing off their product as if "Blended Scotch" although as a matter of law, even unintentional misrepresentation is also actionable. It is unfortunate that the defendants have resorted to unfair device of using the words "Blended with Scotch" and indulged in colourable imitation and unfair trading in an attempt to reap harvest by appropriation of the plaintiffs' goodwill in Scotch Whisky trade. The attempt of the defendants to justify the use of the words "Blended With Scotch" has totally failed. The balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiffs and not in favour of the defendants.  
</p> 

<p id="p_70"> 32. I have heard the learned counsel for both sides for several days and I have been well assisted by them, I am thankful to the learned counsel on both sides. If I deny interim relief to the plaintiffs in this case, it would mean that the Court is permitting the defendants to continue the wrong. It is impossible for the Court to do so.  
</p> 

<p id="p_71"> 33. Having regard to my prima facie findings and other conclusions, I make the motion absolute in terms of prayers (a) and (b). The defendants shall pay a sum of Rs. 5,000/- as costs of the motion to the plaintiffs. In all probability, the amount of cost awarded is nowhere nearer to the costs incurred by the party. But that cannot be helped. 
</p> 

<p id="p_72"> 34. Prayers (a) and (b) of the notice of motion read as under :-- 
</p>  

<p id="p_73"> "(a) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit, the defendant by itself, its servants and agents be restrained by an order and Injunction of this Hon'ble Court from advertising or offering for sale or selling or distributing in any country whisky which is not Scotch Whisky bearing the impugned label (being Exhibit 'C') or the impugned carton (being Exhibit 'H') to the plaint; bearing the mark "Drum Beater" or the word "Scotch" or the device of a Scottish Drummer

wearing a kilt or the tartan band or the words ''Blended with Scotch" or any other mark, label, carton, device, description, suggesting scottish origin so as to pass off or enable others to pass off its whisky as Scotch Whisky;  
</p> 

<p id="p_74"> (b) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit, the defendant by itself, its servants and agents or otherwise, however, be restrained by an Order and Injunction of this Hon'ble Court from advertising or offering for sale or distributing in any country whisky which is not Scotch Whisky with the description "Blended with Scotch Whisky" or "Blended Scotch Whisky" or "Blended with six year Old Scotch" or "Blended with six year Old Vatted Malt Scotch" or the word "Scotch" or the impugned lables (being Exhibit 'J' to the plaint) or the impugned parton (being Exhibit 'K' to the plaint) which bear the mark "Gold Tycoon" containing the word "Scotch" or the description "Blended Scotch Whisky" or "Blended with  Scotch Whisky" or "Blended with six year Old Scotch" or "Blended with six year Old Vatted Malt Scotch" in respect of the defendant's Whisky manufactured by the defendant in India, so as to pass off or enable others to pass off the defendant's whisky as "Scotch Whisky";  
</p>
 

<p id="p_75"> It is hereby clarified that the injunction granted will not prevent the defendants from using "Drum Beater" or "Gold Tycoon" per se if they are otherwise entitled to use the same.  
</p> 

<p id="p_76"> 35. On the application of the learned counsel for the defendants, operation of this order shall remain stayed for a period of six weeks from today.  
</p> 

<p id="p_77"> 36. The Prothonotary and Senior Master
shall issue certified copy of this Order
expeditiously.
