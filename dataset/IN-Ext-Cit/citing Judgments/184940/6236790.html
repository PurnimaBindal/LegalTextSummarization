rights of all over the world, has devolved upon the plaintiff Nos.7 to 10
under the operation of law. They have executed an extra judicial settlement

Master amongst themselves. The plaintiffs have thereafter assigned
trademarks originally owned/applied for by the Master to plaintiff No.1 vide
a Transfer and Assignment Deed dated 18th September, 2007.
</p><p id="p_8">3.     In order to strengthen their case, it is alleged by the plaintiffs that
Yoga Vidya Pranic Healing Foundation Trust, Cochin, defendant No.12



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 4 of 149</span>
 herein, filed a suit bearing Original suit OS No.1207/2010 against Dr. Joy
Joseph and Yoga Vidya Pranic Healing Foundation Trust, Cochin, Kerala
(which is affiliated to plaintiff No.5 herein) in the Court of the Principal
Munsif, Ernakulam.     In the above mentioned suit, the defendant No.12
herein being the plaintiff made statement about the ownership of the mark
and copyright in favour of the present plaintiffs.   The Principal Munsif,
Ernakulam though refused to grant injunction however, concludes that
plaintiff No.3 is the supreme authority to conduct courses to teach Pranic
Healing. The plaintiff thus claims the intellectual property rights in the
Pranic Healing Techniques/ Modern Pranic Healing Techniques.
CASE SET UP AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS BY PLAINTIFFS
</p><p id="p_9">4.     The case set up by the plaintiffs against the defendants is that the
defendant Nos.1 and 2 through the various State Foundations affiliated to
them i.e. defendants No.3 to 14 are conducting courses, issuing certificates
and selling material (books, audio, video) without due authority from the
plaintiffs, in violation of licensing agreements and deeds of assignment
which have been terminated and which have expired by efflux of time
respectively. The defendant No.3 Pranic Healing Foundation of Delhi, has
regularly been conducting Master's courses in an unauthorized manner in
New Delhi. None of the defendants have the authority to conduct these
courses/workshops and both the terms Kriyashakti and Pranic Feng Shui are
registered trademarks in the name of the Master which were assigned to
plaintiff No.1.
</p><p id="p_10">       The defendants are authorizing Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga
instructors, who are not properly qualified and do not follow the guidelines
originally issued by the Master and followed by the plaintiffs, and are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                      Page 5 of 149</span>
 conducting training without proper licenses from the global bodies
established by the Master. The defendant No.2 has not removed the words
"affiliated to World Pranic Healing Foundation, Manila, Philippines" from
its certificates who alongwith other defendants continue to advertise on their
website regarding several courses being conducted by them based on the
teachings and methods devised by the Master without holding a valid license
issued by the plaintiffs. They are also publishing and distributing books,
CDs and certificates relating to Pranic Healing and selling the same in the
similar and identical manner to the material published by the plaintiffs. The
said activities of the defendants is causing innocent persons to believe as
genuine material authorized by the plaintiff institutions. Further, the courses
conducted by the defendants do not adhere to the quality and standards
prescribed by the Master, and are not conducted by persons authorized to
conduct the same. The material such as books, CDs etc. produced is sub-
standard and detrimental to public interest as well as the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiffs and deceased Master.
</p><p id="p_11">5.     It is alleged as the plaintiffs left with no option, the plaintiffs
compelled to file the suit against the defendants for violation of their legal
rights. The abovementioned suit alongwith interim application under Order
39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC were listed before Court on 14th September, 2011
when the summons and notice were issued to the defendants. The interim
order was also passed on that date. The operative portion of the interim
order reads as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "Accordingly, till the next date of hearing, defendants No.1 and 2 are

        agents, assigns, affiliates, subsidiaries, servants, or any person or body
       claiming directly or indirectly through defendant Nos.1 and 2 and all
       the foundations, institutions, trust, companies and other bodies
       functioning under the authority of defendant Nos.1 and 2 are
       restrained from organizing and continuing to organize workshops,
       training programmes, seminars and teachings of the Master's courses,
       techniques, distributing of CDs/DVDs, books, recording of the
       Master's courses and all other items loaned to defendant No.1 under
       the licensing agreements executed including instructor's manuals,
       unused certificates of participation and other documents relating to
       the licensed activities. It is made clear that in case any course or
       workshop is in progress, with a view to avoid any inconvenience
       to the person enrolled for the course, the same shall not be
       disturbed till the end of the course. Plaintiff shall comply with the
       provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC within seven days from
       today. DASTI." (Emphasis added)

Some of defendants have also filed the reply to interim application as well as
application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC for vacation of interim order by
raising the various defences. The defendants also filed applications under
Order 39 Rules 3 &amp; 4 CPC for vacation of interim order for non-compliance
of the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC and rejection of plaint for want of
valid cause of action and territorial jurisdiction of this Court. By order dated
22nd December, 2011 it was observed by this court that the objection of non-
compliance of Order 39 Rules 3 &amp; 4 CPC would be considered on the next

have also filed applications for rejection/return of plaint under the provisions
of Order 7 Rule 10 and 11 CPC.

 February, 2012 with the consent of said parties, a Mediator was appointed
who conducted various meetings. However, the disputes between them
could not be settled and therefore, they also made their submissions on merit
and also filed their written submissions. The orders in the pending
applications were reserved, but plaintiffs and some of the defendants have
filed their written submissions at later stage, thus, it took time to deliver the
order in the pending application. Even certain clarifications from the
defendants were sought, the details of which are mentioned in the order
dated 9th December, 2013 when the matter was listed for direction.
CASE OF DEFENDANT NO.1
</p><p id="p_16">9.     The case of defendant No.1 in her written statement is that the letter
of authorization, signed by the Master in his lifetime, entitles her to practice
Pranic healing. Furthermore, in any event, the defendant No.1 is an expert in
the field by her own right and that, as a joint author, she has the same
intellectual property rights over the work as the Master. Although she was
authorized to do so by the master. Even otherwise, there is no copyright
subsisting in favour of the plaintiffs as all information relating to Pranic
Healing is available in the public domain.
</p><p id="p_17">       Further, the attempt of the plaintiffs to register the trademark in
Australia was dismissed as well. Further, the Master has himself learnt
Pranic healing from his satguru Lord Mahaguruji Mei Ling and his disciples;
therefore, calling the Master as the inventor of Pranic Healing is a baseless
claim. Most of the Masters work's are derivative works and he has himself
acknowledged the same. The defendant No.1 teaching Pranic Healing for the
past fourteen years, with the knowledge of the Master. The defendant No.1
learnt from the Master and has imbibed his skills. The defendant No.1 has

 also written numerous books about the healing techniques used in Pranic
Healing. She claims as legal heir of the Master, other than the plea of
authorization letter. She states that all trademark rights associated with
Master's publications would devolve upon her.
</p><p id="p_18">COMMON CASE OF OTHER DEFENDANTS
</p><p id="p_19">10.    The defence of other defendants are common. The defendant Nos.2
and 3 have taken all possible defences in their written statement. From the
entire pleading of the defendants, they put up their following defences :
</p><p id="p_20">a)     This Court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try
the present suit as they have their business activities and their offices outside
the jurisdiction of the Court. They are unconnected with each other and
they have no connection of any nature with defendant No.3.
</p><p id="p_21">b)     The plaintiffs have indulged in forum shopping.             Prior to the
institution of the present Suit, a Suit bearing number O.S. No. 4291/2010
titled C. Sundaram v. All India Yoga Vidya Pranic Healing Foundations
Trust, was filed against the defendant No.2 herein by the Plaintiffs, through
Mr. Sundram (who is a trustee in plaintiff No.'s 3 and 4 herein) before the
Court of the City Civil Judge at Bangalore, seeking relief in the nature of a
permanent injunction restraining the defendant No.2 from functioning
independently in India. As no relief, interim/temporary relief was granted in
the said proceedings, the plaintiffs in the said suit, they have now
approached this Court for the grant of substantially similar reliefs by
suppressing the factum of filing of the earlier suit and were able to get the
interim orders without any interference given to the defendant No.2.
</p><p id="p_22">c)     After obtaining interim orders from this court, the plaintiffs have
failed to comply with the requirements of Order 39, Rule 3 being



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 10 of 149</span>
 mandatory, non-compliance of the same will lead to the vacation of the
interim order as the plaintiffs have dispatched the incomplete set of
documents which amounts to non-compliance of the said provisions of
Order 39 Rule 3 CPC. Thus, ex-parte order is liable to be vacated.
</p><p id="p_23">d)     Pranic Healing name and concept is pre-existing in public domain,
therefore, the plaintiffs cannot claim an exclusive right over the same under
the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">Copyright Act</a> as the concepts alleged to be
"developed" by the Master are generic and in public domain since 1906.
</p><p id="p_24">e)     The Trade Mark Act does not provide any protection in respect of
techniques, processes or sequences, hence the plaintiffs cannot claim any
Trade Mark protection in relation to the same. It is submitted that Pranic
Healing and/or Modern Pranic Healing and techniques related thereto, are
incapable of receiving trade mark protection.
</p><p id="p_25">f)     Pranic Healing is a term which was not coined by the Master, the term
"Pranic Healing" is publici juris and is a generic/common term. It does not
constitute an original literary, dramatic and musical works and hence cannot
be subject to copyright protection under the provisions of <a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_3">Section 13</a> of the
Copyright Act.        Even otherwise, <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">Copyright Act</a> does not provide any
protection in relation to process or method; hence no protection in respect of
techniques, processes or steps in relation to "Pranic Healing" or "Modern
Pranic Healing" can be claimed by the Plaintiffs under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_5">Copyright Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_26">g)     The Copyright Office (Library of Congress, USA) issued a statement
of policy to clarify the practices relating to examination of claims in
compilations, particularly with relation to claims in selection, arrangements
of exercise (yoga poses) and choreographic work. It has been clarified in the
policy that the Yoga poses and routine exercises are not protectable as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 11 of 149</span>
 compilation and are not the compilations which US law would protect as per
the definition of the compilation under the copyright law in US.
</p><p id="p_27">h)     No exclusivity or monopoly rights were claimed by the Master, it was
clarified by the Master that Pranic Healing techniques were revealed in other
books, which were "rediscovered" by the Master. Hence the Plaintiffs claim
that Master developed "Modern Pranic Healing" is without basis and denied.
</p><p id="p_28">i)     The term Pranic Healing and related techniques, series sequence of
steps, concepts, terminologies etc have not been invented by the Master or
by the plaintiffs, hence they are incapable of being claimed as an
"invention" and receiving protection under the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_6">Patent Act</a>. The Plaintiffs in
the replication filed in the aforesaid suit have expressly admitted that the
Master did not invent Pranic Healing, hence no exclusivity or rights can be
claimed by the Plaintiffs over Pranic Healing and its techniques.
CASE OF THE DEFENDANTS ON MERIT
</p><p id="p_29">11.    On merit, the case of defendants No.2 to 14 is that they have no
connection or any business relations with each other, hence, the suit is bad
for mis-joinder of parties. In various documents and pleadings they allege
that they have not published any book of Master nor they have sold in the
market on commercial scale. They even have no intention to publish or sell
any book of Master in future. The Defendants also stated that they will not
use any trade literature, CDs any other literary work of the master while
performing PRANIC HEALING. However, the defendants state they are
entitled to impart and teach PRANIC HEALING techniques at their centers
or conduct any workshop or seminar in relation to the said PRANIC
HEALING Techniques.
</p><p id="p_30">12.    It is stated by the defendant no. 2 that the Master, at his very young

 age, was already interested in yoga, psychic phenomena, mysticism, Chinese
Chi Kung (the art of generating internal power) and other esoteric sciences.
Because of his strong interest, he spent nearly two decades researching and
studying books and literature on esoteric sciences.
</p><p id="p_31">         It is also submitted that the master also made close association with
yogis, healers, practitioners of ancient Chinese esoteric sciences and a few
extraordinary persons who were in telepathic contact with their spiritual
gurus.     The Master established the defendant No.2 herein, as a Public
Charitable Trust, by a Deed of Declaration of Trust dated 30th January, 1996,
to further the object of advancement of Pranic Healing, for the benefit of the
public. The defendant No.2 is the central coordination body for all Pranic
Healing activities in the entire Indian Sub-Continent. As per Clause 3(g) of
the Deed of Declaration of Trust, defendant No. 2 is expressly entitled to
organize, conduct and provide training programs, seminars and workshops
and to disseminate books, pamphlets and training material relating to
meditation and the attainment of inner peace and harmony, Pranic Healing
and other alternative forms of alleviating human ailments and through
subsequent Deed of Amendment dated 6th August, 2003 Yoga as well. The
Master had created the defendant No. 2 herein, inter alia, to spread Pranic
Healing and in this regard to disseminate his books, pamphlets and training
material relating to meditation and the attainment of inner peace and
harmony, Pranic Healing and other alternative forms of alleviating human
ailments, without expecting royalty or monetary returns. The defendant
No.2 thus is entitled to use the same for dissemination purposes, the
Master's works, books, pamphlets and training material relating to
meditation and the attainment of inner peace and harmony, Pranic Healing

 and other alternative forms of alleviating human ailments, in perpetuity,
without any approval, permission, sanction, license, assignment from either
of the Plaintiffs, including the Master's legal heirs is not required.
12.1 It is stated by the defendant No.2 that the plaintiff No.3 herein was
established by the Master in 1990 as a "private'' and "non-stock"
corporation. That with respect to plaintiff No.4, it is pertinent to mention
that the idea behind establishment of the plaintiff No.4 was opening up of a
branch of plaintiff No.3 in India. The plaintiff No.3 had applied to the
Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, sometime in the middle of 1997, to set up a
branch office in India. However, due to lack of response from the Reserve
Bank of India, the plaintiff No.4 was set up on 21st January, 1999 in
Bangalore. This fact is further established by a bare perusal of the content
appearing on the website of the Plaintiff No.3 herein, which inter alia states
that the plaintiff No.4 is functioning as a branch office of the plaintiff No.3.
The purpose behind opening up of a branch office in India was to make
investments in immovable property in India. However, since the plaintiff
No.3 could not, through the plaintiff No.5 which was established as a public
trust, make such investments, other methods were put into use for
acquisition of the immovable property. The registration of the immovable
property in the name of the plaintiff No. 4 was against the very provisions of
the Deed of Declaration of Trust in relation to the plaintiff No. 4, which
mandates that acquisitions/alienation of immovable property shall be done
with the prior approval of the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) which
according to the knowledge of defendant No.2, was not obtained. A bare
perusal of the Deed of Declaration of Trust in relation to the plaintiff No.4
would demonstrate that the same was established to assist the defendant

 No.2 in acting as the central co-ordinating body for all Pranic Healing
activities in the Indian sub-continent. The domain of the plaintiff No.4
herein with respect to Pranic Healing activities was limited to "the
neighbouring countries and the Middle-East countries."
12.2 It is stated by the defendant No.2 that the Master had additionally
granted the defendant No. 2 the authority to protect the intellectual property
rights in his above-mentioned works, in every manner, from all third parties
in the Indian Sub-Continent. The Master had not granted any such right to
protect his intellectual property to any other organisation in India. This is
further established by the fact that the Certification for all the courses was
granted by the defendant No.2. The rights were granted to the defendant
No.2 directly by the Master, and not through the plaintiff No.1 or plaintiff
No.3. No similar documents were executed by the Master in favour of any
other organisation in so far as India is concerned, including the plaintiff
No.4. As a matter of fact, right from inception, the plaintiff No.4 was never
engaged in the spreading of Pranic Healing activities, like the defendant
No.2.    It was always a source to commercially exploit the intellectual
property of the Master to make profit.
</p><p id="p_32">12.3 It is further stated by the defendant No.2 that several amendments
were carried out to the Deed of Declaration of Trust in respect of the
defendant No.2, during the lifetime of Master from time to time. In terms of
one of such amendments, carried out in terms of the Supplementary Trust
Deed dated 29th May, 2002 the authors divested themselves of all
proprietary rights in the properties which vested in defendant No.2 on the
date of the said amendment. The above-mentioned Supplementary Trust
Deed provided for incorporation of the following clause in the Trust Deed:

       Trust &amp; none of the donors or their legal heirs, executors,
       administrators, successors and assignees shall ever have or
       claim any proprietary rights therein."</blockquote>

<p id="p_33">       The effect of the above mentioned amendment was to vest in the
defendant No.2 the above mentioned intellectual properties, in respect of
which it was enjoying the rights on the said date, making it the lawful owner
in respect of the same, to the exclusion of all others.         It is stated by
defendant No.2 that by the above-mentioned divesture, the authors/founders
of the defendant No.2, the master and C. Sundaram, have become donors of
all their proprietary rights in the properties and assets of the defendant No.2
and have expressly bound themselves, and their legal heirs, etc., with the
stipulation that all the income accruing or arising there from is to be utilized
for the benefit of the defendant No.2 and that none of the donors or their
legal heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assignees would/could
ever have or claim any proprietary rights therein.
</p><p id="p_34">       The only propriety rights, belonging to the Master, i.e. vested in the
defendant No.2 on the relevant date were intellectual property rights granted
by him to the defendant No.2 and under Indian Law, no trustee has ay right
over the assets and any other physical property of the trust. In any event, the
original Deed of Declaration of Trust dated 30th January, 1996, in relation to
the defendant No.2 specifically provided thus:

       any of the Trustees." [Emphasis added] (pgs. 120-121 of the Suit
       Documents)

12.4 Similarly, the Supplementary Trust Deed in respect of the defendant
No. 2 dated 22nd December, 1999, provides that :

12.5 It is submitted by the defendant no. 2 that the Deed of Declaration of
Trust, and various Supplementary Trust Deeds in relation to the defendant

 assets, profits, interest, dividend, etc. of the defendant No.2 shall not be
distributed amongst the Trustees (the Master was himself a Trustee of the
defendant No.2 at the relevant time), there was no occasion for the Master to
make specific relinquishment of his rights in the assets and physical
properties in the defendant No. 2 herein by the Supplementary Trust Deed
dated 29th May, 2002.       It further establishes the fact that the above-

to/or in any other entity, thereby clearly intending, making and ensuring that
the defendant No.2, inter alia, remains unscathed in any manner from/by
any influence, vested/personal interests or vice circumstances and continues
to function undeterred in carrying out its objective of creation. Soon after
the above-mentioned divesture, the Master withdrew himself as a trustee of

revoked, amended, rescinded, annulled, invalidated or cancelled by the said
authors/founders and continues to be so vested, absolute, final and subsisting
with the defendant No.2. That the above-mentioned divesture was done by
the Master with the sole intention of ensuring that the defendant No.2 is an
independent body not to be affected or hampered in any manner from
achieving the purpose and objective of its very creation by any of then
existing     Foundations/entities   persons   as    well   as     the       future

 deeds and other events as stated above, it is the case of the defendant No.2
that the defendant No.2 has independent right to impart Pranic Healing
techniques and carry out its objects as public charitable trust and the
plaintiffs having waived the right to object by not recalling or rescinding the
divesture cannot now turn around and object to the functioning of the
defendant No.2 trust.
</p><p id="p_37">12.6 It is further stated by the defendant No. 2 that in July 2008, C.
Sundaram, the then President of the defendant No. 2, along with some other
trustees of the defendant No.2, which included Sriram Rajagopal (who has
initiated the present proceedings on behalf of the Plaintiffs) in an arbitrary
manner and without the approval of the Board of Trustees of the defendant
No.2, decided to register, and did in fact register, a "Supplementary Deed"
in respect of the defendant No.2 which in total contrast of the system of
administration that existed for almost eleven (11) years, provided for the
decision making of the defendant No.2 to vest in five (5) permanent trustees.
There was refusal of accept the above-mentioned "Supplementary Deed" by
Mr. C. Kailash, the current President of the defendant No.2, and he insisted
upon the immediate cancellation of the same.         As a result of the said
opposition, which was supported by the majority of            Trustees of the
defendant No.2, and with great difficulty, a "Deed of Cancellation",
cancelling the above-mentioned "Supplementary Deed' was executed and
registered by C. Sundaram.
</p><p id="p_38">       In view of unprecedented protest to the above-mentioned actions on
part of C. Sundram, there was relentless pressure on him to step down as the
President of the defendant No.2. Consequently, C. Sundaram resigned as
President of the defendant No.2 on 20th October, 2008. Subsequently, Mr.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 19 of 149</span>
 C. Kailash took over as the President of the defendant No.2 on 20th October,
2008, upon his unanimous election by the Board of Trustees of the
defendant No.2 and upon his assuming charge as the President of the
defendant No.2, Mr. C. Kailash sought the handing over the complete
documents pertaining to the affairs of the defendant No.2 from C.
Sundaram, Sriram Rajagopal and Sumi Lazar (who was acting as the
General Manager of the defendant No.2 at the relevant time). However, no
co-operation was received from them with regard to handing over the said
documents to the new management of the defendant No.2. The above-
mentioned individuals, in active connivance with the plaintiff No.'s 1 to 4
and plaintiff No.'s 7 to 10, saw their efforts to take control of the defendant
No.2 thwart by active opposition from all quarters, which was viewed by
them as a strong challenge to their supreme control of the Pranic Healing
Movement in India, they indulged in several other illegal acts to take control
of the Pranic Healing activities in India.
</p><p id="p_39">13.    It is specifically alleged by all the Defendants that there is no
Intellectual Property Rights over certain Terms and Terminologies.
Defendants have placed on record large number of documents in support of
their submission. The said documents reveals that the art of Pranic healing
is a form of yoga, dealing with mechanism of inner healing techniques,
commonly known and used by healers and users of esoteric sciences. Yoga,
as an art and science, is prevalent and existing from time immemorial and
are very ancient. All forms of yoga and terms and techniques, including the
rights claimed by the plaintiffs thereon substantially, are in the public
domain. The techniques developed by the Master are an adaptation of yoga
techniques and terms. No one can claim exclusivity over any form of yoga,

 including Pranic Healing, and the terms and techniques relating thereto.
Reference is made to books titled " The Science of Physic Healing" and
'Hatha Yoga" written by Yogi Ramacharaka way back in 1906, which talk
about the principles and practice of Pranic Healing, and various terms and
techniques of Pranic Healing including, Pranic Breathing, Pranic
Treatments, Pranic Energy, Pranic Exercises, etc. The Master, at page 8 his
autobiographical work, "The Origin of Modern Pranic Healing and Arhatic
Yoga", makes a reference to the above-mentioned work book.

parties. Mr. Amit Singh Chadha, learned Senior counsel appeared on behalf
of the plaintiff and Mr. B.B Sawhney, Senior Advocate appeared on behalf
of the defendant No.1 and Mr. Sethi, learned Senior counsel appeared on
behalf of the defendant No.3. Mr. Viplav Sharma, Advocate appeared on
behalf of defendant No.2. These pending applications have been argued by
these counsel from time to time and same time other counsel also appeared
as per appearances recorded.
</p><p id="p_41">15.    Mr. Chadha, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiffs has made his submissions which can be outlined in the following
manner :
</p>
<p id="p_42">I.     Firstly, Mr. Chadha, learned Senior counsel has explained the concept
of the Modern Pranic Healing in detail and has argued that the said concept
is originated from that of the plaintiffs. It has been argued that the reliance
of the defendants upon the several sources in order to say that the Pranic
Healing is pre-existing concept and art is misconceived. Mr. Chadha,
learned Senior counsel has further elaborated his submission on the aspect of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 21 of 149</span>
 the originality of the concept by relying several documents and his
submissions point wise can be enumerated as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       i)      Mr. Chadha, relied upon the books written by Master and stated
               that Master has also compiled his research in CDs, books,
               manuals etc which clearly show that the immense hard work,
               labour and effort is involved in creating the said books and thus
               the concept which has been further developed by the Master
               (who is the predecessor of the plaintiffs) by devising new
               techniques and adding on several aspects to the basic concept of
               pranayam is an independent work which is worthy of the
               copyright protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       ii)     Mr. Chadha, alongside also replied to the challenge raised by
               the defendants on the originality of the concept of the Pranic
               Healing by contending that the defendants reliance upon the
               book of "Science of Psychic Healing" is misplaced in as much
               as the said book merely provides the basics and ancient concept
               of the Pranic Healing and the concepts elucidated by the Master
               are far more complex and novel. There are vast differences
               between the concept which was pre-existing and the one which
               has been devised by the Master. Mr. Chadha, relied upon the
               chart comparing the books of the Master with that of Yogi
               Ramacharaka in order to demonstrate the differences.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       iii)    Mr. Chadha, further argued that it is only the Master who
               introduced Modern Pranic Healing in India. It is submitted that
               the first Pranic Healing Foundation in Kerala was established in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 22 of 149</span>
                the year 1991. There were number of Pranic Healing centres
               which were established later on by the Master. It is submitted
               that in 1992, the Master established plaintiff no. 4 to collect
               royalties from Defendant no. 2. Thus, the said concept of Pranic
               Healing has been introduced by the Master and the plaintiffs in
               India. It is argued by him that the defendants organizations
               admit themselves to be the bonafide users of the Modern Pranic
               healing techniques, cannot dissociate themselves from the
               plaintiff and carry on their activities by using the Master's
               name.</blockquote>

<p id="p_43">       For all these reasons, as per Mr. Chadha, it is the plaintiffs who are
the owners of the concept of the Modern Pranic Healing in India who have
also acquired the rights from LRs of the Master and the defendants'
allegation that the said concept is not original concept of the plaintiff is
totally misconceived and baseless.
</p><p id="p_44">II.    Secondly, Mr. Chadha, learned Senior counsel for the plaintiffs has
argued that the defendant No. 1 being a licensee of the plaintiff No. 2 and
was authorized to perform the Pranic Healing activities under twenty
licensing agreement dated 26th September, 2006 which have been terminated
by the letter dated 17th May, 2010 is estopped from taking the plea of the
prior authorization of the said concept by the Master once the defendant no.
1 herself took licences from the plaintiff No. 2.
</p><p id="p_45">       It has been argued that the defendant No.1 has not challenged the
termination letters dated 17th May, 2010 and thus the reliance of some letter
dated 2nd November, 2004 written by Master is misconceived. This is due to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 23 of 149</span>
 the reason that by taking licenses from the plaintiff No. 2, the defendant No.
1 has implicitly acknowledged the plaintiffs rights under the concept of the
Pranic Healing concept. It has been further argued that the letter of
authorization was superseded by the licensing agreements and thus the
reliance of the prior authorization is of no avail in view of the later licenses
which have been now terminated.
</p>
<p id="p_46">III.   Thirdly, Mr. Chadha has argued that the defendant No. 1's claim that
she is the joint author of the books along with the master and therefore
entitled to use the Pranic Healing techniques in her own right is also baseless
and without any merit. It has been urged that the defendant No.1 merely
acted as a mere transcriber who has simply put the Master's word from his
lectures in to the written form along with the help of team of people without
changing any of the words of the Master. There is no active intellectual
collaboration or cooperation on the part of the defendant No.1 to claim
herself to be a joint author. Thus, the claim of the defendant No.1 is totally
false and misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_47">       It has been argued that the acts of the defendant No.1 are infringing in
nature as the defendant continued to hold seminars and promote the Pranic
Healing without any authorization from the plaintiffs and also depriving the
plaintiffs from the royalties. It has been argued that the defendant No.1 has
been garnering funds through sponsorship which amounts to commercial
exploitation and has been accepting offerings from disciples. Thus, the acts
of the defendants are not merely charitable but aimed at reaping commercial
profits and are clearly infringing in nature.

<p id="p_48">        With regard to alternative plea taken by her, it is argued by Mr.
Chadha that defendant No.1 was one of the Master's followers and senior
disciple, who has been claiming to have been married to the Master on 31 st
December, 2006. However, the Competent Court of Philippines dismissed
her claim, which has not been denied by her. Even she has acknowledged
the uniqueness of the concepts developed by the Master and vide her email
dated 23rd March, 2007 has stated as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       "In order to 'Preserve the Purity' of the priceless teachings of
       our Beloved Grand Master Choa Kok Sui, the Institute of Inner
       Studies, Inc., Manila would like to announce the immediate

<p id="p_49">       She was authorized to perform Modern Pranic Healing activities
under twenty (20) Licensing Agreements, all dated 26 th September, 2006
executed between plaintiff No.2 and defendant No.1. The above mentioned
twenty (20) Licensing Agreements executed between plaintiff No.2 and
defendant No.1 have been terminated by plaintiff No.2 vide Termination
Letter dated 17th May, 2010. It is also a matter of record that, till date,
defendant No.1 has not challenged the above Termination Letter dated 17 th
May, 2010 and therefore, defendant No.1 is no longer authorized to perform
Modern Pranic Healing activities. The defendant No.1 has sought to rely

 upon one Letter of Authorization dated 2nd November, 2004 which was
signed by the Master in the capacity of the President of plaintiff No.1. The
same was superseded by the subsequent twenty (20) Licensing Agreements
all executed on 26th September, 2006. The aforesaid fact is evident from the
website pages of 'The Inner Sciences' created by defendant No.1 which
does not recognize or mention the Letter of Authorization dated 2nd
November, 2004 and instead states as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "He granted her 20 years, global licences for all of his courses
       in 2006. These were subsequently revoked by the organization
       after his passing from the physical body."</blockquote>

<p id="p_50">       The said twenty (20) Licensing Agreements have been terminated on
17th May, 2010 within her knowledge and said defendant No.1 has ceased to
have the authority to perform Modern Pranic Healing and/or communicate
the same to the public. In fact on 14th June, 2010, defendant No.1 was also
removed from Trusteeship of plaintiff No.4. The authorization letter, which
defendant No.1 relies upon, mandates payment of royalty to plaintiff No.2
by defendant No.1, however no royalty is being paid by her since 2008.
</p><p id="p_51">       There is no merit in submission of defendant No.1 as she is a
transcriber and editor of various books on Modern Pranic Healing, authored
by the Master and therefore, she is the concurrent user of Modern Pranic
Healing and the copyright owner. Defendant No.1 is also not the copyright
owner of any of the books over which she claims copyright by virtue of
being a transcriber/editor. The original and plagiarized books produced in
the Court would show that the copyright in respect of the said work vests in
the name of the Master. Further, the defendant No.1 had been granted
permission to perform Modern Pranic activities only in the capacity of a

terminated by plaintiff No.2 vide Termination Letter dated 17th May, 2010.
</p><p id="p_52">         The reliance of decision in the case of Najma Heptulla Vs. Orient
Longman Ltd. &amp; Ors., AIR 1989 Del 63 in support of her contention that
she is a joint author and copyright holder of the works of the Master is
completely misplaced. In the said case, this Court has held that if there is
intellectual contribution by two more persons pursuant to a pre-concerted
joint design to the composition of a literary work, then those persons have to
be regarded as 'joint authors'. However, in the present case, defendant
No.1 has acted merely as a transcriber, who simply put the Master's words
from his lectures into written form alongwith the help of a team of people,
without changing any of the words of the Master. The Golden Lotus Sutras
produced by Master's lectures and the words and preaching enunciated by
the Master. There is no active intellectual collaboration or cooperation on
the part of the defendant No.1 to claim herself to be a joint author. In the
decision referred by defendant No.1 in the Najma (supra) it was observed
that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">         "If a scientist takes the services of another person with a view to
         transcribe his thoughts, findings and materials in form of books
         or articles, can it mean that the author of the scientific material
         is not the scientist himself but the author is the person in whose
         language the material is expressed ? In such a case, the person
         who transcribe a thought may not even be able to understand
         the material which is being written."
</blockquote><p id="p_53">IV.      Fourthly, Mr. Chadha has argued that the defendant no. 2's claim that
it has independent right to use the Pranic Healing in India by virtue of the
                                      th
supplementary trust deed dated 29          May, 2002 which as per the defendant's

 plaintiffs have no right to object against the defendant's use of the Pranic
Healing techniques is frivolous one. As per Mr. Chadha, the said argument
is flawed due to manifold reasons which have been given by the counsel for
the plaintiffs in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_54">a)   Admittedly the Master established defendant No.2 on 30th January,
     1996 who was the founder Chairman of defendant No.2. The Trust
     Deed of defendant No.2 stipulates that it has to frame its rules and
     regulations in concurrence with the rules of plaintiff No.3. Therefore,
     defendant No.2 was established to promote pranic healing and, inter
     alia, to :
</p><p id="p_55">       i)     Standardize course fees, certificates and coordinate the schedule
              of classes and retreats of the Master among all Pranic
              Foundations in India.
</p><p id="p_56">       ii)    Collect and hold royalties from all the state pranic healing
              foundations, for the benefit of defendant No.2 as well as for and
              on behalf of plaintiff No.3 herein.
</p><p id="p_57">       The right claimed by the defendant No.2 is defeated in view of the
fact that the defendant No.2 on behalf of trust had obtained orders against
third parties restraining them from performing Modern Pranic Healing
activities, recognizing the uniqueness of the Master's works. The list of
cases filed by defendant No.2 are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">             All India Pranic Healing Foundation Trust Vs. Jaico

               unique Pranic Healing techniques and also coined certain

               modalities, techniques and diagrams besides the narrative texts.
               Apart from the text, the various modalities and techniques
               originally developed by the said Master and incorporated in the
               above said book....includes the following (i) The concept of lag
               time; (ii) The concept and techniques of sensitizing the hands
               and fingers; (iii) The concept and techniques of
               cleansing/sweeping including localized sweeping..."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">b)   The defendant no. 2 had been claiming the rights through assignment
     deeds which were signed in the year 2004 and also on 15th March,
     2006. The term of the said deeds was for the period of 5 years. The
     plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the term of the assignment deed
     dated 15th March, 2006 has come to an end, to which the defendant no.
     2 did not deny the same but instead started claiming the right through
     the supplementary trust deed dated 29th May, 2002. Therefore, As per
     Mr. Chadha, the defendant No.2 has no explanation to use the concept
     of the Pranic Healing after entering into the assignment deed for
     limited period and the claim of independent right is a sham.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 29 of 149</span>
<p id="p_58"> c)   The defendant No.2 had also claimed the rights deriving the strength
     from the extension of assignment deeds given to defendant No. 1. It has
     been argued that the permission to use the said Pranic Healing concept
     was withdrawn from the defendant No.1 on 23rd January, 2010 and still
     the defendant No. 2 continued to publish books in India, CDs, course
     material and certificates in violation of the rights of the plaintiff even
     after the permission was withdrawn from the defendant No. 1. Thus,
     the conduct of the defendant No. 2 is malafide and the stand taken by
     the defendant No. 2 is inconsistent and should not be believed by the
     court.
</p>
<p id="p_59">d)   It has been further pointed out that bare perusal of the supplementary
     trust deed shows that authors have divested themselves of properties
     and assets of the trust and not the assets and properties owned by the
     authors. Thus, to say that the plaintiffs have relinquished their rights
     qua the trade mark and the concept of the Pranic Healing and
     indefinitely allowed the same to the defendant No. 2 is totally contrary
     to the intent of the trust deed.
</p>
<p id="p_60">e)   The defendant No. 2 has now claimed all rights for India based on
     extension of Assignment Deeds through defendant No. 1, however, on
     23rd January, 2010 all support to defendant No. 1 was withdrawn by the
     Plaintiff with effect from 23rd January, 2010 but in February 2010,
     defendant No. 2, under authority of defendant No. 1 was publishing
     books in India, making CDs, publishing course material and
     certificates.    Pranic Healing is well evidenced by the facts stated
     hereunder:

<p id="p_61">        a. Relevant provisions of the Trust Deed of defendant No. 2 are
           reproduced as under: -

<p id="p_63">                 Board Resolution passed by the Board of Trustees of defendant
       No. 2 at a meeting held on 18th February, 1996 specifically states that
       an " All India body will formulate policies based on recommendations
       from the World Pranic Healing Foundation designed to standardize
       the requirement for admission of basic Pranic Healing graduates.
       These policies will be adhered to by all foundations."
</p><p id="p_64">f)   Mr. Chadha states that it is admitted position as mentioned that the
     defendant No. 2, on behalf of itself and other defendants, had been
     sharing royalties received from them with Plaintiffs. This is evident
     from defendant No. 2's own documents at Annexure a/15 Colly of IA
     No. 20143 of 2011, which give details of the amounts due from
     defendant No. 2 to plaintiff No. 4. That defendant No. 2 was sharing
     royalties with Plaintiffs is also evident from pages 317 and 318 of IA
     No. 20143 of 2011.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                             Page 31 of 149</span>
<p id="p_65">             In the minutes of meeting of Board of Trustees of defendant No. 2
     held on 31st January, 1996, signed by the Master himself, it is stated
     that defendant No. 2 shall enter into agreements with each state level
     foundation concerning the remittance of royalties and submission of
     reports, "including those royalties and reports intended for World
     Pranic Healing Foundation."
</p><p id="p_66">            The master had, during his lifetime, given instructions that in
     respect of legal agreements granting rights to organize and conduct
     various courses of the Master, these agreements will first be signed
     between plaintiff No. 3 and plaintiff No. 4 and then rights would be
     granted by plaintiff No. 4 to defendant No. 2, which would in turn
     authorize all the local foundations.    These understanding has been
     recorded in the minutes of the meetings of Board of Trustees of
     defendant No. 2 dated 9th June, 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_67">       By placing reliance of the aforesaid events, it has been argued by Mr.
Chadha that the stand taken by the defendant No. 2 in order to justify the
continuance of the usage of the concept of Pranic Healing is wrong and
baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_68">V.     Fifthly, it has been argued by Mr. Chadha that Modern Pranic
Techniques have been conceptualized by the Master comprising several
postures and Asanas and the same deserves the protection under the realm of
copyright being the compilation of the works. The said postures and the
manner of performing the Pranic Healing is also the choreography works
within the meaning of the copyright Act and thus deserves protection under
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_7">Copyright Act</a>, 1957.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 32 of 149</span>
<p id="p_69"> i)      In the case of     Academy of General Education, Manipal and
Another Vs. Malini Mallya (Para 58, 63-64, 68, 79-80), it has been held
that the teachings contained in the books/manuals are not capable of being
distinguished or segregated from the teachings/preachings and other forms
of communication to the public and hence, the manuals which set out the
manner in which 'Modern Pranic Healing' is to be manifested protect not
only the literature embodied in the manuals and books but also the manner
of performance of the same.
</p><p id="p_70">ii)     It is submitted that copyright subsists in the sequence of asanas
determined by the Master. This Court, in University of Cambridge v B.D.
Bhandari &amp; University of Oxford v. Narendra publishing House, 2009
(39) PTC 642 (Para 9) has opined that copyright subsists in a sequence of
information is complied in a creative arrangement by virtue of selection,
coordination and sequencing that makes it different from the pre-existing
data.
</p><p id="p_71">iii)    In the case of Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Chaudhary, 2005
WL 756558 (N.D. Cal. (Paras 3-5)), it is held that copyright law does
extend protection to an arrangement of information in the public domain
assembled in a sufficiently creative fashion. In this case, copyright is a
selection and arrangement of asanas was upheld and it was held that a
sequence of yoga position could be one's intellectual property . it was held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">        "Thus, OSYU has provided no persuasive authority that a compilation
        of yoga asanas cannot be protected under the Copyright Laws in the
        same manner as other compilations. The court, while recognizing,
        and even agreeing that application of law of compilations to yoga
        asanas appears to violate the spirit of yoga, has been unable to locate
        any authority that precludes such application. Therefore, if the trier
        of fact determines that a sufficient number of individual yoga asanas

         are arranged in a sufficiently creative manner, copyright protection
        for the yoga sequence would be available."</blockquote>
<p id="p_72">        In order to substantiate the argument, Mr. Chadha relied upon the
following judgments :
</p>
<p id="p_73">   a) <a href="/doc/184940/" id="a_8">Academy of General Education , Manipal and Another v. Malini
        Mallya</a>, (2009) 4 SCC 256 and

</p><p id="p_74">   b) <a href="/doc/280822/" id="a_9">University of Cambridge v. B.D Bhandhari &amp; University of Oxford</a>
        v. Narendra Publishing House.
</p>
<p id="p_75">        It is submitted by Mr. Chadha that from these decisions, it appears
that the courts have given protection to the literary works and also the
sequence of information present in the public domain provided that the
information is compiled in a creative arrangement by virtue of selection,
coordination and sequencing that makes it different from the pre-existing
data.
</p>
<p id="p_76">        Mr. Chadha also placed heavy reliance on the judgment passed by the
US district court in case of Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Chaudhary
(supra) wherein the court has treated the activities of Yoga as compilation
when the same are assimilated in the book form and the performance of the
same without permission of the owner is held to be violation of the
copyright in the compilation and choreography work.
</p>
<p id="p_77">        It is further argued by Mr. Chadha that copyright extends to the
performance of that work as set out in the literature. In Academy of General
Education, Manipal and Another v Malini Mallya, (2009) 4 SCC 256 (Para




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                       Page 34 of 149</span>
</p><p id="p_78"> 40), it has categorically noted that the copyright in a literary work cannot be
distinguished from its performance in the manner set out in the literature.
</p><p id="p_79">       He stated that Modern Pranic Healing as developed by the Master was
set out in the instruction manuals and books. Undisputedly, there subsists a
copyright in these instruction manuals and books manifesting the teachings
of the Master. Borrowing the rationale of the Supreme Court in Malini
Mallya, copyright in the books/instruction manuals extends to the
performance and preaching of Modern Pranic Healing to the public.
</p><p id="p_80">       Moreover, <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_10">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 confers upon the
holder of copyright, the exclusive right to 'perform the work in public, or
communicate it to the public' among others things.            Furthermore, as
established in the light of the Supreme Court decision in Malini Mallya, the
copyright on sequence of asanas is manifested in the published preachings of
the Master or the instruction manuals of Modern Pranic Healing and cannot
be segregated from the performance of those instructions.
</p>
<p id="p_81">VI.    Sixthly, it is argued that the defendants by copying the books,
manuals, CDs and other literature of the plaintiffs are clearly reproducing
the literary work of the plaintiffs and are causing infringement of the
copyright in the literary works as contained under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_11">Copyright Act</a>, 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_82">       His submission is that in view of the above, copyright subsists in
Modern Pranic Healing methods for being developed by systematically
arranging and sequencing asanas. Although these asanas may have been
known to exist and may have been available in the public domain, Master
carefully studied and experimented with the information in Public domain



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 35 of 149</span>
 and he systematically collated the same into a unique sequence of asanas
that was subsequently reduced to a tangible medium, copyrightable under
<a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_12">Section 13</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_83">       Mr. Chadha argued that in the present case the Defendants activities
do not fall within the exception of 'Fair Use' as teachings of the Master
have been performed in public by the defendants and also displayed and
communicate for a fee, which violate <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957.
All programs of defendants No. 1 are sponsored and sponsors are gaining
mileage, making it more or less a commercial event. Defendant No. 1 is
earning money by way of offerings by the followers. The other defendants
are selling books, CDs, course material and photographs of the Master
which are all pirated/infringed copies of the copyrighted material and hence
it amounts to be commercial exploitation. The said Defendants cannot take
the defence of 'fair use' under <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_14">Section 52</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 as they
have been resorting to uncontrolled commercial exploitation of the
techniques developed by the Master.
</p>
<p id="p_84">       The following cases are referred by the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of plaintiffs Counsel :
</p><p id="p_85">i)     In the cases of University of Cambridge Vs. B.D. Bhandari &amp;
University of Oxford v. Narendra Publishing House, 2009 (39) PTC 642
and Super Cassettes Industries Vs. Hamar Television Network, 2011 (45)
PTC 70 (Del) (Para 63), it has been clearly laid down that commercial
exploitation of works protected by intellectual property rights will take the
matter outside the ambit of "fair use".
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                       Page 36 of 149</span>
<p id="p_86"> ii)    In Church of Scientology International Vs. Enid Vien, 827 F. Supp
629, the United Stated District Court used the mandate in <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_15">Section 107</a> of
the Copyright Act which states that the following factors have to be
considered in determining whether the activity is covered under the fair use
doctrine:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">          "a. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such
          use is of commercial nature or it is for non-profit educational
          purposes: b. The Nature of copyrighted work; c. The amount and
          substantiality of the portion used in relation to copyrighted work as
          a whole; d. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or
          the value of the copyrighted work."</blockquote>

<p id="p_87">       Therefore, as the defendant Nos.1 and 2 have used whole of Master's
creations and teachings for commercial exploitation instead or restricting the
use to private use or teacher-pupil instruction. The use, therefore, cannot be
defended as 'fair use' under <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_16">Section 52</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957.
VII. Seventhly, It has been argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiff
that the mark MODERN PRANIC HEALING has been used by the Master
as well as the plaintiff for the considerable period of time in India and thus
by virtue of such long standing use and the efforts made by the plaintiffs in
popularizing the trade mark PRANIC HEALING, the said trade mark
MODERN PRANIC HEALING OR PRANIC HEALING has acquired
distinctiveness qua the plaintiffs and the same has been associated with that
of the Master and his descendants and no one else.
</p>
<p id="p_88">       Even assuming that the concept the Pranic Healing was available in
public domain, however, the methodologies and principles as developed and
practiced by the Master are unique to the Master and are not available in the
public domain. In fact, by virtue of Master having spent years developing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 37 of 149</span>
 and spreading Modern Pranic Healing, the term Pranic Healing as prevalent
and practiced in India today, has acquired a secondary meaning and
distinctiveness which has come to be exclusively identified and recognized
with the Master. In fact, protection of such rights acquired by reason of use
and practice over period of time is afforded under Section 32 of the
Trademarks Act, 1999 ("Trademarks Act") which provides as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">          <a href="/doc/701290/" id="a_17">Section 32</a>: Protection of registration on ground of
          distinctiveness in certain cases- where a trade mark is
          registered in breach of sub- section of <a href="/doc/229141/" id="a_18">section 9</a>, it shall not
          be declared invalid if, in consequence of the use which has
          been made of it, it has after registration and before
          commencement of any legal proceedings challenging the
          validity of such registration, acquired a distinctive
          character in relation to the goods or services for which it is
          registered.
</blockquote><p id="p_89">VIII. Eighthly, Mr. Chadha has argued that the performance of the work
cannot be segregated from the copyright which subsists in the literary work
as the literary work prepared by the Master contains the manner of doing the
ASANAS as well as the postures in which the said ASANAS are required to
be performed. Thus, by performing the work of the plaintiff in public as per
the manuals, books and CD Roms, the defendants are infringing the
plaintiffs copyright in the work of MODERN PRANIC HEALING.
</p>
<p id="p_90">       Mr. Chadha again relied upon the judgment passed in the case of
<a href="/doc/184940/" id="a_19">Academy of General Education, Manipal v. Malini Mallya</a> (supra) wherein
there is an observation that the copyright in a literary work cannot be
distinguished from its performance in the manner set out in the literature in

<p id="p_91"> IX.    Ninthly, it has been argued that the acts of the defendants do not
constitute fair use as all the programs performed by the defendant No. 1 and
others are sponsored and the sponsors are gaining the popularity on the
strength of the popular work of the plaintiffs. The defendants No. 1 is also
earning money by way of confusing the disciples and accepting the
offerings. The defendants are also selling the books, CDs, course material
along with the photographs of the master which are all for commercial
purpose and thus it is an infringement of the plaintiffs copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_92">X.     Tenthly, Mr. Chadha has also countered the plea of the lack of the
territorial jurisdiction of this court by stating that the plaint contains ample
averments in the plaint that the defendants are conducting their illegal
activities of performing the PRANIC HEALING CLASSES in Delhi and
therefore the cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of
this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_93">       By making the aforementioned submissions, it has been prayed by
Mr. Chadha that the injunction order passed on 14th September, 2011 in IA
No.14617/2011 should be confirmed by this court and prayer made in the
application be granted and applications filed by the defendants for vacation
of interim orders are liable to be dismissed with cost.

<p id="p_94">16.    Per contra, Mr. Sawhney, learned Senior counsel for defendant No.1
and Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of
defendant No.3 have made their respective submissions as per their own
case on merit. The other counsel on behalf of rest of defendants have also
made their submissions. Except the submissions of defendant No.1, the
arguments of other defendants are common which can be outlined in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 39 of 149</span>
 following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_95">A.     Firstly, Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned counsel for the Defendants have
argued that the plaintiff has come before this court with unclean hands and
have not disclosed the material facts before this Court in the suit and interim
application at the time of passing of the ex-parte ad interim order dated 14th
September, 2011. The said concealment of the material facts are enumerated
as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">       a)      That the suit bearing No. 4291/2010 titled as C. Sunderam v.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">               All India Yoga Vidya Pranic Healing Foundation Trust seeking
               injunction against the defendant No. 2 (Containing similar
               prayer as in the present suit) was filed by Mr. S.C. Sunderam
               (Trustee of the plaintiff No. 4) before District Court, Bangalore
               at page 2 of the documents filed by the defendant No. 3.It has
               been argued that the Plaintiffs did not get the interim order in
               the suit bearing No.4291/2010 before the District Court,
               Bangalore and thereafter filed the present suit by intentionally
               suppressing and concealing the said suit. It has been argued that
               the statement contained in para 73 of the plaint that there is no
               proceeding instituted similar to the aforesaid suit is false and is
               aimed at misleading this court.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_96">B.     Secondly, learned counsel for the defendants have argued that the
plaintiffs have failed to comply with the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC
as prescribed by the law. It has been argued that the perusal of the postal
receipt affixed on the envelope addressed to them would reveal that the
weight of the documents which were dispatched by the plaintiffs was 400


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 40 of 149</span>
 grams, it has been argued that the records of the suit and applications filed
by the plaintiff was quite bulky and the same was not supplied to the
defendants and thus the provisions of the Order 39 Rule 3 CPC has not been
complied with which warrants the vacation of the interim orders passed by
this court.
</p>
<p id="p_97">C.     Thirdly, learned counsel for the defendants argued that the concept of
Pranic Healing is the sequences of steps, concepts, principles, techniques of
performing the ancient exercise of yoga is incapable of protection in the
field of the Intellectual Property Rights as they form part of the public
knowledge in the public domain and thus cannot form subject matter of the
protection. It has been argued that the concept of Pranic Healing being a
facet of Yoga forms part of the traditional knowledge of India and thus
cannot be appropriated by anyone exclusively much less the plaintiff under
the guise of the intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p id="p_98">D.     Fourthly, learned counsel for the defendants argued that the plaintiffs
did not inform the court as to what is the difference between the Pranic
Healing and Modern Pranic Healing and the basis behind the said
distinction. It has been argued that the plaintiffs mere saying may not be
enough but the plaintiffs have to explain as to what constituted the Pranic
Healing and how the Modern Pranic Healing is a significant departure from
the ancient Pranic Healing. It is thus argued that the plaintiffs alleged work
slack originality and therefore the same do not deserve the copyright
protection.
</p>
<p id="p_99">E.     Fifthly, it has been argued that by the learned counsel for the
defendants that the plaintiffs have also not explained in the plaint or in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 41 of 149</span>
 injunction application as to how the Pranic healing techniques, practices and
concept amounts to a work of Choreography and thus the same has not been
pleaded nor explained cannot give rise to the valid claim of copyright
protection. As per the defendant's counsel, this court should reject the
submission that the Pranic Healing Techniques are subject matter of the
choreography and thus protected under the law of copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_100">F.     Sixthly, learned counsel for the defendants argued once the plaintiffs
do not have any exclusive right to use the Pranic Healing techniques in law,
the grant or non grant of the license by the plaintiffs to the defendant No. 3
or any of the defendants is inconsequential. Thus, the defendants use of the
common place Pranic Healing techniques cannot be prevented by the court
when the plaintiffs do not have any legal right to restrain the defendants to
use the Pranic Healing techniques.
</p>
<p id="p_101">G.     Seventhly, learned counsel for the defendants argued that the Pranic
Healing Techniques form part of the traditional knowledge of India and is
also available in ancient and recent literature available in Public domain and
thus cannot be protected by way of conferment of the exclusive right to the
plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_102">H.     Eighthly, learned counsel for the defendants argued that this court
should disregard the additional points contended by the plaintiffs in the
replication as the replication cannot alter the entire nature of the case of the
plaintiff. It has been argued that the disclosure of 13 points in the form of
techniques allegedly invented by the Master should be disregarded as the
same nowhere form part of the plaint. Additionally, it has been argued that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 42 of 149</span>
 the thirteen concepts are denied and disputed by the defendants as stated by
the plaintiffs to be allegedly invented by the master.
</p>
<p id="p_103">I.     Ninthly, learned counsel for the defendants argue that 13 techniques
allegedly invented by the master have already been explained in several
books which are available in the public domain for almost a century ago.
The defendants have provided the list of the said books and publications in
order to show that the plaintiffs Pranic Healing techniques lack originality
which are enlisted in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_104">     The thirteen concepts (sought to added as an after by the plaintiffs) do
not form part of the pleadings contained in the plaint and the application
seeking temporary injunction sought from this court, it is pertinent that the
thirteen concepts claimed to have been founded by the Masters, have been
set out, explained and discussed in the following books; hence it is
erroneous to contend that the concepts were developed by the Master or are
novel or unique to Master alone :
</p>
<p id="p_105">i.   Pranic      Psychotherapy      as   a    concept    of      healing       from
     emotional/psychological point of view : Reference is made to a book
     titled the Science of Psychic Healing by Yogi Rama Charaka, Yogi
     Publications Society, Chicago, Illinois (copyrighted in 1906). Chapter
     V to IX of the said book sets out the detailed concepts such as "Pranic
     Healing", "Pranic Breathing", "Longitudinal Passes" "Horizontal
     Passes" (sweeping), to effect healing from an emotional, psychological
     point of view by diagnosing the persons energy conditions by use of
     hands referred to as "laying on of hands".

<p id="p_106">       Thus the concepts alleged to be developed by the Master are generic
      and in public domain since 1906 and it would be absurd for the
      plaintiffs to contend that the concepts set out in paragraph 3 of the
      reply are unique or that they have been developed by the Master, as
      alleged or at all. Reference is also made to a book titled Hands of Light
      USA written by Brennan, Barnara Ann (1988): Bantam Books wherein,
      the said book set out the concept relating to scanning and healing

     been set out in the book titled Hands of Light at page 239 and 240. It is
     submitted that cleansing of blood technique and internal organs, Master
     Technique have been known to ancient Indian yoga practitioners and
     finds it basis in medical science wherein blood id purified in the liver
     and lungs, hence ancient      yoga practitioner mastered         the art of
     breathing exercise, which purified the blood and thereafter healed
     internal organs. Such breathing and other exercises are contained in

     internal organ technique, Master healing technique has been
     documented in various books and has been practised and popularized

cannot claim any exclusive monopoly over the expression "PRANIC

healing techniques.
</p>
<p id="p_118">     PRANIC HEALING is a part of the traditional knowledge of India has
been used by several gurus or persons who impart training relating Pranic
healing and thus the said expression PRANIC HEALING is incapable of
distinguishing the services of the plaintiffs from that of other persons who
are rendering similar services. Therefore, the word PRANIC HEALING as
registered trade mark is not a valid trade mark within the meaning of the

on the clarification issued by US copyright office on 22nd June, 2012

been relied upon to contend that the plaintiffs claim that there will be
copyright in the yoga poses in the form of compilation has been expressly
negated by US Copyright Office.

<p id="p_121">N.     Fourteenthly, it has been argued by the learned counsel for the
defendant no. 3 even assuming that there exists valid copyright in the Pranic
Healing in favour of the plaintiffs, the defendant No. 3 acted under the
bonafide belief that the defendant No. 1 and defendant No. 2 had good title
being the legally wedded wife of the Master and assignee respectively.
Defendant No. 3 had never communicated with the plaintiffs and was never
informed about the termination of the license and thus the defendant No. 3
cannot be said to be licensee acting under the permission of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_122">O.     Fifteenthly, learned counsel for the defendants have argued that there
is no valid deed of assignment in favour of the plaintiffs entitling them to
sue for the infringement of copyright. It has been argued that the wife of
Master namely Ms. Mary Jane Choachuy has not executed the assignment
deed along with the plaintiff No. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff, thus the
deed of assignment cannot be said to be valid one. It has also been stated
that the assignment is inadequately stamped and thus is not in accordance

<p id="p_124">17.    Some additional submissions have been made by the learned counsel
for the defendant No. 1 and defendant No. 2 which have been summarized in
the following manner:

<p id="p_125">     Learned counsel for the defendant No. 1 has argued that teaching of
      Pranic Healing has been permitted expressly by Master Choa Kok Sui
      vide a written authorization letter dated 2nd November, 2004 and the
      said letter is valid uptill 2025, thus, the plaintiffs being the descendants
      of the master deriving title from him cannot withdraw the consent and
      permission which has been given by the master himself and the said
      permission was never withdrawn or cancelled in any manner by the
      master during his life time. Thus, the defendant No. 1 is entitle to carry
      on its activities of teaching Pranic healing which it has been carrying
      on for the last 19 years from now.

      defendant No. 1 is the concurrent user of Pranic Healing as a teaching
      technique and the defendant No. 1 is the transcriber and editor of the
      various published books (more than 9) of the master and therefore is
      the joint author of the said books. The aspects have been concealed

      from this court while seeking interim orders. The defendant No. 1 has
     named the said books which are enlisted below:
</p>
<p id="p_127">       a.     Achieve the impossible (The Golden Lotus Sutra on Spiritual
              Business Management)

</p>
<p id="p_128">       As per the defendant No. 1, due to the said co-authorship, the
defendant No.1 has distinct and independent title to practice Pranic Healing
techniques.
</p>
<p id="p_129">    Learned counsel for the defendant No. 1 has also argued that the Pranic
     Healing techniques, practices are very ancient not only in India but in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                       Page 52 of 149</span>
      other parts of the world as well and the same have been in public
     domain for centuries. It has argued that the books of Yogi
     Ramacharaka and Swami Sivananda on Pranic Healing clearly predate
     the works of the Master and thus the plaintiffs cannot claim any
     exclusive monopoly rights on the same.
</p>
<p id="p_130">    Learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has argued that the plaintiffs
     attempt to register the mark Pranic Healing has been rejected in
     Australia on the similar grounds that the combination of the two
     common words having significance in ancient Hinduism lack
     distinctive character and cannot attain the trade mark significance. As
     per the learned counsel for the defendant, this court should also accept
     the same and proceed to hold that the expression Pranic Healing is a
     generic one.
</p>
<p id="p_131">    Learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has argued that there is lot of
     evidence available on record to suggest that Pranic Healing is very
     ancient in nature and has been part of the Yoga Vidya system in ancient
     India. It has been argued that Master himself has admitted and
     acknowledged in all books published by him that he has learnt the
     Pranic Healing techniques from his satguru Lord Mahaguruji Mei Lind
     and his disciples especially Chaham Jing Mei Ling and other spiritual
     teachers. Thus, the plaintiffs contention that the master is the inventor
     of Pranic Healing has no basis in any manner whatsoever

    Learned counsel for the Defendant no. 1 has also argued that the master
     intended to spread the Pranic Healing techniques worldwide and for the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 53 of 149</span>
       same reason granted the authorization to the defendant No.1 to impart
      the said techniques on worldwide basis. It has been argued that once
      the intention of the master was to spread the said techniques and the
      defendant No. 1 was openly carrying on the said teachings within the
      knowledge of the plaintiffs for 14 years, the plaintiffs are now estopped
      from claiming any relief of injunction against the defendant No.1. It
      has been argued that the plaintiff has not properly disclosed this fact
      before this court while asking for the interim orders from this court.
</p>
<p id="p_132">       Learned counsel for the defendant No. 1 has taken objection that the
names of the legal heirs have not been substituted before the trade mark
office in relation to the trade mark granted to the master and thus the
plaintiffs have no locus standi to bring any action before this court and also
are not entitled to any relief in any manner whatsoever.
</p>
<p id="p_133">       All other submissions of the defendant No.1 are common to the ones
stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_134">18.    Learned counsel for the defendant No.2, 11 and 14 have also raised
the objections that this court lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try
the present suit against the said defendants. It has been argued that the
offices of the said defendants are situated outside the jurisdiction of this
court. It has been argued that the answering defendants are not operating
through the defendant No.3 and they are independent from that of the
defendant No.3. Thus, this court lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain and
try the suit against the answering defendants.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 54 of 149</span>
<p id="p_135">     Learned counsel for the defendant No.2 argued that the defendant No. 2
     is the public charitable trust which has been formed by the master and
     the articles of the trust deed make it clear that the trust has the right to
     impart the pranic healing techniques without any permission or
     authorization from the plaintiff. It has been argued that the master
     himself had the intention to spread the teachings of Pranic Healing
     worldwide and that's the reason the defendant No. 2 trust was created.
     The defendant No.2 has the independent right to use and using for
     dissemination of Pranic Healing techniques without any permission
     from the plaintiffs including the legal heirs of Master.
</p>
<p id="p_136">    Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 argued that the defendant No.2
     as a trust was formed in the year 1996 and the deed of declaration of
     the trust of the defendant No. 2 had undergone the amendments from
     time to time during the life time of the master. It has been argued that
     on 29th May, 2002, the authors divested themselves of all the
     proprietory rights in the properties vested in defendant No. 2 on the
     date of the said amendment. The supplementary deed was prepared
     pursuant to the amendment which contained the following clause :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">           "(15)     The authors declare that they have completely and
           finally divested themselves of all proprietary rights in the
           properties and assets of the Trust and also that all the
           income accruing or arising there from has been and shall be
           utilized for the benefit of the Trust and none of the donors
           or their legal heirs, executors, administrators and assignees
           shall ever have or claim any proprietary rights therein".
</blockquote><p id="p_137">       By placing the reliance upon the said clause in the deed of trust, it has
been argued that the said amendments in the deed of the trust clearly go on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 55 of 149</span>
 to show that the plaintiffs being the legal heirs are estopped from claiming
any right against the properties of the trust which is defendant No.2 which
include the imparting of the Pranic Healing techniques. The plaintiffs
objection to carrying out of the object of functioning of the trust is thus
unfounded and suffers from waiver as the plaintiffs predecessor master has
given up any right to object to such use of the techniques by the defendant
No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_138">    Learned counsel for the defendant No.2 has argued that the master was
     clear in his mind while distribution of the rights in relation to charitable
     purposes and commercial purposes. It has been argued that the
     imparting of the Pranic Healing techniques, philosophym esoteric
     science and related activities were never intended to be commercialized
     by the master and thus the same was vested with the defendant No.2 as
     public charitable body. Thus, the plaintiffs objection to the defendant's
     use of the Pranic Healing techniques is baseless as the plaintiffs are
     themselves have no right to use the Pranic Healing techniques
     exclusively.
</p>
<p id="p_139">    Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 has argued that soon after the
     death of the master, the plaintiffs attempted to encash on the goodwill
     of the master by commercializing the Pranic Healing movements in
     India and undermining the role of the defendant No. 2 in relation to the
     said activities. The defendant No. 2 narrates the entire events after the
     death of the master which as per the defendant No.2 suggest that the
     plaintiffs started opening private limited companies in India in order to
     capture the market and commercialize Pranic Healing and claiming



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 56 of 149</span>
       itself to be owner of the intellectual property rights in the same when
      the master had created the defendant No. 2 trust from his own hands in
      order to further the object of imparting the Pranic Healing techniques
      on charitable basis. Thus, the plaintiffs have concealed all this from the
      court and is not entitled to any relief of the interim injunction against
      the defendant No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_140">     Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 has argued that there cannot
      be any monopoly over the term Pranic Healing as the said term has
      ancient origin which can be traced in Indian yoga. As per the learned
      counsel for the defendant No.2, the expression Pranic Healing is Prana
      Vidya which is connected with Pranayama and is commonly found in
      literature relating to Yoga. Accordingly, the said word Pranic Healing
      cannot be monopolized by the plaintiffs exclusively.
</p>
<p id="p_141">       The above were submissions of defendant Nos. 1, 2, 3 advanced by
them separately in the form of oral arguments and written submissions
provided after the conclusion of the hearing in the matter. By raising the
aforementioned submissions, it has been prayed by the defendants that for
different reasons stated in the submissions, this court should allow these
applications filed under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC and proceed to vacate the
interim order dated 14th September, 2011 passed by this court.
</p>
<p id="p_142">19.    I have gone through the plaint, written statement, replication and the
documents filed along with the same. I have also given my careful
consideration to the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the
parties as well as in the written submissions. I shall now proceed to deal




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 57 of 149</span>
 with the various aspects which fall for consideration in the present case as
raised by the parties and shall answer them point wise.
Territorial Jurisdiction
</p><p id="p_143">20.    As the learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 has raised the issue of
lack of territorial jurisdiction of this court to entertain and try the present
suit, I shall first deal with the said objection.
</p><p id="p_144">       Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 has vehemently raised the
objection as to lack of territorial jurisdiction of this court by contending that
the defendant No. 2 is not associated with defendant No. 3 or for that matter
any other defendants and is an independent trust functioning in the territory
of Bangalore and thus this court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain
and try the suit proceedings qua defendant Nos.2, 11 and 14.
</p>
<p id="p_145">21.    It is trite law that for the purpose of testing the jurisdiction of the
court in the civil suit on the basis of the objection which has been taken on
demurer, the court should see the averments made in the plaint and the same
must be assumed to be correct.
</p>
<p id="p_146">       The reference is invited to the Supreme Court dictum of <a href="/doc/474885/" id="a_21">Exphar S.A
&amp; Anr v.Eupharma Laboratories Ltd</a>., (2004) 3 SCC 688 wherein Hon'ble
Justice Ruma Pal (as her lordship then was) speaking for the apex court
observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">       "Besides when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by way of
       demurrer and not at the trial, the objection must proceed on the basis
       that the facts as pleaded by the initiator of the impugned proceedings
       are true. The submission in order to succeed must show that given
       those facts the Court does not have jurisdiction as a matter of law. In
       rejecting a plaint on the ground of jurisdiction, the Division Bench



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 58 of 149</span>
        should have taken the allegations contained in the plaint to be
       correct. However, the Division Bench examined the written
       statement filed by the respondents in which it was claimed that
       the goods were not at all sold within the territorial jurisdiction of
       the Delhi High Court and also that the respondent No. 2 did not
       carry on business within the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court.
       Having recorded the appellants' objections to these factual statements
       by the respondents, surprisingly the Division Bench said:
       "Admittedly the goods are being traded outside India and not being
       traded in India and as such there is no question of infringement of
       trademark within the territorial limits of any Court in India what to of
       Delhi".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">       Apart from the ex-facie contradiction of this statement in the
       judgment itself, the Division Bench erred in going beyond the
       statements contained in the plaint." (Emphasis Supplied).</blockquote>
<p id="p_147">       From the bare reading of the afore quoted observations of the apex
court in Exphar (supra), there seems to be settled position in the law that the
averments made in the plaint have to be seen as correct while testing the
jurisdiction of the court and the court should proceed to return the plaint
only when the court does not have the jurisdiction as a matter of the law and
not when it requires an enquiry into facts beyond to what has been contained
in the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_148">22.    It is equally well settled that the cause of action required for attracting
the jurisdiction of the civil court is also the bundle of material facts which
are required to be seen from the careful and meaningful reading of the plaint
as whole and not merely by considering a singular para in the plaint.
Likewise, for the purposes of testing whether the court lacks territorial
jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit for the purposes of applicability of
Order 7 Rule 10 and 11 CPC, the cause of action for the purposes of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 59 of 149</span>
 jurisdiction has to be culled out from the reading of the plaint in its entirety
and not in isolation.
</p>
<p id="p_149">23.    <a href="/doc/1841885/" id="a_22">In Sopan Sukhdeo Sable &amp; Ors vs. Assistant Charity
Commissioner</a>, it has been observed by the Supreme Court thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">       There cannot be any compartmentalization, dissection, segregation
       and inversions of the language of various paragraphs in the plaint. If
       such a course is adopted it would run counter to the cardinal
       canon of interpretation according to which a pleading has to be
       read as a whole to ascertain its true import. It is not permissible
       to cull out a sentence or a passage and to read it out of the context
       in isolation. Although it is the substance and not merely the form that
       has to be looked into, the pleading has to be construed as it stands
       without addition or subtraction or words or change of its apparent
       grammatical sense. The intention of the party concerned is to be
       gathered primarily from the tenor and terms of his pleadings taken as
       a whole. At the same time it should be borne in mind that no pedantic
       approach should be adopted to defeat justice on hair- splitting
       technicalities.(Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_150">24.    The combined effect of the applicability of principles that the
averments made in the plaint are to be assumed as correct for the purposes
of deciding the application seeking rejection or return of the plaint under
Order 7 Rule 10 and 11 CPC and the plaint has to be read as whole for the
purposes of the culling out of the cause of action for testing the plaint on the
thresholds of Order 7 Rule 10 and 11 CPC, is that given the allegations
contained in the plaint as correct in the entirety, if ex facie the court lacks
territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit proceedings as a matter of
law without enquiry into any further disputed facts, then court must reject or
return the plaint for the presentation before the court of appropriate
jurisdiction. If on the other hand, if the court finds that upon meaningful and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 60 of 149</span>
 fair reading of the plaint, there exists a doubtful case which does not make
the plaint returnable on the mere applicability of law but also enables the
court to indulge in to the disputed question of facts and preference of one
sets of facts over the other beyond the purview of the allegations in the
plaint, then the same very question of the lack of territorial jurisdiction
becomes a mixed question of fact and law and is necessarily required to be
postponed uptil trial.
</p>
<p id="p_151">25.    Let me now read the allegations made in the plaint and evaluate as to
whether the given allegations contained in the plaint, it can be said that this
court lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present suit qua
defendant Nos.2, 11 and 14 or not.
</p>
<p id="p_152">26.    The plaint contains the allegations relating to defendant No.2 in
paragraph 12 and 13 which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       "12. Defendant No.2 is a public charitable trust, which was
       established and registered by the Master on 30 th January, 1996
       in the name of All India Pranic Healing Foundation Trust
       ("AIPHFT"). The defendant No.2 was established to collect
       and hold royalties on behalf of the plaintiff No.3 from all the
       state-level foundations opened under the affiliation of the
       plaintiff No.3. The Mater was the founder chairman of the
       defendant No.2. The name of AIPHFT was changed to All
       India Yoga Vidya Pranic Healing Foundation Trust
       ("AIYVPHFT") on 6th August, 2003. The defendant No.1 and
       defendant No.2 by themselves and through their affiliate
       foundations have been continuously violating the intellectual
       property rights of the Master that are now the property of the
       plaintiffs.

        Master. However, defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 have
       caused the above stated foundations to disassociate itself from
       the plaintiffs and now they operate exclusively under the
       control of the defendant No.2 without due authority from the
       plaintiffs herein. Defendant No.14 is a foundation which has
       been established and is under the control of defendant No.1
       and/or defendant No.2 and is spreading Pranic Healing without
       any authority of the plaintiffs. It is submitted that the
       aforementioned defendant organization/foundations/trusts have
       been conducting Master's courses on Pranic Healing and are
       using the copyright material of the Master as well as the
       trademarks registered in the name of the Master or the plaintiff
       No.1, on a regular basis, without having any legal authority to
       do so. These intellectual property rights have developed upon
       the plaintiff Nos.7 to 10 or assigned to plaintiff No.1. It is
       submitted that at present the plaintiffs are only aware of the said
       defendant institutions which are affiliated to defendant No.1 or
       2, however, there may exist more such institutions that have
       been established by the defendants without any authority from
       the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs crave leave of the Hon'ble Court to
       add such institutions as co-defendants as and when the plaintiffs
       become aware of their existence."
</blockquote><p id="p_153">27.    Thereafter, para 26 enlists several organizations which are teaching
Pranic Healing and techniques which are authorized by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_154">28.    The paragraph 27 of the plaint contains another allegation that the
other organizations which are carrying on Pranic Healing are not authorized
to carry on the courses of Master or to use any other property which is
owned now by the plaintiffs. The said para 27 reads as under:

<p id="p_155"> 29.      In paragraph 55, there are allegations contained in the plaint that the
defendant No. 2 has joined hands with the defendant No. 1 and is operating
Pranic Healing Classes in collusion with each other. The defendant No. 1
and defendant No. 2 have illegally established their own independent state
level foundations in various cities of the country without any due authority
from the plaintiff No. 1 and/ or the plaintiff no. 3. The said para 55 reads as
under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">         "55. It is pertinent to mention that initially defendant No.2
         itself was against the unauthorized and illegal action of

         2009 in violation of licensing agreements, i.e. by charging a
         lower course fee than that authorized. However, on account of
         purported extension of deeds of assignment executed between
         Master and defendant No.2, now defendant No.2 has joined
         hands with the defendant No.1 and is operating Pranic Healing

continuing to function independently and imparting so called teachings of
Pranic Healing. The said paragraph 58 reads as under:

       material (books, audio, video) without due authority from the
       plaintiffs, in violation of licensing agreements and deeds of
       assignment which have been terminated and which have
       expired by efflux of time respectively."
</blockquote><p id="p_158">32.    Thereafter in Para 69 of the plaint contains the cause of action
paragraph containing the allegations that the defendant No.1 and defendant
No.2 are the cause of disassociation of the defendant No. 3 to 14 with the
plaintiffs. The said para 69 reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">       "69. The cause of action in the present suit first arose when
       the defendant No.1, without due permission from the plaintiffs,
       conducted a Kriyashakti class in Chennai on 23rd August, 2009
       through defendant No.8 herein. The cause of action again arose
       when the defendant No.1, in violation of the licensing
       agreements, conducted teacher's training course to train
       instructors to teach Arhatic Prep in Chennai from 11 th - 13th
       December, 2009 organized by defendant No.2 without any

        authority to do so. The cause of action arose further when the
       plaintiff No.2 issued a letter dated 15 th December, 2009 to all
       trustees of the state level Pranic Healing Foundations of India
       clarifying that they have not authorised defendant No.1 or any
       institute under the control of defendant No.1 to run such
       courses. The cause of action further arose when the defendant
       No.2 issued a letter dated 16th January, 2010 announcing to all
       the state level foundations that it works independently in India
       even though the same was established by the Master and was
       affiliated to the plaintiff No.3. The cause of action again arose
       when the defendant No.1 as well as defendant No.2 caused
       defendant No.3 to 14 to disassociate themselves and the same
       cause of action is still continuing. The cause of action further
       arose when defendant No.14 was established. The cause of
       action also arose when the plaintiff No.1 vide its letter dated
       23rd January, 2010 withdrew all its support to the defendant
       No.2. The cause of action also continues because the defendant
       No.2 are issuing certificates without mentioning the words
       "affiliated to World Pranic Healing Foundation, Manila,
       Philippines". The cause of action arose yet again when the
       plaintiff No.2 issued Termination Notice date 17th May, 2010 to
       the defendant No.1 cancelling all the licensing agreements. The
       cause of action further arose when all reconciliation efforts by
       the plaintiffs with the defendants failed. The cause of action is
       a continuing one as the defendant No.1 and the defendant No.2
       are continuing to conduct Pranic Healing Classes in Delhi and
       all over the country without the due authority of the plaintiffs.
       Further, they are on a regular basis conducting seminars,
       issuing and selling books and CD's and carrying out other such
       activities without authority from the plaintiffs. Cause of action
       will continue to arise till such time that the defendants are not
       restrained from carrying on their impugned activities."
</blockquote><p id="p_159">33.    Again in para 70 relating to jurisdiction, there is an averment that this
court has jurisdiction to the entertain the present suit as the defendant No. 2
through defendant No. 3 is carrying on its activities which have been
challenged in the present suit. The said paragraph 70 of the plaint reads as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 65 of 149</span>
 under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">         "70. This Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and
         try the present suit as the defendant No.1 is habitually residing
         at the last known address of the defendant No.1 within the
         territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. This Hon'ble
         Court also has jurisdiction on the grounds that the cause of
         action for filing the present suit has arisen, and that the
         defendant No.2 through defendant No.3 is carrying on its
         activities which have been challenged in the present suit within
         the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court without any
         authority from the plaintiffs herein."
</blockquote><p id="p_160">34.      On the combined reading of the aforementioned allegations in the
form of paragraphs contained in the plaint, it is clear that the plaintiffs have
made several allegations against the defendant No.2 and have clearly stated
that the defendant No. 2 has illegally caused the defendant Nos. 3 to 13 to be
disassociated with the plaintiffs and now the said defendant Nos. 3 to 13 are
clearly operating under the control of the defendant No.2. It has also been
alleged that the defendant No.2 has joined hands with the defendant No.1 by
illegally carrying such offending activities of imparting the Pranic Healing
techniques by themselves and by authorizing others to impart them through
the state level organization.
</p>
<p id="p_161">35.      The said allegations contained in aforementioned paras especially in
para 13 relating to the role of the defendant No.2 have been disputed by the
defendants in their written statements by taking different stands. The
Defendant No.1 do not comment upon the allegations relating to role of the
defendant No.2 with that defendant Nos.3 to 14 in reply to the para 13 in its
written statement. The defendant No.1 also remained silent with its joining
hands with the defendant No.2 while replying the paragraph 55 of the plaint



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 66 of 149</span>
 in its written statement. The defendant No.2 clearly disputes the allegations
that it has any connection with defendant no. 1 as well as the defendant No.3
and other entities and stating to be operating independently of the said
organizations. Likewise, defendant No.11 has taken a stand while replying
to para 13 of the plaint that the defendant No.2 was established with the
blessings and approval of the master directly and as such one of the
functions of the defendant No.2 is to help establishing autonomous
foundations in various states of India and thus not completely ruling out of
the possibility of involvement of the defendant No. 2 in the various state
level foundation signalling towards consistency in the allegations in the
plaint. Likewise the other defendants also have taken different stands in the
written statement.
</p>
<p id="p_162">36.    Under these circumstances, it is clear that there are allegations in the
plaint as to the defendant No.2's participation and involvement in carrying
out the activities by the other defendants which have been disputed by the
defendant No.2 and contested by the other defendants by taking different
stands. Therefore, the contention of the defendant No.2 it is an independent
trust having no relation with the other defendants including defendant Nos.3
to 13 is merely the defence raised by the said defendant No.2 and is thus a
disputed question of fact.
</p>
<p id="p_163">37.    If at this juncture, the plea that the defendant No. 2 is an independent
trust cannot be believed as the disputed question of fact, accordingly, the
assertions made in the cause of action and jurisdiction paragraph that the
defendant No.2 is carrying on their activities through other defendants in
Delhi can also as a matter of necessary consequence become a disputed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 67 of 149</span>
 question of fact dependent upon the conclusive finding as to whether
defendant No.2 is completely an independent trust having no role to play in
the activities carried out by the other defendants who are also carrying
business within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. Therefore, the
objection raised by the defendant on the lack of territorial jurisdiction is a
mixed question of fact and law in the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_164">38.    The different kinds of eventualities occurring when the court is faced
with the issue of jurisdiction for adjudication and the appropriate recourse to
be adopted has been finely laid down by the learned Division Bench of this
court in the case of <a href="/doc/163905/" id="a_23">State Trading Corporation of India Limited v.
Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh (DB</a>), 63 (1996) DLT
971, wherein Hon'ble Justice R.C. Lahoti (as his lordship then was)
observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">       "A court seized of a suit and a prayer for the grant of ad interim relief
       may be faced with a doubt or challenge as to the availability of
       jurisdiction to try the suit in a variety of circumstances. The court has
       to act as under :- (a) In the case of inherent lack of jurisdiction
       apparent on the face of the record, court cannot exercise jurisdiction
       over the suit so as to pass any interlocutory order or grant interim
       relief; (b) If it appears from a bare reading of the plaint that the court
       does not have jurisdiction to try the suit, the plaint itself may be
       returned for presentation to a proper court under Order 7 Rule 10
       CPC; (c) If the suit appears to be barred by any law, the plaint may be
       rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 Civil Procedure Code ; (d) It may be a
       disputed question of fact or law or both- whether court has
       jurisdiction over the suit or not. Such a question if it be a pure
       question of law it can be decided on hearing the parties on a
       preliminary issue. Such a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to
       entertain the -suit being laid by the defendant as a pure question of
       law, it is incumbent upon the Judge to determine that question as a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 68 of 149</span>
        preliminary issue before making absolute the rule issued earlier; (e) If
       the determination of jurisdiction of the Court is a question of fact
       or mixed question of fact and law requiring evidence to be
       adduced before recording a finding, the determination of the
       question may in appropriate, cases be liable to be postponed till
       after the determination of all or several other issues if the
       evidence to be adduced by the parties may be common on the
       issue of jurisdiction and such other issues." (Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_165">39.    Applying the said exposition of law in the instant case, it can be seen
that, on meaningful reading of the averments made in the plaint in relation to
the defendant No.2's role in controlling the affairs and activities of the other
defendant Nos.3 to 13, it cannot be said that ex facie, it is borne out from the
plaint that the defendant No. 2 is a trust operating independently and having
no control over the other defendants. Thus, the defence raised by the
defendant No.2 that it has no role to play or control over the acts of the other
defendants is a disputed question of fact. Thus, this court cannot proceed to
hold that on mere reading of the plaint, this court lacks the territorial
jurisdiction to try the suit against the defendant No. 2 as a matter of law.
Rather, this court has to first arrive at the finding on the disputed question of
fact that the defendant No.2 is independently operating and have no control
over the acts of the other defendants which is fact finding enquiry and then
proceed to evaluate such facts by applying law.
</p>
<p id="p_166">40.    Therefore, the issue of territorial jurisdiction in the instant case as
urged by the defendant No.2 is not a pure question of law which is apparent
from the mere reading of the plaint but is a mixed question of fact and law
and is thus necessarily required to be deferred for trial as the said question
requires consideration and evaluation of the defence of the defendants and
also the applicability of law thereon. However, it is made clear that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 69 of 149</span>
 objection raised on the territorial jurisdiction would be considered at the
time of final hearing of the suit and after framing of issues.                 I.A.
No.20144/2011 filed by defendant No.2 and I.A. No.15808/2012 filed by
defendant No.14 are disposed off.
</p><p id="p_167">CONCEALMENT AND SUPPRESSION OF FACTS
</p><p id="p_168">41.    I shall now proceed to discuss the ground of concealment and
suppression of material facts which has been raised by the Defendants in
order to seek the vacation of the interim order dated 14th September, 2011
passed by this court.
</p><p id="p_169">42.    Learned counsel for the defendants have argued that the plaintiff has
come before this court with unclean hand and have not disclosed the
material facts before this Court in the suit and interim application at the time
of passing of the ex-parte ad interim order dated 14th September, 2011. The
said concealment of the material facts as per the defendants is that the suit
bearing No. 4291/2010 titled as C. Sunderam v. All India Yoga Vidya
Pranic Healing Foundation Trust seeking injunction against the defendant
No.2 (Containing similar prayer as in the present suit) was filed by Mr. S.C.
Sunderam (Trustee of the plaintiff No. 4) before District Court, Bangalore at
page 2 of the documents filed by the defendant No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_170">43.    It has been argued that the Plaintiffs did not get the interim order in
the suit bearing No.4291/2010 before the District Court, Bangalore and
thereafter filed the present suit by intentionally suppressing and concealing
the said suit. It has been argued that the statement contained in para 73 of
the plaint that there is no proceeding instituted similar to the aforesaid suit is
false and is aimed at misleading this court.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 70 of 149</span>
<p id="p_171"> 44.    As per the defendants, the suit against the defendant No.2 on the basis
of similar prayers was pending in Bangalore Civil court in which the court
did not pass any interim order and thus the filing of the present suit which in
effect leads to similar relief without disclosing the pendency of the previous
suit has been deliberately done in order to seek the interim orders from this
court and thus this court should vacate the interim order on the grounds of
concealment of the material facts from this court.
</p>
<p id="p_172">45.    I have gone through the plaint filed by Mr. C. S. Sunderam against the
defendant No. 2 before Bangalore Civil Court . The said suit has averments
in the plaint as to the functioning of the defendant No. 2 trust and also that
the activities of teaching Pranic Healing Techniques by defendant No. 2's
trust. The plaint also contends that the despite the withdrawal of the support
from the institute for Inner Studies Inc and also from World Pranic Healing
Foundation Inc, the defendant trust is actively organizing, conducting and
providing the training programs based on the concepts devised by Grand
Master.
</p>
<p id="p_173">46.    It has been urged in the plaint filed before the Bangalore court that the
Plaintiff Mr. Sundaram in the said case as an author of the defendant's trust
and follower of Grand Master is aggrieved by the actions and illegal
activities of the defendant trust/defendant No.2 in publishing the books
which is contrary to objects of Institute of Inner Studies Inc. and World
Pranic Healing Inc and in advertising on the website regarding holding of
several courses devised by the master without holding a valid license as
opposed to the objective for which it was created.
</p>
<p id="p_174">       The cause of action para of the said plaint provides that the defendant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 71 of 149</span>
 trust by functioning independently and is continuing to act independently as
opposed to the purpose for which it was created is violating the rights of the
plaintiff. The prayer clause seeks a prayer of injunction restraining the
defendant trust/defendant No.2 in the instant case from functioning
independently in India as opposed to the original purposes for which it was
created.
</p>
<p id="p_175">47.    The defendant No. 2 in the instant case seeks to derive the strength
from the prayers made by Mr. Sundaram in the said suit pending before the
Bangalore court wherein the plaintiff seeks to restrain the defendant No.2's
trust from independently functioning in India which include the cause of
action relating to the carrying on Pranic Healing activities in India by the
defendant No.2 as an independent body. As per the defendants, the plaintiff
ought to have disclosed the present suit before this court while seeking
interim orders from this court and the non grant of the interim relief by the
Bangalore City Civil Court as the same could have material bearing for the
purposes of grant or non grant of interim relief by this Court at the ex-parte
ad interim stage. It has been further argued that Mr. Sunderam is the trustee
of the plaintiff No.4 on the date of filing of the suit in City Civil Court in
Bangalore and therefore, the said concealment of the fact in the suit is
deliberate one and has been made with a view to seek advantage over the
defendant No.2 by seeking interim relief.
</p>
<p id="p_176">48.    On the other hand, the plaintiffs respond to the said ground of
concealment by contending that the nature of the civil suit pending before
Bangalore City Civil Court is altogether different which has been filed by
one of the authors of the defendant No.2's trust against the functioning of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 72 of 149</span>
 the defendant No.2 trust though there may exist some kind of similarity with
the plaintiffs grievance. The said fact as per the plaintiffs is not material fact
for the grant of the injunction by this court against the defendants in the
present case. Thus, there is no concealment made by the plaintiffs in the
instant suit.
</p>
<p id="p_177">49.    After considering the submissions advanced by the learned counsel
for the parties and also reading the plaint filed by Mr. Sunderam against the
defendant No.2 and the averments made in the present suit, I am of the view
that there is sufficient disclosure contained in paragraphs 53 to 58 about the
defendant No.2's attempt to function independently to that of the plaintiff
since the year 2009. The suit which has been filed by Mr. Sunderam before
the Bangalore court is on account of the author of the defendant No.2's trust
and as an ex president of the defendant No.2's trust. It is true that some of
the allegations about the functioning of the defendant No.2's trust are
similar to that of the allegations contained in the plaint and the plaintiffs
grievance as stated in the plaint. But the nature of the said suit pending
before City Civil Court in Bangalore filed by one ex trustee and author of
the defendant No.2 about the malfunctioning of defendant No.2 trust against
its object is entirely distinct from the complaint made before this court by
the plaintiffs who claim to be lawful owners of the intellectual property
rights in Pranic Healing. It is also noteworthy to mention that though Mr.
Sunderam is stated to be trustee of the plaintiff No.4 and is alleged to have
deliberately concealed the factum of pendency of the Civil Court in
Bangalore court, is not party to the present suit. The present suit has been
filed by the plaintiffs entities as owners of the Intellectual property rights




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 73 of 149</span>
 vested in them and not as trustees of the defendant No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_178">50.    Under these circumstances, it would be too farfetched to assume that
the plaintiffs have deliberately chosen not to disclose a suit pending before
the Bangalore City Civil Court when the prayer of the said suit is not the
same as the prayers contained in the present suit though somehow
incidentally it may connect with some reliefs against the defendant No.2 as a
matter of necessary consequence. Although, this court felt that there was no
harm on the part of plaintiffs to disclose about the suit filed before the
Bangalore City Civil Court. The said argument of the defendant No.3
relating to concealment of pending suit in Bangalore in the present suit in
order to succeed is calling upon this court to make too many inferences
which are quite convoluted and the same is not plainly coming out of the
reading of the plaint filed before Bangalore City Civil Court along side the
plaint filed in the instant case. Therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiffs
have made any concealment of the material fact as alleged by the defendants
while seeking interim relief against the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_179">51.    Moreover, the disclosures made in paragraph 53 to 58 of the plaint
filed before this court is quite elaborative and commenced from the year
2009 uptill the bringing of the present suit which include the defendant
No.2's attempt to act independently all over India and its refusal to associate
with the plaintiffs. The Bangalore suit was filed in the year 2010 which is
later than 2009 which is the earliest disclosure made in the plaint. Therefore,
it cannot be said that the plaintiffs actually gained anything by not disclosing
the suit pending before the civil court in Bangalore. Thus, the said suit being
entirely of different nature and based on separate cause of action is prima



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 74 of 149</span>
 facie not material for the purposes of the grant or non grant of the interim
relief in the instant case and not even at the ex-parte ad-interim stage.
</p>
<p id="p_180">NON-COMPLIANCE OF PROVISION UNDER ORDER 39 RULE 3 CPC

</p><p id="p_181">52.    Now I shall be proceeding to discuss another ground of non
compliance of the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC as raised by
defendants in order to seek vacation of interim order before adverting to the
grounds on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_182">53.    It has been argued by the learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 that
the plaintiffs have failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of Order
39 Rule 3 CPC within the prescribed period of 7 days from the date of Order
dated 14th September, 2011. It has been argued that the plaintiffs though
have sent a copy of the plaint and interim injunction application to the
Defendant No. 2 herein by way of letter dated 14th September, 2011 which
was received on 17th September, 2011 but the plaintiffs have served the
documents along with the plaint by way of letter dated 20th September, 2011
which was received merely on 24th September, 2011 which was after passing
of the period of the compliance of the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC.
The plaintiffs have also filed the postal receipts and courier receipts
alongwith an affidavit of Ravinder Sharma. The same was filed on 21st
September, 2011 within one week as time granted by the court while passing
the interim order.
</p>
<p id="p_183">54.    It has been further argued that the plaintiffs have failed to comply
with the prescribed mode of service through the delivery of documents by
hand or registered post as per the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC for the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 75 of 149</span>
 purposes of serving the documents filed along with the plaint on 20 th
September, 2011 and have deliberately sent the document through courier.
In view of the same, it has been said that the plaintiffs have not complied
with the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC in the prescribed form.
</p>
<p id="p_184">       Various judgments have been cited at the bar to lay stress on the
proposition that the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC are mandatory in
nature and the same cannot be given a go bye by the court.
</p>
<p id="p_185">55.    I have gone through the affidavit in compliance filed by the plaintiff
along with the annexures containing the particulars of the dispatch of the
records of the present case and have also given careful consideration to the
submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the defendant No.2 on the
ground of the non-compliance of the mandatory provisions of Order 39 Rule
3 CPC by the plaintiff. After considering everything, I am of the opinion that
the defendant No.2 is agitating on the aspect of strict compliance of the
provisions on Order 39 Rule 3 CPC not on the ground that the plaintiffs
have failed to act by supplying the documents as provided in code within the
time prescribed by the court but on the ground that the defendants have
received the documents outside the outer limit of the time period prescribed
by the plaintiff to act upon. It is also not the case of the defendant No. 2 that
in fact the said defendant did not receive the nature of the documents
including the plaint, injunction application and documents as filed by the
plaintiff in the court as the prescribed manner in the code. On the contrary,
the defendant is aggrieved by the later delivery of the list of documents
along with the documents, the steps to serve the same have already been
taken by the plaintiff within the time period of 7 days as provided by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 76 of 149</span>
 court.
</p>
<p id="p_186">56.      I find after going through the records that the plaintiffs have
sufficiently complied with the provisions of the Order 39 Rule 3 CPC within
the period of 7 days. The defendant No.2 is too much insistent on hyper
technicalities in order to just bring the issue when as a matter of fact the
plaintiffs have acted within the period of 7 days of the passing of order and
proceeded to send the entire set of the documents to the defendant No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_187">57.      It is true that the courts have from time to time emphasized the
mandatory nature of the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC and proceeded
to vacate the order by withdrawing the discretion of the injunction exercised
in favour of the plaintiff who is at fault in not complying the provisions of
the Order 39 Rule 3 CPC. Having said that, the court's while withdrawing or
vacating the injunction on the grounds of failure to comply with the
provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC have always taken into consideration the
facts and circumstances of each case. In cases, where it is plain and
unambiguously clear from the record, the courts have discharged or vacated
the injunction on the counts of failure to comply with the provisions Order
39 Rule 3 CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_188">58.      On the other hand, there are line of cases where it is doubtful to
ascribe any motives to the plaintiffs and it seems that the plaintiffs have
acted with due diligence in substantially complying the provisions of Order
39 Rule 3 CPC without causing any real prejudice to the defendants except
enabling the defendants to raise the ground for sake of agitating the same. In
the later kind of cases, the courts have also acted judiciously by not
withdrawing the discretion and vacating the order on the said ground. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 77 of 149</span>
 reason for the same is plain and simple which is that it is true that the
provisions of the Order 39 Rule 3 CPC are mandatory in nature, but the
consequence of its non compliance is not provided explicitly in the code of
civil procedure. It is the judicious approach which the court has to adopt
while seeing the facts of each case in order to infer in which case there exists
violation of the provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC and in which case there
is no such violation in true sense but the ground is urged only on hyper
technicalities.
</p>
<p id="p_189">59.    The said judicious approach which the courts have adopted normally
is by insisting upon the strict compliance of the provisions of Order 39 Rule
3 CPC so that the valuable right of the defendant to know the case filed by
the plaintiff should not be taken away and the defendant may be entitled to
approach the court with earnest opportunity. (Kindly see Agi Logistics,
Ashok Kumar Chadha etc.). But that does not imply that the court is
powerless to exercise the discretion in favour the plaintiff in a given case
where it is seen that there exists a substantive compliance of the provisions
which is not really depriving the right of the defendant to approach the court
at the earnest opportunity.
</p>
<p id="p_190">       This is due to the reason that rules of the procedure are handmaiden to
justice. The inherent power to do complete justice between the parties still
vests with the court. The said power cannot be curtailed by any mandatory
rules of procedure which are all subservient to the powers of the court. In the
present case, once the plaintiffs have fairly acted within 7 days period
prescribed by the court in the order and proceeded to comply with the
provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC and the defendants have received the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 78 of 149</span>
 papers on 24th September, 2011 when the plaintiffs had taken the steps to
send them the documents on 20th September, 2011 which was again within
the period of 7 days prescribed in the code. Thus the mere objection that
about the mode of the service about the registered post to have been adopted
by the plaintiff in order to serve the documents to the defendants when in
fact the plaintiffs took steps in time and defendants got the document is mere
technicality and such strict insistence upon the same in a case when
defendants did get the documents from the courier mode would be too rigid,
technical and pedantic interpretation of the said provision.

LITERARY WORK AND ITS SCOPE OF PROTECTION

As the claim of the plaintiffs relating to copyright in Pranic Healing
Techniques is premised on the copyright in the Literary works/ books and
trade literature authored by the plaintiff's predecessor master, it is first
necessary to comprehend as to what is the scope of the protection in the
original literary work as per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_24">Copyright Act</a>, 1957. The
understanding of the scope of protection of copyright in the literary work

<p id="p_199">66.      All these unsolved questions are necessary to determine the scope or
the ambit of the protection required to be extended to the literary works
under the law of the copyrights are not defined or clarified by the Act but the
said questions and concerns have been attempted to be answered by the
courts from time to time as and when the courts face the propositions which
indulge the courts attention to go into the enquiry of the scope of protection
in relation to the various kinds of the works under the law of the copyright
including the literary work.
</p>
<p id="p_200">67.      The broad propositions which have been laid down by the courts in
India after following the position of law in UK and other common law
countries are enlisted below for the understanding:
</p>
<p id="p_201">      In University of London Press Limited v. University Tutorial Press
       Limited [1916] 2 Ch 601, J. Peterson observed that: The word original
       does not in this connection mean that the work must be the expression
       of original or innovative thought. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_37">Copyright Act</a>s are not concerned



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 84 of 149</span>
      with the originality of ideas, but with the expression of thought. The
     originality which is required relates to the expression of thoughts. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_38">But
     the Act</a> doesn't require that the expression must be in the original or
     novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another's work-
     that it should originate from the author. (The said definition of
     originality has been followed by the Privy Council in India in the case
     of <a href="/doc/1257788/" id="a_39">Macmillan and Company Limited vs. K. and J. Cooper</a>. AIR 1924
     Privy Council 175, which is often quoted in various judgments in India)

    In the case of <a href="/doc/1257788/" id="a_40">Macmillan vs. Cooper</a> (supra), the learned Privy Council
     had also observed that no precise definition can be given the amount of
     skill, labour and judgment required to constitute originality in the work,
     it is question of fact and degree which has to be evaluated from case to
     case basis. In the words of privy council, it was observed thus:
</p>
<p id="p_202">        "What is the precise amount of the knowledge, labour, judgment or
        literary skill or taste which the author of any book or other
        compilation must bestow upon its composition in order to acquire
        copyright in it within the meaning of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_41">Copyright Act</a> of 1911
        cannot be defined in precise terms. In every ease it must depend
        largely on the special facts of that case, and must in each case be
        very much a question of degree. But their Lordships have no
        hesitation in holding that there is no evidence in the present case to
        establish that an amount of these several things has been applied to
        the composition of the text of the appellants' book, as distinguished
        from the notes contained in it, to entitle them to the copyright of it.
        As to the notes it is altogether different. Their Lordships do not take
        the view that these notes are trifling in their nature or are
        useless."                                     (Emphasis supplied)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 85 of 149</span>
     In the case of <a href="/doc/1062099/" id="a_42">Eastern Book Company v. DB Modak</a>, 2008(1) SCC 1,
     The Supreme Court again revisited the entire case law on the subject of
     the originality and proceeded to observed thus:
</p>
<p id="p_203">        "The exercise of the skill and judgment required to produce the work
        is trivial and is on account of the labour and the capital invested and
        could be characterized as purely a work which has been brought
        about by putting some amount of labour by the appellants. Although
        for establishing a copyright, the creativity standard applies is not
        that something must be novel or non-obvious, but some amount
        of creativity in the work to claim a copyright is required. It does
        require a minimal degree of creativity. Arrangement of the facts or
        data or the case law is already included in the judgment of the court.

    In the case of <a href="/doc/1734007/" id="a_43">R.G. Anand v. Delux Films</a>, 1979 SCR (1) 218, The
     Hon'ble Supreme Court proceeded to lay down some tests after
     analyzing the case laws decided in UK, India and US which somehow
     define the scope of the protection of the copyright in law in general.
     The said propositions are:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_88">         I.    There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, themes,
         plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in
         such cases is confined to the form, manner and arrangement and
         expression of the idea by title author of the copy-righted work.
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 86 of 149</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_89">          II.   Where the same idea is being developed in a different manner,
         it is manifest that the source being common, similarities are bound
         to occur. In such a case the courts should determine whether or not
         the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the
         mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the
         defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted
         work with some variations here and there it would amount to
         violation of the copyright. In other words, in order to be actionable
         the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads
         to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_90">         III. One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not
         there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,
         spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is
         clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the
         subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">         IV. Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated
         differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new
         work, no question of violation of copyright arises.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_92">         V. Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two
         works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which
         negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences
         appearing in the two words are clearly incidental no infringement of
         the copyright comes into existence.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                            Page 87 of 149</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">          VI. As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must
         be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various
         tests laid down by decided cases.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">         VII. Where however the question is of the violation of the copyright
         of a stage play by a film producer or a Director the task of the
         plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy. It is manifest that
         unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective, wider
         field and a bigger background where the defendants can by
         introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion
         different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has
         expressed the Idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film gets a
         totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the
         original play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_204">68.    The said tests laid down by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra)
throw some light on the significant aspect of no protection of idea and but
only to the form of expression under the laws of copyrights and also defines
the aspects relating to substantial nature of copying and all other necessary
tests required to prove infringement in the case of copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_205">     There are other cases which have been decided in India relating to
      copyright infringement but broadly the said cases take the similar line
      of reasons as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of RG Anand
      (Supra), Eastern Book (supra) and Privy council in the case of
      MacMillan (supra) and proceed to decide the cases by describing the
      kind of the originality required for conferring copyright in the work and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 88 of 149</span>
       then sometimes deciding the question of infringements and sometimes
      holding that the defendants have merely taken an idea and not the
      manner of expression.
</p>
<p id="p_206">69.    The said propositions of law laid by the courts in India till date are
helpful in understanding the concepts like originality, substantial nature of
copying required for infringement, non availability of the protection to ideas
but only the manner of expression of ideas which are not provided under the
written law i.e. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_44">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 and rightly so as they are more or less
question of facts and degree present in each case.
</p>
<p id="p_207">70.    The enquiry of originality of the work from the author and passing the
test of originality in each case relating to copyright infringement where it is
a disputed question is a basic thrust on which the copyright claim of the
party rests. The said concept of originality has an immediate nexus with
another limb of enquiry which is significant in each case that is the
distinction between the idea and expression of an idea. This is due to the
reason that the copyright vests not in an idea but in an original expression of
an idea. In short, what is protected in the copyright law is not merely an idea
but the original way or manner of presentation of an idea.
</p>
<p id="p_208">71.    We have seen cases in India as stated above where the courts have
been able to identify the difference between ideas and expression promptly
without any overlap between the two like plots, themes of the play as against
the manner of the presentation of the plays where such distinctions are
clearly evident without any further enquiry. On the other hand, there are the
cases where the courts have to draw the line between the ideas and
expression of an idea by themselves by indulging into the depth enquiry into


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 89 of 149</span>
 the work in order to identify first as to what may constitute idea in a
particular work and what is an expression of idea where the originality
resides in order to delineate the scope of the protection of work and
dissecting it from the ideas. Such a kind of enquiry by courts in copyright
cases is more commonly known as idea and expression dichotomy.
</p>
<p id="p_209">72.    The said concept of idea expression problem has been evolved firstly
by the courts in US and recently has also been recognized by the courts in
UK. India is still in the process of accepting the said proposition as the
courts are in the process of facing the factual situations wherein the dividing
line between idea and expression is blurred though some cases in India shed
some light on the subject by quoting the international cases relating to idea
expression problems but do not clearly spell out the problem relating to idea
and expression in so many words as laid down in the said judgments in US
and in UK.
</p>
<p id="p_210">73.    I find that this case is an opportune time to discuss in detail the said
concept of idea and expression dichotomy as the present case seek to
prevent the implementation of facts and narrations stated in the book which
are Asanas of Yoga on the premise that the said facts and narrations,
descriptions of Asanas and techniques stated in Books authored by master
are his copyright and thus the performance of the said works in physical
form actions or performing such Pranic Healing Yoga Asanas must result in
the copyright infringement. On the first blush, the argument is seemingly
convincing considering the provisions of the Act and in the manner they are
worded so as to include the performance of the work in public or
communication of the work to the public unguided by the exposition of law



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 90 of 149</span>
 relating to idea and expression. But once the said argument is tested from
the glasses of idea expression distinction which sometimes the courts have
to make in a given case, the answer becomes clearer and the shadow of
doubt which exists in the mind proceeds to obliterate.
</p>
<p id="p_211">74.      Such kind of Idea expression problems often arises in the cases where
the protection is sought for the derivative nature of the works or in cases
where the work contains the historical facts collated from history or ancient
times or in cases where work consists of methods of construction, any
theorems, principles which are common place or scientific principles or
experiments touching the patents which are sought to be protected under the
guise of original works of authorship. In all such cases, the court makes fair
attempt to draw a line between what is an idea and expression within the
same work by testing the originality quotient of the work.
</p>
<p id="p_212">75.      The idea expression problem faced by the courts has been aptly
explained by the House of Lords in UK recently in the case of Designers
Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd., [2001] F.S.R. 11, by Lord
Hoffman in his speech in the context of artistic works. In the words of Lord
Hoffman, it was observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">      "It is often said, as Morritt L.J. said in this case, that copyright subsists
      not in ideas but in the form in which the ideas are expressed. The
      distinction between expression and ideas finds a place in the Agreement
      on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
      ([1994] O.J. L336/213 ), to which the United Kingdom is a party (see
      <a href="/doc/501118/" id="a_45">Article 9.2 : "</a>Copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to
      ideas ..." ). Nevertheless, it needs to be handled with care. What does
      it mean? As Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone said in L.B. (Plastics) Ltd
      v. Swish Products Ltd [1979] R.P.C. 551 at 629 , "it all depends on
      what you mean by 'ideas'".                          (Emphasis Supplied)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                            Page 91 of 149</span>
    24 Plainly there can be no copyright in an idea which is merely in the
   head, which has not been expressed in copyrightable form, as a
   literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, but the distinction
   between ideas and expression cannot mean anything so trivial as
   that. On the other hand, every element in the expression of an artistic
   work (unless it got there by accident or compulsion) is the expression of
   an idea on the part of the author. It represents her choice to paint stripes
   rather than polka dots, flowers rather than tadpoles, use one colour and
   brush technique rather than another, and so on. The expression of these
   ideas is protected, both as a cumulative whole and also to the extent to
   which they form a "substantial part" of the work. Although the term
   "substantial part" might suggest a quantitative test, or at least the
   ability to identify some discrete part which, on quantitative or
   qualitative grounds, can be regarded as substantial, it is clear upon
   the authorities that neither is the correct test. Ladbroke (Football) Ltd
   v. William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 W.L.R. 273 establishes that
   substantiality depends upon quality rather than quantity (Lord Reid at
   276, Lord Evershed at 283, Lord Hodson at 288, Lord Pearce at 293),
   and there are numerous authorities which show that the "part" which is
   regarded as substantial can be a feature or combination of features of the
   work, abstracted from it rather than forming a discrete part. That is what
   the judge found to have been copied in this case. Or to take another
   example, the original elements in the plot of a play or novel may be a
   substantial part, so that copyright may be infringed by a work which
   does not reproduce a single sentence of the original. If one asks what
   is being protected in such a case, it is difficult to give any
   answer except that it is an idea expressed in the copyright
   work.                                             (Emphasis Supplied)
   25 My Lords, if one examines the cases in which the distinction
   between ideas and the expression of ideas has been given effect, I
   think it will be found that they support two quite distinct
   propositions. The first is that a copyright work may express certain
   ideas which are not protected because they have no connection with
   the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic nature of the work. It is on
   this ground that, for example, a literary work which describes a system
   or invention does not entitle the author to claim protection for his
   system or invention as such. The same is true of an inventive concept
   expressed in an artistic work. However striking or original it may be,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 92 of 149</span>
       others are (in the absence of patent protection) free to express it in
      works of their own: see Kleeneze Ltd v. D.R.G. (U.K.) Ltd [1984]
      F.S.R. 399 . The other proposition is that certain ideas expressed by a
      copyright work may not be protected because, although they are
      ideas of a literary, dramatic or artistic nature, they are not original,
      or so commonplace as not to form a substantial part of the work.
      <a href="/doc/1147483/" id="a_46">Kenrick &amp; Co. v. Lawrence &amp; Co</a>. (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 99 , is a well-
      known example. It is on this ground that the mere notion of combining
      stripes and flowers would not have amounted to a substantial part of the
      plaintiff's work. At that level of abstraction, the idea, though expressed in
      the design, would not have represented sufficient of the author's skill and
      labour as to attract copyright protection."         (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_96">      99. Upon the meaningful reading of Lord Hoffman's speech in the case
      of Designers Guild (supra), I find para 25 of the judgment summarizes
      the idea expressions problem faced and recognized by the courts in
      England with clarity. Thus, it would not be out of place to state there may
      arise sometimes the cases or instances where within a work, what is
      appears to be an expression because of its presence in the work as a
      whole is merely an idea and the protectable area which is the manner of
      expression lies somewhere else. The courts have attempted to distinguish
      such expressions of idea which are unrelated to copyright which in the
      opinion of the court are falling within the broader ambit of idea itself
      from that of the expression of ideas where originality resides in copyright
      sense. The former are not protected but the later do. This is emerging
      from the Speech of Lord Hoffman in Designers Guild (supra).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_97">      100. The reading of the Lord Hoffman's speech in para 25 also makes it
      clear that this kind of problem more than often arises in cases where
      literary work describes a system or invention as such which supports my
      conclusions above as it touches aspect between the patents and copyright
      and sometimes raises the concern relating to discovery of fact vis a vis
      creation of fact and challenges the originality quotient of the work."
</blockquote><p id="p_213">76.      As we have now seen the position of law in UK which recognize this
concept of non protectable areas within the same work itself due to lack of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                            Page 93 of 149</span>
 originality and calling them as mere ideas or unprotectable expressions
unrelated to copyright as against the protectable manner of expression of an
idea, It is now time to understand the true import of such line of cases more
closely where such idea expression problem had in fact fallen for
consideration in the context of literary works and compilations so as to
discern the reasoning given by the courts in such circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_214">77.      The celebrated case on the subject and most likely the starting point of
the debate of idea expression problem in the context of Literary works has
been decided by US Supreme Court in Baker vs. Seldon, 101 U.S. 99 in the
year 1880. It is noteworthy to first mention the facts of the said case which
are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_98">      "Charles Selden, the testator of the complainant in this case, in the year
      1859 took the requisite steps for obtaining the copyright of a book,
      entitled "Selden's Condensed Ledger, or Book-keeping Simplified," the
      object of which was to exhibit and explain a peculiar system of book-
      keeping. In 1860 and 1861, he took the copyright of several other books,
      containing additions to and improvements upon the said system. The bill
      of complaint was filed against the defendant, Baker, for an alleged
      infringement of these copyrights. The latter, in his answer, denied that
      Selden was the author or designer of the books, and denied the
      infringement charged, and contends on the argument that the matter
      alleged to be infringed is not a lawful subject of copyright.
      The parties went into proofs, and the various books of the complainant,
      as well as those sold and used by the defendant, were exhibited before
      the examiner, and witnesses were examined on both sides. A decree was
      rendered for the complainant, and the defendant appealed.
      The book or series of books of which the complainant claims the
      copyright consists of an introductory essay explaining the system of
      book-keeping referred to, to which are annexed certain forms or blanks,
      consisting of ruled lines, and headings, illustrating the system and
      showing how it is to be used and carried out in practice. This system



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                           Page 94 of 149</span>
       effects the same results as book-keeping by double entry; but, by a
      peculiar arrangement of columns and headings, presents the entire
      operation, of a day, a week, or a month, on a single page, or on two pages
      facing each other, in an account-book. The defendant uses a similar plan
      so far as results are concerned; but makes a different arrangement of the
      columns, and uses different headings. If the complainant's testator had
      the exclusive right to the use of the system explained in his book, it
      would be difficult to contend that the defendant does not infringe it,
      notwithstanding the difference in his form of arrangement; but if it be
      assumed that the system is open to public use, it seems to be equally
      difficult to contend that the books made and sold by the defendant are a
      violation of the copyright of the complainant's book considered merely as
      a book explanatory of the system.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">      Where the truths of a science or the methods of an art are the common
      property of the whole world, and author has the right to express the one,
      or explain and use the other, in his own way. As an author, Selden
      explained the system in a particular way. It may be conceded that Baker
      makes and uses account-books arranged on substantially the same
      system; but the proof fails to show that he has violated the copyright of
      Selden's book, regarding the latter merely as an explanatory work; or that
      he has infringed Selden's right in any way, unless the latter became
      entitled to an exclusive right in the system."
</blockquote><p id="p_215">78.      Given the aforementioned facts in hand, the Supreme Court of US
decided the question as to the scope and the extent of the protection which
can be given to a book or a literary work describing the process of well
known book keeping or methods of accounting. In the process of deciding
the present case, the Supreme Court has made some very significant
observations which describe the fundamentals of the copyright protection in
simplistic words. One such observation is that the protection which is
conferred by the copyright is the book containing the manner of the
expression of the art and not the art described in the book. Even if the book
illustrate the process of the book keeping or accounting in detail, the
similarity in said process of book keeping in another book is due to the art or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 95 of 149</span>
 process described in the book which is common place cannot be exclusively
appropriated by the author. In the words of the Supreme Court, it was
observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_100">        "There is no doubt that a work on the subject of book-keeping,
        though only explanatory of well-known systems, may be the
        subject of a copyright; but, then, it is claimed only as a book.
        Such a book may be explanatory either of old systems, or of an
        entirely new system; and, considered as a book, as the work of an
        author, conveying information on the subject of book-keeping,
        and containing detailed explanations of the art, it may be a very
        valuable acquisition to the practical knowledge of the
        community. But there is a clear distinction between the book, as
        such, and the art which, it is intended to illustrate. The mere
        statement of the proposition is so evident, that it requires hardly
        any argument to support it. The same distinction may be
        predicated of every other art as well as that of book-keeping. A
        treatise on the composition and use of medicines, be they old or new;
        on the construction and use of ploughs, or watches, or churns; or on
        the mixture and application of colors for painting or dyeing; or on the
        mode of drawing lines to produce the effect of perspective, -- would
        be the subject of copyright; but no one would contend that the
        copyright of the treatise would give the exclusive right to the art or
        manufacture described therein."              (Emphasis Supplied).
</blockquote><p id="p_216">79.    The reading of the aforenoted illuminating observations of Supreme
Court of US, it is clear that even if the book describes in detail the new and
the old processes or system and the same may be very valuable to the
acquisition of the practical knowledge of the community. The mere fact, it
describes the art does not imply that the art described in the book becomes
the proprietary interest of the author. It is only the manner in which it is
described is required to be protected by preventing the reproduction of the
substantial part of the book and not the performance of the process provided
in the book in practice.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 96 of 149</span>
<p id="p_217"> 80.    Thereafter, the Supreme Court of US had further noted that the
novelty of the description of the process in the book is also immaterial as it
is merely an assertion of the person seeking protection, the actual testing of
the novelty in the subject matter is the domain of the patent office and not
the copyright office. The court then gave a fine distinction between the
patents and copyrights and the problem which lies with the extension of the
monopoly to the books describing the process to the process itself is that it
creates a monopoly which is akin to that of the patents to the author of the
book under the guise of copyright without the author having any patent over
the said process. This has been explained by the Supreme Court of US in the
following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">       "The copyright of the book, if not pirated from other works,
       would be valid without regard to the novelty, or want of novelty,
       of its subject-matter. The novelty of the art or thing described or
       explained has nothing to do with the validity of the copyright. To
       give to the author of the book an exclusive property in the art
       described therein, when no examination of its novelty has ever
       been officially made, would be a surprise and a fraud upon the
       public. That is the province of letters-patent, not of copyright.
       The claim to an invention or discovery of an art or manufacture
       must be subjected to the examination of the Patent Office before
       an exclusive right therein can be obtained; and it can only be
       secured by a patent from the government. (Emphasis supplied)
       The difference between the two things, letters-patent and
       copyright, may be illustrated by reference to the subjects just
       enumerated. Take the case of medicines. Certain mixtures are
       found to be of great value in the healing art.If the discoverer
       writes and publishes a book on the subject (as regular physicians
       generally do), he gains no exclusive right to the manufacture and
       sale of the medicine; he gives that to the public. If he desires to
       acquire such exclusive right, he must obtain a patent for the
       mixture as a new art, manufacture, or composition of matter. He



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 97 of 149</span>
        may copyright his book, if he pleases; but that only secures to him
       the exclusive right of printing and publishing his book. So of all
       other inventions or discoveries."           (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_218">81.    It is noteworthy to mention that the reference to the case of Baker
vs. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1879) is invited and the case has been discussed in
detail not to explain the general proposition of law that there cannot be any
copyright in ideas but exists in expression of an idea. But, the reliance has
been placed on the said decision in order to demonstrate that in cases
involving books and literary works describing and defining useful arts,
medicines, scientific principles and historical events, the scope of protection
in relation to copyright lies in the manner of language employed in the book
in order to describe the said art and selection and arrangement of the
incidents and overall compilation of the work and not in the art or the
performance of art itself howsoever new or unique it may be.
</p><p id="p_219">82.    By reading the statement of law in Baker (Supra), one can say that the
statement of law that the copyright vests in literary work in the language
employed in order to describe the art and not the art itself is no different
from the proposition that the copyright lies in expression of an idea and not
the idea itself. Apparently, the comparison between the two propositions is
correct and they are akin to each other but the only point of difference which
distinguishes the former from the latter is that in the former one, it is the
court which has deduced after judicially applying the mind what is an idea
and what is an expression. However, the latter is simply a general
proposition of law.
</p><p id="p_220">83.    This can be explained in more detail if one takes an example of a
book/literary work describing the useful art or principle of science. In such



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 98 of 149</span>
 a case, the overall book describes the art step by step and the ways to
perform the said art in the words of author. Now, if one has to find out what
can be idea and what can be an expression of an idea, it can be said that the
way the author has described the art is not an idea but the expression of an
idea and therefore the manner of performing the art should also be given
protection due to the unique expression of art or principle of science
mentioned in the book and the idea is merely the plot of the book which is
the book on scientific principle/art but the manner indicated in the book for
performing the art is unique to the author and thus deserve protection.
</p><p id="p_221">84.    The said argument is quite attractive and if a person goes merely by
the general proposition that there can be a copyright in an expression of an
idea and not an idea itself, then it is too confusing to understand as to
whether the description of a scientific principle or performance of art in the
manner indicated by the author is an expression or an idea. But, if one goes
by the former proposition which is that the copyright vests only in the
language employed to describe the art and not the art itself, it becomes
clearer that in cases where there are literary works describing scientific
principle, useful arts or compiles any pre-existing data though the
description of the art may be unique or novel in the book and is seemingly
an expression of an idea but actually the same is merely an idea and not the
expression. Thus, in some cases like in Baker (Supra) the boundaries of
idea get expanded in order to cover within its ambit not merely the general
plot of the book but also the descriptions contained in the book relating to
the said art and the extension of boundaries of an idea delimits the scope of
expression of an idea by confining the contours of protection within the four
corners of reproduction of the said works in substantial form and ruling out



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 99 of 149</span>
 any possibility of giving protection towards performance of the said art as
described in the book.
</p><p id="p_222">85.    In this way, the proposition explained in Baker (Supra) that there
cannot be any copyright in the art described in the book but copyright
resides in reproducing the said book in material form in the form of
language employed, selection and arrangement has in-depth meaning and
the court in the said case has balanced out the protection vis-à-vis the public
domain by identifying the boundaries of an idea and expression of an idea.
</p><p id="p_223">86.    The said case of Baker (Supra) has been decided in 1880 by the
Supreme Court of US laying down some very significant propositions
relating to identifying the idea and the expression and also the interplay of
conferring copyright in the useful arts and scientific principles with that of
patents and how the consequences of giving protection to the useful arts
described in the books can lead to intrusion in the domain of patent regime.
</p><p id="p_224">87.    Thus, the case of Baker (Supra) was one of its own kind where it was
difficult for the court to identify the idea and the expression of an idea.
Such kind of cases have also gained the attention of the courts in US as well
as in UK and the courts have time and again came to the similar conclusion
by identifying the ideas and the expressions of an idea in a given case
considering its own typical facts and circumstances.
</p><p id="p_225">88.    Similar question again came up before the Supreme Court of US more
than 100 years later in the year 1991 in the case of Feist Publications Inc Vs
Rural Telephone Services Company, 499 U.S. 340 (1991) wherein the court
was concerned with the question relating to the scope and the extent of
protection of copyright in the compilation of pre-existing data in the form of
telephone directory. The question which arose before the court was as to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 100 of 149</span>
 what is the scope and the extent of protection in respect of compilations of
the work more particularly the telephone directory and whether the
copyright in compilation extends to the facts stated in compilation or merely
vests in arrangement and selection of the complied work. The Court after
placing reliance on Baker (Supra) decision had proceeded to observe that
the facts stated in the compilations are merely an idea as they lack
originality and the expression of an idea is merely arrangement and the
selection which is the manner of presentation. In the words of the court it
was observed thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">       "[15] It is this bedrock principle of copyright that mandates the
       law's seemingly disparate treatment of facts and factual
       compilations. "No one may claim originality as to facts." Id., §
       2.11[A], p. 2-157. This is because facts do not owe their origin to
       an act of authorship. The distinction is one between creation and
       discovery: the first person to find and report a particular fact has
       not created the fact; he or she has merely discovered its existence.
       To borrow from Burrow-Giles, one who discovers a fact is not its
       "maker" or "originator." 111 U.S., at 58. "The discoverer merely finds
       and records." Nimmer § 2.03[E]. Census-takers, for example, do not
       "create" the population figures that emerge from their efforts; in a
       sense, they copy these figures from the world around them. Denicola,
       Copyright in Collections of Facts: A Theory for the Protection of
       Nonfiction Literary Works, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 516, 525 (1981)
       (hereinafter Denicola). Census data therefore do not trigger
       copyright because these data are not "original" in the
       constitutional sense. Nimmer [p*348] § 2.03[E]. The same is true
       of all facts -- scientific, historical, biographical, and news of the
       day. "They may not be copyrighted and are part of the public
       domain available to every person." Miller, supra, at 1369.
       [16] Factual compilations, on the other hand, may possess the
       requisite originality. The compilation author typically chooses which
       facts to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the
       collected data so that they may be used effectively by readers. These

        choices as to selection and arrangement, so long as they are made
       independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of
       creativity, are sufficiently original that Congress may protect
       such compilations through the copyright laws. Nimmer §§ 2.11[D],
       3.03; Denicola 523, n. 38. Thus, even a directory that contains
       absolutely no protectible written expression, only facts, meets the
       constitutional minimum for copyright protection if it features an
       original selection or arrangement. See Harper &amp; Row, 471 U.S., at

copyright in the factual compilation is thin and the subsequent compiler
remains free to use facts contained in another's work to aid in preparing and
competing work so long as he does not copy the selection and the
arrangement done by the previous author. It was observed thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_104">       "[18] This inevitably means that the copyright in a factual compilation
       is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler
       remains free to use the facts contained in an another's publication to
       aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work
       does not feature the same selection and arrangement. As one
       commentator explains it: "No matter how much original authorship
       the work displays, the facts and ideas it exposes are free for the
       taking . . . . The very same facts and ideas may be divorced from
       the context imposed by the author, and restated or reshuffled by
       second comers, even if the author was the first to discover the
       facts or to propose the ideas."Ginsburg 1868."(Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_227">90.    Again, the US Supreme Court in Feist (Supra) acknowledged the idea
expression dichotomy limits the scope of protection in fact based works by
confining its counter only to reproduction right and not extending to the
performance of the facts contained in the said work. This has been explained
in para 20 in the following manner:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_105">       "[20] This Court has long recognized that the fact-expression
       dichotomy limits severely the scope of protection in fact-based works.

<blockquote id="blockquote_106">        More than a century ago, the Court observed: "The very object of
       publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to communicate to
       the world the useful knowledge which it contains. But this object
       would be frustrated if the knowledge could not be used without
       incurring the guilt of piracy of the book." Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S.
       99, 103 (1880). We reiterated this point in Harper &amp; Row:
       "No author may copyright facts or ideas. The copyright is limited
       to those aspects of the work -- termed 'expression' -- that display the
       stamp of the author's originality.

       original contributions." 471 U.S., at 547-548 (citation omitted)."
</blockquote><p id="p_228">91.    Lastly, the court has also laid down the test relating to scope of
protection in the cases relating to compilations of work which as per the
court is selection, coordination and arrangement of facts and the said
selection, coordination and arrangement should be done in such a way so as
to render whole of the work as original. This has been explained by the court
in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">        "[39] The key to the statutory definition is the second requirement. It
       instructs courts that, in determining whether a fact-based work is an
       original work of authorship, they should focus on the manner in which
       the collected facts have been selected, coordinated, and arranged. This
       is a straightforward application of the originality requirement. Facts
       are never original, so the compilation author can claim originality, if
       at all, only in the way the facts are presented. To that end, the statute
       dictates that the principal focus should be on whether the selection,
       coordination, and arrangement are sufficiently original to merit
       protection.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_110">       [40] Not every selection, coordination, or arrangement will pass
       muster. This is plain from the statute. It states that, to merit protection,
       the facts must be selected, coordinated, or arranged "in such a way" as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                            Page 103 of 149</span>
        to render the work as a whole original. This implies that some "ways"
       will trigger copyright, but that others will not. See Patry 57, and n. 76.
       Otherwise, the phrase "in such a way" is meaningless and Congress
       should have defined "compilation" simply as "a work formed by the
       collection and assembly of preexisting materials or data that are
       selected, coordinated, or arranged." That Congress did not do so is
       dispositive. In accordance with "the established principle that a court
       should give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,"
       Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 109-110 (1990) (internal
       quotations omitted), we conclude that the statute envisions that there
       will be some fact-based works in which the selection, coordination,
       and arrangement are not sufficiently original to trigger copyright
       protection."
</blockquote><p id="p_229">92.    From the reading of Feist (Supra), it is clear that the position of law
starting from Baker (Supra) uptill Feist (Supra) remains the same and
consistent when it comes to confer protection in relation to fact based works
or the works which are derived from pre-existing data, scientific principles
or arts which is to identify the limits of protection by finding out what is an
idea in a given case and what is an expression by asking the question as to
where the originality in copyright sense resides. The originality in copyright
sense would mean the hard work, labour and skill extended truly by author
in relation to creativity and not in relation to innovation done in respect of
deriving some principle or method.
</p><p id="p_230">93.    Post Feist (Supra) decision, there are number of cases which have
been decided by the US Court in respect of similar principle. The said
decisions of the courts remained consistent in accordance with Feist (Supra)
and the rule of law laid down in Baker (Supra).
</p><p id="p_231">94.    After understanding the rule of law laid down in Baker (Supra) and
Feist (Supra) decision, it is beyond the cavil of any doubt that in cases
relating to literary work describing useful arts, science or based upon pre-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 104 of 149</span>
<p id="p_232"> existing data and facts, the copyright shall be extended only to the manner of
description of the said art principles or facts in the language employed by
the author and it is substantial copying by the infringer and not in the facts in
generality.
</p><p id="p_233">95.    After having understood Feist (Supra) decision and rule of law in
Baker (Supra) it requires no further elaboration of the said principle of law
stated above but still it is pertinent to point out that recently the Court of
Appeal in UK in the year 2007 in a case titled as Baigent &amp; Leigh vs. The
Random House Group Limited, (2007) FSR 24 has also reiterated the
similar principle by stating that though the historical research takes time,
effort and skill to collect material for a book but the said time, skill and
effort do not make the pre-existing facts in the history copyrightable and the
only expression of an idea in the form of language in which work is
composed along with selection arrangement and compilation of the research
material is protected and not a historical research in itself.
</p><p id="p_234">96.    The case of Baigent (Supra) was concerning the copyright
infringement alleged by the plaintiff against the famous book writer Dan
Brown in his book titled as Da Vinci Code wherein it has been alleged that
book contained certain portion of historical research done by the plaintiff in
relation to the life history of Jesus Christ according to which he was married
to Mary Magdalene and she also had a child of Jesus Christ in her womb
when she fled away from Jerusalem to France where there is an evidence of
offspring of Jesus Christ available in history. It has been alleged that the said
facts narrated by the defendants in is famous book are reproduction of the
expression of an idea created by the plaintiff in its literature. The English
Court of Appeal countering the said allegation observed thus:-
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                              Page 105 of 149</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_111">        "156 The literary copyright exists in HBHG by reason of the skill and
       labour expended by the claimants in the original composition and
       production of it and the original manner or form of expression of the
       results of their research. Original expression includes not only the
       language in which the work is composed but also the original
       selection, arrangement and compilation of the raw research
       material. It does not, however, extend to clothing information,
       facts, ideas, theories and themes with exclusive property rights, so
       as to enable the claimants to monopolise historical research or
       knowledge and prevent the legitimate use of historical and
       biographical material, theories propounded, general arguments
       deployed, or general hypotheses suggested (whether they are sound
       or not) or general themes written about."    (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_235">97.    After reading the judgment of Baigent (Supra) decided by the court of
appeal, it is clear that the copyright protection accorded to the fact based
works is limited only to language employed in respect of describing the
incidents in the work and also the selection, arrangement and compilation of
data and not in the historical facts itself and the said principle again is a
reiteration of rule of law in Baker (Supra) and Feist (Supra) extending the
said principle to historical works.
</p><p id="p_236">98.    The overall effect of the elaborated discussion done above is that
whenever the protection on the premise of copyright is sought for in relation
to books and literature describing the useful art, principle, historical fact or
events or mode of performing ancient exercise or any other process for that
matter, the copyright protection shall vest in the language employed to
describe in the art in the book, the selection and arrangement of the facts or
Asanas and their presence in the sequential manner in the book wherein the
hard work, skill, labour has been expended by the master in doing so and the
reproduction right to this shall be available exclusively to the master or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 106 of 149</span>
 persons deriving title from him. However, the protection shall not be
extended to include the monopoly right over the performance of the said
Asanas of Yoga or Pranic Healing on the strength of the manner of the
expression as stated in book as doing the same would be giving the
monopoly right to the art or technique itself which is available in public
domain from time immemorial which is also evident from the books
available on record authored by Swami Ramachakra since 1906.
</p><p id="p_237">99.    Even assuming the argument of the plaintiff is to be correct that there
exists certain kind of novelty in the Modern Pranic Healing which as per the
plaintiff is far removed from traditional Pranic Healing, still the protection
available under the realm of the copyright is confined to the substantial
copying of the language employed in the books authored by the master or
the manner of explanation of Asanas, pictorial content contained in the
book, arrangement and selection of contents and its setting thereof and not in
the Asanas of Pranic Healing or performance of Pranic Healing Exercise
following the law laid down in Baker (supra), Fiest (supra), Baigent
(supra). This is due to the reason that even if there exists any novelty in such
expression of the idea, the said novelty is not a sine qua non for conferring
copyright and the copyright vests on the basis of originality. The said
originality in the copyright sense as indicate would imply the hard work,
skill, judgment extended by the author towards creativity which emanate
from author and not in innovative sense. The novel processes, methods,
principles, manner of performing the art or exercise are all the realm of the
Patents and not the copyright. Therefore, without testing the novelty in any
appropriate art or technique and giving the monopoly over the performance
art or exercising techniques which are apparently preexisting in the ancient



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 107 of 149</span>
 history of India would be a serious intrusion in the Public domain. Thus,
even if any kind of novelty exists in such Pranic Healing Asanas, the
copyright in book cannot encompass such kind of protection in the manner
sought for by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_238">100. It can also be argued simultaneously the Yoga as an art or technique is
not prima facie patentable, thus rejecting the copyright claim would be
rendering the plaintiff as remediless. The said argument would also not be
correct in as much as what is not patentable cannot as a matter of necessary
consequence becomes copyrightable. The grant of no protection over the art
described in the book as against the manner of the description in the form of
language etc is due to the separate reasons available in Copyright law
including the applicability of idea expression dichotomy principle which sets
out the boundaries between the idea and expression. Therefore, the ouster of
the art or technique or method from the realm of the protection has really no
connection with that of the Patent as such. The grant of the patent to such
useful arts, methods in relation to novel inventions is an additional reasoning
which prevents the subject matter to be copyrightable because the said
subject may overlap with patent. That by itself does not mean that what is
not patentable will become copyrightable. This is also applicable to
historical facts, as the historical facts are neither copyrightable and cannot
be patentable also.
</p><p id="p_239">101. It is further pertinent to mention that the plaintiffs have relied upon
the decision of Open Source Yoga Unity vs. Bikram Choudhury,                  74
U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1434 decided by the District Court of North California
in the year 2005, wherein the court accepted the contention of the plaintiffs
that the 26 Yoga asanas described in the literature are compilations within



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 108 of 149</span>
 the meaning of the law and proceeded to pass interim order against the
defendants restraining them from performing the Yogas Asanas conducted
by Bikram Chaudhury by observing the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">    "Thus, copyright law provides that while functional and public domain
    material remains free for all to use, a compilation of that material may
    nonetheless qualify for copyright protection if the compiler can
    demonstrate a sufficient level of creativity in the selection and
    arrangement of the elements in the compilation. It is against this
    backdrop that Choudhury's claims must be evaluated......"
    "..... Thus, OSYU has provided no persuasive authority that a
    compilation of yoga asanas cannot be protected under the copyright laws
    in the same manner as other compilations. The court, while recognizing,
    and even agreeing that application of the law of compilations to yoga
    asanas appears to violate the spirit of yoga, has been unable to locate any
    authority that precludes such application. Therefore, if the trier of fact
    determines that a sufficient number of the individual yoga asanas are
    arranged in a sufficiently creative manner, copyright protection for the
    yoga sequence would be available.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_113">    ....Nonetheless, even under a thin copyright, Choudhury may properly
    enjoin exact or near-exact duplications of his yoga sequence, if the
    routines taught by plaintiffs are "substantially similar" to Choudhury's,
    and thus infringing."
</blockquote><p id="p_240">102. I have gone through the reasoning stated in the judgment of Open
Source Yoga Unity (supra) decided by the District court of North California.
I find that the reasoning contained in the judgment of District Court is
legally flawed due to the following reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_241">   a) The District court in Open Source (supra) though quoted Fiest (supra)
       decision of Supreme Court of US passed in 1991 which clearly
       describes the scope and the extent of the protection available to the
       compilations containing the facts in details overlooks the observations
       of its own court in Fiest (supra) and proceeds to arrive at the hasty



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 109 of 149</span>
        finding that the copyright sequences in Yoga are protectable if they
       qualify the test of sufficient level of creativity. The said finding is
       legally incorrect in view of the reasoning and observations contained
       in Fiest (supra) which clearly enunciates the law that in the cases
       where the protection is sought for on the premise of compilation, the
       copyright is very thin and the originality in such cases has to be traced
       in to the hard work, skill and labour done in selecting, arranging the
       sequences or facts contained in compilation and not on the facts itself.
       Thus, there cannot be copyright which can be conferred on facts
       stated in the compilation even if they are new or pre-existing which is
       also evident from the principle of Baker (supra). The district court
       going contrary by conferring monopoly to Yoga sequences on the
       premise of compilation is not legally correct finding.
</p>
<p id="p_242">   b) The District court in Open source (supra) also no where goes into the
       detailed discussion of the literary works describing the historical
       events, processes, exercises available in ancient times and the scope
       of protection to be provided to them by applying idea expression
       dichotomy, the jurisprudence of which is emanated from US itself, the
       district court by ignoring the same and not indulging in the discussion
       which has been done above has clearly flawed in its approach in
       arriving at the finding giving protection to the Yoga sequences and
       Asanas.
</p>
<p id="p_243">103. In addition to aforenoted reasoning stated above, even the copyright
office of US has realized the problem area of conferring protection to Yoga
Asanas and sequences on the grounds of Compilation. The Copyright office

decision of Open Source Yoga Unity (supra) clarifying the position in law
relating to compilation copyright protection. The said clarification of policy

       material that is otherwise separately uncopyrightable. The Office has
       long accepted claims of registration based on the selection,
       coordination, or arrangement of uncopyrightable elements, because
       the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_47">Copyright Act</a> specifically states that copyrightable authorship

       definition's inclusion of the terms ''preexisting material'' or ''data''
       suggest that individually uncopyrightable elements may be compiled
       into a copyrightable whole. The legislative history of the 1976 Act
       supports this interpretation, stating that a compilation ''results from a
       process of selecting, bringing together, organizing, and arranging
       previously existing material of all kinds, regardless of whether the

<blockquote id="blockquote_120">       An example that has occupied the attention of the Copyright Office

EVOLATION YOGA, LLC, 105 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1162, decided on

       Choudhury's books and videos, commits copyright infringement. But
       this argument is tenuous--facts and ideas within a work are not
       protected; only an author's expression of them is. Shaw v.
       Lindheim, 919 F.2d 1353, 1356 (9th Cir. 1990). The Sequence is a
       collection of facts and ideas. 4 There is a distinction between a
       creative work that compiles a series of exercises and the
       compilation of exercises itself. The former is copyrightable, the
       latter is not. See Feist, 499 U.S. at 357 ("Facts are never original,
       so the compilation author can claim originality, if at all, only in
       the way the facts are presented.").          (Emphasis supplied)
       The Sequence--Choudhury's compilation of exercises and yoga poses
       (and not the book or videos depicting the compilation)--is merely a
       procedure or system of exercises. Regardless of the categories
       enumerated in § 102(a), copyright protection does not "extend to any
       idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept,
       principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described,
       explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work." 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).
       According to the Copyright Office, a "compilation of yoga poses
       may be precluded from registration as a functional system or
       process in cases where the particular movements and the order in
       which they are to be performed are said to result in
       improvements in one's health or physical or mental condition." 5
       77 Fed. Reg. 37605, 37607 (June 22, 2012). Choudhury admits that
       the Sequence helps to prevent, cure, and alleviate disease. UF 19-22.
       The Court can only conclude that the Sequence is a system or
       process that is not copyrightable subject matter under § 102(b)."

       Copyright Office's grounds for doing so." (Opp'n 14, 16.) But under
       Skidmore, an administrative agency's interpretation merits
       deference given (1) its specialized experience, broader
       investigations, and information available to the agency; and (2)
       the value of uniformity in administrative and judicial
       interpretations of a statutory scheme. Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323
       U.S. 134, 139, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944). The Supreme
       Court has long recognized that "considerable weight should be
       accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory
       scheme it is entrusted to administer, and the principle of deference to
       administrative interpretations." Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res.

that there is no foundation which has been laid in the pleadings qua the

should therefore reject this argument straightway as afterthought.
</p><p id="p_247">109. I have gone through the submissions advanced by the learned counsel
for the parties in relation to the protection of Asanas of yoga or Pranic
healing as dramatic works under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_54">Copyright Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_248">110. For the purposes of discussion, it is relevant to reproduce the

<p id="p_249">111. From the mere reading of <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_58">Section 2</a> (h) of the Act, it is clear that the

consequence of the said inclusive definition would result in the right holders

 may seem that the Asanas of Yoga or Pranic Healing if written may be
included within the realm of the dramatic work. But on careful
understanding of the concept of the dramatic work as to what sort of the
works are protected within the ambit of the dramatic work and after studying
the pre-requisite requirements for calling any work as dramatic work, it may
be concluded that the arts and exercises like Yoga, Pranic Healing
Technique or daily routine exercises though appear to be choreographic
work but they are as a matter of fact not a choreographic work.
</p><p id="p_251">113. In order to comprehend as to what sort of the works are covered
within the ambit of the Dramatic works as provided in the copyright law.
Some guidance is necessary from the English authorities. In this context,
Copinger &amp; Skone James on Copyright (Fourteenth Edition by Kevin
Garnett M.A., Jonathan R. James, MA. LLB, Gillian Davies, Ph.D., 1999
Edition, London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) which is leading authority on the
subject has given fair amount of commentary which may be useful for the
purposes of the present discussion. The learned author discusses first what
sort of the works are protected as dramatic works and thereafter proceeds to
observe that the requirement of the fixation and certainty of the subject
matter is one of the thrust of the dramatic work but the same are not
applicable to the cases where there is a reasonable doubt as to the certainty
of the subject matter in relation to performance of the same and the
examples of such kind of activities are stated to be sport activities and news
items. The learned author observes as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_131">       "3-24 What constitutes a dramatic work: capability of performance.
       It is implicit from the structure of the 1988 Act that a dramatic work is
       distinguishable from other works. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_60">The Act</a> further makes it clear that
       what makes a work a dramatic work, rather than a literary work, may



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 117 of 149</span>
        be added or removed, so that a literary work can be converted into a
       dramatic work, and vice versa. However, the present definition,
       which is essentially the same in this respect as that in the 1911 and
       1965 Acts, does not seek to define what is this feature which makes a
       work a dramatic work, merely stating that it includes a work of dance
       or a mime. It is suggested that the essential feature of a dramatic
       work, as the term implies, is that it is capable of being physically
       performed. However, not all works which are capable of being
       performed are dramatic works. It is possible, in one sense, to perform
       a literary work (for example, by reciting a poem) , or a musical work
       (for example, by singing a song) or an artistic work (for example, by
       creating a tableu vivant with human actors), but that possibility does
       not make such a work a dramatic work. To constitute a work a
       dramatic work something more is necessary than mere capability
       of performance in this sense. It is suggested that the work must
       have been created for the purpose of being performed, such
       purpose being a matter to be deduced from the form and nature
       of the work."                                (Emphasis Supplied)

       Furthermore, it is thought that the intended performance must be one
       which involves action. Works of dance and mime clearly predicate
       action in their performance, but a work consisting of words intended
       to be spoken or sung, would not, it is suggested, be a dramatic work
       unless the performance of the words is to be accompanied by action.
       Thus, a work which was intended to be sung by a singer in
       character costume but without action would not, it is thought, be
       a dramatic work. Similarly, the assemblage of a scene to be
       viewed or to be subject of a photograph, even if incorporating
       human actors, does not constitute a dramatic work, as it lacks the
       necessary element of action. For the same reason backdrops and
       scenic arrangements produced as the setting in which a play is to be
       performed do not themselves constitute, nor are part of, a dramatic
       work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_132">       3-26 Elements or features of a dramatic work. The elements or
       features which may make a work a dramatic work are many and
       varied, and in the case of an obvious example of a dramatic work,
       such as a play or a screenplay, will be readily identifiable as the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                       Page 118 of 149</span>
        dialogue and the acting directions, usually found in the stage
       directions. However, in order for a work to constitute a dramatic work
       there must be sufficient certainty of its subject matter. in the case of a
       play or a screenplay, this presents little problem, since what knits the
       separate incidents together so that they can be performed as an entity
       is the structure of the work, or the plot, which comprises the setting,
       the characters, and their inter-relationship and development. In the
       case of subject matter which does not fall into any of the obvious
       types of dramatic work, however, this requires not only that there
       should be identifiable with sufficient certainty sufficient elements
       or features in such subject matter which are of a dramatic nature
       in the sense discussed above, but also that those features or
       elements should be sufficiently linked or connected so as to be
       capable of performance. This ultimately turns on the facts of the
       particular case, but in applying this test it has been held that a
       sports game did not constitute a choreographic work (and
       therefore was not a dramatic work), even though parts of the
       game were intended to follow a pre-determined plan. Similarly, it
       has been held that news and current affairs programmes
       comprising video clips, interviews and discussion, lacked
       the choreography required to constitute them dramatic
       works. This has usually been the basis on which formats
       for television programmes have failed to qualify as dramatic works."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_133">                                                      (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_134">114. The summary of the observations made by the learned author relating
to scope of the protection of dramatic work is that for a work to be called as
a dramatic work has to be the one which is capable of physically performed
or accompanied by action. The other requirement for a work to be called as
dramatic work is fixation of the matter in the form of writing or otherwise
which means certainty of incidents as a predetermined plan. Where there
exists a reasonable doubt as to complete certainty of the performance of the
work in the manner conceived by the author or writer, in such cases, the
work falls short of the requirement of fixation or certainty of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 119 of 149</span>
 performance and therefore cannot be called as dramatic work. Such
instances of doubtful nature of certainty include sport games, news
presentations, aerobics and by necessary implication also include other
exercises, daily routines, Yoga and Pranic Healing techniques. Thus, by
applying the test enunciated and well settled by the authorities in England
for the determining the work as a dramatic work, it can be said that prima
facie the Asanas of Yoga or Pranic Healing do not fall within the ambit of
the dramatic work.
</blockquote><p id="p_252">115. Incidentally, the similar conclusions have been arrived at by US
Copyright office when the clarification policy has been issued by the
Copyright in US that the daily routines including Yoga exercises and their
sequences of Asanas are not covered within the realm of the dramatic works.
The said reasoning is consistent with the analysis made in the preceding
paragraphs of this discussion. Furthermore, in later of case of Bikram's
Yoga (supra) decided by District court in California on 14th December, 2012,
the said district court explicitly negatived the contention that the Asanas of
Yoga are protected as dramatic works by observing on similar lines. The
District court observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_135">       "But Plaintiffs contend that the Sequence is at least copyrightable as a

           it results in a category of copyrightable authorship. A mere
          compilation of physical movements does not rise to the level
          of choreographic authorship unless it contains sufficient
          attributes of a work of choreography. And although a
          choreographic work, such as a ballet or abstract modern
          dance, may incorporate simple routines, social dances, or
          even exercise routines as elements of the overall work, the
          mere selection and arrangement of physical movements does
          not in itself support a claim of choreographic authorship. 77

          Choudhury's copyrighted works are not either of those.
          Further, the Sequence of 26 yoga poses hardly seems to fall
          within the definition of a pantomime or a choreographic work
          because of the simplicity of the Sequence and the fact that it is
          not a dramatic performance. (Emphasis Supplied)

       ambit of the dramatic work as provided under the provisions of the
       <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_62">Copyright Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_258">119. In view of the said prima facie conclusions, let me now deal with case
of the parties as per the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_259">a)     So far as the plaintiffs claim of copyright in relation to the
       books, trade literature, CD Roms is concerned, though the
       defendants dispute the said claim on manifold reasons stated in
       the written statements filed by them, However, all the defendants
       have stated during the course of arguments that at this interim
       stage they do not intend to reproduce the said works or using the
       said materials which are material reproduction of the plaintiff's
       copyrighted books except defendant No.1 who has stated that
       she had jointly authored 9 book titles with the master and is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 123 of 149</span>
        accordingly entitled to use the said works in the same manner as
       that of the master. Therefore, excepting the defendant No.1, the
       case of whom I will deal hereinafter, all the other defendants can
       be conveniently restrained temporarily from using the literary
       works including books, their titles which are material
       reproduction of the plaintiffs works as claimed in the list of the
       works filed by the plaintiffs as Annexure A to the plaint.
</p><p id="p_260">b)     Plaintiffs claim of copyright in relation to performance of the
       Asanas of Modern Pranic Healing is prima facie untenable in
       view of the reasoning contained in the discussion mentioned
       above wherein the claim of the copyright in respect of book
       cannot be extended to the art or technique described in the book.
</p><p id="p_261">c)     The similar claim of the plaintiffs copyright in respect of
       performance of the Asanas on the premise of the dramatic work
       is prima facie unsustainable and no prima facie case in this
       respect has been made out by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_262">d)     The copyright claim of the plaintiffs in respect of the
       performance of the Asanas of Pranic Healing has been resisted
       by the defendants by contending that the said Asanas lack
       originality in as much as the concept of the Pranic Healing finds
       mentioned in the books which are predated and published prior
       to that of the books of the master including book of Swami
       Ramachakra since the year 1906 and others. The said challenge
       as to originality is further countered by the plaintiff by
       contending that there is a difference between the traditional
       Pranic Healing and Modern Pranic Healing. I have gone through



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 124 of 149</span>
        the contents of the books relied upon by the defendants in order
       to raise such challenge as to originality. After going through the
       same, it can be said that prima facie, it appears that the
       techniques of Pranic Healing finds mentioned in the books
       shown by the defendants. Thus, the challenge raised by the
       defendants as to the originality quotient to resist the copyright
       claim is seemingly prima facie credible. However, it is a
       disputed question of fact in view of the plaintiffs response of
       difference between the Modern Pranic Healing and traditional
       Pranic Healing. The plaintiffs are to prove the same in trial. I
       may point out here that the finding as to the lack of originality is
       additional reasoning to support the finding as to prima facie non
       tenability of the copyright claim in the performance of Pranic
       Healing. This is due to the reason that the analysis done by me
       above clearly indicates that whether the compilation contained in
       the book is of novel facts or non novel facts, the important point
       to be borne in mind is that the copyright shall vest in the manner
       of description contained in the work like the language employed
       in the work, selection and arrangement of the incidents and their
       sequence and shall not extend to performance. Therefore, the
       novelty or lack of originality of the facts is though essential but
       not the whole basis of my finding as this is more of an idea
       expression problem.
</p><p id="p_263">e)     The contention of the defendant No.1 and other defendants that
       they are acting under the separate titles for one reason or other
       either as licensee or as an independent trust need not require



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 125 of 149</span>
        determination at this stage in view of my finding that the
       copyright claim of the plaintiffs do not extend to the
       performance of Asanas of Yoga. In that view of the matter, the
       question of the defendants separate entitlements to impart Pranic
       Healing techniques is disputed question of fact and can be
       postponed uptil trial.
</p><p id="p_264">f)     The reliance of the plaintiffs on the judgment of Supreme Court
       in the case of Academy of General Education, Manipal (supra)
       in order to demonstrate the performance of the dramatic work is
       protectable and the dance is included within the realm of
       dramatic work is not applicable to the instant case as no one is
       disputing that the dance cannot be protected as dramatic and also
       the performance right is not included when it comes to
       protecting dramatic works. I have arrived at prima facie finding
       that Pranic Healing techniques or routine exercises are not
       covered within the ambit of dramatic works and thus the
       question of the right to restrain their performance does not arise
       in the instant case. The right of performance is separately
       curtailed due to idea and expression problem when it comes to
       protection of literary works. So both way, the exclusive right to
       perform or impart or to do Pranic Healing techniques in practice
       cannot be given solely to the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_265">g)     The argument of the plaintiffs by demonstrating some 13 new
       Asanas invented by the master and hence they are protectable is
       also meritless in view of my finding that the novelty of the art
       described in the book or literary work does not confer any



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 126 of 149</span>
        copyright on the art or facts described therein. Thus, the said
       argument of novelty also does not aid the case of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_266">h)     Similarly, the defendants have made submissions as to non
       availability of the deed of assignment in favour of the plaintiffs
       or complete devolution of title in favour of plaintiffs due to
       which the plaintiffs cannot assert their right against the
       defendants. Prima facie, I have found that there is no right of the
       plaintiffs qua the performances of the Asanas of Pranic Healing
       Techniques and so far as the books are concerned, the
       defendants (except defendant no. 1 to the extent of the books co-
       authored by her) have made the statement that they do not intend
       to use the trade literature, CDs and books which are reproduction
       of the master. Under these circumstances, the question as to deed
       to assignment and devolution of title in favour of the plaintiffs at
       this juncture becomes inconsequential for the purposes of
       deciding the present application.
</p><p id="p_267">i)     The contention of the defendants that the Pranic Healing is part
       of traditional knowledge of the country also requires the
       evidence to be led by both the sides as to whether actually Pranic
       Healing has been emanated from the traditional knowledge of
       this country. Prima facie, the literature produced on record
       suggests so but the conclusive finding on the said aspect can be
       arrived after the evidence is led by the competent person in the
       field of the art as well as making in depth enquiry after the trial.
       Suffice it to say that the plaintiffs claim on the copyright at the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 127 of 149</span>
        interim stage can be decided without going into this question in
       view of my findings arrived at above.
</p><p id="p_268">120. These are the main contentions which have been raised by the parties
in relation to the copyright claim. The question of comparison of the
Master's books and literatures and defendant's literature does not arise in
this case as the defendants except the defendant No.2 have made the
undertaking that they do not intend to reproduce books and the literature of
the Master in material form in the manner owned by the Master so that it
may not infringe the copyright of the plaintiff. Only the plaintiffs have tried
to compare the works incidents wise. However, the defendant No.2 did not
satisfy the court on this aspect. The only plea taken by defendant No.2 is
that there is divesting intellectual property rights which includes copyrights
of the Master. The plaintiffs deny the said plea, it is thus disputed question
of fact and no prima facie view can be formed on the basis of pleadings and
material placed on record except to observe that tenabilities of the said plea
would be examined in trial. The same cannot be accepted at this stage.
</p><p id="p_269">121. The defendant No.1 in order to resist the copyright claim of the
plaintiffs in the literary work/books contend that she had co-authored 9
books as mentioned in the submissions recorded above and therefore she is
entitled to use the said literature as co-author of the book. The reasoning
given by defendant No.1 in respect of the said claim of the co-authorship is
that she was the transcriber of the books authored by the master and she had
taken notes from the lectures given by the master and thereafter compiled
them and edited the books authored by the master. It has been argued that
the master has also acknowledged the said fact in his books about the kind of
the efforts made by the defendant No.1 in order to compile and edit the 9



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 128 of 149</span>
 books. Counsel for the defendant No.1 submitted that she is entitled to use
the said literature as co-author of the books.
</p><p id="p_270">122. Learned counsel for plaintiffs in order to substantiate the submission
also relied upon the judgment of <a href="/doc/79757/" id="a_63">Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd</a>.,
AIR 1989 Del 63.
</p><p id="p_271">123. Learned counsel for plaintiffs refutes the said contention by arguing
that mere fact that the defendant No.1 is a mere transcriber/editor would not
make any difference in the authorship of the work and the copyright in the
said book vests with the Master and no one else.
</p><p id="p_272">124. I have examined the submission advanced by the learned counsel for
the plaintiff and defendant No.1 with respect to the claim of co-authorship
by the defendant No.1 in respect of 9 books as mentioned above. I am of the
view that before moving further, it is for me to first deal with the concept of
joint authorship in detail as provided under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_64">Copyright
Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_273">125. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_65">The Copyright Act</a>, 1957 defines the expression work of joint
authorship under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_66">Section 2</a> (1) (z) of the Act. The said definition reads as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_141">         "(z) "work of joint authorship" means a work produced by the
         collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of one
         author is not distinct from the contribution of the other author or
         authors. From the mere reading of the <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_67">section 2</a> (z) of the Act, it is
         apparent that for the purposes of any work to be called as a work of
         joint authorship, the necessary prerequisites which are required to be
         satisfied are as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_142">            a) That the work has been produced by the collaboration of
               two or more authors




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 129 of 149</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_143">            b) In which the contribution one author is not distinct from
              the contribution of other author."</blockquote>

<p id="p_274">       If these ingredients are satisfied, then one may term the work as a
work of joint authorship. Now, what is nature of contribution which is
required from the author in such work and what are tests to determine such
contribution at the level of authorship or otherwise are the questions which
are required to be looked into in certain detail for which little guidance is
necessary from English authorities in UK containing the similarly worded
provision.
</p><p id="p_275">126. In this respect it would be appropriate to quote Laddie, Prescott &amp;
Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs , 2011 Edition
Lexis Nexis where the said concept of Joint authorship has been dealt with
in great detail. The learned Author observes that there are three ingredients
to be established for the work to be called as a work of joint authorship
which are collaboration, non distinction of the contribution from one and
other and third and last is creative input. In the words of the learned Author,
it has been observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_144">       Joint authors
       "3.97 A work of joint authorship is defined in s 10(1) of the CDPA
       1988 as a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors
       in which the contribution of each author is not distinct from the
       contribution of the other author or authors. Accordingly, it appears
       that there are three requirements which must be fulfilled to make
       someone a joint author of a literary, dramatic or musical work. First, a
       joint author must collaborate with the other author(s) in the
       production of the work. It is submitted that subsequent authors will
       not result in a work of joint authorship. However, the existence of
       collaboration must be a question of fact and degree.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_145">                                                     (Emphasis supplied)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 130 of 149</span>
        Thirdly, the joint author must provide a significant creative input. In
       other words, a joint author must contribute a significant part of
       the skill and labour protected by copyright. It may be helpful to
       consider two questions; first, whether the alleged author has
       contributed the right kind of skill and labour; and secondly
       whether his contribution was big enough. In the case of a literary
       work, since copyright subsists in the written expression of ideas, a
       joint author must participate in the writing and share responsibility for
       the form of expression in the literary work. Therefore, although a
       joint author is not necessarily required to push the pen, a direct
       responsibility for what appears on paper is necessary. This
       requirement has been described as 'something which approximates
       to penmanship'."                               (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_276">127. From the reading of the above excerpt from the book of Modern Law
of Copyright, it can be said that the three essential ingredients are required
to be established for any work to be termed as work of joint authorship. It is
also seen that not necessarily the contribution of joint author should coincide
with that of the other author, but the contribution should be something which
approximates to penmanship which show the skill, labour expended towards
the creativity having a role to play in the work considering the nature of the
work produced by the two authors.
</p><p id="p_277">128. Let me now evaluate the case set up by the defendant No.1 upon the
aforementioned tests provided by the author and see whether for prima facie
purposes, the said three requirements are qualified or not.
</p><p id="p_278">129. It is first necessary to reproduce the assertions made by defendant no.
1 in support her claim as to the joint authorship. The relevant assertions
made in the written statement are reproduced hereinafter:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_146">       ".... Moreover, the Answering Defendant compiled and edited
       seven books of Golden Lotus Sutra of Master Chao Kok Sui on
       seven different titles which were copyrighted in the year 2003 and

        2004 after compilation of notes taken by her from the lectures
       given from time to time by Master. In the said books, the Master
       has acknowledged the work of the answering defendant for
       compiling the aphorism of the said books for the past nine years.
       The titles of the said books of Golden Lotus sutra are as follows...."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_147">                                                    (Emphasis Supplied)

       ".....The above said work of the Defendant no. 1 itself shows that
       she was associated with Master and taking notes of the lectures
       delivered by the said master since about 1994. The long
       association has been unequivocally acknowledged and recognized
       by the said master. Further, the defendant no. 1 was the principal
       architect in publishing the said books. It is evident from one of the
       said book namely "inspired Action" that the desire and principal
       objectives of the said Master were to propagate and spread the
       teachings of Pranic Healing and no one should monopolise such
       teaching. The right is non exclusive. The said Master along with the
       defendant no. 1 had also founded the "planetary peace Movement" in
       the year 1998. This only goes to show that the defendant no. 1 was
       closely associated with the Master in development the Pranic
       Healing courses. The Defendant no. 1 transcribed, compiled and
       edited two more books of Master on Pranic Healing namely 1.
       The Original of Modern Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga and 2.
       The Existence of God is self evident and all these Master....."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_149">130. From the reading of the aforementioned assertions made by the
defendant No.1 in her written statement, it is clear that there are averments
to the effect that the defendant No.1 was associated with the master, her
association also went on to contribute her participation in 9 books authored
by the master which clearly indicates towards the collaboration or jointness
with which work was conducted. The averments in the written statement
also proceed to state that defendant No.1 had contributed towards the taking
down notes from the lectures of the master, compiling them and providing to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                       Page 132 of 149</span>
 the master, the contribution also proceeds to state that she had transcribed
the works for the master and thereafter compiled and edited the work. All
these averments indicates towards the skill, labour and judgment which has
been expended by the defendant No.1 which was not merely ordinary but
towards creativity which is a kind of responsibility not distinct from that of
the author and the said contribution cannot be said to be merely lopsided but
signalling towards her contribution to the penmanship and the essence of the
authorship by writing, compiling and editing. It can therefore cannot be said
that the prima facie, the averments qua the claim of joint authorship are
missing and rather three essentials of the joint authorship are clearly pleaded
and indicating towards such joint authorship.
</blockquote><p id="p_279">131. In response thereto, the plaintiff has in the rejoinder filed by the
plaintiffs to the reply to the interim application wherein the plaintiffs admit
the said position by contending as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_150">     "It is admitted that the defendant No.1 compiled and edited seven
     books of Golden Sutra of Master Choa Kok Sui on seven different
     titles. It is clarified that all the seven books were mere collection of the
     teachings of the master and all the copyright so obtained in the year
     2003 and 2004 on the books were in the name of the Master. It is stated
     that the merely compiling a book by collecting the teachings of Master
     does not gives right to Defendant no. 1 to claim ownership of the works
     of the Master or the institution of Pranic Healing. It is admitted that
     the Master has acknowledged the work of the Defendant no. 1 for
     compiling the aphormism of the said books for the past nine years.
     It is not the case of the plaintiffs that the Defendant no. 1 was
     associated with the Master. It is however denied that the Defendant
     no. 1 was the principal architect in publishing the said books....."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_280">132. From the reading of the aforementioned averments made in the
rejoinder, it is clear that the plaintiffs admit the association of the defendant




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 133 of 149</span>
 No. 1 with the master, they also admit that the defendant No.1 compiled and
edited the books of the master, they also admit the fact that the master
acknowledge the said fact in his book and lastly the plaintiffs also inform
that the nature of the books are of compilation of the teachings of the master.
Thus, there are clear admissions on the part of the plaintiffs on defendant
No. 1 towards the basis of her claim as a joint author except by mere denial
of the consequence which is that given the admissions done by the plaintiffs,
same may not result in making her joint author of the work. The plaintiffs
continue to state in the written submissions that the defendant No.1 is a
transcriber who simply put the master's words from his lectures into written
form along with help of the team of people, without changing any of the
words of the master. The Golden Lotus sutra are merely a compilation of the
extracts of the Masters lectures and the words and preachings enunciated by
the master. There is no active intellectual collaboration involved. On this
basis, the plaintiff contends that this court should reject the claim of the
defendant No.1 as a joint author.
</p><p id="p_281">133. As seen above that the three essential ingredients of the joint
authorship are clearly pleaded and borne out of the assertions made by the
defendant No.1 in her written statement to which, there are clear admissions
in the rejoinder and on the contrary the plaintiffs merely take the plea that
the said contribution is not vital enough to ascribe joint authorship to the
defendant No.1
</p><p id="p_282">134. It has already been deduced by me after quoting Modern law of
copyright that the intellectual contribution should be in the sense of
contribution towards the creativity in copyright sense which is the hardwork,
skill and labour expended in the creativity having role to play in the work



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 134 of 149</span>
 considering the very nature of the work. If the plaintiffs state that the Golden
Lotus Sutras produced by the defendant No.1 are merely a compilation of
the extracts from the Master's lectures and the defendant No.1 contributed
nothing intellectually when she penned down the lectures of the master,
compiled in the form of compilation and edited in the form of book, then it
passes human comprehension as what sort of the contribution shall suffice
for an author in the work of the compilation when compiling, editing and
penning down the lectures are not considered such contribution. It appears to
me on prima facie basis that the plaintiffs have been failed to satisfy that the
defendant No.1 has no intellectual contribution towards creativity in
copyright sense. Prima facie, I find that if the work is of compilation of
lectures, then the acts like preparation of lectures by penning down,
transcribing them, compiling them and editing them are surely vital enough
to signal hard work, labour and skill towards the creativity as the compiling,
preparing of lectures, transcribing them are the essence of the work only.
Therefore, on the basis of this prima facie finding, the defendant can
exercise her rights in the said 9 books wherein she claims to have
contributed with the master in authorship. The plaintiff is at the liberty to
prove anything to the contrary in the trial.
</p><p id="p_283">135. So far as the rest of the books authored by master and other trade
literature, CD Roms etc are concerned, the defendant No. 1 in her
supplementary affidavit filed through her power of attorney holder namely
Rajiv Bhargava filed on 7th February, 2012, it is said that the defendant No.
1 has not published any of the copyrighted books, manuals of the master and
she intends to utilize the copyrighted works of the master only for teaching
purposes of conducting the workshop. The said statements made by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 135 of 149</span>
 defendant No.1 through her attorney are accepted and on that basis the
defendant No.1 shall not reproduce the said books in material form and shall
also not sell or distributed the books, CDs, manuals and other trade literature
of the master in any manner. It is made clear that the said interim order shall
exclude from its purview the use of the 9 books for which the defendant
No.1 is permitted to exercise her rights.
</p><p id="p_284">136. In relation to the residual part of the statement made in the affidavit of
Mr. Bhargava that defendants intends to utilize the said works for teaching
purposes, this court cannot give any such blanket permission at this stage,
the nature of infringement shall be determined by the court on case to case
basis. Suffice it to say that there is no interim order which this court is
passing on the performance of the Pranic Healing techniques and its
imparting in any manner in practice. The parties may infer such prima facie
findings as per their understanding on the subject and considering the nature
of the work undertaken by them.

</pre><p id="p_287">138. It has been alleged by the plaintiffs that the plaintiff being the
registered proprietor of the trade mark comprising the expression PRANIC
HEALING can prevent any third party misuse of the trade mark PRANIC
HEALING. It has been argued that the trade mark PRANIC HEALING has
acquired secondary significance vis-a-vis the plaintiffs due to its long
standing use by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_288">139. The defendants on the other hand argued that the expression PRANIC
HEALING is publici juris and as such no monopoly can be claimed on the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                              Page 140 of 149</span>
 said basis. It has been argued that there is no valid deed of assignment in
favour of the plaintiffs in order to show title over the trade marks and thus
the plaintiffs are estopped from claiming any trade mark infringement. It has
been argued that the Pranic Healing as an expression cannot acquire any
secondary significance qua the plaintiffs being generic expression. The
defendants relied upon the material they have placed on record including the
books and literature filed to challenge the originality to show that the
expression Pranic Healing is the name of the concept or technique which is
one of the facet of Yoga and has been part of the traditional knowledge of
India.
</p><p id="p_289">140. I have considered the rival contentions of the parties on the aspect of
the trade mark infringement and have also considered the material available
on record. On going through the material available on record, it is apparent
that the expression Pranic Healing has been used by Swami Ramachakra in
his book as back as in the year 1906 prior the books and titles of the Master.
The said Book of 1906 describes Pranic Healing as a concept derived from
Prana which has been taken from Pranayam of Yoga and the said concept
mainly means utilising the inherent energy prana or energy of life in all
beings for self-healing. The said term Pranic Healing has been written
prominently in the chapters of the book published more than a century ago
by another Swami. The said book has also been relied by the defendants to
attack the aspect of originality in the copyright claimed by the plaintiff. It is
thus evident that it is not the master or the plaintiffs who have coined the
term Pranic Healing and the same has been originated from somewhere else
or probably from the public domain.
</p><p id="p_290">141. <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_68">Section 18</a> of the Trade Marks Act clearly provide that any person



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                          Page 141 of 149</span>
 claiming to be a proprietor of the trade mark can secure the trade mark
registration and apply for the same. It is however required to be mentioned
that the said claim of the proprietorship made by the plaintiff has to be
truthful in as much as that it is the plaintiff who is the owner of the trade
mark by adopting a trade mark which is inherently distinctive or the mark
which is capable of distinguishing the goods and services of the one person
from that of another. The trade marks which have secured by the plaintiffs in
India are all secured post the year 2000 as is evident from the list. If the
expression Pranic Healing was the name of the art or technique of Yoga in
the year 1906 finding place in the books in the field of Yoga, it is prima
facie appears to be highly doubtful as to how the said expression PRANIC
HEALING is either inherently distinctive or for that matter capable of
distinguishing the goods of one person from that of another. Having not
made a truthful statement as to proprietorship of the mark PRANIC
HEALING by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have secured the registration of
the expression PRANIC HEALING from the Registrar of the trade mark
without informing about the correct proprietorship of the mark applied for
on the date of the application. The said act of withholding the information or
making incorrect claim of the proprietorship of the mark in legal parlance is
termed as committing fraud upon the register.
</p><p id="p_291">142. It is established law that in an action before the civil court relating to
infringement proceedings, the validity of the trade mark cannot be
questioned more so at the prima facie stage. But, it cannot also be lost sight
of that the registration is merely a prima facie proof of validity by virtue of
<a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_69">Section 31</a> of the Act. There is always a rebuttable presumption available
under the law in such cases where the circumstances attending the same



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 142 of 149</span>
 speaks to the contrary, the court can at any stage draw inference to the
contrary even in cases wherein there shall be prima facie presumption as to
validity. (Kindly see the judgment of Division bench of this court in the case
of Marico Ltd. Vs. Agro Tech Foods Limited; 2010 (44) PTC 736 (Del.)
wherein this court observed in the context of lack of distinctiveness in the
following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_151">       "A trademark is ordinarily used in relation to goods of a
       manufacturer. A trademark can be registered but ordinarily
       registration is not granted if the mark falls under sub-sections 1(a) to
       1(c) of Section 9. The proviso however, provides for entitlement to
       registration although ordinarily not permissible under <a href="/doc/229141/" id="a_70">Sections 9</a> (1)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_152">       (a) to (c), provided that the mark has acquired a distinctive character
       as a result of its use prior to registration or is otherwise a well known
       trademark. Registration is only prima facie evidence of its validity
       and the presumption of prima facie validity of registration is only a
       rebuttable presumption." (Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_292">143. The reading of the aforesaid observations would show that the court
in an infringement proceeding would proceed to enforce the trade mark
when it prima facie appears to the court that it is valid one. Normally, such
presumption is implicit by virtue of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_71">Section 31</a> of the Act, however if any
contrary material is informed to the court which indicates that the
registration has secured by ignoring the mandatory provisions of the Act.
The court may in such cases draw an inference as to invalidity for prima
facie purposes if not conclusively and proceed to deny the discretionary
relief of interim injunction to the party even though the appropriate tribunal
to try the proceedings relating to cancellation is trade mark registry or IPAB.
By drawing such inferences, this court time and again even maintained an




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 143 of 149</span>
 infringement action against the registered proprietor holding that for prima
facie purposes the mark of the defendant is invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_293">144. Applying the said proposition to the instant case, it can be seen that
the expression PRANIC HEALING on the date of the application for the
registration was prima facie non distinctive and was the name of the art or
technique of doing exercise which was a facet of Yoga. The expression was
not capable of distinguishing the services of the plaintiff from others due to
its wide spread use in the field dating back from centuries ago. Thus, the
registration of the expression PRANIC HEALING attracts serious
objections under the provisions of <a href="/doc/229141/" id="a_72">Section 9</a> of the Act relating to lack of
distinctive character. Furthermore, the plaintiff or the applicant has secured
the registration by making false claim as to proprietorship in the trade mark
registration which prima facie vitiates the registration. Thus, this court can
conveniently draw prima facie inference that the registrations obtained by
the plaintiffs for the mark PRANIC HEALING are inconsequential. Prima
facie, it appears to the court that it becomes generic name and cannot be
protected being known as name of concept of Yoga at present. Even the
Master was not the proprietor of the said expression "PRANIC HEALING",
hence at this stage, the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim the monopoly of
the said words.
</p>
<p id="p_294">145. Therefore, prima facie no case has been made out by the plaintiffs for
the infringement of the trade mark as the expression Pranic Healing is
incapable of performing the function of the trade mark and the trade mark
registration secured by the plaintiff is prima facie inconsequential.
Accordingly, the court cannot proceed to grant interim injunction as prayed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                        Page 144 of 149</span>
 for by the plaintiffs on the strength of prima facie invalid registrations. So
far as the secondary significance is concerned, once it is seen that the
expression Pranic Healing has a wide spread use prior to the plaintiffs
coming into picture, no amount of expenditure or investment can lead to
distinctiveness of such an expression which is the name of the art or
technique which has its roots embedded in ancient history of India can lead
to secondary meaning identifying any singular proprietor like the plaintiffs.
Accordingly, the trade mark infringement and passing off claims of the
plaintiff on the premise of the use of the expression PRANIC HEALING by
the defendants are prima facie not made out.
</p>
<p id="p_295">INJUNCTION

</p><p id="p_296">146. Finally, I shall now proceed to discuss the principles governing the
grant of interim injunction which are prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss and test the case of the plaintiffs on the
same. The plaintiffs have failed to make out any prima facie case for the
grant of injunction in relation to infringement of trade mark, passing off and
the infringement of copyright qua the performance of the Asanas of Pranic
Healing under the copyright. The balance of the convenience is of course is
in favour of the defendants in absence of the any prima facie case of
copyright infringement in relation to pranic healing techniques, concepts or
any exercises of Yoga and Asanas and trade mark infringement and
irreparable damage shall also ensue to the defendants if the plaintiff is
granted the interim injunction in its favour without establishing a prima facie
right over the trade mark and copyright.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">CS(OS) No.2252/2011                                         Page 145 of 149</span>
<p id="p_297"> 147. The only prima facie case which has been made out by the plaintiff is
towards the reproduction right of the books and other literature or issuance
of copies or distribution of certificate by the defendants. The defendants
have made the statement during the course of hearing (except 9 books for
which rights have been claimed by the defendant No.1) they do not intend to
replicate the literature, brochures, CDS Roms etc of the plaintiff which may
cause infringement in the manner of expression by way of language or
sequential incidents contained in the books and other literature. The
defendants have further stated that they will not affiliate themselves with
Master by issuing any certificate containing the name of the master or any
way associate their institutes with the Master while running their training
courses. Thus, the balance of the convenience and irreparable loss so far as
these reliefs are concerned are in favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are
therefore entitled to injunction restraining reproduction or distribution or
selling of the copies of the books and literature etc. as per the directions
given below subject to continuance of use of 9 books by the defendant No.1
as mentioned in the directions.
</p>
<p id="p_298">148. The directions as per the prima facie conclusions arrived at under the
various heads of the discussions done above can be summarized as under:
</p>
<p id="p_299">a)     The defendants, their agents, partners, directors, trustees or any
       one of them acting on their behalf directly or indirectly are
       temporarily restrained during the pendency of the proceedings
       from reproducing the contents of the books and the trade
       literature, brochures, CD Roms, manuals in the manner used by
       the Master in his books, literature and other material or copying

        the material in material or substantial form sequentially or
       incident wise which may cause infringement of the copyright in
       the said works and from selling, distributing, offering for sale
       any such books, CD Roms, recordings of master courses,
       brochures and other literary work authored by the Master or
       using the same at the time of teaching or imparting training of
       Modern Pranic Healing or Pranic Healing in their training
       programmes, workshop and also from issuing the certificate for
       conducting their training courses which contains the name of
       the Master namely Master Choa Kok Sui or use any material or
       write up which may suggest affiliation of the defendants with
       that of Master Choa Kok Sui in relation to their training
       programmes run in their training institutes and foundations.
       However, they are free to print, publish any book, printed
       material, brochures and certificates on the basis of material
       available in public domain which do not infringe the copyright
