Per P. R. Ramachandra Menon, Chief Justice


</p><p id="p_2">   1.     Dismissal of the writ petition filed by the Appellants challenging the

           Annexure- A/2 order dated 21/06/2019 passed by the learned Magistrate,

           directing the Police Officer concerned to register FIR and to proceed with

           the investigation under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 156(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2</span>


         (in short, '<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>'), in respect of the cognizable offences and the

         subsequent proceedings whereby FIR came to be registered by the

         Police Officer are put to challenge in this appeal. The main ground of

         challenge is that the order passed by the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section

         156(3)</a> of the CrPC is not correct or sustainable for non-satisfaction of the

         pre-requirements under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">154(3)</a> of the CrPC, which

         has not been correctly appreciated by the learned Single Judge while

         holding that no such requirement is there in <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC.

         It is pointed out that the verdict passed by the learned Single Judge is

         contrary to the law declared by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/163299097/" id="a_7">Priyanka Srivastava

         and Another vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others</a> 1 and hence the

         challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.       Heard Ms. Sharmila Singhai, the learned counsel appearing for the

         Appellants and Mr Sudeep Verma, the learned counsel representing the

         State.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.       The crux of the factual sequence which led to the proceeding, as revealed

         from the materials on record, is that there were some hiccups in the

         matrimonial relationship between the 1st Appellant and his wife, who is

         the daughter of the 3rd Respondent, alleging various offences against the

         Appellants (Appellants No.2 &amp; 3 are the parents of the 1 st Appellant and

         Appellant No.4 is the maternal uncle). The 3 rd Respondent filed a petition

         before the learned Magistrate at Bilaspur under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 156(3)</a> of the

         CrPC and after considering the same, the learned Magistrate forwarded

         the same to the Station House Officer, Police Station, Civil Line,

         Bilaspur / 2nd Respondent directing to register FIR and to investigate.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1</span>
    (2015) 6 SCC 287
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            3</span>


         Pursuant to the said order, Annexure-A/4 FIR came to be registered by

         the 2nd Respondent, against the Appellants, in respect of the offences

         under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9">Sections 452</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">498A</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">294</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">506B</a>, read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_13">Section 34</a> of the

         Indian Penal Code. This made the Appellants to approach this Court by

         filing WP(Cr) No.507/2019, seeking to set aside Annexure-A/2 order

         passed by the learned Magistrate and to quash the FIR registered by the

         police with Crime No.504/2019 of the Police Station Civil Line, Bilaspur.

</p><p id="p_5">4.       As   mentioned    already,   it   was   specifically   contended   that   no

         petition/proceeding was ever filed by the complainant in terms of

         <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">154(3)</a> of the CrPC, without which no proceeding

         could be entertained under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC.         It was also

         contended that a 'preliminary enquiry' had to be conducted in view of the

         nature of grievance, being a matrimonial dispute, as declared by the

         Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/10239019/" id="a_17">Latita Kumari vs. Government

         of Uttar Pradesh and Others2</a>. After hearing both the sides, the learned

         Judge declined interference and the writ petition was dismissed, which

         hence is subjected to challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.       When the matter came up for consideration before this Court on

         23.09.2019, maintainability of the appeal was doubted and the learned

         counsel was required to address the Court on this ground as well, apart

         from the merit involved and accordingly, the matter was heard

         elaborately.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.       With regard to the merits involved, the contention of the Appellants is that

         the complainant had not preferred any application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_18">Section 154(1)</a>

         of CrPC before the Station House Officer and no petition was filed before

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">2</span>
    (2014) 2 SCC 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  4</span>


the Superintendent of Police under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_19">Section 154(3)</a> of the CrPC, before

filing the petition before the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC,

if there was any lapse on the part of the Station House Officer in

registering the crime. Without completing the pre-requirements under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_22">154(3)</a> of the CrPC, it was not open for the

complainant to have moved the Magistrate directly under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_23">Section 156(3)</a>

of the CrPC and hence Annexure-A/2 order passed by the Magistrate,

directing the Police to register the FIR and to conduct the investigation

without satisfying the pre-requirements as above, is not correct or

sustainable, being contrary to the law declared by the Apex Court in

Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra). The next contention is that the

dispute involved is a 'matrimonial dispute', with reference to the alleged

demand for dowry and such other instances and in the said

circumstance, it was very much obligatory for conducting a preliminary

enquiry before registering the FIR, as declared by the Constitution Bench

of the Apex Court in Lalita Kumari's case (supra). The said requirement

having not been satisfied, the learned Single Judge ought to have

interdicted the impugned orders and having not chosen to do so,

miscarriage of justice has been resulted. The learned counsel for the

Appellants further points out with reference to the materials on record,

that the wife of the 1st Appellant by name 'Shifa Anjum' had not preferred

any complaint regarding cruelty or harassment and that, it was the 3 rd

Respondent/complainant, who is the father of the victim, who had made

a false and fabricated complaint in the Police Station, Civil Lines,

Bilaspur. As such, the direction given by the Magistrate to register an

FIR and to conduct investigation, in a mechanical manner, is quite alien
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                             5</span>


         to the scheme of the statute and is liable to be set aside.         The last

         contention is that the alleged incident took place at Raipur and that the

         FIR has been caused to be registered in the Police Station at Bilaspur. It

         is stated that the Police Station, Bilaspur has no territorial jurisdiction to

         register the FIR and that the course pursued is contrary to the provision

         of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_24">Section 177</a> of the CrPC. The learned counsel submits that the finding

         of the learned Single Judge that satisfaction of the requirements under

         <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_25">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_26">154(3)</a> of the CrPC (wrongly mentioned as 154(3)

         and (4) in paragraphs 5 and 7 of Annexure-A/1 order passed by the

         learned Single Judge) is not a requirement as per the Rule for bringing

         application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_27">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC is not correct. Apart from

         the reliance sought to be placed on the verdict passed by the Apex Court

         in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) reliance is also sought to be

         placed on the recent judgment dated 14.05.2019 passed by a learned

         Single Judge of this Court in WP(Cr) No. 146 of 2016. With regard to the

         maintainability, the learned counsel sought to place reliance on the

         verdict passed by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/12721854/" id="a_28">Ram Kishan Fauji vs. State of

         Haryana and Others3</a> and such other decisions which will be dealt with

         in due course.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">7.       The learned counsel representing the State sought to sustain the order

         passed by the learned Magistrate and the subsequent registration of the

         FIR by the Police, pointing out that a cognizable offence has been made

         out and satisfaction has been recorded by the learned Magistrate with

         reference to the contents of the application and the materials produced.

         It is stated that the requirements of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_29">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_30">154(3)</a> of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">3</span>
    (2017) 5 SCC 533
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                        6</span>


     <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_31">CrPC</a> stand satisfied in the instant case and the contention to the

     contrary is not correct or sustainable.      The learned counsel further

     submits that the appeal itself is not maintainable, by virtue of the specific

     bar under the proviso to Section 2(1) of the Chhattisgarh High Courts

     (Appeal to Division Bench) Act, 2006 (for short, 'the Act'); adding that the

     decisions sought to be relied on by the Appellants, including, in Ram

     Kishan Fauji's case (supra) do not come to the rescue of the Appellants

     in this regard. Reliance is sought to be placed on the common judgment

     dated 24.06.2015 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in Writ

     Appeal Nos. 181/2015 and 206/2015 to the effect that no appeal will lie

     against the verdict passed by the learned Single Judge in the writ petition

     filed with reference to the order passed by the learned Magistrate under

     <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_32">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC. Various other rulings are also sought to be

     relied on in support of the contentions, which will be discussed later.


</p><p id="p_10">8.   With regard to the primary contention raised by the Appellants as to the

     non-satisfaction of the requirements under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_33">Section 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_34">154(3)</a> of

     the CrPC before proceeding with under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_35">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC, this

     Court finds it appropriate to extract the relevant provisions for clear

<p id="p_12">9.    The gist of the above provisions is to the effect that; <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_36">Section 154(1)</a> casts

      a duty upon the Police Officer in-charge of police station to register a

      crime, if information is obtained to him as to the commission of a

      cognizable offence as mentioned therein.         Under sub-Section (3) of

      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_37">Section 154</a>, any person aggrieved by refusal on the part of such Police

      Officer to discharge his duty under sub-Section (1), may send the

      substance of such information in writing and by post to the

      Superintendent of Police, who has to deal with the matter as specified

      therein. <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_38">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC deals with Police Officer's power to

      investigate the cognizable case without an order of the Magistrate and

      under sub-Section (3), it is stipulated that any Magistrate empowered

      under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_39">Section 190</a> may order such an investigation as mentioned in sub-

      Sections (1) and (2).

      complaints to harass persons of dislike in various ways by invoking the

      power under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_40">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC, the Apex Court heavily came
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          8</span>


      against such steps/course in Priyanka Srivastava's case (supra) and it

      was held that, it was quite necessary to file an 'affidavit' of the informant

      along with the application filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_41">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC so as to

      make the informer responsible for the course of action, if found to be

      proceeded against later. The Apex Court also made it clear that, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_42">Section

      156(3)</a> proceeding cannot be taken as a matter of routine and it should

      precede the circumstances envisaged under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_43">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_44">154(3)</a>

      of the CrPC.      The Apex Court emphasized that there had to be

      application of mind on the part of the Magistrate which should be

      reflected in the order passed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_45">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC. The

      question is whether the said requirements have been satisfied in the

      instant case or not.

      discussed in detail.     The relevant portion with regard to filing of

      application before the Police Officer on 21.04.2019 is adverted to in the

      bottom paragraph of the 4th page's order, which is to the following effect :

<p id="p_25">17.   On going through the order passed by the Magistrate, the learned Single

      Judge observed that cognizable offence was, prima-facie, made out and

      there was no reason to interdict the said order. It is also revealed that

      the Police, despite revealing cognizable offences, caused the matter to

      be sent for Mediation (with steps of counselling), to which it appears that

      the wife of the 1st Appellant was not amenable. It was because of the

      lapse on the part of the Police Officer in discharging the duty under

      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_48">Section 154(1)</a> of the CrPC and lethargy on the part of the

      Superintendent of Police under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_49">Section 154(3)</a> of the CrPC, that the 3 rd

      Respondent was compelled to approach the Magistrate's Court under

      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_50">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC, in turn leading to Annexure-A/2 order,

      directing the Police Officer to register FIR and to investigate the matter.

      the Police Officer under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_51">Section 154(1)</a> of the CrPC and as to the filing of

      petition before Superintendent of Police on 30.04.2019 (despite which no

      action has been taken), the learned counsel for the Appellants points out

      that the Police had relegated the parties for counselling and in the said

      circumstance, if the 3rd Respondent was aggrieved in any manner, it was

      for him to have filed a fresh application/complaint before the Police

      Officer had refused to register the Crime, if cognizable offence was made

      out, it was for the 3rd Respondent to move the Superintendent of Police in

      terms of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_53">Section 154(3)</a> of the CrPC; before filing a complaint petition

      before the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_54">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC.           We find it

      difficult to accept the said proposition as the requirement to satisfy the

      provisions under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_55">Sections 154(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_56">154(3)</a> of the CrPC and as to filing

<p id="p_30">20.      The above provision clearly mentions that no appeal will lie against

         various judgments / rulings cited from the part of both the Appellants and

         the Respondents/State. A three member Bench of the Apex Court held

         in <a href="/doc/412326/" id="a_64">Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy and Others vs. V. Narayana

         Reddy and Others4</a> that an order made under sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_65">Section

         156</a> of the CrPC is in the nature of a peremptory reminder or intimation to

         the police to exercise their plenary powers of investigation under <a href="/doc/731949/" id="a_66">Section

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">4</span></a>

         156(1) and that such an investigation embraces the entire continuous

         process which begins with the collection of evidence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_67">Section 156</a>

         and ends with a report or charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_68">Section 173</a>. The Bench

         also made it clear that the object of an investigation under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_69">Section 202</a>,

         on the other hand, is not to initiate a fresh case on the basis of police

         report but to assist the Magistrate in completing the proceedings already

         instituted upon a complaint before him.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">22.      <a href="/doc/1938541/" id="a_70">In Mohd. Yousuf vs. Afaq Jahan (Smt.) and Another</a> 5, a two member

         Bench of the Apex Court held that any judicial Magistrate, before taking

         cognizance of the offence, can order investigation under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_71">Section 156(3)</a>

         of the CrPC. But if he does so, he is not to examine the complainant on

         oath because he was not taking cognizance of any offence therein.

         Once the Police Officer is directed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_72">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC, it is

         the duty of the Officer in-charge to register an FIR and to conduct the

         investigation.   It was also held by the Apex Court that there is no

         particular    format   for   a   complaint   and   hence   nomenclature   is

         inconsequential; adding that a petition to the Magistrate containing an

         allegation that an offence has been committed and ending with a prayer

         that the culprits be suitably dealt with is a complaint good enough.

         and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_76">156(3)</a>, was explained by the Apex Court in a two member Bench

         judgment in <a href="/doc/1836621/" id="a_77">Sakiri Vasu vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others6</a>, where

         it was held that, on a petition under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_78">Section 156(3)</a>, the Magistrate can

         direct the FIR to be registered and can also direct a proper investigation

         to be made.     Further, in a case where, according to the aggrieved

         person, no proper investigation was made, the Magistrate can, under the

         same    provision,   monitor   the    investigation   to   ensure    a   proper

         investigation. It was held by the Apex Court that <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_79">Section 156(3)</a> of the

         CrPC provides for a check by the Magistrate on the Police performing its

         duties under Chapter XII of the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_80">CrPC</a> and in cases where the Magistrate

         finds that the Police has not done its duty of investigating the case at all,

         or has not done it satisfactorily, he can issue a direction to the Police to

         do the investigation properly, and can monitor the same. It was also

         made clear that <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_81">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC is wide enough to include all

         such powers in a Magistrate which are necessary for ensuring a proper

         investigation on the different counts as mentioned above. The above

         observations were made by the Apex Court deprecating the move on the

         part of the litigants in rushing to the High Court by filing petitions under

         <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_82">Section 482</a> of the CrPC or otherwise, without causing the remedy as

         provided under the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_83">CrPC</a> exhausted as mentioned above.

         the scope of <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_85">Section 2</a> and its proviso under the M.P. Uchcha Nyayalaya

         (Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005 [which is almost similar

         to <a href="/doc/1755673/" id="a_86">Section 2</a> of the State Act, 2006 as applicable here].            The verdict

         passed by the learned Single Judge was challenged directly before the

         Apex Court by filing SLP, which was disposed off, for causing the matter

         superintendence under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_87">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, against

         which Letters Patent Appeal was preferred, was not maintainable.

         Referring to the facts involved, the Apex Court held that it was open to

         the Respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court both under

         <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_88">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_89">227</a> of the Constitution of India and once such jurisdiction

         was invoked and when the writ petition was dismissed on merits, it

         cannot be said that the learned Single Judge had exercised the

         jurisdiction only <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_90">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India. The Bench held

         that the High Court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the

         prayer involved in the writ petition, which prayed for quashing of the

         assessment passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax,

         levying the purchase as well as entry Tax. The nomenclature / cause

         the remedy by way of appeal.

permissible in such a situation which is an essential rule and must be

strictly complied with. It is also pointed out that, if it does not disclose

any cognizable offence, in appropriate cases as mentioned, a

'preliminary enquiry' within a short time (seven days) is possible, only to

ascertain whether any cognizable offence is made out and it is not to

ascertain veracity or otherwise of the information received. The Bench

held that the proper stage for verification of the veracity of the information

received is only after registration of the FIR and not before. It was also

asserted by the Bench that, the Police Officer cannot avoid his duty of

registering FIR, if cognizable offence was disclosed. By virtue of the

specific terminology 'shall' used in the provision {<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_97">Section 154(1)</a>} it is

stated as mandatory; adding that <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_98">Section 154(1)</a> does not confer any

discretion on the Officer in-charge of the police station for embarking

upon a preliminary enquiry prior to registration of FIR. It was also made

clear that the expression 'information' under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_99">Section 154</a> CrPC is not

qualified by the prefix 'reasonable' or 'credible'. It will be worthwhile to

extract the conclusion/directions reached / given by the Bench as

contained in paragraph 120 of the judgment, which is reproduced below :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">         "Conclusion/Directions:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">             120.    In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold:
             120.1. Registration of FIR is mandatory under
         Section 154 of the Code, if the information discloses
         commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary
         inquiry is permissible in such a situation.</blockquote><p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">             120.2. If the information received does not disclose
         a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an
         inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                         19</span>


ascertain whether cognizable offence is disclosed or
not.
</p><p id="p_41">    120.3. If the inquiry discloses the commission of a
cognizable offence, the FIR must be registered. In cases
where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the complaint,
a copy of the entry of such closure must be supplied to
the first informant forthwith and not later than one week.
It must disclose reasons in brief for closing the
complaint and not proceeding further.
</p><p id="p_42">    120.4. The police officer cannot avoid his duty of
registering offence if cognizable offence is disclosed.
Action must be taken against erring officers who do not
register the FIR if information received by him discloses
a cognizable offence.
</p><p id="p_43">    120.5. The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to
verify the veracity or otherwise of the information
received but only to ascertain whether the information
reveals any cognizable offence.
</p><p id="p_44">    120.6. As to what type and in which cases
preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the
facts and circumstances of each case. The category of
cases in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">    (a)   Matrimonial disputes/ family disputes
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">    (b)   Commercial offences
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">    (c)   Medical negligence cases
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">    (d)   Corruption cases
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">    (e)     Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches
in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3
months delay in reporting the matter without
satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay.</blockquote><p id="p_45">
    The aforesaid are only illustrations and not
exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant
preliminary inquiry.
</p><p id="p_46">    120.7. While ensuring and protecting the rights of
the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry
should be made time bound and in any case it should
not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the
causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry.
</p><p id="p_47">     120.8. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily
Diary is the record of all information received in a police
station, we direct that all information relating to
cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of
FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and
meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the decision
to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected,
as mentioned above."

         'preliminary enquiry' mainly held in matrimonial / family disputes, however

         making it clear that, such preliminary enquiry does not mean veracity of

         'information', but to ascertain whether 'information' discloses any

         cognizable offence and that alone.      This clearly means, if cognizable

         offence is already made out in the petition, it is not necessary to conduct

         any preliminary enquiry as a pre-requisite before registering FIR.


</p><p id="p_54">30.      It was asserted by a three member Bench of the Apex Court in Ram

         Kishan Fauji's case (supra) that no Letters Patent Appeal lies against

         an order passed by the Single Bench of the High Court in exercise of the

         criminal jurisdiction. The Bench held that the vital factor for determination

         of maintainability of Letters Patent Appeal is the nature of jurisdiction

         invoked by the party and root nature of the order passed by the Single

         Bench of the High Court. It was a case where FIR was 'recommended' to

         be registered as per the order passed by the Lokayukta which was

         subjected to challenge in the writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_110">Article 226</a> of the

         Constitution of India for quashing the recommendation of the Lokayukta,

         as recommendation would have led to lodging of criminal prosecution.

         Highlighting the principles as to the distinction between the powers under

         <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_111">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_112">227</a> of the Constitution of India, the Bench held that the

         nomenclature of the proceeding was not of much relevance in

         determining the true nature of the proceedings; adding that a statement

     (2018) 10 SCC 443
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                    22</span>


by the Single Judge of the High Court that he has exercised power under

<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_113">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India cannot take away the right of

appeal (Letters Patent Appeal) against said judgment, if the power was

otherwise found to have exercised under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_114">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India; adding further that a writ petition which assails the order of a Civil

Court in the High Court had to be understood in all circumstances, to be

a challenge and determination under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_115">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of

India.    It was accordingly held that the order passed by the learned

Single Judge in the said case quashing the recommendation of the

Lokayukta was not liable to be appealed against.        The observation and

direction in paragraphs 61 and 62 are relevant, which are reproduced

below :
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">               "61. In the case at hand, the writ petition was filed
          under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_116">Article 26</a> of the Constitution for quashing of the
          recommendation of the Lokayukta. The said
          recommendation would have led to launching of criminal
          prosecution, and, as the factual matrix reveals, FIR was
          registered and criminal investigation was initiated. The
          learned Single Judge analysed the report and the
          ultimate recommendation of the statutory authority and
          thought it seemly to quash the same and after quashing
          the same, as he found that FIR had been registered, he
          annulled it treating the same as a natural consequence.
          Thus, the effort of the writ petitioner was to avoid a
          criminal investigation and the final order of the writ court
          is quashment of the registration of FIR and the
          subsequent investigation. In such a situation, to hold
          that the learned Single Judge, in exercise of jurisdiction
          under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_117">Article 26</a> of the Constitution, has passed an order
          in a civil proceeding as the order that was challenged
          was that of the quasi- judicial authority, that is, the
          Lokayukta, would be conceptually fallacious. It is
          because what matters is the nature of the proceeding,
          and that is the litmus test.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">          62. In view of the aforesaid prismatic reasoning, the
          irresistible conclusion is that the Letters Patent Appeal
          was not maintainable before the Division Bench and,
          consequently, the order passed therein is wholly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                        23</span>


              unsustainable and, accordingly, it is set aside. However,
              as the State had been diligently agitating its grievance in
              a legal forum which it thought had jurisdiction, we grant
              liberty to the State to assail the order of the learned
              Single Judge in accordance with law."

<p id="p_56">31.   It was held by a Division Bench of this Court, in a common judgment

      passed on 24.06.2015 in WA No.181/2015 and WA No.2016/2015, that

      no appeal will lie in respect of an order passed by the learned Single

      Judge with reference to a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_118">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC.

      It was also held that, merely by labelling Writ Petitions (Criminal) as

      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_119">Article 226</a> of the Constitution will not detract from the nature of

      jurisdiction exercised by the learned Single Judge, which is supervisory

      in nature, under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_120">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, thus, declining to

      entertain the appeals and dismissed the same as not maintainable.


</p><p id="p_57">32.   The learned counsel for the Appellants submits that, if appeal is not

      maintainable against the verdict passed by the learned Single Judge by

      virtue of the proviso to <a href="/doc/706692/" id="a_121">Section 2</a> of the Act, 2006, treating it as an order

      passed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_122">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, it is still

      maintainable since the writ petition filed was also challenging Annexure-

      A/4 FIR registered by the Police pursuant to the Annexure-A/3 order. We

      are not impressed by the said submission. Annexure-A/4 FIR is only a

      consequential proceeding in discharging of the official duty of the Police

      Officer, having obtained a direction from the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_123">Section

      156(3)</a> of the CrPC to register the FIR and to conduct the investigation.

      As made clear by the Apex Court in the decision cited supra, there is no

      option for the Police Officer to refrain from the registration of FIR, once

      he has been directed by the Magistrate for registration of the FIR under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                        24</span>


      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_124">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC. So also, the Magistrate had forwarded the

      matter directing to register FIR and to conduct investigation on

      satisfaction of the cognizable offence made out from the proceedings.

      As it stands so, it is no more open for the Police Officer to conduct a

      'preliminary enquiry' and arrive at a finding, to see whether any

      cognizable offence is made out or not; which otherwise will virtually

      amount to sitting in appeal over the order passed by the Magistrate. As

      such, there is absolutely no merit in the contention putforth by the

      Appellants that a 'preliminary enquiry' was mandatorily to be conducted

      by the Police Officer, it being a 'matrimonial dispute', in the light of law

      declared by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Lalita Kumari's

      case (supra). The position is clear from the discussion, conclusion and

      directions given by the Apex Court at 'para 120.6' to the effect that

      preliminary enquiry may be contemplated in              cases involved in

      Matrimonial disputes/family disputes, Commercial offences, Medical

      negligence cases, Corruption cases and cases where there is abnormal

      delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3

      months' delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the

      reasons for delay and the further direction in conclusion/directions in

      paragraph '120.5' to the effect that such preliminary enquiry is only to find

      whether any cognizable offence is committed or not and never to verify

      the correctness of the information.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">33.   In the light of the specific provision under <a href="/doc/706692/" id="a_125">Section 2</a> of the Act, 2006 and

      the 'proviso' thereunder and the effect of the rulings mentioned above, no

      appeal is maintainable in respect of an order passed by the learned

      India. Going by the nature pleadings, prayers and proceedings and the

      verdict passed by the learned Single Judge, it is quite evident that the

      correctness and sustainability of the Annexure-A/2 order passed by the

      Magistrate in exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_127">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC

      was put to scrutiny, which is only in the supervisory jurisdiction under

      <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_128">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India and as such, it cannot but be held

      that this appeal is not maintainable. Similarly, this Court finds that the

      contention raised by the Appellants that there is no complaint under

      <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_129">Section 154(1)</a> / <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_130">154(3)</a> of the CrPC prior to invocation of the power

      under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_131">Section 156(3)</a> of the CrPC by the Magistrate, is contrary to the

      correct factual position as disclosed from the materials on record. It is

      further seen that there is 'proper application of mind' on the part of the

      Magistrate and the same is reflected in Annexure-A/2 order, scope of

      which was considered by the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">34.   In the above facts and circumstances, we are of the view that no relief

      can be extended to the Appellants and the challenge raised against the

      order passed by the learned Single Judge is not liable to be sustained,

      besides the fact that the appeal itself is not maintainable at all.


</p><p id="p_62">35.   We find no merit in the contentions raised by the Appellant and the

      appeal stands dismissed, on both the counts, as to the merits and

      maintainability. It is however added that, the observations made by the

      learned Single Judge and this Court are only to the limited extent for

      considering the sustainability of the course of action pursued by the

      Magistrate in ordering the Crime to be registered under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_132">Section 156(3)</a> of

      the CrPC and to conduct investigation and it is never to deal with the
