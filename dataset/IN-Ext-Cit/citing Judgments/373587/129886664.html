   settled principle of law that in a case of circumstantial evidence, the 

   prosecution has to prove and establish each and every circumstance, 

   on   which   they   rely   ;   the   circumstances   so   proved   must   be 

   inconsistent with any hypothesis of innocence of the accused and the 

   circumstances  proved  must  form  a complete  chain establishing  the 

   guilt   of   the   accused.       Learned   Addl.   PP   submitted   that   if   the 

   circumstances   so   proved   are   pointing   towards   the   guilt   of   the 

   accused, then the motive need not be proved.  However, in this case, 

   the motive has also been proved.   Ld. Addl. PP further submitted that 

   in the present case, the prosecution mainly intends to prove the guilt 

   of   the   accused   by   proving   the   circumstance   of   "LAST   SEEN", 

   secondly absconding from his house, thirdly the recovery of weapon 

   of offence and the shirt, which he was wearing at the time of incident ; 

   fourthly detection of the blood  on the weapon of offence i.e. Knife Ex. 

   P­1 as well as on the shirt of the accused and fifthly the motive.

were the planted witnesses is evident from the fact that PW­3 stated 

that Kayamuddin was wearing a light blue colour baniyan, but does 

not say about the colour of the pant and stated that there was slightly 

darkness.     She   also   does   not   know   the   colour   of   the   shirt   of   the 

accused Babloo Chauhan or whether Babloo Chauhan was wearing 

the pant or not.    In the present context, it is not possible for PW­3,

colour of the baniyan as told by the PW­3 does not tally with the other 

documents/evidence, as according to the postmortem report Ex. PW­

statement.       PW­4   also   stated   during   cross­examination   that   dead 

body of the deceased was found in a small khada (pit), whereas no 

other witness stated so.  This also creates a doubt about the presece 

of PW­4 on the spot.    Ld. Counsel also submitted that there was no 

function of ladies sangeeta at the house of Rampal and no evidence 

to this effect has been adduced by the prosecution.   The onus was 

upon the prosecution to establish that PW­3 had gone to the house of 

Rampal   to   attend   the   ceremony   of   ladies   sangeet,   in   which   the 

prosecution   has   miserably   failed.       Neither   Rampal   has   been 

examined, nor any efforts whatsoever made by Ins. Ranjit Kumar to 

verify  that there was  any such marriage  ceremony  at the house  of 

Rampal.     The   prosecution   has   miserably   failed   to   prove   that   any 

ceremony of ladies sangeet took place on 08.04.2008 at the house of 

Rampal.  In support of his arguments, ld. Defence counsel has placed 

reliance upon the judgment cites as <a href="/doc/112415262/" id="a_8">Mohd. Rashid v. State</a>, 2009 (5)

   available  on record,    I find that in the  present  case,  there  are two 

   witnesses of last seen i.e. PW­3 and PW­4 and they were the chance 

   witnesses.    PW­3 stated that she had gone to the house of Rampal 

   to attend the ceremony  of ladies sangeet and PW­4 came there to 

   call her.  PW­4 is the son of PW­3.   When they were returning in the 

   night at about 12.45 am,   PW­4 pointed out to PW­3 and she also 

   noticed  the accused  going  with  the deceased.    It has come  in the 

   testimony   of   PW­4   that   there   was   sufficient   light   at   that   place   i.e. 

   Mercury   light,   where   they   had   seen   deceased   and   accused   going 

   together  and  there   is  no such  law  that  these  witnesses  cannot  be 

   relied upon. The only thing is that their evidence has to be cautiously 

   scrutinized.  In having this opinion, I found strength from the judgment 

   cited  as  <a href="/doc/1566250/" id="a_9">Sarvesh Narain Shukla vs. Daroga Singh</a>, AIR 2008 SC

       Both these witnesses stated that deceased was wearing baniyan. 

PW­4 also stated that deceased was wearing  jeans.   The witnesses 

does  not know the colour of the clothes  of the accused, but PW­3 

stated  that  deceased  was  wearing  a blue  colour  baniyan,  whereas 

according   to   the   postmortem   report,   it   was   white   colour   baniyan. 

Even in the photographs Ex. PW­17/9 to Ex. PW­17/16, it is clear that 

colour of baniyan  was white,  but this minor contradiction  about the 

colour of the baniyan, particularly when the witnesses had seen the 

deceased under a mercury light, is of not much importance.   These 

two   witnesses   are   not   related   to   the   deceased   or   to   his   family 

members.       The   defence   has   also   tried   to   make   out   a   case   that 

deceased  and his family  members  threatened  these  witnesses and 

also had a quarrel  with them that they have to depose against the 

accused.   Both these witnesses denied such suggestions.   Defence 

also tried  to make  out a case that PW­3 and PW­4 have previous 

criminal   history,   but   in   my   opinion,   this   also   is   of   no   help   to   the

accused, particularly when, no such evidence has been brought on 

record.    However, PW­4 had once gone to jail in a quarrel, but that 

also does not discredit a witness, particularly when, it was not either 

in relation to the deceased or the accused.     There is no record to 

show that PW­3 and PW­4 have any reason to falsely depose against 

the   accused   and   there   was   no   enmity   between   the   accused   and 

family of PW­3 and PW­4.   PW­3 and PW­4 had seen the accused 

lastly with the deceased that also at about 12.45 am and they had 

seen both of them going together in the direction i.e the park, where 

the dead body was recovered next date in the early morning at 7.20 

am, as the police received information about the dead body at about 

7.23 am  vide DD no. 13­A Ex. PW­20/A, which was recorded at 7.23

was just after the time when deceased and accused were seen going 

towards that park.     There is nothing on record that accused parted 

from  the deceased.      Defence  particularly  asked  the witness­PW­4 

that some other person might have met them therefore, but statement 

of PW­4 in this respect is very important as pointed out by the Ld. 

Addl. PP, who stated that the direction, in which they were going, no 

body goes there during the day time and they were going there at the

   anybody else.  There is no such defence of the accused also that he 

   parted away from the deceased and went home or that some other 

   place and does not know what happened thereafter.  The distance of 

   place where PW­3 and PW­4 lastly seen the accused with deceased 

   and the place where dead body was found was hardly five minutes

   when  the deceased  was  seen  last alive and when  he died is very 

   small.  Even the distance between the place where he was last seen 

   alive and his  dead  body  was found  is also  very  small.    Under  the 

   circumstances  the possibility  of any person other than the accused 

   being the author of the crime becomes impossible.

names are not mentioned in FIR, in my opinion, this fact itself does 

not mean that they were not the witnesses of the last seen.  It is well 

settled law that FIR is not the encyclopedia.  It is not required that it

the judgment cited as <a href="/doc/329579/" id="a_10">Baldev Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1996 SC 

372 and <a href="/doc/1279400/" id="a_11">Bishna @ Bhiswadeb Mahto v. State of West Bengal</a>, AIR 

2006 SC 302.   So far as the contradiction in the testimonies of PW­3 

and PW­4 about  the place  of work  of PW­4, in my opinion,  it is a 

minor contradiction and does not go to the root of the case.   Learned 

defence   counsel   also   stressed   upon   the   reference   of   Modi 

Jurisprudence   and   Toxicology,   but   I   do   not   find   any   force   in   this 

argument as body was identified by the sister of the deceased.   The 

defence does not dispute the identity of deceased and   PW­10 was 

also not confronted  or questioned  about the reference made in the 

book.       It   is   well   settled   principal   of   law   that   the   expert   must   be 

questioned   about   reference   made   in   the   book   before   he   is

  though by itself does not prove anything, but if seen along with other 

  circumstance,   it   points   towards   the   guilty   mind   of   the   accused. 

  These facts clearly show that accused absconded immediately after 

  commission of offence.

<p id="p_136">

</p><p id="p_137">48. Ld. Defence counsel submitted that accused had not absconded and 

  infact   he   had   already   left   Delhi   much   before   07.04.2008   and   no 

  quarrel as deposed by PW­1 and PW­2 has taken place between the 

  deceased and the accused on 07.04.2008 and if any such quarrel has 

  taken   place   as   deposed   by   these   two   witnesses,   some   complaint

  submitted   in   the   absence   of   any   complaint,   it   is   clear   that   this

  present at Delhi on 07.04.2008.  The fact that he was arrested from

   prove  that  accused   was   absconding,   in  which  the  prosecution   has 

   miserably failed.    IO of the case came to know that Babloo Chauhan 

   had a quarrel with the deceased from the statement of PW­1 and PW­

   2, but he did not make any effort to make inquiries at the residence of 

   the accused, as is clear from the testimony of PW­20 itself, hence it is 

   clear that accused was not absconding.  Even otherwise, PW­20 and 

   other   police   witnesses   must   have   deposed   that   they   went   to   his 

   house and he was found there.

   and no such incident had taken place.   PW­2 has specifically stated 

   that   when   the   quarrel   was   going   on,   he   was   not   there,   meaning 

   thereby, he was not the witness of any quarrel, which allegedly took 

   place on 07.04.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_142">

</p><p id="p_143">50.  After hearing the arguments and going through the testimonies and 

   other documents, I find that PW­1, PW­2 and PW­3 specifically stated 

   that   accused   was   living   with   his   brother   Jai   Kishan   in   Phase­III, 

   Sector­03,   Dwarka,   New   Delhi.     There   is   no   cross­examination   to 

   these  witnesses  on this  point  that  accused  was not residing  there. 

   There is no such suggestion to these witnesses that accused was not 

   residing there or that they have deposed falsely about this fact.   So 

   far as the quarrel  dated  07.04.2008  is concerned,  it was  a quarrel 

   between two friends as PW­1 has stated that deceased was a friend 

   of accused and it was also sorted out by the intervention of the father 

   of the deceased as has come in the testimony of PW­1 and PW­2 and 

   under  these   circumstances,   if  no  complaint   has   been   made  to  the 

   police, that does not mean that no such quarrel has taken place, as 

   deposed by PW­1 and PW­2.    So far his presence in Delhi and the 

   fact that he was staying with his brother, is concerned,  PW­1, PW­2 


                                                                                  ..........contd.

and PW­3 are consistent on this point.   No doubt, the accused in his 

statement  u/s 313  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">Cr.P.C</a>  denied  the fact  that  he was not residing 

with his brother in Delhi, but in reply to a specific question no. 48, he 

stated that "he left Delhi" meaning thereby that he was living in Delhi. 

He does not say that he was having any other address in Delhi or that 

he was not residing with his brother.  Even the defence suggested  to 

PW­1 that accused and deceased were friends.     This itself shows 

that   the   accused   was   living   in   Delhi   and   that   is   why   he   became 

friendly with deceased.    He was ultimately arrested from Azamgarh 

and after his arrest, he was produced before the Ld. CJM, Azamgarh 

on 15.04.2008.  This fact itself shows that he was not arrested from 

Delhi.  Police party reached Azamgarh as has come in the testimony 

of PW­11 that they reached Azamgarh on 11.4.2008 and they made 

the arrival entry at PS Kotwali Nagar, which is proved on record as 

Ex. PW­11/A and thereafter they came to know that Babloo Chauhan 

is lodged in Azamgarh Jail as a preventive measure due to election of 

Lok   Sabha   and   the   accused   gave   evasive   reply   that   he   does   not 

know.  The accused does not say that he was in judicial custody u/s

   case and to depose before the court and judicial notice of the same 

   be taken.   Even otherwise,   testimonies of the witnesses cannot be 

   discarded merely on the ground that they are from police force, when 

   they   are   reliable,   trustworthy   and   un­impeached.         Ld.   Addl.   PP

it was concealed under the heap of grass in between eucalyptus tree 

and the knife could not have been recovered as it was not visible from 

the   road.     It   could   be   recovered   only   because   of   the   accused. 

Similarly, shirt was recovered from the first floor of C­47, Phase­III, 

Sector­3, Dwarka and it was found in a polythene under the cot along

would support the prosecution case.     It is a well settled principle of

           and that also of human  original  strengthens  the same.    Blood was

deposed that Babloo Chauhan threatened his brother that  "Tu kal se

motive   of   the   accused   was   to   eliminate   the   deceased   and   the 

deceased  had   a  quarrel   just   one   day  prior   to  the  incident,   as  has

accused and deceased quarreled with each other only one day prior 

to the incident.   There is no cross­examination to PW­4 on this point. 

No doubt,  no complaint  was  lodged  by  the deceased  or his family 

members about the threat extended by the accused, but as deposed 

by the witnesses, the matter was settled by the intervention of PW­2, 

therefore they did not find it necessary to lodge a complaint.   Even 

otherwise, simply because a complaint was not lodged, this does not 

mean that no quarrel has taken place or no threat was extended by

the   opinion   that   there   is   no   specific   parameter   as   to   what   kind   of 

motive   should   be   there   for   committing   the   offence   of   murder.     It 

depends upon person to person and the facts and circumstances of 

each   case.     A   grave   provocation   for   some   person   may   not   be 

sufficient   motive   to   commit   murder   and   for   another,   slightest 

provocation is sufficient to cause murder.   In the present case, the 

accused   had   a   quarrel   with   the   deceased   on   07.04.2008   and   he 

extended threats to the deceased that he will kill him.  The  witnesses 

have used the words :­"Main ek, do din ke andar­andar, iska kam kar 

doonga" and "Tu kal se parso tak is duniya me nahi rahega".   It is 

also important to note that accused was kept in preventive detention 

by PS Kotwali Nagar at Azamgarh, so that Lok Sabha Election can be 

conducted   successfully   and   peacefully,   which   clearly   shows   that 

accused   was   a  threat   to  the   peace   and   tranquility     of  the   society, 

which also shows the criminal bent of his mind.  He had a quarrel with 

the deceased.    It was  not only  supported  by PW­1 and PW­2, but 

PW­4   also   stated   that   in   his   examination­in­chief   that     "I   told   my 

mother that yesterday both were fighting with each other and today 

they are going together."  The testimonies of PW­1, PW­2 and PW­4 

clearly  shows  that deceased and accused had a quarrel  with  each 


                                                                                 ..........contd.

   other, which was sorted out due to the intervention of PW­2.  Defence 

   has   suggested   to   PW­1   that   they   were   friends,   which   was   also 

   admitted   by   PW­1,   but   denied   by   PW­2.     In   view   of   the   above 

   discussion, I am of the considered opinion that accused had a quarrel 

   with   the  deceased  and  he  also  extended  threat  to  him  during  that 

   quarrel.   But, this in my opinion is not such a grave motive for which 

   a person would kill other.

<p id="p_200">

</p><p id="p_201">65.  Learned defence counsel  also argued that police has not properly 

   investigated the case and the accused has been falsely implicated ; 

   no attempt whatsoever was made to lift the finger print from the case 

   property such as disposable glasses, quarters bottles and chowmin 

   polythene  pack.      It is  in the  evidence  that  crime  team  along  with 

   finger print expert reached the spot, but no efforts whatsoever was 

   made   to   lift   the   finger   print   from   any   of   the   exhibits,   despite   the 

   availability of the experts.    In the report of the crime team, there is 

   no   mention,   how   many   plastic   glasses   were   found   on   the   spot. 

   However, the crime team Incharge was examined as  PW­8 and in his 

   examination­in­chief, he stated that only one plastic glass was found 

   on the spot, whereas according to PW­20 and other witnesses, two 


                                                                                    ..........contd.

   plastic glasses were found on the spot.  The report of the crime team 

   is also silent about the number of plastic pouches, whereas according 

   to PW­20, five pouches were found on the spot.     Ld. Counsel also 

   submitted  that  according  to prosecution  case,  the  accused  pointed 

   out the place of occurrence, regarding which pointing out memo was 

   also prepared, which is Ex. PW­13/A.   ASI Zile Singh prepared this 

   memo, but according to ASI Zile Singh, he was not knowing the place 

   of occurrence, but the evidence of PW­20 shows that ASI Zile Singh 

   was present on the spot as he is visible in the photograph taken on 

   the   spot   as   deposed   by   PW­20,   therefore,   pointing   out   by   the 

   accused is of no consequence.   It is prayed that keeping in view all 

   these contradictions, shoddy investigation and the fact that chain of 

   circumstances  is not complete, the accused be given the benefit of 

   doubt and he be acquitted.

<p id="p_203">

</p><p id="p_204">66.   Keeping in view the submissions of the learned counsels, I found 

   that in the present case, the prosecution has examined 22 witnesses 

   as   discussed   above   and   circumstances   have   been   proved   and 

   established by the prosecution.   So far as the discrepancies  in the 

   crime team report is concerned,  the witness has stated that he has 


                                                                               ..........contd.

   not mentioned the number of the glasses and pouches, found on the 

   spot,   whereas   in   the   seizure   memo,   the   number   of   the   same   are 

   mentioned.   Even otherwise, from the photographs also, it is clearly 

   visible that two plastic glasses and five pouches  were there on the 

   spot,   therefore,   this   discrepancy,   in   my   opinion   is   not   a   major 

   discrepancy and does not go to the root of the case. 



</p><p id="p_206">67.   The next contention  is about the finger prints,  but in my  opinion, 

   non­availability of the finger print  or non­lifting of the same does not 

   mean that accused was not involved in the crime.   Even otherwise, 

   there   is   shoddy   investigation,   but   the   evidence   and   circumstances 

   proved   on   record   by   the   prosecution   fully   prove   the   guilt   of   the 

   accused and benefit of the shoddy investigation cannot be given to 

   the accused.   In the present case, the prosecution has proved that 

   the deceased  was  lastly  seen  in the company  of the accused  and 

   immediately  thereafter,  dead body  of deceased was  recovered  and 

   according to the postmortem report, the time of death was just after 

   when the accused and deceased were seen together as deposed by 

   PW­3 and PW­4.  The other circumstance i.e recovery of knife Ex. P­

   1 i.e. Weapon of offence and shirt at the instance of the accused is 


                                                                                  ..........contd.

    also  proved.      The  accused  got  recovered  the knife  i.e weapon  of 

    offence and also the shirt and it has been proved by PW­10 in his 

    evidence that Ex. P­1­knife is the weapon, by which the injuries could 

    be caused, which were sustained and found on the dead body. 



</p><p id="p_208">68.  It   is   well   settled   principle   of   law   that   a   person   can   be   convicted 

    merely   on   the   basis   of   the   circumstantial   evidence   also   in   the 

    absence of ocular evidence, if the chain of circumstances as proved 

    is complete and subsequently,  the circumstances  proved on record 

    are inconsistent with any hypothesis of innocence of the accused and 

    the circumstances are well established.   If the circumstances proved 

    form a complete chain, even motive need not be established.  



</p><p id="p_209">69. In the present case, as pointed out, the most important circumstance 

    is the 'Last seen" of the accused with the deceased at about 12.45 

    am and according to the postmortem report Ex.PW­10/A, the time of 

    death was also given the same time.  Nobody has seen the deceased 

    alive thereafter and the dead body was recovered in the morning at 

    around 7.20 am.  It has also come in the evidence of PW­4 that there 

    was no possibility of anybody meeting the deceased and the accused 


                                                                                     ..........contd.

   thereafter, as even during day time, no body dare to go there, where 

   the deceased and accused were going in the dead of night at around 

   12.45 am.   It is not the case of the defence that accused separated 

   with the deceased after he was seen by PW­3 and PW­4 going with 

   the deceased.   The Time gap after the last seen and death is also 

   very less.  Even the distance between the place where they were last 

   seen  and place of death  is also very  less.    Coupled  with this  fact, 

   there is recovery of knife Ex.P­1 at the instance of the accused, on 

   which blood of human origin was  also detected  and that knife was 

   concealed under the heap of dried grass between eucalyptus trees 

   and it could not have been recovered, but  it was only the accused, 

   who got it recovered.   The accused also got recovered the shirt, on 

   which human blood was detected.         There is no explanation as to 

   how   the   human   blood   came   on   the   shirt.       The   accused   also 

   absconded after commission of offence.

   record,   I   am   of   the   considered   opinion   that   prosecution   has 

   successfully proved and established all the circumstances and all the 

   circumstances   form   a   complete   chain   and   gives   a   conclusive

         that accused is author of the offence.  All these circumstances proved
