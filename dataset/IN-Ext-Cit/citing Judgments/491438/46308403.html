</p>
<p id="p_13">                               Learned counsel representing the appellants has argued that it has

            come in the evidence of injured PW1-Gian Singh and PW3-Sujan Singh that

            the injured PW1-Gian Singh is not only known to PW3-Sujan Singh but has

            also sold his land to him which indicates that PW3-Sujan Singh, is an

            interested witness and, as such, his evidence could not be relied upon.

            Expanding his argument further, learned counsel has submitted that in the

            absence of evidence of PW3-Sujan Singh the only evidence that remains on

            record is the evidence of injured PW1-Gian Singh and it is not safe to sustain

            the finding of conviction only on his evidence in the absence of independent

            corroboration and even though the occurrence might have been witnessed by

            many because, as per admission of the injured PW1-Gian Singh, there were

            shops on both sides of the place of occurrence, but the prosecution has failed to

            examine any one from those shops to support its version. This, according to the

            learned counsel, establishes that story put up by the prosecution has no legs to

            stand on.

                               Learned counsel for the appellants has further argued that it has

            and the prosecution has failed to render any explanation, much less a plausible

            explanation, for the delay.

            the prosecution and the defence, and consider the record available before it to

            find out what offence, if any, is shown to have been committed by the accused

            and then <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_73">Section 354</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_74">Cr.P.C</a>., requires that every judgment, as the one in case

            in hand is, shall, inter alia, "contain the point or points for determination, the

            decision thereon and the reasons for the decision". This, in my view, is not a

            mere procedural formality. It, rather, aids the trial court to identify the areas of

            discord between the prosecution and the defence and, thereby facilitates the

            court to attempt at a resolution of those points so as to reach a just conclusion.

            In the case on hand the trial court, no doubt, has disposed of all the points

            raised by the defence but it has not attempted to find out what offence, if any,

            was, in fact, made out from the circumstances appearing on record. In his

            statement, Exhibit PA, before the Investigating Officer and while appearing as

            PW1 before the trial court, the injured PW1-Gian Singh has stated in so many

            words that the appellants ambushed him on the way and inflicted injuries on his

            person with an iron rod and a hockey stick, with an intention to kill him. It has

            also come in the medico legal report, Exhibit PB, and evidence of PW2-Dr.

            Parmodh Rishi that body of the injured PW, Gian Singh had thirty one (31)

            injuries when brought for medico legal examination. Out of these, injury Nos.

            3, 24, and 25 were found to be grievous in nature. Injury Nos. 6 and 12 are on

            the chest and injury Nos. 16 and 17 are on back side of the chest, injury No. 30

            is on the forehead and injury No. 9 is on the spine. A glance across the medico

            legal report, Exhibit PB, and pictorial diagrams, Exhibit PB/1, PB/2, and PB/3,

            reveals that no part of the body of the victim is left unhurt in the occurrence.

            From the circumstances a clear cut case punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_75">Section 307</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_76">IPC</a>, is

            made out. Had the trial court been a bit vigilant about the relevant provisions,

            the omission that led to framing of charge under <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_77">Section 308</a>, instead of 307,

            <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_78">IPC</a>, would not have occurred. Strangely enough, in paragraph 11 of the

            impugned judgment, trial court observed, "Some of the injuries are on vital

            parts, i.e., chest and head. Accused inflicted as many as 31 injuries on the

            person of complainant which shows their intention that they wanted to kill

            him." It also observed, and rightly so, that for constituting an offence under

            fight or provocation offered by the victim. In spite of this all, the accused have

            minor offences. Trial court did not make use of the power available to it to

            amend the charge at any stage of the trial. For a moment I toyed with the idea

            of amending the charge but on deeper consideration refrained myself from so

            doing in view of the fact that much water has flown down the Ganges since

            commission of the crime and the prosecution has thought it wasteful to remind

            the trial court at the time of framing of the cahrge or at any subsequent stage of

            the trial of an offence of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_83">Section 307</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_84">IPC</a>, being clearly made out, as also the

            fact that amendment of the charge, at this stage, is bound to prejudice the

            accused in so far as their entire defence is out and retrial may be necessary but

            the witnesses of the prosecution may not be available or capable of appearing

            for evidence because the injured PW1-Gian Singh himself was 60 years old

            when he came to depose before the trial court on 15.04.2002. In any case, no

            prejudice has been caused to the accused by the omission.

            that the injuries were on non-vital parts of the body, were caused by blunt

            weapon(s) and were not dangerous to life individually or collectively and, as

            such, the case goes out of the purview of <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_85">Section 308</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_86">IPC</a>.

                               The contention that PW3-Sujan Singh is an interested witness and,

            therefore, his evidence should be discarded, has not impressed me. A witness

            may be called "interested" only when he or she derives some benefit from the

            result of a litigation; in the decree in a civil case, or in seeing an accused

            person punished. A witness who is a natural one and is the only possible

            eyewitness in the circumstances of a case cannot be said to be "interested".

            Defence has not been able to bring any material on record, either in the cross-

            examination of the witnesses of prosecution or by leading evidence in defence,

            to show that PW3-Sujan Singh either has derived or is likely to derive any

            monetary or other benefit for himself or for any one whom he may be interested

            in, by incarceration of the appellants or that he had an animus hostile to them.

            His presence on the spot, at the time of the occurrence, was quite natural and he

            has not only been able to pass the litmus test of cross-examination successfully,

            but also his testimony is in consonance with that of injured PW1-Gian Singh,

            who being the injured his testimony deserves a special status in law. This is as

            a consequence of the fact that the injury to the witness is an inbuilt guarantee of

            his presence at the scene of the crime and because the witness will not want to

            let his actual assailant go unpunished merely to falsely implicate a third party

            for the commission of the offence. It cannot even be imagined that he would

            inflict 31 injuries, including three grievous injuries, on his body only to falsely

            implicate the appellants and there are no grounds, much less strong grounds,

            such as major contradictions and discrepancies for rejection of his evidence.

                                 reiterated observing that the testimony of a stamped
                                 witness has its own relevance and efficacy. The fact

            Indian Evidence Act, 1872, does not lay down that in proof of a particular fact

            a particular number of witnesses are required to be examined. Even otherwise,

            it is a matter of common knowledge that people do not come forward to depose

            in respect of an occurrence because they feel that the occurrence is a dispute

            between two individuals or parties and their deposition in favour of either of

            them is bound to incur wrath of the other and they would be required to make

            rounds of the court unnecessarily. It should suffice to refer to two, out of many,

            judgments recognizing relictance of the general public to depose as witnesses

                                           apathy of general public is indeed unfortunate, but it

                                           cities. One cannot ignore this handicap with which
                                           the investigating agency has to discharge its duties.
                                           The court, therefore, instead of doubting the
                                           prosecution for want of independent witness must
                                           consider the broad spectrum of the prosecution
                                           version and then search for the nugget of truth with

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                           ".... It is known fact that independent persons are
                                           reluctant to be witnesses or to assist the
                                           investigation. Reasons are not far to seek. Firstly, in
                                           cases where injured witnesses or the close relatives
                                           of the deceased are under constant threat and they
                                           dare not depose the truth before the Court,
                                           independent witnesses believe that their safety is not
                                           guaranteed. That belief cannot be said to be without
                                           any substance. Another reason may be the delay in
                                           recording the evidence of independent witnesses and
                                           repeated adjournments in the Court. In any case, if
                                           independent persons are not willing to cooperate
                                           with the investigation, the prosecution cannot be
                                           blamed and it cannot be a ground for rejecting the

            was recorded at 09.10 p.m. Thus, there has been no delay in recording of the

            the same solely on the ground of delay in lodging the first information report.

            Delay has the effect of putting the Court on its guard to search if any plausible

            explanation has been offered for the delay, and if offered, whether it is

            satisfactory or not. If the prosecution fails to satisfactorily explain the delay

            and there is possibility of embellishment in the prosecution version on account

            of such delay, the delay would be fatal to the prosecution. However, if the
