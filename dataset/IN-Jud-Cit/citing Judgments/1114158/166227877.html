<p id="p_2">2.     By    the   impugned      order,       the    IPAB   has     allowed    the

Rectification      Application     filed      by     Respondent       No.4- Sun

</p><p id="p_3">3.     It is the claim of the Respondent no.4 that the Respondent

no. 4 applied for registration of Trade mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot; on 30th

August 1989 and the registration was granted on 13th May

1994. The said registered Trade mark is falling in Class-5 i.e.

&quot;pharmaceutical products for human and veterinary use&quot;. It is

the claim of Respondent no. 4 that the said Trade mark is being

used since July 1991. The Petitioner filed Trade mark Application

on 28th January 1999 regarding the mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; in said

Class-5 and the Petitioner was granted registration for Trade

mark OFLOMAC on 12th December 2005 under Category-5 i.e.

October 2013 by the Respondent no.4 seeking cancellation/

Petitioner. The said application for removal of Trade mark from

the register was filed under <a href="/doc/188759/" id="a_3">Section 57</a> of the said 1999 Act. As

set out earlier by the impugned order dated 30th December

2020 of the IPAB, the said application was allowed.        The said

order dated 30th December 2020 is impugned in the present

writ petition.

</p><p id="p_6">      SUBMISSIONS OF PETITIONER :
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Mr. Kirpekar, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of

the Petitioner raised following contentions :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (i)   The Petitioner adopted the mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; which is

      combination of its medicine name &quot;OFLOXACIN&quot; and the

      company name &quot;MACLEODS&quot;. The date of application for

      registration of the trade mark is 28th January 1999, date

      of registration of the Petitioner&#x27;s mark is 12th December

2005 and date of first use of the mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; by the

Petitioner   is   28th    April       1999.    Since   then,     there    is

continuous use by the Petitioner. Drug license is also

issued by the statutory authority in favour of the Petitioner

for the mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot;.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">(ii)    Respondent      no.4    claimed        user    of    trade    mark

&quot;OFRAMAX&quot; since July 1991 but failed to produce any

documents to show that the said mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot; of

Respondent no.4 has been used prior to May 1999 and

invoices and statements are produced only since 2003.

</p><p id="p_9">(iii)   Suit for infringement of the trade mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot;

was filed against the Petitioner before the Hon&#x27;ble High

Court, Delhi by contending infringement of the trade mark

&quot;OFRAMAX&quot;         due    to    use     of     the   mark      &quot;OFLOMAC&quot;

(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Delhi Suit&quot;). No injunction

order was passed in the said Delhi Suit till date. The

Petitioner/Defendant filed Written Statement on 14th

January 2008 in said Delhi Suit and raised the defence

under <a href="/doc/1588473/" id="a_4">Section 30(2)(e)</a> of the 1999 Act. Issues were

framed on 29th April 2008 and initially issue regarding

infringement of the trade mark was framed and then by

consent of the parties, the same was deleted on 29th July

2011.

</p><p id="p_12">      (iv)   Admittedly, Respondent no.4 never raised the plea of

      invalidity of the petitioner&#x27;s mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; before the

      Delhi High Court. It is contented that, by allowing the issue

      of infringement deleted by conduct, the Respondent no. 4

      abandoned the right to raise the plea of invalidity.

</p><p id="p_13">      (v)    Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in the

      case of Patel Field Marshal Agencies and Another Vs.

      P.M. Diesels Limited and Others1, it is the contention of

      Mr. Kirpekar that in a situation where a suit is pending

      (whether instituted before or after filing of the rectification

      application) the exercise of jurisdiction by the prescribed

      statutory authority is contingent on a finding of the civil

      court as regards the prima facie tenability of the plea of

      invalidity.    He submitted that in a situation where civil

      court does not find a triable issue on the plea of invalidity,

      the remedy of an aggrieved party would not be to move

      under <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_5">Section 46</a>/<a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_6">56</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_7">Merchandise Act</a>,

      1958 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the 1958 Act&quot;) i.e.

      <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_8">Sections 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_9">57</a> of the 1999 Act but to challenge the order

      of civil court in appeal. This would be necessary to avoid

      multiple proceedings on the same issue and resultant

      conflict of decisions.   It is the contention of Mr. Kirpekar

that since Respondent no.4 never raised the plea of

invalidity and abandoned the same by their own conduct,

Respondent no.4 is not entitled to raise it again before the

IPAB. It is submitted that if the suit is pending before the

Civil Court, no plea of invalidity can be raised by the party

without following the due process of law as mandated by

the Supreme Court in Patel Field Marshal Agencies

(supra).     The    Respondent     no.4   never   raised   plea    of

invalidity before Hon&#x27;ble High Court, Delhi by filing the

application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_10">Section 124</a> (1)(b)(ii) of the 1999 Act for

framing of issues on the basis of plea of invalidity and for

satisfying    the    Hon&#x27;ble   High   Court,   Delhi   about      the

tenability of the plea of invalidity. Hence, the IPAB never

came in seisin of the rectification application filed by

Respondent no. 4. It is submitted that the application was

not maintainable in the eyes of law because it is not filed

under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_11">Section 124</a> (1)(b) (ii) of the 1999 Act but it was

filed under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure,

1908 (&quot;CPC&quot;) to circumvent the effect of abandonment of

plea of invalidity under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_12">Section 124</a> of the 1999 Act as held

in Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra).

</p><p id="p_14">(vi)   It is submitted that the right to raise the plea of

invalidity accrued to the Respondent no. 4 on 29th April

2008. The Respondent no. 4 could have filed application

under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_13">Section 124</a> by raising the plea of invalidity before

Hon&#x27;ble High Court, Delhi within time as contemplated by

<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_14">Section 124</a>. If in the year 2013, the Respondent no. 4

would have filed the aforesaid application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_15">Section

124</a> before Hon&#x27;ble High Court, Delhi, it would have been

barred by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_16">Article 137</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_17">Limitation Act</a>. Infact till date

no such application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_18">Section 124</a> is preferred by the

Respondent no. 4. Hence, the Respondent No. 4 has

abandoned the right to raise the plea of invalidity of the

Petitioner&#x27;s mark by virtue of <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_19">Article 137</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_20">Limitation

Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(vii) It is submitted that the actual use of the Petitioner&#x27;s

mark is prior in point of time. The Petitioner&#x27;s mark

&quot;OFLOMAC&quot; being used prior in point of time is entitled for

protection under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_21">Section 34</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_22">Section 12</a> of the 1999

Act which protects prior user and/or honest and concurrent

user of the same or similar mark. The IPAB has completely

overlooked that the documentary evidence clearly shows

that the Petitioner&#x27;s adoption is honest and if not prior then

certainly concurrent.
</p>
<p id="p_16">(viii) IPAB completely overlooked the fact that there is no

confusion or deception amongst the trade and public as

      well as medical practitioners as both the marks have been

      independently existing for more than 20 years and there

      hasn&#x27;t been any event of any confusion. It is submitted

      that    the     Petitioner&#x27;s    mark   &quot;OFLOMAC&quot;    is    used   for

      &quot;Oxfloxacin&quot;       tablets     and   Respondent   no.     4&#x27;s   mark

      &quot;OFRAMAX&quot;          is used for specialised injections that are

      administered by the specialised doctors only and can not

      cause any confusion in market. Hence, there is no

      probability against possibility of confusion and/or public

      interest as contended by the Respondent no. 4. Even

      doctors have certified that there is no confusion about the

      rival products of the Petitioner and Respondent no. 4.

</p><p id="p_17">      (ix)    The Petitioner relied on many judgments to contend

      that similar trade marks even in medicinal products is

      allowed.       We will make reference to those judgments as

      and when necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      (x)     It is submitted that first in the market will be

      protected over the first registrant of the trade mark in view

      his contention, Mr. Kirpekar relied on the decision of this

SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENT NO.4 :
</p>
<p id="p_20">7.   Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for

Respondent no. 4 made following submissions:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (i)    Registration of OFLOMAC as a word mark of the

     Petitioner was challenged by Respondent no. 4 before the

     IPAB on the ground of <a href="/doc/268914/" id="a_26">Section 9</a> (2)(a) and <a href="/doc/438099/" id="a_27">Section 11</a> (1)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (b) of the said 1999 Act. The trade mark of the Petitioner

     is of such a nature as to deceive the public or cause

     confusion. There is mark similarity of the Petitioner&#x27;s trade

     mark with earlier registered trade mark of Respondent

     no.4. The Respondent No. 4&#x27;s trade mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot; is of

     the year 1989 for the pharmaceutical products for human

     and veterinary use and the Petitioner&#x27;s impugned trade

     mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; is for the same goods i.e. &#x27;medicinal and

     pharmaceutical preparations&#x27; falling in Class-5 of the

     Fourth Schedule to the Trade Mark Rules, 2002.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (ii)   This is not a case of infringement or passing off, but

     a case to consider whether the Petitioner&#x27;s subsequent

     impugned     mark   is   entitled   to   be   registered,   when

     Respondent no. 4&#x27;s prior registered Trade mark has

     already been registered earlier.

     application of principles of law and in particular the test of

      deceptive similarity laid down by the Supreme Court in

      various decisions as also by this Court and other High

      Courts. There is no illegality or material irregularity which

      would warrant interference in exercise of extraordinary

      writ jurisdiction. Learned Senior Counsel relied on the

      judgments of the Supreme Court in Khalil Ahmed Bashir

      Ahmed Vs. Tufelhussein Samasbhai Sarangpurwala3,

      and of this Court in Ciba Ltd. Vs. M. Ramalingam4.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (iv) The IPAB consisted of a judicial member and at least

      one technical member, thereby constituting an expert

      body/Tribunal to deal with matters requiring specialised

      knowledge.     The impugned judgment was delivered by a

      Bench of IPAB consisting of Chairman and two technical

      members. The judgment of expert body/ Tribunal ought

      not be interfered with lightly.</blockquote><p id="p_21">

      May 2000 by Respondent no. 4 against the Petitioner

      seeking action for infringement of trade mark and passing

      off.   On 29th October, 2013, the Rectification Application

      was    filed   by   Respondent    no.   4   before   IPAB    and

      immediately on the very next day i.e. on 30th October

      Suit seeking stay of the suit pending in Delhi Court as

      provided under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_28">Section 124</a> of the said Act.            Vide order

      dated 8th April 2015, the Delhi High Court stayed the said

      suit awaiting decision of the IPAB in the said Rectification

      Application. He submitted that once the order is passed

      staying the Suit, all the necessary requirements in <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_29">Section

      124(1)(b)(ii)</a> were subsumed in it. He submitted that the

      Delhi High Court was satisfied that the Respondent No. 4&#x27;s

      plea   about    invalidity   of   the   Petitioner&#x27;s   impugned

      registration was prima facie tenable and therefore it stayed

      the Delhi Suit.   The order of Delhi High Court dated 8th

      April 2015 was never challenged by the Petitioner and the

      same has attained finality. Thus, now the Petitioner cannot

      raise an objection that the IPAB was not in seisin of the

      matter. He relied on the decision in the matter of Arun

      Chopra Vs. Kaka-Ka Dhaba5. The learned Senior Counsel

      submitted that in the case of Arun Chopra (supra)

      wherein Delhi High Court had allowed such application for

      stay of the Suit much subsequent to the Plaintiff filing the

      rectification application before the IPAB without any

      specific permission or leave.

Counsel that the Respondent no.4 in any event, could have

filed subject Rectification Application before the IPAB under

<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_30">Section 57</a> of the Act independent of the said suit. <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_31">Section

124(1)</a> of the Act provides that only when in the suit an

issue of invalidity of the registration of a party&#x27;s trade

mark is raised, the procedure contemplated under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_32">Section

124</a> (1)(b)(ii) of requiring the Court&#x27;s satisfaction as

regards the prima facie tenability of such contention can

arise. He submitted that when no such issue is raised in

the suit, this procedure/requirement is not attracted at all.

He submitted that the said suit was filed in the year 2000

and on the day when said suit was filed, there was no

registration of the Petitioner&#x27;s impugned mark.            The

Petitioner filed an application on 28th January 1999 and

the same was allowed on 12th December 2005 and

therefore actually and factually there was no registration

of the Petitioner&#x27;s impugned mark, when the said suit was

filed in or about May 2000.       Therefore, there was no

question of Respondent no. 4 applying to the Court for

recording satisfaction regarding prima facie tenability of

the challenge to such registration.   He submitted that in

Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble

Supreme Court has in paragraphs 28, 31 and 34 observed

that only when in the suit before the civil court, the issue

of invalidity of the registration of a trade mark has been

raised, the provision of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_33">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the 1999

Act, requiring the satisfaction of the court as regards

prima facie tenability of such contention, come into play

and not otherwise. Further, in paragraphs 31 and 34, the

Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has observed that where the issue

of invalidity is raised or arises independent of a suit, the

IPAB will be the sole authority to deal with the matter; and

thus, reliance of the Petitioner on Patel Field Marshal

Agencies (supra) is misplaced.

<p id="p_24">(vii) The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the

defence of honest concurrent user is based on <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_34">Section 12</a>

of the 1999 Act which gives power to the Registrar to

register two identical or similar trade marks provided there

is an honest concurrent user or there are some other

special circumstances. The invocation of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_35">Section 12</a> by the

Petitioner constitutes an admission that its impugned mark

OFLOMAC is deceptively similar to Respondent No. 4&#x27;s prior

registered trade mark OFRAMAX.         Such adoption of a

mark,   which   the   Petitioner   admits   and   accepts   is

deceptively similar to Respondent No.4&#x27;s prior registered

mark (registered 10 years earlier), cannot be said to be

      the honest concurrent user.            He submitted that the

      Petitioner has not truly carried out a proper and bonafide

      search to ascertain presence of Respondent no. 4&#x27;s

      registration as of 30th August 1989.          He submitted that

      the Petitioner&#x27;s adoption and use of impugned mark is not

      honest.    It is submitted that to secure the bonafides of

      honest    concurrent   user,     the   Petitioner&#x27;s    use   of   the

      impugned mark must be for a period prior to its date of

      application for registration of the impugned mark.                 On

      28th     January   1999,   the    Petitioner&#x27;s   application       for

      registration was filed on &quot;proposed to be used&quot; basis.

      Thus, the impugned mark had not been used by the

      Petitioner at all on 28th January 1999. Therefore, there is

      no question of invocation of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_36">Section 12</a> of the said 1999

      Act for justifying the registration. He relied on the Case of

      Charak Pharmaceutical Vs. M.J. Exports Pvt. Ltd6.

</p><p id="p_25">      (viii) It is submitted that as it has been held that the

      impugned mark is deceptively similar to Respondent no.

      4&#x27;s trade mark and therefore other submissions are of no

      significance. To substantiate said contentions, the learned

      Senior Counsel relied on following decisions:

      No.4 submitted that in Rectification proceeding what is

      relevant is that there is already a mark registered prior to

      the registration of the impugned mark.           In Rectification

      proceeding, the Tribunal is called upon to cancel the

      registration of the impugned trade mark by deciding the

      question as to who is the true and lawful proprietor of the

      registered mark, the impugned mark cannot be registered

      or continued to remain in the Register and its registration

      must be cancelled. It is submitted that the Petitioner&#x27;s

      impugned mark OFLOMAC is deceptively similar to the

      Respondent No. 4&#x27;s trade mark OFRAMAX on account of

      overall structural and visual similarity. It is correctly held

Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra) make it evident

that the question of abandoning the plea of invalidity

would not arise in a situation, such as in the present case,

where the subject Rectification Application was admittedly

filed and only the procedure under <a href="/doc/944811/" id="a_47">Section 124(1)(b)</a> (ii)

of the 1999 Act was allegedly not followed.    It is further

submitted that it is a settled principle of law that for

abandonment or waiver of a right, firstly some distinct and

positive act ought to be done to constitute a waiver, it

must be intentional and it must be with knowledge. It is

submitted that still there must be an unambiguous

representation arising as the result of a positive and

intentional act done by the party granting the concession

with knowledge of all the material circumstances and the

party to whom the concession is granted must have acted

in reliance of the concession.      All these elements are

completely missing in the present case and there is no

question of the Respondent no. 4 having waived or

abandoned its plea of invalidity.

     &#x27;Physicians are not immune from confusion or
mistake. Furthermore it is common knowledge
that many prescriptions are telephoned to the
pharmacists and others are handwritten, and
frequently handwriting is not unmistakably
legible. These facts enhance the chances of
confusion or mistake by the pharmacists in filling
the prescription if the marks appear too much
alike when handwritten or sound too much alike
when pronounced.&#x27;

The      defendant   concedes    that     physicians  and
pharmacists are not infallible but urges that the
members of these professions are carefully trained to
detect difference in the characteristics of pharmaceutical
products. While this is doubtless true to dos (sic) not
open the door to the adoption by manufacturers of
medicines of trade marks or names which would be
confusingly similar to anyone not exercising such great
care. For physicians and pharmacists are human and in
common with the rest of mankind are subject to human
frailties. In the field of medicinal remedies the
courts may not speculate as to whether there is a
probability of confusion between similar names. If
there is any possibility of such confusion in the
case of medicines public policy requires that the
use of the confusingly similar name be enjoined
(See Lambert Pharmacol Ltd. Vs. Bolton Chemical
Corporation).

</p><p id="p_108">30. In the case of Syntex Laboratories Inc. Vs.
Norwich Pharmacal Co. reported in 169 USPQ 1(2nd Cir.
1971), it is observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_109">      &quot;Stricter standard in order to prevent
likelihood of confusion is desirable where involved
trade marks are applied to different prescribed
pharmaceutical products and where confusion
could result in physical harm to consuming
public.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_110">31. Trade mark is essentially adopted to advertise
one&#x27;s product and to make it known to the purchaser. It
attempts to portray the nature and, if possible, the
quality of the product and over a period of time the
mark may become popular. It is usually at that stage
that other people are tempted to pass off their products
as that of the original owner of the mark. That is why it
is said that in a passing-off action, the plaintiff&#x27;s right is
&quot;against the conduct of the defendant which leads to or
is intended or calculated to lead to deception. Passing-
off is said to be a species of unfair trade competition or
of actionable unfair trading by which one person,
through deception, attempts to obtain an economic
benefit of the reputation which another has established
for himself in a particular trade or business. The action
is regarded as an action for deceit.&quot; [<a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_66">See Wander Ltd. V.
Antox India (P) Ltd</a>., SCC p.734, para 16.]

</p><p id="p_111">32. Public interest would support lesser degree
of proof showing confusing similarity in the case
of trade mark in respect of medicinal products as
against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are
poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal
products may, therefore, be life threatening, nor
merely inconvenient. Noting the frailty of human
nature and the pressures placed by society on
doctors, there should be as many clear indicators
as possible to distinguish two medicinal products
from each other. It is not uncommon that in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                            32</span>

hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or
under critical/pressure situations. Many patients
may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not
be in a position to differentiate between the
medicine prescribed and bought which is
ultimately handed over to them. This view finds
support from McCarthy on Trade Marks, 3rd Edn., para
23.12 of which reads as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     &quot;The tests of confusing similarity are
     modified when the goods involved are
     medicinal products. Confusion of source or
     product between medicinal products may
     produce physically harmful results to
     purchasers and greater protection is
     required than in the ordinary case. If the
     goods involved are medicinal products
     each with different effects and designed
     for even subtly different uses, confusion
     among the products caused by similar
     marks could have disastrous effects. For
     these reasons, it is proper to require a
     lesser quantum of proof of confusing
     similarity    for    drugs     and medicinal
     preparations. The same standard has been
     applied to medical products such as surgical
     sutures and clavicle splints.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_112">33. The decisions of English courts would be relevant
in a country where literacy is high and the marks used
are in the language which the purchaser can
understand. While English cases may be relevant in
understanding the essential features of trade mark
law but when we are dealing with the sale of
consumer items in India, you have to see and bear in
mind the difference in situation between England and
India. Can English principles apply in their
entirety in India with no regard to Indian
conditions? We think not. In a country like India
where there is no single common language, a
large percentage of population is illiterate and a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                         33</span>

small fraction of people know English, then to
apply the principles of English law regarding
dissimilarity of the marks or the customer
knowing about the distinguishing characteristics
of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods seems to overlook the
ground realities in India. While examining such
cases in India, what has to be kept in mind is
the purchaser of such goods in India who may
have absolutely no knowledge of English
language or of the language in which the trade
mark is written and to whom different words
with slight difference in spellings may sound
phonetically the same. While dealing with cases
relating to passing off, one of the important tests
which has to be applied in each case is whether the
misrepresentation made by the defendant is of such a
nature as is likely to cause an ordinary consumer to
confuse one product for another due to similarity of
marks and other surrounding factors. What is likely to
cause confusion would vary from case to case.
However, the appellants are right in contending that
where medicinal products are involved, the test
to be applied for adjudging the violation of trade
mark law may not be on a par with cases
involving non-medicinal products. A stricter
approach should be adopted while applying the
test to judge the possibility of confusion of one
medicinal product for another by the consumer.
While confusion in the case of non-medicinal
products may only cause economic loss to the
plaintiff, confusion between the two medicinal
products may have disastrous effects on health
and in some cases life itself. Stringent measures
should be adopted specially where medicines are
the medicines of last resort as any confusion in
such medicines may be fatal or could have
disastrous effects. The confusion as to the
identity of the product itself could have dire
effects on the public health.&quot;

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd</a>.24, the Supreme Court held that the

question whether two competing marks are so similar as to be

likely to deceive or cause confusion is one of first impression and

it is for the court to decide it. The question has to be

approached from the point of view of a man of average

intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the

overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two marks

Gluvita and Glucovita is likely to deceive or to cause confusion.

In deciding whether two marks are so similar as to be likely to

consideration.

&quot;3. Now, in considering both <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_69">Section 46</a> and <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_70">Section
10</a> it has got to be remembered that the primary
duty of the Court is towards the public and the
maintenance of the purity of the register. When a
case is sought to be made out that a particular
trade mark is likely to deceive or cause
confusion, the contest is not so much between
the parties to the litigation as it is a contest
between the party defending his right to a
particular trade mark and the public, and the
duty of the Court must always be to protect the
public   irrespective   of   what    hardship    or
inconvenience it may cause to a particular party
whose trade mark is likely to deceive or cause
confusion. The object of maintaining a trade
mark register is that the public should know
whose goods they are buying and with whom
particular goods are associated. It is therefore
essential that the register should not contain
trade marks which are identical or which so
closely resemble each other that an unwary
purchaser may be likely to be deceived by
thinking that he is buying the goods of a
particular person or a particular firm or a
particular industry, whereas he is buying the
goods at another person or firm or industry.&quot;

&quot;8. The learned Judge in coming to the conclusion
that he did has attached great importance to the
evidence given by the respondents of user of
their goods. In doing so, the learned Judge
overlooked the fact that if he was considering a case
falling under <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_71">Section 10</a>, the evidence of user
was entirely irrelevant. The only test that has to be
applied when the Court is considering a case falling
under <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_72">Section 10</a> is the test of identity or
resemblance. Even if the respondents could
establish a long user and if the appellants could
establish no user at all, if there was resemblance
between the mark of the appellants and the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                        36</span>

      respondents and if there was a likelihood of
      deception and if the appellants were first in the
      field and had their trade mark registered, then
      the respondents&#x27; trade mark could not be
      registered. The learned Judge has also taken into
      consideration the fact that although the respondents
      had proved large sales of their article, the appellants
      had failed to prove any case of actual deception. Here
      again, with very great respect to the learned Judge, he
      was in error because the approach under <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_73">Section 10</a> is
      not the same as in a passing off action. As the
      authorities have said, it is not for a witness or a
      large number of witnesses to tell the Court
      whether there is likelihood of deception. The
      Court cannot abdicate its own function which is
      to decide on looking at the two trade marks and
      on considering them phonetically whether they
      resemble each other and whether there is
      likelihood of deception. That function cannot be
      discharged by a person in the witness-box. It is true
      that the absence of any evidence of deception may be
      a material fact which the Court may take into
      consideration but if the resemblance between the
      two marks is clear and obvious, then it is the
      duty of the Court to remove from the register a
      mark which is likely to cause deception. Mr.
      Justice Chitty in In re, Hill&#x27;s Trade Mark, (1893) 10 RPC
      113 (B), emphatically staled: &quot;I state my opinion that
      directly it is apparent that if any part of a trade
      mark is calculated to deceive it is the duty of the
      Court to order it to be removed.&quot;

     true that the said drugs are supposed to be sold

</p><p id="p_122">21. I do not accept the submission of the learned
counsel for the defendant as I feel that it is more
dangerous if the pharmaceuticals products
bearing the same mark is used for different
purposes for the same ailment or even otherwise.
I also do not accept the contention of the
defendant‟s counsel that there would be no
confusion if the product contain different
ingredients/different salt. In my opinion, it is
more dangerous and harmful in the trade if the
same trade mark is used for different ailments.
The Apex court has already dealt with this
proposition of law in the case of Cadila Healthcare
Ltd. Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals, (2001) 5 SCC 73
and held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">    &quot;25. The drugs have a marked difference in
    the compositions with completely different
    side effects, the test should be applied
    strictly as the possibility of harm resulting
    from any kind of confusion by the consumer
    can have unpleasant if not disastrous
    results. The courts need to be particularly
    vigilant where the defendant&#x27;s drug, of
    which passing off is alleged, is meant for
    curing the same ailment as the plaintiff&#x27;s
    medicine but the compositions are different.
    The confusion is more likely in such cases
    and the incorrect intake of medicine may
    even result in loss of life or other serious
    health problems. In this regard, reference may
    usefully be made to the case of Glenwood
    Laboratories, Inc. Vs. American Home Products
    Corp. 173 USPQ 19(1972) 455 F.Reports 2d,

                that confusion or mistake in filling a
                prescription for either product could
                produce harmful effects. Under such
                circumstances, it is necessary for obvious
                reasons, to avoid confusion or mistake in
                the dispensing of the pharmaceuticals.&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      22. The other argument of the counsel for the
      defendant that the plaintiff‟s product is available in

      has also no force as it has been seen from
      experience of the pharmaceuticals products
      available in all over the world that most of the
      companies are making pharmaceuticals products
      in both the forms i.e. tablets as well as in injection
      form under the same trade mark. As per well
      settled law, the actual confusion and deception is
      not required in order to prove the case of passing
      off even if the defendant has adopted the mark
      innocently and the court comes to the conclusion
      that the two trade marks are deceptively similar,
      injunction under the said circumstances has to be

</blockquote><p id="p_123">24. The principles which are emerging from the decisions set

out hereinabove are summarised in the following manner:

</p><p id="p_124">(a)   When a particular medicinal or a pharmaceutical product is

involved as the impugned trade mark which may deceive the

public or cause a confusion with respect to another trademark, it

is the Court&#x27;s primary duty to take utmost care to prevent any




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                               43</span>
                                                         wp 1517.2022 .doc


such possibility of confusion in the use of trademarks.

</p><p id="p_125">(b)   Confusion   in   case   of    a   non-medicinal    or   a    non-

pharmaceutical product may only cause economic loss to the

person, but on the other hand, a confusion in terms of medicinal

or a pharmaceutical product may have disastrous effect on the

health. Hence, it is proper to require a lesser quantum of proof

of confusing similarity for such products.

</p><p id="p_126">(c)   The Court may not speculate as to whether there is a

probability of confusion between the marks. Mere existence of

the slightest probability of confusion in case of medicinal product

marks, requires that the use of such mark be restrained.

</p><p id="p_127">(d)   While arriving at a conclusion with respect to the similarity

and confusion between medicinal products, the same should be

examined from the point of view of an ordinary common man of

average intelligence instead of that of a specialised medicinal

practitioner. Courts must decide the same from the view point of

man with average intelligence considering multiple factors such

as the first impression of the mark, salient features of both the

products, nature of the commodity, overall similarity and the

possibility of the same creating a confusion amongst the public

at large.
</p>
<p id="p_128">(e)   The primary duty of the Court is towards the public and the

purity of the register. Duty of the Court must always be to

protect the public irrespective of what hardship or inconvenience

it may cause to a particular party whose trade mark is likely to

deceive or cause confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_129">(f)   The following rules of comparison can be culled out from

various pronouncement of Court from time to time.

</p><p id="p_130">      (i)     Meticulous comparison is not the correct way.
</p><pre id="pre_6">      (ii)    Mark must be compared as whole.
      (iii)   First impression.
      (iv)    Prima facie view is not conclusive.
      (v)     Structural resemblance.
      (vi)    Similarity in idea to be considered.
</pre><p id="p_131">(g)   The main object of maintaining trade mark register is that

the public should know whose goods they are buying. It is

therefore essential that the register should not contain the trade

mark which is identical by which purchaser may likely to be

deceived by thinking that they are buying the goods of a

particular company/industry whereas he is buying the goods of

another company/industry.

We are in complete agreement with the above conclusions

recorded by IPAB. If the above conclusions are examined on the

touchstone of various principles culled out from various decisions

as summarised above and comparison of the marks of the

Petitioner and the Respondent No.4, then it is clear that the

conclusions recorded by the IPAB are proper and legal and

recorded by applying the established principles to the same. It

is settled legal position that when a particular medicinal or a

pharmaceutical product is involved as the impugned trade mark

which may deceive the public or cause a confusion with respect

to another trademark, it is the Court&#x27;s primary duty to take

utmost care to prevent any such possibility of confusion in the

use of trademarks. The Court may not speculate as to whether

there is a probability of confusion between the marks. Mere

existence of the slightest probability of confusion in case of

medicinal product marks, requires that the use of such mark be

restrained. Confusion in case of a non-medicinal or a non-

<p id="p_138">27. It is required to be noted that the impugned order dated

30th December 2020 was delivered by Bench of IPAB consisting

of the Chairman and two Technical Members. It is settled legal

position that the judgment of expert body/ Tribunal should not

be interfered lightly.   In this case, the IPAB has taken into

consideration various factors to arrive at the conclusion that the

competing marks are phonetically deceptively similar and there

is possibility of confusion and deception.        Therefore, <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_75">Section 9</a>

(2)(a) and <a href="/doc/1969598/" id="a_76">Section 11(1)(b)</a> of the said Act are squarely

applicable to the Petitioner&#x27;s trade mark.

</p><p id="p_139">28. Mr. Kirpekar, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

submitted that IPAB completely overlooked the fact that there is

no confusion or deception amongst the trade and public as well

as   medical   practitioners   as    both   the   marks     have    been

independently existing for more than 20 years and there hasn&#x27;t

been any event of any confusion.            He submitted that the

injections that are administered by the specialised doctors only

and can not cause any confusion in market. Hence, there is no

possibility of confusion and/or public interest as contended by

the Respondent no. 4. Even doctors have certified that there is

no confusion about the rival products of the Petitioner and

Respondent no.4. We have already set out settled legal position

that in case of medicinal / pharmaceutical products, the Courts

should apply a stricter test. It is settled position that while

arriving at a conclusion with respect to the similarity and

confusion between medicinal products, the same should be

examined from the point of view of an ordinary common man of

average intelligence instead of that of a specialised medicinal

practitioner. Courts must decide the same from the view point of

man with average intelligence considering multiple factors such

as the first impression of the mark, salient features of both the

products, nature of the commodity, overall similarity and the

possibility of the same creating a confusion amongst the public

at large. We have already set out the reasoning given by the

Tribunal to arrive at conclusion that competing marks of the

Petitioner and Respondent No. 4 are phonetically deceptively

similar and there is possibility of confusion and deception. The

said conclusion is   proper and legal. The IPAB has given valid

reasons for coming to the said conclusion and the said reasons

cannot be said that said conclusion is without any basis.

relied on various judgments regarding pharmaceutical products

wherein competing marks were held not infringing the respective

trade marks in question.            Hereinafter we will consider those

judgments relied by Mr. Kirpekar.
</p>
<p id="p_141">(a) In F. Hoffman La Roche &amp; Company v Geoffrey

Manners and Company Pvt. Ltd.27, the Supreme Court was

considering whether the trade mark &quot;Protovit&quot; of the Appellant

was deceptively similar to the trade mark of the Respondent

namely     &quot;Dropovit&quot;.     While     considering   the   said   deceptive

similarity, the Supreme Court inter lia took into consideration the

aspect that (a) the terminal syllable &#x27;Vit&quot; in the two marks is

both descriptive and common to the trade and (b) last three

letters &quot;Vit&quot; is a well known common abbreviation used in the

pharmaceutical trade to denote vitamin preparations.

two marks, there is no difference in the composition of the two

drugs and both products are made of a single ingredient viz.

Azithromycin and, therefore, the question of causing any health

problem or side effects really does not arise. In that case, this

Court was considering similarity in competing trade marks

namely Aziwin and Aziwok. This Court observed as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">     &quot;In order to decide whether the word &quot;Aziwin&quot; is deceptively
     similar to the word&quot;Aziwok&quot;, each of the two words must,
     therefore, be taken as a whole word. Each of them consists
     of six letters, the first three letters &quot;AZI&quot; being common in
     both the words. The affidavit of the appellants indicate
     that various brands of Azithromycin tablets and syrup
     are marketed by different pharmaceutical companies
     using the common prefix AZI, which is derived from
     the generic name of drug and in fact the appellants
     have given a list of as many as 13 different names of
     the companies including the parties to the suit who
     are using the prefix AZI. It is thus apparent that the
     drug Azithromycin, being the base of these products,
     the word AZI has been commonly used in describing
     the product and no one can claim monopoly over the
     use of the said word. In fact any company producing
     Azithromycin tablets would be justified in using the
     said word as prefix to it&#x27;s trade name. The word AZI
     being both descriptive and common to the trade, the
     users of such product are not likely to be misguided or
     confused by the said word. Once it is held that the word
     &quot;AZI&quot; is common to the trade, then having regard to the un-
     common letters in these two words namely &quot;wok&quot; and &quot;win&quot;
     which are totally dissimilar and also having regard to the
     fact that even phonetically the two words are totally
     dissimilar, it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken or
     confused with the other. There is not even a remote chance
     of anyone being misguided by the two words......&quot;

medicinal and pharmaceutical preparation containing the drug

&quot;Cefixime&quot; to be marketed by the Plaintiff, whereas the

Defendant has also claimed that the words &quot;CEF&quot; is a prefix of

the formulation and is commonly used by the various companies

and there are large number of drugs which are already in market

with prefix CEF and thus the Plaintiff has no proprietary right nor

the said mark is any innovative design or innovation by the

Plaintiff and thus the Plaintiff is not entitled to use the said mark

derived from the chemical compound or salt Cefixime and there

are umpteen authorities on the proposition that where marks are

derived from     such pharmaceutical sales, these are weak

trademarks. Here the Plaintiff has taken the first four letters of

that LIV is an abbreviation of liver. This abbreviation has been

used in over 160 registrations as a constituent of the name

under which the products relating to treatment associated with

liver in the field of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations--

Homeopathic and Ayurvedic are being marketed. The word &#x27;Liv&#x27;

is, therefore, generic and common to trade as describing the

medicines associated with the treatment of liver. It has become

publici juris. In the field of medicines and pharmaceuticals, it is

common practice that the drugs are named either by the name

of the organ which it treats or by the principal ingredients or the

name of the ailment.       This enables a doctor to associate a

particular trade name with the organ, ingredient or ailment

thereby reducing chances of error.       No trader can therefore

restrain another trader from using the description of the organ,

ingredients or ailment.   The Delhi High Court further observed

that there are about 100 drugs in the market using the

abbreviation &#x27;Liv&#x27; made out of the word Liver - an organ of the

Trademarks under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_84">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958.

Prima facie, there is some evidence to show that the prior user

of the trademark &#x27;RIVOX&#x27; by the plaintiff in relation to his

antibiotic medicinal preparation and on the other hand, the

defendant has been able to establish its sales for the year 1999-

2000 which are in crores and its advertising and promotional

expenses for this product was in lacs of rupees during the period

1999-2000 and the plaintiff was aware of the defendant&#x27;s user of

the trademark since April, 1999 but did not chose to file the suit

promptly and, therefore, the suit can be said to be suffering

from delay/laches/acquiescence.

the case where the Court was concerning with interim injunction.

The Court took into consideration the aspect that the two drugs

Therefore, both the drugs are Schedule &#x27;H&#x27; drugs and since they

are required for treatment of a very serious disease, the same,

in all cases, expected to be purchased on the basis of a doctor&#x27;s

</pre><p id="p_158">Thus, reliance of Mr. Kirpekar on the above referred cases is not

of much significance.
</p>
<p id="p_159">31. In the present case we are concerned with final order

which has been passed by IPAB under <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_96">Section 57</a> of the said

1999 Act. Most of the authorities on which Mr. Kirpekar, the

learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner has relied

are concerning interim injunctions and, therefore, the said

decisions are on the basis of prima facie finding and do not

decide any issue conclusively. In most of the said decisions the

principle which has been used is that nobody can claim exclusive

right to use any generic word, abbreviation, or acronym which

has become publici juris.   In the trade of drugs, it is common

practice to name a drug by the name of the organ or ailment

which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug. Such an organ

ailment or ingredient being publici juris or generic cannot be

owned by anyone for use as a trademark. In the present case,

main ingredient of the product of the Respondent No.4 is

Ceftriaxone, whereas the main ingredient of the product of the

Petitioner is Ofloxacin. The product of the Respondent No.4 is

prescribed for severe medical indications amongst hospitalized

patients and perioperative prophylaxis patients for respiratory

tract infections, meningitis, pediatric infections and soft tissue



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                64</span>

infections. The product of the Petitioner is prescribed for enteric

respiratory tract infections, meningitis, gram negative bacterial

infections, infections of tissues and skin, infections of bones and

joints,   abdominal   infections   including   pelvis   inflammation,

infections of kidney, UT, genital organs and gonorrhea. The

Supreme Court has held that, when a particular medicinal or a

pharmaceutical product is involved as the impugned trade mark

which may deceive the public or cause a confusion with respect

to another trademark, it is the Court&#x27;s primary duty to take

utmost care to prevent any such possibility of confusion in the

use of trademarks. Confusion in case of a non-medicinal or a

non-pharmaceutical product may only cause economic loss to

the person, but on the other hand, a confusion in terms of

medicinal product or a pharmaceutical product may have

disastrous effect on the health. Hence, it is proper to require a

lesser quantum of proof of confusing similarity for such

products. The Court may not speculate as to whether there is a

probability of confusion between the marks. The mere existence

of the slightest probability of confusion in case of medicinal

product marks,        requires that the use of such mark be

restrained. The degree of resemblance between the two marks

must be taken into consideration while deciding the same.

Factors such as phonetic similarity or similar pronunciation can




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                   65</span>

cause a big confusion amongst the public. While arriving at a

conclusion with respect to the similarity and confusion between

medicinal products, the point of view of an ordinary common

man of average intelligence should be considered instead of that

of a specialised medicinal practitioner. The IPAB by recording

valid reasons has held that there is likelihood of confusion on

account of phonetic similarity along with margin to be kept for

imperfect pronunciation and imperfect recollection in multilingual

society in India. Thus, the decisions on which Mr. Kirpekar has

heavily relied do not assist the case of the Petitioner.

For the above reasons, we hold that the impugned trade

mark of the Petitioner is of such a nature so as to deceive

the public or cause confusion with respect to the trade

mark of the Respondent no. 4 as envisaged under <a href="/doc/645511/" id="a_97">Section

9(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/696256/" id="a_98">Section 11(1)</a> (b) of the said 1999 Act

28th April 1999. Mr. Kirpekar submitted that the rectification

same is barred by law of limitation and therefore IPAB has no

contained in the Schedule to the Act applies to Suits, Appeals

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">     &quot;9. Then we turn to the question of delay and
     acquiescence. Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned Counsel appearing
     for the Respondent cites the judgment of the Supreme
     Court in <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_117">Power Control Appliances and Ors. v. Sumeet
     Machines Pvt. Ltd</a>., MANU/SC/0646/1994 :[(1994) 1
     SCR708 wherein the Supreme Court approvingly referred
     to the judgment of the Appeal Court in England in
     Electrolux LD v. Electrix and quoted a passage therefrom
     in paragraph 34 of its judgment. Our attention was also
     drawn to the judgment in Electrolux itself. Reference to
     the judgment in Electrolux shows that there is no hard
     and fast rule that delay per se would defeat an
     application     for   interlocutory     injunction.     The
     judgment indicates that in a situation where the
     defendant to an action has been using the mark,
     even if concurrently, without making himself aware
     of the fact as to whether the same mark is the
     subject-matter of the registration and belongs to
     another person, the first person cannot be heard to
     complain for he has been using it negligently
     inasmuch as he has not taken the elementary
     precaution of making himself aware by looking at
     the public record of Registrar as to whether the
     mark in question is the property of another. If,
     however, he had taken search and, knowing full
     well that the mark was the property of another
     person, continues to use the mark, then he runs the
     risk of a registered proprietor challenging his action
     for infringement and merely because it is done at a
     subsequent stage, he cannot be heard to complain
     on the ground of delay. Further discussion in the
     judgment shows that in order to deny an interlocutory
     injunction, the delay must be such as to have induced the
     defendant or at least to have lulled him into a false sense
     of security to continue to use the trade mark in the belief
     that he was the monarch of all he surveyed. In our
     judgment, such are not the circumstances here. We are

      taken of the registry by the Appellant to assure
      itself that there was no other person who owned

As discussed hereinabove the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_118">Limitation Act</a> are

not applicable to the Tribunal/IPAB. Therefore, there is no

substance in the contention raised by the Petitioner that the

rectification application filed by the Respondent No.4 is barred by

limitation. There is also no substance in the alternate contention

that the application is belatedly filed. The above observations in

Bal Pharma Ltd. (supra) are squarely applicable to the present

case. The Supreme Court has held that, primary duty of the Court

is towards the public and the purity of the register. Duty of the

Court must always be to protect the public irrespective of what

hardship or inconvenience it may cause to a particular party

whose trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion. Thus,

there is no substance in the contention that the application of

rectification is barred by Law of Limitation or is belatedly filed.

the 1999 Act as held in Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra).

</p><p id="p_177">41. It is the contention of the Respondent No.4 that by order

the necessary requirements in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_124">Section 124(1)(b)</a> (ii) of the 1999

the Delhi High Court was satisfied about the tenability of

impugned registration and therefore the Suit was stayed. It is

further submission of Respondent no. 4 that the order dated 8th

Field Marshal Agencies (supra) held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">     &quot;31 Rather, from the resume of the provisions of the
     1958 Act made above it becomes clear that all
     questions with regard to the validity of a Trade
     Mark is required to be decided by the Registrar or
     the High Court under the 1958 Act or by the
     Registrar or the IPAB under the 1999 Act and not
     by the Civil Court. The Civil Court, in fact, is not
     empowered by the Act to decide the said question.
     Furthermore, the Act mandates that the decisions
     rendered by the prescribed statutory authority
     [Registrar/High Court (now IPAB)] will bind the
     Civil Court. At the same time, the Act (both old and
     new) goes on to provide a different procedure to govern
     the exercise of the same jurisdiction in two different
     situations. In a case where the issue of invalidity is
     raised or arises independent of a suit, the
     prescribed statutory authority will be the sole
     authority to deal with the matter. However, in a
     situation where a suit is pending (whether
     instituted before or after the filing of a
     rectification     application)   the     exercise    of
     jurisdiction by the prescribed statutory authority
     is contingent on a finding of the Civil Court as
     regards the prima facie tenability of the plea of
     invalidity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">     32. Conversely, in a situation where the Civil Court
     does not find a triable issue on the plea of

     Act but to challenge the order of the Civil Court in
     appeal. This would be necessary to avoid multiple
     proceedings on the same issue and resultant
     conflict of decisions.

</blockquote><p id="p_183">33. The 1958 Act clearly visualizes that though in both
situations i.e. where no suit for infringement is pending
at the time of filing of the application for rectification or
such a suit has came to be instituted subsequent to the
application for rectification, it is the Registrar or the High
Court which constitutes the Tribunal to determine the
question of invalidity, the procedure contemplated by the
Statute to govern the exercise of jurisdiction to rectify
is, however, different in the two situations enumerated.
Such difference has already been noted.
</p>
<p id="p_184">34. The intention of the legislature is clear. All issues
relating to and connected with the validity of
registration has to be dealt with by the Tribunal
and not by the civil court. In cases where the
parties have not approached the civil court,
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_137">Sections 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_138">56</a> provide an independent
statutory right to an aggrieved party to seek
rectification of a trade mark. However, in the
event the Civil Court is approached, inter alia,
raising the issue of invalidity of the trade mark
such plea will be decided not by the civil court but
by the Tribunal under the 1958 Act. The Tribunal
will however come into seisin of the matter only if
the Civil Court is satisfied that an issue with
regard to invalidity ought to be framed in the suit.
Once an issue to the said effect is framed, the
matter will have to go to the Tribunal and the
decision of the Tribunal will thereafter bind the
Civil Court. If despite the order of the civil court
the parties do not approach the Tribunal for
rectification, the plea with regard to rectification
will no longer survive.
</p>
<p id="p_185">35. The legislature while providing consequences
for non-compliance with timelines for doing of any
act must be understood to have intended such
consequences to be mandatory in nature, thereby,
also affecting the substantive rights of the parties.
This is how <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_139">Section 111(3)</a> of the 1958 Act has to be




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                             76</span>
                                                  wp 1517.2022 .doc


understood. That apart, it is very much within the
legislative domain to create legal fictions by
incorporating a deeming clause and the court will have
to understand such statutory fictions as bringing about a
real state of affairs between the parties and ushering in
legal consequences affecting the parties unless, of
course, there is any other contrary provision in the
statue. None exists in the 1958 Act to understand the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_140">Section 111(3)</a> in any other manner except
that the right to raise the issue of invalidity is lost
forever if the requisite action to move the High
Court/IPAB (now) is not initiated within the
statutorily prescribed time frame.
</p>
<p id="p_186">36. Thus, by virtue of the operation of the 1958
Act, the plea of rectification, upon abandonment,
must be understood to have ceased to exist or
survive between the parties inter se. Any other
view would be to permit a party to collaterally
raise the issue of rectification at any stage
notwithstanding that a final decree may have been
passed by the civil court in the meantime. True, the
decree of the Civil Court will be on the basis of the
conclusions on the other issues in the suit. But to
permit the issue of rectification, once abandoned,
to be resurrected at the option of the party who
had chosen not to pursue the same at an earlier
point of time would be to open the doors to
reopening of decrees/orders that have attained
finality in law. This will bring in uncertainty if not
chaos in the judicial determinations between the
parties that stand concluded. Besides, such an
interpretation would permit an aggrieved party to get
over the operation of a statute providing for deemed
abandonment of the right to raise an issue relevant; in
fact, fundamental to the lis.
</p>
<p id="p_187">37. The position may be highlighted by reference to a
suit for infringement where the defendant raises the plea
of invalidity of the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark and also in the
alternative takes up any of the defenses available in law.

     The defendant by operation of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_141">Section 111(3)</a> of the
     1958 Act is deemed to have abandoned the plea of
     invalidity. In the trial it is found that the defendant is
     guilty of infringement and is appropriately restrained by
     a decree of the Civil Court. If the right under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_142">Section
     46</a>/<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_143">56</a> of the 1958 Act is to subsist even in such a
     situation, the possible uncertainty and possible anarchy
     may well be visualized. This is why the legislature by
     enacting <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_144">Section 111</a> of the 1958 Act has
     mandated that the issue of invalidity which would
     go to the root of the matter should be decided in
     the first instance and a decision on the same
     would bind the parties before the civil court. Only
     if the same is abandoned or decided against the
     party raising it that the suit will proceed in respect
     of the other issues, if any. If the above is the
     legislative intent, which seems to be clear, we do not see
     how the same can be overcome by reading the rights
     under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_145">Sections 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_146">56</a> of the 1958 Act to exist even
     in a situation where the abandonment of the same right
     under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_147">Section 111(3)</a> has taken effect in law.

</p><p id="p_189">     38. The mandate of the 1958 Act, particularly,
     <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_148">Section 111</a> thereof, appears to be that if an
     aggrieved party does not approach the Tribunal for
     a decision on the issue of invalidity of registration
     as provided for under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_149">Section 111(2)</a> and (3), the
     right to raise the issue (of invalidity) would no
     longer survive between the parties to enable the
     concerned party to seek enforcement of the same
     by recourse to or by a separate action under the
     provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_150">Section 46</a>/<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_151">56</a> of the 1958 Act.&quot;

the matter will have to go to the prescribed statutory

authority and the decision of the prescribed statutory

of the Civil Court, if the parties do not approach the

Suit awaiting the decision of IPAB in the subject

Rectification Application. The said order of stay dated

8th April 2015 is very relevant and the same is reproduced

hereinbelow for ready reference:
</p>
<p id="p_205">&quot;IA No. 17530/2013 :
</p>
<p id="p_206">This application purportedly under Section 151 CPC is filed
by the plaintiff seeking stay of trial in the suit to await the
outcome of the cancellation proceedings before the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board. Learned Counsel
for the Plaintiff points out that the present suit has
been filed for infringement of trademark and passing
off. In the written statement, the defendant has
raised a defence, namely, that their impugned
trademark is also a registered trademark and hence
the present suit for infringement of trademark would
not lie under Section 28(3) of the Trademark Act.
The Plaintiffs have hence filed an appropriate
application         before         the         IPAB         for
rectification/cancellation of the Trade Mark of the
defendant and hence seek a stay in the present suit
in terms of Section 124 of the Trademarks Act.

Learned counsel appearing for the Defendant has
vehemently opposed the present application He states
that the present suit is only confined to the relief of
passing off and does not deal with the relief of
infringement of the trademark. He relies upon the
order of this Court dated 29.7.2011 where issue No.
2 was deleted. Issue No.2 dealt with the fact as to
whether the trademark of the Plaintiff had been infringed
by the defendant. Based on this order of 29.7.2011, it is
vehemently contended that the present suit is now
confined only to passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_207">Learned counsel appearing for the Plaintiff has, however,
refuted the contentions of the Defendant. He has relied
upon the Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case
of Puma Stationer P. Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Hindustan
Pencils Ltd., 2010 (43) PTC (Del.) to contend that it is
settled legal position that this Court is obliged to stay
further proceedings of the suit once an application
for cancellation of a registered trademark is filed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                            83</span>
                                                    wp 1517.2022 .doc


      before the statutory authority pursuant to Section
      124(1) of the Trademarks Act. He further states that
      merely because the issue was deleted on account of
      the defence of the Defendant under Section 28(3) of
      the Trademark Act would not ipso facto mean that
      the relief as sought regarding infringement of the
      trademark is no longer pressed by the Plaintiff.

      There is merit in the contentions of the Plaintiff. The
      Division Bench in Puma Stationer P. Ltd. and Anr. Vs.
      Hindustan Pencils Ltd. (supra) held as follows:-

      &quot;15. We are of the view, therefore, that the law on this
      issue is quite well settled. Where an application for
      rectification / cancellation of a registered trade
      mark is pending before the statutory authority, the
      High Court is obliged to stay further proceedings in
      the suit pending before it pursuant to <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_157">Section 124(1)</a>
      of the Trade Marks Act, 1999&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_208">      It is open to the Plaintiff to at any stage of
      proceedings give up any claim in the suit. However,
      in the present case, the order of 29.7.2011 cannot
      mean to read that the Plaintiff has given up its claim
      regarding infringement of the trademark. The issue
      No. 2 regarding infringement of the trademark of the
      Plaintiff has been given up in view of the provisions
      of Section 28(3) of the Trademark Act. Accordingly,
      the present application is allowed and the trial of the
      present suit is stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_209">      Liberty is granted to the parties to approach this
      Court, if necessary, after appropriate adjudication of
      the application by the concerned IPAB.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_210">A perusal of above order of Delhi High Court demonstrates

following aspects:
</p>
<p id="p_211">(i)   Although application filed by the Respondent No. 4 in said

Delhi Suit seeking stay of Delhi Suit makes reference to Section

151 of CPC, Delhi High Court exercised jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_158">Section

124</a> of the 1999 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_212">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                               84</span>

</p><p id="p_214">(ii)    The Delhi High Court records that issue of infringement is

raised in the Delhi Suit.
</p>
<p id="p_215">(iii)   The Delhi High Court stayed the Delhi Suit and granted

liberty to the parties to approach Delhi High Court in said Delhi

Suit after appropriate adjudication by the IPAB.

</p><p id="p_216">46. Before dealing with the merits with respect to Point Nos. 3

and 4, it is necessary to deal with submission of the Petitioner

that the said application dated 30th October, 2013 filed by the

Respondent No.4 in Delhi Suit bearing IA No.17530/2013 was

filed under Section 151 of CPC and, therefore, the same cannot

be considered as application under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_159">Section 124</a> of the said 1999

Act and, therefore, the requirements of said decision of the

Supreme Court in Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra) are

not complied with. The Petitioner relied on judgment of the

Supreme Court in My Palace Mutually Aided Co-operative

Society Vs. B. Mahesh &amp; Ors. 45 and submitted that the

inherent powers enshrined under Section 151 of CPC can be

exercised only where no remedy has been provided for in any

other provison of CPC. In view of said submission of the

Petitioner, it is significant to note the order passed by Delhi High

Court in said IA No.17530/2013 on 8th April, 2015. The Delhi

High Court in the said order dated 8th April, 2015 has


45 (2022) SCC OnLine SC 1063

specifically   observed   that   the   Respondent   No.4   has   filed

application under Section 151 of CPC however, Delhi High Court

exercised jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_160">Section 124</a> of the 1999 Act.

Therefore, the contention of the Petitioner that the said

application was filed under Section 151 of CPC and, therefore,

the same cannot be treated as application under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_161">Section 124</a> of

the said Act has no substance. It is settled legal position that

what is important is the substance of the application and not the

section which is mentioned in the application. Order dated 8th

April 2015 of the Delhi High Court clearly shows that although in

the stay application, Respondent No. 4 has mentioned Section

151 of CPC, however, the Delhi High Court has passed order

under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_162">Section 124</a> of the 1999 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_217">47. It is necessary to examine the factual position of this case

in the light of the said decision of Patel Field Marshal

Agencies (supra). The factual position shows that, the issue

with respect to trade mark infringement was struck off with the

consent of the parties on the application filed by the Petitioner.

Therefore, it has to be held that, there was no issue framed

since inception regarding infringement. The Rectification Petition

was filed on 29th October, 2013 and immediately on 30th

October, 2013 the stay application was filed awaiting the

outcome of the Rectification Petition. By order 8th April, 2015

the Delhi High Court stayed said Delhi Suit by granting liberty to

the parties to approach Delhi High Court in Delhi Suit, if

necessary, after appropriate adjudication of the application by

the IPAB. Perusal of the order passed by Delhi High Court shows

that Delhi High Court was satisfied that issue of infringement of

trade mark is raised in the suit and prima facie satisfied about

the tenability of the plea of invalidity. There is substance in the

contention raised by the Respondent No.4 that once the said

Delhi Suit was stayed by the abovementioned order dated 8th

April 2015 passed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_163">Section 124(2)</a> of the

1999 Act, all the necessary requirements in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_164">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a>

were subsumed in it; in the sense that the Delhi High Court was

satisfied that Respondent No. 4&#x27;s plea about invalidity of the

Petitioner&#x27;s impugned registration was prima facie tenable and

therefore it stayed the Delhi Suit. It is pertinent to note that the

above-mentioned order dated 8th April 2015 of the Delhi High

Court was never challenged by the Petitioner and the same has

attained finality.
</p>
<p id="p_218">48. It is further significant to note that, it was the contention

raised by the Petitioner in the said Delhi Suit, when arguing

against the prayer of the stay of said Delhi Suit, that the said

suit was only confined to the relief of passing off and does not

deal with the relief of infringement of the trade mark. To

substantiate the said contention the Petitioner has relied on

order dated 29th July, 2011 of the Delhi High Court by which, by

consent issue No. 2 regarding infringement was deleted. If it is

the contention of the Petitioner that the said Delhi Suit is not for

infringement then now the Petitioner cannot take a contrary

stand that it is the suit regarding infringement and, therefore,

requirements of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_165">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> are applicable. The said

contention will be contradictory to the contention raised by the

Petitioner before the Delhi High Court in said Delhi Suit.

</p><p id="p_219">49. In any case, it is significant to note that after specifically

setting out the said contention of the Petitioner, the Delhi High

Court as recorded in order dated 8th April 2015 found substance

in the contentions of the Respondent No.4 that merely because

the issue of infringement was deleted on account of the defence of

the Defendant under <a href="/doc/1154330/" id="a_166">Section 28(3)</a> of the 1999 Act, the same

would not ipso facto mean that the relief as sought regarding

infringement of the trademark is no longer pressed by the Plaintiff.

The Delhi High Court has held that, it is open to the Plaintiff to at

any stage of proceedings to give up any claim in the suit. However,

in the present case, the order dated 29.7.2011 in Delhi Suit cannot

mean to read that the Plaintiff has given up its claim regarding

infringement of the trademark.    By observing this the Delhi High

Court stayed the suit and granted liberty to the parties to approach

the   Delhi   High   Court   after   appropriate   adjudication    of   the

Application by the IPAB.
</p>
<p id="p_220">50. In addition to the above reasons, there is one more

reason to reject the submission raised on behalf of the

Petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_221">      (a)     It is significant to note that as held by Patel Field

      Marshal Agencies (supra) in a situation where a suit is

      pending (whether instituted before or after the filing of

      Rectification Application), the exercise of jurisdiction by

      the prescribed statutory authority is contingent on a

      finding of the Civil Court as regards the prima facie

      tenability     of the plea of invalidlity.      Conversely in a

      situation where the Civil Court does not find triable issue

      on the plea of invalidity, the remedy of an aggrieved

      party would be to challenge the said order of the Civil

      Court in appeal and not under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_167">Section 46</a>/<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_168">56</a> of the 1958

      Act i.e <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_169">Sections 47</a>/<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_170">57</a> of the 1999 Act.                     What is

      contemplated by Patel Field Marshal Agencies (supra)

      is finding of the Civil Court as regards the prima facie

      tenability of the plea of invalidity.

<p id="p_222">      (b)     Order XIV, Rule 1 of the CPC contemplates framing

      of issues when the material proposition of fact or law is

material proposition are those propositions of law or fact

which a Plaintiff must allege in order to show a right to

sue or a Defendant must allege in order to constitute his

defence.
</p>
<p id="p_223">(c)   Order dated 29th April 2008 of Delhi High Court, by

which issues were framed in said Delhi Suit clearly

shows that the issues were framed by exercising power

under Order XIV, Rule 1 of CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_224">(d)   Order XIV, Rule 1 CPC provides that &quot;when a

material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by the one

party and denied by the other&quot;.      On the other hand

<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_171">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> provides that &quot;the plea regarding

the invalidity of the registration of the Plaintiff&#x27;s or

Defendant&#x27;s trade mark is prima facie tenable, raise an

issue regarding the same&quot;.    Thus while framing issues

under Order XIV, Rule 1, CPC, the Court has to only

apply mind to the aspect whether the issues arise

between the parties i.e. when a material proposition of

fact or law is affirmed by the one party and denied by

the other, however, <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_172">Section 124</a> of the 1999 Act

Court should be satisfied that the plea regarding the

invalidity   of   the    registration   of    the   Plaintiff&#x27;s   or

Defendant&#x27;s trade mark is prima facie tenable.               If Civil

Court is satisfied about prima facie tenability of the issue

of invalidity then to raise such an issue regarding the

same and adjourn the case for a period of three months

from the date of framing of the issues, in order to enable

the party concerned to apply to the High Court for

rectification of the register. Thus, what is contemplated

by said <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_174">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> is satisfaction of the Court

that the plea regarding invalidity of the registration of

the trade mark is prima facie tenable. Therefore, what

is contemplated under said provision is application of

mind to the aspect whether the plea regarding the

invalidity of the registration of the trade mark in

question is prima facie tenable and thereafter to raise an

issue   regarding       the   same   and     adjourn   the    case.

Therefore, what is contemplated under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_175">Section 124(1)</a>

Court contemplated under Order XIV, Rule 1 of CPC is

merely from the point of view that a particular issue

arise in the suit whereas satisfaction contemplated

under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_176">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the 1999 Act is from the

point of view that the plea regarding the invalidity of the

registration of the trade mark in question is prima facie

tenable.

<p id="p_226">(e)    The order of the Delhi High Court dated 29th April

requirement of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_177">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> is complied with.

<p id="p_227">(f)    It is also significant to note that in any case, the

said issue was thereafter deleted by consent of the

parties and therefore it has to be assumed that at no

point of time said issue was framed. Thus it cannot be

assumed that the time limit as contemplated under

      plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the

of the Petitioner that the requirements of the decision of the

of the Delhi High Court which has been specifically passed by the

Delhi High Court by exercising power under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_181">Section 124</a> of the said

1999 Act, it has to be held that all the necessary requirements of

Delhi High Court was satisfied that Respondent No.4&#x27;s plea about

invalidity of the Petitioner&#x27;s impugned registration was prima facie

tenable and therefore, it stayed the Delhi Suit.

For the above reasons, we hold that application filed

under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_183">Section 57</a> of the said 1999 Act before IPAB for

removal of registration of the Petitioner&#x27;s trade mark is

<p id="p_233">52. Mr. Kirpekar, learned counsel of the Petitioner submitted

that, the actual use of the Petitioner&#x27;s mark is prior in point of

time. The Petitioner&#x27;s mark &quot;OFLOMAC&quot; being used prior in point

of time is entitled for protection under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_187">Section 34</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1267250/" id="a_188">Section

12</a> of the 1999 Act which protects prior user and/or honest and

concurrent user of the same or similar mark. He submitted that

the IPAB has completely overlooked that the documentary

evidence clearly shows that the Petitioner&#x27;s adoption is honest

and if not prior then certainly concurrent.


</p><p id="p_234">53. However, it is to be noted that, the IPAB has passed the

order under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_189">Section 57</a> of the 1999 Act by which, Petitioner&#x27;s

trade mark OFLOMAC was cancelled/removed from the register

of the trade mark on the ground that the mark of the Petitioner

is of such a nature as to deceive the public or cause confusion.

In this background, it is important to note Division Bench

judgment of this Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1245691/" id="a_190">Ciba Ltd. V. M.

Ramalingam</a> (supra). In the said case, this Court has held

that, the primary duty of the Court is towards the public and the

maintenance of the purity of the register. This Court has further

held that, the contest is not so much between the parties to the

litigation as it is a contest between the party defending his right

to a particular trade mark and the public, and the duty of the

Court must always be to protect the public irrespective of what

economic loss, hardship or inconvenience it may cause to a

particular party whose trade mark is likely to deceive or cause

confusion. The register should not contain trade marks which are

identical or which so closely resemble each other that an unwary

purchaser may be likely to be deceived by thinking that he is

buying the goods of a particular person or a particular firm or a

particular industry, whereas he is buying the goods of another

person or firm or industry.

<p id="p_235">
</p><p id="p_236">54. It is further significant to note that, it is the contention of

the Petitioner that Petitioner&#x27;s user is honest and concurrent. In

this behalf, it is significant to note that on 30th August 1989,

Respondent No.4 filed application for registration of trade mark

OFRAMAX and the same was registered on 13th May 1994; more

than 9 years later, on 28th January 1999, the Petitioner applied

for registration of the impugned mark OFLOMAC. A simple

search of the Register which is open to the public, would

necessarily have revealed Respondent No. 4&#x27;s prior registered

trade mark. A search for a prior conflicting mark is always

conducted before adopting a new mark. The Petitioner, however,

did not to do so. Instead, its purported search is after its

adoption of the impugned mark and even after receiving

Respondent No. 4&#x27;s cease-and-desist notice.      On 27th August

1999 Respondent No. 4 issued the cease-and-desist notice to

the Petitioner calling upon the Petitioner not to use the

impugned mark OFLOMAC and on 12th October 1999, the

Petitioner conducted the purported search of the Register. It is

pertinent to note that the purported search report relied upon by

the Petitioner is, in fact, much after receiving Respondent No.4&#x27;s

cease-and-desist notice dated 27th August 1999 and after the

Petitioner filed its application for registration of its mark

OFLOMAC on 28th January 1999. Thus there is no substance in

the contention raised by the Petitioner regarding honest and

concurrent use.

</p><p id="p_239">55. It is further significant to note that, the Respondent No. 4

filed application seeking trade mark OFRAMAX on 30th August,

1989 and the certificate of registration was granted on 13th May,

1994. The Petitioner applied for the trade mark OFLOMAC on

28th January, 1999 and it is in the category of &quot;proposed to be

used&quot;. Therefore, it is clear that, user, if any of Petitioner&#x27;s trade

mark has started after January, 1999. In fact it is the claim of

the Petitioner that the same was started in April, 1999.

Therefore, this is not a case of honest and concurrent or

previous use.
</p>
<p id="p_240">
</p><p id="p_241">56. In this behalf, it is also important to deal with the

submission of Mr. Kirpekar, learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner. He submitted that although Respondent no.4 claimed

user of trade mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot; since July 1991 but failed to

produce any documents to show that the said mark &quot;OFRAMAX&quot;

of Respondent no.4 has been used prior to May 1999 and

invoices and statements are produced only since 2003. In this

behalf,   it is significant to   note following observations in

paragraph 24 of the impugned order of IPAB:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">      &quot;24. While both marks have been filed on a proposed to
      be used basis, it is admitted position that while the
      Respondent No.1 has shown usage from 1999 onwards,
      the Applicant is the prior user, having already
      achieved sales figure of INR 5,01,96,000/- in

      1999 as per the data placed before us. It is
      impossible that a product launched in 1999 or in
      a few years past would have achieved said sale
      figures, the logical assumption being that the
      Applicant commenced use of the brand OFRAMAX
      sometime after the filing of its trademark in 1989
      and well before achieving sales figure of INR
      5,01,96,000/- in 1999.&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">                                          (Emphasis added)

Thus, the above observations of IPAB clearly shows that the

Respondent No. 4 commenced use of the brand OFRAMAX well

before achieving sales figure of INR 5,01,96,000/- in 1999.

<p id="p_242">57. Therefore, there is no substance in the contention raised

by the Petitioner that actual use of the Petitioner&#x27;s mark is prior

in point of time and or honest and concurrent use and therefore

entitled for protection under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_191">Section 34</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1267250/" id="a_192">Section 12</a> of the

</p>
<p id="p_243">
For the above reasons, we hold that the actual use of the

Petitioner&#x27;s mark is not prior in point of time and/or

honest and concurrent use and therefore is not entitled

(6) A patent error is an error which is self-evident, i.e.,
which can be perceived or demonstrated without involving
into any lengthy or complicated argument or a long-drawn
process of reasoning. Where two inferences are reasonably
possible and the subordinate court has chosen to take one
view the error cannot be called gross or patent.

(7) The power to issue a writ of certiorari and the
supervisory jurisdiction are to be exercised sparingly and
only in appropriate cases where the judicial conscience of
the High Court dictates it to act lest a gross failure of
justice or grave injustice should occasion. Care, caution
and circumspection need to be exercised, when any of the
above-said two jurisdictions is sought to be invoked during
the pendency of any suit or proceedings in a subordinate
court and the error though calling for correction is yet
capable of being corrected at the conclusion of the
proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred there
against and entertaining a petition invoking certiorari or
supervisory jurisdiction of High Court would obstruct the
smooth flow and/or early disposal of the suit or
proceedings. The High Court may feel inclined to intervene
where the error is such, as, if not corrected at that very
moment, may become incapable of correction at a later
stage and refusal to intervene would result in travesty of
justice or where such refusal itself would result in
prolonging of the lis.
</p>
<p id="p_247">(8) The High Court in exercise of certiorari or supervisory
jurisdiction will not convert itself into a Court of Appeal and
indulge in re-appreciation or evaluation of evidence or
correct errors in drawing inferences or correct errors of
mere formal or technical character.
</p>
<p id="p_248">(9) In practice, the parameters for exercising jurisdiction
to issue a writ of certiorari and those calling for exercise of
supervisory jurisdiction are almost similar and the width of
jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts in India unlike
English courts has almost obliterated the distinction

      between the two jurisdictions. While exercising jurisdiction
      to issue a writ of certiorari the High Court may annul or set
      aside the act, order or proceedings of the subordinate
      courts but cannot substitute its own decision in place
      thereof. In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the High
      Court may not only give suitable directions so as to guide
      the subordinate court as to the manner in which it would
      act or proceed thereafter or afresh, the High Court may in
      appropriate cases itself make an order in supersession or
      substitution of the order of the subordinate court as the
      court should have made in the facts and circumstances of
      the case.&quot;

<p id="p_249">60. In the present case, it cannot be said that the impugned

order has been passed by IPAB without jurisdiction or in excess

of its jurisdiction.    It also cannot be said that IPAB acted in

flagrant disregard of law or the rules of the procedure or acting

in violations of principles of natural justice and thereby occasion

in failure of justice. The IPAB has passed the order after giving

full opportunity to both the parties. We have already discussed

hereinabove    that     the   IPAB    took      decision   by    taking     into

consideration parameters set out by the Supreme Court and

other High Courts. The decision of the IPAB is in the interest of

general   public   as    the    mark       is   concerning       medicinal     /

pharmaceutical product. IPAB has taken possible view of the

matter and in fact the view taken by IPAB is the only view which

can be taken in the matter. There is no patent error which has

been pointed out. Therefore, no ground is made out to interfere
