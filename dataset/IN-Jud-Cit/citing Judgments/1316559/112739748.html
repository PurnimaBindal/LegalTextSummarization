Judgment on                 : 24.07.2015

Nishita Mhatre, J.:

</pre><p id="p_1">1.    WPCT 218 of 2009 and WPCT 219 of 2009 are writ petitions filed

by employees of the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works against the common

order of the Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A. 1190 of 2005 and

O.A. 1321 of 1998 respectively. WPCT 73 of 2009 has been filed by the

Chittaranjan Locomotive Works against the same order. For convenience

the petitioners in WPCT 218 of 2009 and WPCT 219 of 2009 will be
 referred to as 'the petitioners' in this judgment, whereas the petitioners

in WPCT 73 of 2009 will be referred to as Chittaranjan Locomotive Works

(hereinafter in short 'CLW').
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    It is necessary to set out the brief history of this case in order to

appreciate the questions raised in the writ petition. The petitioners were

working either as Shop Clerks or Tool Checkers with the CLW.           The

working of the Shop Clerks was regulated by the Hours of Employment

Regulations (for short 'HOER'). The Tool Checkers were designated as

Shop Clerks with effect from 1st April, 1984 after the two cadres were

merged.    The recommendations of the second pay commission were

approved by the President of India on 28th August, 1961.       Split shifts

were recognised and split duty allowance was payable to those who were

rostered for such duty.    A split duty consists of two or more spells of

work with an intervening break of half an hour or more necessitated by

the exigencies of work. The employee is free to leave his place of duty.

Where the spells of duty of employees was for 2 or 3 hours at a stretch

and their place of residence was beyond a distance of 1.6 kilometres from

their place of work, the duty hours were to be so regulated that 7 hours

split duty were treated as 8 hours of normal duty. This concession was

allowed only to staff classified as "continuous".   Thus, only employees

who, in the interest of the administration, were required to work 2 or 3

hours at a stretch, with a break between two spells of work, were entitled

to split duty allowance.   The cadre of Tool Checkers was merged with

that of Shop Clerks with effect from 1st January 1984. The Shop Clerks

were admittedly considered to be "continuous workers". They were
 required to attend duties in two spells, starting from 6.30 a.m. and the

night shift commencing at 4 p.m. As a result the split duty was between

6.30 a.m. and 14.30 p.m. They were required to work for 48 hours a

week whereas their counterparts working as office clerks worked for 40

hours in a week with a spread-over of 8 hours. An order was issued by

the Railway Board on 5th September, 1962 clarifying that its earlier order

dated 28th August, 1961 would not be applicable where the roster had

been drawn up in such a manner that the shift was fixed for the

convenience of the staff, that is, to give them a lunch break, etc. even

though the distance between their places of residence and work exceeded

1.6 kilometres. According to the petitioners, CLW denied the split duty

allowance to them. It appears that a section of the Shop Clerks had filed

a writ petition before this Court in 1984 claiming the split duty

allowance.    This   writ   petition   was   transferred   to   the   Central

Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, after it was constituted under

the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_1">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1984.      The order was passed by the

Tribunal on 27th July, 1988 directing the CLW to implement the order of

28th August, 1981 and pay all arrears of the split duty allowance to the

applicants before the Tribunal.    A review application preferred by the

CLW was rejected on 3rd February, 1989 by the Tribunal. The Union of

India and CLW preferred special leave petitions before the Supreme

Court being SLP (C) Nos.40392-93 of 1989 against the decision of the

Administrative Tribunal.      These special leave petitions were also

dismissed. Left with no alternative, CLW implemented the order dated

27th July, 1988 passed in TA No.2045 of 1986 by the Tribunal with
 retrospective effect from 28th August, 1961 in favour of the clerks posted

in work-shops and depots. Thus, the petitioners, irrespective of whether

were originally appointed as Tool Checkers or Shop Clerks, benefited by

the order of the Supreme Court and were paid split duty allowance.

</p><p id="p_3">3.    By an order issued on 29th March, 1990 the Deputy Chief

Personnel Officer declared that Shop Clerks posted in the Loco Works,

Steel Foundry and Central Power Supply Stations of CLW as "workers" as

defined under <a href="/doc/1980271/" id="a_2">Section 2(l)</a> of the Factories Act, 1948 with effect from 1st

April, 1990. The CLW decided that by virtue of such a declaration the

petitioners were no longer within the ambit of the HOER, 1961, and were

covered only by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_3">Factories Act</a>. On representations

made by the Shop Clerks and to alleviate the disparity between the Shop

Clerks and the factory workers, the Chief Mechanical Engineer granted

overtime to the Shop Clerks to compensate the loss in payment of split

duty allowance.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    The decision to grant overtime to Shop Clerks was withdrawn and

the benefit of the split duty allowance under the HOER was discontinued

from 26th February, 1998.       The representations submitted by the

petitioners and other similarly situated employees fell on deaf ears. The

Railway authorities informed the petitioners later that they would be

entitled to the overtime from April, 1998.   However that payment was

later discontinued from September, 1999.      Again, the representations

submitted by the petitioners were not heeded and an application was

moved before the Tribunal for payment of split duty allowance.        The

Tribunal by its order dated 24th August, 2004 permitted the applicants in
 those applications which included the petitioners to withdraw the

application and to file a fresh representation along with the necessary

documents for consideration by the CLW.          That representation was

rejected by the authorities on 18th December, 2004.

</p><p id="p_5">5.    Being aggrieved by the decision of the CLW in respect of their

representations, the petitioners and other employees similarly situated

filed O.A. 1190 of 2005 while O.A. 1321 of 1998 before the Tribunal

claiming the split duty allowance.     It appears that the names of 24

employees figured in both the applications as disclosed in the affidavit in

reply filed by CLW. The CLW pleaded, inter alia, that (i) since the Shop

Clerks were no longer covered by the HOER but by the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_4">Factories Act</a>,

they were not entitled to the split duty allowance; (ii) the CLW

administration had issued necessary orders on 1st April, 1990 on the

recommendation and approval of the Joint Inspector and Director of

Factories, Government of West Bengal bringing Shop Clerks within the

purview of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_5">Factories Act</a>, 1948 and       declaring that they were not

entitled to the split duty allowance; (iii) the payment of overtime to these

persons would be regulated by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_6">Factories Act</a>; (iv)

the service of Tool Checkers were regulated by the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_7">Factories Act</a> from

1954; and (v) the Tool Checkers merged with Shop Clerks and after 1990

the Shop Clerks were also governed by the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_8">Factories Act</a>.          The CLW

pointed out in its reply that 33 applicants before the Tribunal were

originally appointed as Tool Checkers whereas 49 were Shop Clerks. The

CLW therefore contended that none of the petitioners were entitled to the

split duty allowance at all.
</p><p id="p_6"> 6.    The Tribunal accepted the contentions of CLW and held that the

Tool Checkers, who had been declared workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_9">Factories Act</a>,

were not entitled to be paid split duty allowance. Similarly, Shop Clerks

working in the Loco Works Steel Foundry and Power Supply Station who

had been brought within the purview of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_10">Factories Act</a> from 29th

March, 1990, were not entitled to the split duty allowance after that date.

The Tribunal further directed that the Supreme Court's decision in the

case of <a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_11">Union of India &amp; Ors vs. Sukumar Dutta &amp; Ors</a> delivered on

31st August, 1989 should be implemented with regard to all Shop Clerks

who were not engaged in the Loco Works Steel Foundry and Power

Supply Station and not merely to those who had approached the

Supreme Court.      The allowance was directed to be paid within six

months. Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal, the parties have filed

their respective writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">7.    Mr. Achintya Banerjee, the learned Counsel appearing for the

petitioners, has urged that the CLW being a recalcitrant employer has

deliberately flouted the observations and directions of the Supreme Court

in the special leave petitions. He submitted that the circulars issued by

the Deputy Chief Personnel Officer could not override the rules of

employment which had been issued in exercise of the power under

<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_12">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India. He then submitted that when

the Supreme Court had directed that split duty allowance should be paid

to all persons whether they were originally Tool Checkers or Shop Clerks,

the CLW could not defy the judgment and contend that it was because
 the Factory Inspector had covered the Shop Clerks under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_13">Factories

Act</a> that they would not be entitled to split duty allowance. The learned

Counsel drew our attention to the fact that the petitioners were neither

paid the split duty allowance as payable under HOER nor the overtime

allowance under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_14">Factories Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">8.    Mr. Pradip Kumar Roy, the learned Counsel for the CLW, argued

that the petitions of the employees are not maintainable because some of

the petitioners are common to both the petitions; their names were found

in both the original applications filed in the Tribunal. He urged that the

petitions should be dismissed on this ground alone.          The learned

Counsel then submitted that the judgment of the Supreme Court was

with respect to Shop Clerks who were employed prior to 1990 and

therefore, they were entitled to the split duty allowance. He pointed out

that there is no pleading in the original applications indicating that the

petitioners are entitled to split duty allowance on the ground that they

had worked for the stipulated number of hours as per the HOER and

resided more than 1.6 kilometres away from the place of work.         The

learned Counsel therefore submitted that assuming the Shop Clerks are

entitled to split duty allowance there was no material on record to

establish that each of the petitioners was entitled to the same. According

to him, the lack of pleadings in the application would mean that the

petitioners had not been able to establish their claim for the split duty

allowance.   The learned Counsel then submitted that there was no

material on record to indicate that the split duty was undertaken
 because of the requirement of the administration and that the split in the

shift was not for the benefit of the employees. Unless the need of the

administration is established there is no question of paying all the

petitioners the split duty allowance, submitted the learned Counsel.



</p><p id="p_11">9.    On scrutiny of the petitions it is evident that there are 24 names

which are common in both the petitions. These persons will be treated

as the petitioners in WPCT 218 of 2009 and their names will be deemed

to have been deleted in WPCT 219 of 2009. We do not agree with the

submission of the learned Counsel for CLW that the petitions are

required to be dismissed on the ground that there are common names in

both the applications before the Tribunal and in the writ petitions.



</p><p id="p_12">10.   Indisputably, some of the petitioners were initially appointed as

Tool Checkers whereas the others were Shop Clerks.         The two grades

were amalgamated and all the employees were called Shop Clerks after

the merger on and from 1st January, 1984.        The Tool Checkers were

covered by the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_15">Factories Act</a> since 1954. However, after amalgamation

they were all entitled to the split duty allowance. This is apparent from

the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_16">Union of India &amp; Ors vs.

Sukumar Dutta &amp; Ors</a> (supra).           Therefore, the submission of the

learned Counsel that the Shop Clerks having been declared as workers

under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_17">Factories Act</a> were not required to be paid the split duty

allowance is untenable.
</p><p id="p_13"> 11.   The hours of the work and rest of the railway employees is

regulated by the Railway Servants (Hours of Employment) Rules, 1961.

These rules were in force till they were repealed and revised in the year

2005. The revised rules are known as the Railway Servants (Hours of

Work and Period of Rest) Rules, 2005. The claim of the petitioners is

based on the HOER which was in force till 2005. The HOER was framed

under the directions issued in an award under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_18">Industrial Disputes

Act</a>, 1947. The second pay commission which came into effect from 1960

recommended thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Split should not ordinarily be required to be
      performed     in   more   than    3   spells    and   where
      employee's residence is not close to the place of
      work, 7 hours of split duty should be treated as
      equal to 8 hours of normal duty."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">12.   It has been contended on behalf of the Railways that the Shop

Clerks are designated as workers under <a href="/doc/1980271/" id="a_19">Section 2(l)</a> of the Factories Act

from 1990 and therefore, they were not entitled to the split duty

allowance.   This submission of the learned Counsel for the CLW is

untenable. The CLW was always a factory since its inception. The fact

that the Factory Inspector issued directions to consider some of the

employees as workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_20">Factories Act</a> is of no consequence.

Once an establishment is governed by the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_21">Factories Act</a> depending on the

nature of work performed by the employee, he is recognised as a worker

within the definition of <a href="/doc/1980271/" id="a_22">Section 2(l)</a> of the Factories Act. The employee

would have to establish that he was employed for a manufacturing
 process of cleaning in part of the machinery or premises used for

manufacturing or in any other kind of work incidental to or connected

with the manufacturing process. The declaration of the Shop Clerks as

workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_23">Factories Act</a> does not in any way deny the Shop

Clerks, their allowances and other benefits which were being paid till the

declaration was issued. The declaration was perhaps issued because the

CLW chose not to treat them as factory workers. However, if the CLW

wanted to change the conditions of service of these employees, it was

necessary for CLW which is no doubt an industry since it is a factory, to

issue a notice under <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_24">Section 9A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act before

changing the service conditions of the employees. Admittedly this has

not been done though it is a mandatory requirement. Overnight the CLW

decided unilaterally to change the service conditions of the employees

only on the basis that the Factory Inspector had declared them to be

workers.    There is no need for such a declaration.     Even without a

declaration, employees who are employed in the manufacturing process

of a factory or related process which is incidental to the manufacturing

process are factory workers. The declaration is only an affirmance of an

existing fact.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">13.   Thus despite the fact that the employees, i.e., the petitioners

herein were workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_25">Factories Act</a> being employed for work

which was incidental to the manufacturing process, they were being paid

the split duty allowance. Therefore, they cannot be denied the same only

because of a declaration issued by the Factory Inspector. The Factory
 Inspector has not declared that because they were workers under the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_26">Factories Act</a>, benefits which were available to them earlier should be

withdrawn or denied to them after the declaration. There is no dispute

that the petitioners work in spells of 2 to 3 hours at a stretch for seven

and half hours a day. Under <a href="/doc/989665/" id="a_27">Section 54</a> of the Factories Act no adult

worker is permitted to work for more than 9 hours in any day.          The

intervals of rest had been stipulated under <a href="/doc/989665/" id="a_28">Section 54</a> and no worker can

work for more than 5 hours before he is entitled to an interval of rest for

at least half an hour. There is no provision which mandates that the

continuous period of work cannot be less than 5 hours. The spread-over

periods have also been specified under the Act and they cannot be for

more than ten and half hours on any day. Again there is no provision

which stipulates that the spread-over cannot be for less than ten and

half hours on any day.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">14.   Therefore, in our opinion, the CLW has raised a bogey about the

declaration issued by the Chief Inspector of Factories, Government of

West Bengal that Shop Clerks are workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_29">Factories Act</a>, in

order to deny them the split duty allowance.        The CLW came into

existence much before the declaration issued by the Chief Inspector of

Factories, Government of West Bengal.      However, this does not mean

that the Shop Clerks were not workers prior to the declaration.        <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_30">The

Factories Act</a> provides for the minimum rate of overtime wages, the

maximum hours of work and spread-over etc. It does not prohibit more

beneficial conditions of service being granted to the employees. Moreover
 the Supreme Court has already dealt with the CLW's contention that

split duty allowance was not payable to the employees who had been

declared as workers under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_31">Factories Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">15.   We have perused the judgement of the Supreme Court in the

special leave petitions. In our opinion the Tribunal's decision is incorrect

and that the petitioners would be entitled to split duty allowance

depending on the distance between their place of residence and the

factory at the relevant point of time. The CLW has not denied the

contention of the petitioners that they were required to work with split

duty because of administrative exigencies and for the benefit of the

administration.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">16.   Therefore, WPCT 218 of 2009 and WPCT 219 of 2009 are allowed

and the WPCT 73 of 2009 is dismissed.
