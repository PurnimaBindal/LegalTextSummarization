 requirement of ASIAD games in 1982.

<p id="p_3">2.2.   M/s P.S.J. Housing Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. submitted the highest
bid, which was accepted by NDMC and a licence deed dated 4 th
November, 1981 was executed by NDMC in favour of M/s. P.S.J.
Housing Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. In terms of clause 22 of the licence
deed dated 4th November, 1981, M/s. PSJ Housing Enterprises Pvt.
Ltd. incorporated a public company, M/s.Prominent Hotels Ltd. with
the object of taking over the youth hostel.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.3.   On 16th July, 1982, NDMC executed a licence deed dated 16th
July, 1982 in favour of M/s Prominent Hotels Ltd. (hereinafter
referred to as ‗Licensee') for running an international youth hostel for
a period of 99 years with effect from 4th November, 1981 subject to
increase in licence fee after every 33 years.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.4.   The Licensee constructed a luxurious hotel, instead of a youth
hostel, on the licensed plot which was completed in September, 1987.

by the sale of the project by H.R. Sabharwal group to Hari Ram
Kakkar, an Afgan national of Indian origin who invested in this
project.

<p id="p_7">2.6.   The licence deed provides for a minimum guaranteed licence
fee of Rs.21,08,040/- or 23% of the annual gross turnover of the
Licensee, whichever is more, from the date of handing over of the
possession, i.e. 4th November, 1981.

 NDMC to compute the licence fee. However, the Licensee defaulted
in furnishing the annual audited reports for the years 1991-92 to 1993-
94 and therefore, NDMC issued a show cause notice dated 15th June,
1994 to the Licensee to show cause why legal action be not initiated
for violation/breach of the licence deed in pursuance of which the
Licensee furnished the annual reports to NDMC whereupon NDMC
computed dues of Rs.3,05,67,355.20 towards the licence fee and
interest upto period ending July 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.8.   Vide show cause notice dated 09th September, 1994, NDMC
called upon the Licensee to pay Rs.3,05,67,355.20 towards the arrears
of licence fee and interest upto July, 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.9.   Vide show cause notice dated 23rd December, 1994, NDMC
called upon the Licensee to show cause as to why the licence be not
cancelled on account of non-payment of Rs.3,05,67,355.20.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.10. On 01st February, 1995, NDMC cancelled the licence due to
non-payment of Rs.3,05,67,355.20 and vide letter dated 21st February,
1995, NDMC intimated the cancellation of the licence to the Licensee
and notified the Licensee that their occupation, after the cancellation
of the licence, was unauthorised and therefore the Licensee should
stop the use of the premises.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.11. NDMC initiated proceedings against the Licensee under
Sections 5 and 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized
Occupants) Act, 1971 for eviction of the Licensee and recovery of
licence fees and damages before the Estate Officer which are pending.

<p id="p_13"> 2.12. Licensee‟s suit for declaration, permanent and mandatory
      injunction
     On 28th February, 1995, the Licensee instituted the suit for
      declaration, permanent and mandatory injunction. The Licensee
      pleaded inter alia that the Licensee completed the construction
      of a building on the licensed plot in 1987. During the course of
      construction, the Licensee found that the project was
      economically unviable as the Licensee was obliged to pay
      licence fee at the rate of 23% of the gross turnover with a
      minimum guaranteed amount of Rs.21,08,040/-, which was
      grossly excessive whereas the NDMC was charging 15% of the
      gross turnover from the other hotel chains. The project was also
      unviable as the licence deed provides FAR(Floor Area Ratio) of
      100 whereas the other hotels have been granted FAR of 250.
      The Licensee pleaded having made a representation to the Lt.
      Governor on 28th August, 1987 for reduction of licence fee. The
      Licensee further pleaded having made representations to NDMC
      on 22nd February, 1988; 20th April, 1988; 10th February, 1992;
      24th July, 1992 and 29th April, 1994. The Licensee admitted the
      change of management by sale of project by H.R. Sabharwal
      Group to Hari Ram Kakkar in September, 1987. The Licensee
      sought the following prayers in the plaint: -

2.13. Defence of NDMC in the Suit.
</p><p id="p_15">2.13.1.   The suit is barred by <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_1">Public Premises (Eviction of
          Unauthorised Occupants) Act</a>, 1971 as the Licensee is an
          unauthorised occupant after the cancellation of the
          allotment.      NDMC has already initiated proceedings for
          eviction against the Licensee under <a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_2">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1376406/" id="a_3">7</a> of the
          Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act,
          1971 before the Estate Officer.
</p><p id="p_16">2.13.2.   The contractual obligations of the licence deed executed
          between the parties are binding on both the parties and the
          Licensee cannot wriggle out of the same.
</p><p id="p_17">2.13.3.   The Licensee is estopped from challenging the licence deed
          executed between the parties after understanding and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA 78-2014                                                     Page 5 of 156</span>
           without any force or coercion.
</p><p id="p_18">2.13.4.   The Licensee is under contractual obligation to pay the
          licence fee and use the premises as per the licence deed in
          accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the
          licence deed.
</p><p id="p_19">2.13.5.   The Licensee never raised any objection to validity of the
          licence deed till 1994. The Licensee was in use, occupation,
          possession and enjoyment of licensed premises since 1981.
          The challenge to the clauses of the licence deed after 13
          years of the allotment is misconceived and untenable.
2.13.6.   The Licensee has become unauthorised occupant after the
          cancellation/termination of the licence and cannot be
          permitted to challenge the terms of the licence deed that too
          when the Licensee has derived the benefit from the
          allotment of the licensed premises for such a long time.
2.13.7.   The Licensee's grievance of lower FAR is misconceived as
          the licence deed clearly provides mechanism for increase of
          FAR upon payment of enhanced licence fee to be decided by
          NDMC.
</p><p id="p_20">2.13.8.   No representation or concrete proposal for permission of
          increase of FAR has been made by the Licensee in terms of
          the licence deed.
</p><p id="p_21">2.13.9.   The suit has not been valued properly for the purpose of
          Court fees and jurisdiction as admittedly a sum of
          Rs.3,40,97,015/- was due towards the licence fee for the
          period 1987 to 1995.

<p id="p_22"> 2.13.10. The suit has not been signed, instituted and verified by a
          duly authorised and competent person.
</p><p id="p_23">2.13.11. The Licensee's suit in respect of the prayer for declaration is
          not maintainable as the Licensee has not served a mandatory
          notice under Section 385 of NDMC Act, 1984.
</p><p id="p_24">2.13.12. The use of licensed premises by the Licensee for a hotel is in
          clear cut violation of the licence deed between the parties.
          The Licensee was never granted a licence for running a
          hotel. In fact, the licence was given for running a hostel.
2.13.13. The conversion of youth hostel into a 4/5 star hotel was
          never approved by NDMC. The approval of Ministry of
          Tourism does not create any right or interest in favour of the
          Licensee to convert the youth hostel into a hotel in utter
          disregard and violation of the terms of the licence deed.
2.13.14. The Licensee has misused the allotted premises for hotel
          purposes as the plot in question was allotted for a youth
          hostel.
</p><p id="p_25">2.13.15. The Licensee has raised a false plea of keeping minimal
          tariff. A bare perusal of tariff rates of the Licensee's hotel
          shows that it is equivalent to that of 4/5 star category hotels.
2.13.16. The Licensee has violated the terms of the licence deed by
          unauthorisedly selling the licensed property admitted by
          them in para 13 of the plaint. As per the licence deed, the
          Licensee cannot part with possession of the licensed
          premises without the written permission of the NDMC.
   2.14. Issues

        The following issues were framed on 2nd November, 1999:-
       ―(1) Whether the present suit for declaration, permanent and
            mandatory injunction as claimed is maintainable without
            serving notice under section 385 of NDMC Act, 1994?
            OPP
       (2)      Whether the jurisdiction of this court is barred in view of
                the provisions of section 15 of the Public Premises
                (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 after the
                termination of the license deed vide letter dated 21 st
                February, 1995? OPP
       (3)      Whether the suit has been signed, verified and instituted
                by a duly authorised and competent person.
</p><p id="p_26">       (4)      Whether the suit is correctly valued for the purposes of
                Court Fee and Jurisdiction? OPP
       (5)      Whether the terms and conditions of the licence deed
                dated 16th July, 1982 were wholly unconscionable
                arbitrary and, therefore, unenforceable? OPP
       (6)      Whether the impugned action of the defendant in
                termination/cancellation was illegal, malafide or
                arbitrary or ultravires? OPP
       (7)      Whether the plaintiff can continue in possession upon
                termination of the licence? OPP‖

2.15. No oral evidence led by the Licensee
2.15.1.      Vide order dated 10th April, 2002, the evidence of the
             Licensee was closed on the ground that the Licensee failed
             to produce any evidence despite number of opportunities
             granted, made all out efforts to postpone the recording of
             evidence of the witnesses in the trial on one pretext or the
             other and was bent upon to frustrate the recording of the
             evidence.

5.1.   With respect to Issue No. 1, the Trial Court held that the
representations made by the Licensee are sufficient notice under
Section 385 of the NDMC Act and therefore, the suit was not barred
by Section 385 of the NDMC Act

5.2.   With respect to Issue No. 2, the Trial Court held that the suit
was not barred by Section 15 of the Public Premises (Eviction and
Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 because the challenge to the
terms of the licence deed and <a href="/doc/125151673/" id="a_5">Section 60(b)</a> of the Easements Act
cannot be considered by the Estate Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_59">5.3.   With respect to issue No.3, the Trial Court held that the suit has
been signed, verified and instituted by a duly authorized person vide
resolution dated 28th February, 1985.
</p>
<p id="p_60">5.4.   With respect to issue No.4, the Trial Court held that the suit to
be correctly valued. The Trial Court held that the Licensee cannot be
asked to pay ad valorem Court fees on the demand raised by NDMC.
</p>
<p id="p_61">5.5.   With respect to Issues No.5, 6 &amp; 7, the Trial court held the
licence to be irrevocable under section 60(b) of Indian Easement Act
1882 because the Licensee had raised permanent construction. The
Trial Court held that the licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 cannot be
revoked and is not terminable.
</p>
<p id="p_62">5.6.   The Trial Court interpreted ―Gross turnover‖ by observing that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">RFA 78-2014                                                  Page 17 of 156</span>
 there was no justification for adding the turnover of food, beverages
and catering in the gross turnover. The Trial Court further held that
the Licensee is entitled to deduct the incentives given to the agents,
receipts from various outlets including room revenue from the gross
turnover. The Trial Court further observed that these are not earnings
at all. The licence fees paid for beverage licence and luxury tax is also
not to be included in the gross turnover. The Licensee is entitled to
deduct some percentage of gross revenue like incentives given to the
agents, receipts from various outlets including room revenue and
telephone, telex, fax etc. to its customers and amounts paid to external
government agencies, as these are not earnings at all and if amount is
calculated on such incidental expenses then it will be totally
unreasonable. The Trial Court further held that the income generated
attributable directly to the building only remains included in the gross
turnover and other income included without cost of direct
consumables/commission and the amount spent on the repairs and
maintenance and on insurance and repairs and renewals are also
deductible from gross turnover. The licence deed is silent with regard
to the definition of gross turnover and unless the same is specified or
interpreted as per law, the calculation cannot be made.
</p>
<p id="p_63">5.7.   The Trial Court declared Clause 3 of the licence deed dated 16th
July, 1982, requiring the Licensee to pay annual fee of 23% on the
annual gross turnover of the business as arbitrary, unreasonable,
unjust, unconscionable, unlawful and, therefore, null and void ab
initio and available gross turnover is to be defined first. The Trail
Court directed NDMC to re-negotiate the terms particularly the clause

 3 of the licence deed with the Licensee and pending the negotiation,
the Licensee shall continue to pay fixed licence fees of Rs.21,08,040/.
</p>
<p id="p_64">5.8.   The Trial Court compared the FAR and licence fee of Licensee
with that of Bharat Hotels Limited, Sunair Hotel, C.J. International
and Taj Mahal Hotel and held that there is fixed amount of licence fee
for two hotels and FAR is also not in consonance with each other.
The Trial Court further held that the licence fee should be at a lower
side as the Licensee was required to construct a youth hostel. The
Trial Court further held that NDMC cannot make unjust enrichment
for themselves. The Trial Court further held that though the initial
allotment was for youth hostel, the NDMC has ratified the use of the
property as a hotel.

6.1.   Prayer (i) of the suit for declaring Clause 3 of the licence deed
dated 16th July, 1982 as void, is barred by well settled law that the
Licensee cannot wriggle out of the commercial contract on the ground
that the terms of the contract are onerous. The doctrine of unjust
enrichment applied by the Trial Court is not applicable to the
commercial transactions. The Licensee submitted the highest bid
which was accepted. The Licensee entered into a contract with open

<p id="p_71"> 6.5.   The plea of <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_21">Section 60(b)</a> raised by the Licensee is
misconceived as the licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 is revocable.
Reference is made to Clauses 1, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20(xii), 21(b), 31,
47, 48 of the licence deed. Clause 9 of the agreement authorizes and
empowers the licensor to revoke the licence in the event of the
Licensee failing to make the payment of licence fee and the interest
due thereupon or any other payment due against the Licensee for any
reason whatsoever and to take the possession of the licence premises
by recourse to the law as provided in the Public Premises (Eviction of
Unauthorized Occupants) Act 1971. Clause 10 of the licence deed
stipulates that the land for construction of youth hostel would continue
to vest in the licensor in whom the building so constructed shall also
vest. Clause 11 provides for termination for breach of any terms and
conditions of the licence deed. Clause 20(xii) of the licence deed
stipulates that the Licensee is not liable to pay house tax on the land
and building as the same vest in the licensor for all intents and
purposes. Clause 21(b) of the licence deed also empowers the NDMC
to re-enter upon the land and building in the event of any breach or
default of the performance of the licence deed. Clause 29 provides
that the building to be constructed by the Licensee shall at all times
vest in the Licensor together with all fittings, fixtures and
installations. Clause 31 of the agreement further makes it clear that the
allotment is made on licence basis and the licenced premises including
building to be constructed will be a public premises within the
meaning of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants)
Act 1971. Clauses 47 and 48 of the agreement specifically empower

 the licensor to revoke and terminate the licence in the event of
Licensee committing any breach thereof and to recover possession
and to take complete control of the premises without any obstruction
and resistance from the Licensee. The licence granted to the Licensee
was agreed to be terminable by the licensor in the event of non-
payment of licence fee and other dues by the Licensee. The licensor is
empowered and entitled to recover the possession of the premises by a

Court fees and jurisdiction. The Licensee was seeking to avoid the
payment of Rs. 3,40,97,015/- demanded by NDMC and therefore, the
suit was required to be valued on that basis. The Trial Court had no

<p id="p_73"> 6.7.   The Licensee has not proved that the suit has been signed,
verified and instituted by a competent person. The Licensee has
neither led any oral evidence nor proved the board resolution or
articles of the Licensee company and therefore, the findings of the
Trial Court are clearly perverse as they are not based on any
admissible evidence. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/896643/" id="a_30">Nibro Limited v. National

<p id="p_74">6.8.   The findings of the Trial Court with respect to ―Gross turnover‖
are beyond pleadings and evidence. There is no prayer with respect to
the interpretation of term of ―Gross turnover‖ and no issue was even
framed by the Trial Court.         That apart, there is no merit in the
contention of the Licensee as NDMC has just adopted the gross
turnover computed by the Licensee in their audited accounts in terms
of Clause 5 of the licence deed.

<p id="p_76">6.10. The Trial Court merely noticed the area, rate of licence fee and
the FAR given to the respective Licensees of the hotels, without
considering the location, the purpose of licence, the area covered in
the licence, the advantages and disadvantages attached to each of the
properties. The Trial Court even failed to appreciate that terms and
conditions of the licence deed in respect of hotels are different than
the terms and conditions of the licence given for a youth hostel. In the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">RFA 78-2014                                                 Page 24 of 156</span>
 present case, admittedly the licence was granted for construction and
running of youth hostel and not for a commercial hotel. Transactions
involved in the cases are not on equal footing and thus were unequals.
It is well settled law that unequals cannot be treated equally.
</p>
<p id="p_77">6.11. The first instance relied upon by the Trial Court relates to
Bharat Hotels Ltd covered by Ex.D-2 i.e. licence deed dated 22nd
April, 1982. By this licence deed, land measuring 6.0485 acres was
given on licence for five star hotel of 500 rooms capacity, at a licence
fee of 1.5 crore per month without any linkage with the percentage on
turnover.
</p>
<p id="p_78">6.12. The second instance relied upon by the Trial Court relates to
Sunair Hotel covered by Ex.D-3 i.e. licence deed dated 22nd March,
1977 followed by two supplementary agreements Ex.D-7 dated 01st
February, 1998 and Ex.D-8 dated 28th September, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_79">6.13. The third instance relied upon by the Trial Court relates to C.J.
International covered by Ex.D-4 and D-6, namely, the licence deed
dated 16th April, 1981 between NDMC and M/s Pure Drinks and
licence deed dated 14th July,1982 between NDMC and M/s C.J.
International Hotels Ltd. (Ex.D-4) whereby a plot measuring 4.3 acres
of land was given on licence for construction of 358 rooms of Five
Star Hotel at the minimum licence fee of Rs.2.668 Crores or 21% of
the gross turnover, whichever is higher.
</p>
<p id="p_80">6.14. The fourth instance was of Hotel Taj Mahal at Man Singh Road
which was on licence vide licence deed dated 18th April, 1976 but
only collaboration agreement dated 18th April, 1976 was exhibited as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">RFA 78-2014                                                   Page 25 of 156</span>
 Ex.D-5. Vide Collaboration Agreement, land measuring 3.27 acres
was given to Indian Hotels Company Ltd. for construction of a Five
Star Hotel from the funds made available by the NDMC and after
construction the same was given on licence fee basis @ 15% of the
licensor's instrument as the minimum guaranteed amount or 10.5% of
the gross receipt, whichever is higher.
</p>
<p id="p_81">6.15. None of these instances can be taken into consideration while
examining the plea of discrimination in view of the law laid down by
the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/541216/" id="a_32">Radhakrishna Agarwal v. State of
Bihar</a>, AIR 1977 SC 1496 inasmuch as the Licensee has failed to
establish how is it similarly placed with other instances. The size of
the plot, the purpose of the licence and the nature of construction in all
the cases are different and are not identical. Admittedly, the Licensee
was not discriminated in the bidding process.             The Licensee has
admittedly not led any evidence to bring out the comparison between
the two. No evidence has been led to establish the discrimination
between the parties identically situated. Besides this, as held by the
Supreme Court in para 10 of the said judgment, the discrimination and
violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Article 14</a> of the Constitution does not arise once the
agreement is executed between the parties and they are bound by the
terms and conditions of the agreement.               Thus, the plea of
discrimination in this behalf is liable to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_82">6.16. The Licensee has sought parity with these Hotels on the ground
that though the licence was for construction and running of a youth
hostel but the licensor had allowed and ratified the construction and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">RFA 78-2014                                                     Page 26 of 156</span>
 running of a four star hotel. As submitted above, no oral evidence in
this behalf has been led by the Licensee and the documentary
evidence placed by it also do not support such a claim.            On the
contrary, during the pendency of the suit, this Court vide order dated
10th September, 2002 permitted that Licensee to file a detailed
representation to the licensor. Pursuant to this order, the Licensee
made a detailed representation on 20th September, 2002 and in this
representation sought regularisation of the conversion of hotel from
hostel. This assertion of the Licensee clearly belies its claim.
</p>

by NDMC in the written submissions filed and on record of Trial

consider and discuss the aforesaid judgments in the impugned



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">RFA 78-2014                                                   Page 27 of 156</span>
 judgment. The impugned judgment rendered by the leaned Trial Court
in violation of the binding precedents of the higher Courts and in
particular the Apex Court is a nullity. Reliance is placed on
Dwarikesh Sugar Industries ltd. Vrs. Prem Heavy Engineering
Works (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors.1997 (6) SCC 450.
</p><p id="p_84">6.18. The Licensee failed to establish that the licensor ratified the
change of user as claimed by it. However, in the relief clause the
Trial Court recorded that ―....concept of Hotel or youth hostel as the
case may be (though now the youth hostel has been ratified as Hotel
by NDMC itself).‖ This conclusion of the Trial Court is contrary to
the observation/ finding recorded in para 21 of the impugned
judgment.     The Trial Court under this wrong premise made the
comparison of the licence in question treating the same as licence for
hotel with other licences of hotel buildings. This is the basic and
fundamental error committed by the Trial Court and the finding so
recorded is unsustainable in law.
</p><p id="p_85">6.19. That as per the own showing of the Licensee, the licence was
obtained by it when the management of the Licensee company was
with H.R. Sabharwal Group. As per the averments made in para 12 of
the plaint, the Licensee company vide its representation dated 28th
August, 1987 sought reduction in licence fee pleading economic
unviability of the project. However, in para 13, the Licensee admitted
that in September, 1987, there was a change in the management of the
Licensee company. The said H.R.Sabharwal group sold out the
Licensee company and Hari Ram Kakkar Group, the present
management, took over the reins of the company. As the Sabharwal



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">RFA 78-2014                                                Page 28 of 156</span>
 group had already sought reduction in the licence fee on the ground of
economical unviability of the project, then in such situation, it is not
understandable as to why Kakkar group purchased the management
and took over the same from Sabharwal group and that too at what
consideration. In any case, this admission established beyond any
doubt that the Kakkar group took a calculated risk with full
knowledge of all economic conditions and the reduction of licence fee
was claimed for some extraneous considerations. Therefore, the
Licensee is precluded from raising any objections and to seek
modification of the payment clause in the agreement at this belated
stage.
</p>
<p id="p_86">6.20. The reliance of the Trial Court on intra-departmental noting
dated 03rd December, 1992 of the Administrator of NDMC and
reference to the same as order of Administrator is misplaced and
against the settled principles of law reiterated by the Supreme Court in
a catena of judgments. <a href="/doc/1954714/" id="a_44">In Sethi Auto Service Station v. DDA</a>, (2009)
1 SCC 180, the Supreme Court has held that notings in a departmental
file do not have the sanction of law to be an effective order. A noting
by an officer is an expression of his viewpoint on the subject. Notings
in the file culminate into an executable order, affecting the rights of
the parties, only when it reaches the final decision-making authority in
the department, gets his approval and the final order is communicated
to the person concerned. Reliance is also placed on <a href="/doc/1812974/" id="a_45">Union of India v.

</p>
<p id="p_87">6.21. The Trial Court has completely ignored the loss to public
exchequer caused by the Licensee. As of today, the Licensee is liable
to pay outstanding dues of Rs.122 crores and NDMC is not able to
recover the said amount because of impugned judgment and decree.
After cancellation of its allotment, the Licensee became unauthorised
occupant of the property and liable to pay damages @ 30% above the
licence fee.
</p>
<p id="p_88">6.22. As per Clause 1 of licence deed dated 16th July, 1982, the
Licensee was initially granted a licence for a period of 33 years and
the same could be extended up to 99 years. However, the extension of
licence beyond the initial period of 33 years was subject to increase in
licence fee ―as may be mutually agreed between the Licensee and
licensor.‖ Admittedly, no increased licence fee has been mutually
agreed between NDMC and the Licensee. The Licensee has not even
approached the NDMC for seeking renewal of the licence beyond 33
years after the expiry of 33 years and in the absence of any mutually
agreed licence fee after 33 years, it gives an additional cause of action
to NDMC to seek the eviction of the Licensee.

DLT 431 relied upon by the Licensee goes against the Licensee. This
Court rejected the contention of the Licensee about the claim of
exclusive possession and the plea of Section 60(b) of the Indian
Easement Act and that a Licensee cannot claim an injunction against
the true owner. The possession continues with the licensor. The
Licensee, once the licence is terminated, is only entitled to claim a
reasonable time to vacate the premises. The nature of occupancy of a
Licensee is clearly permissive and does not amount to possession at
all. A licence does not create any interest in the property. It merely
permits another person to make use of the property. There is no
parting with possession as legal possession continues with the
licensor. Only a right to use the property in a particular way or under
certain terms given to the occupant while the owner retains the control
or possession over the premises results in a licence being created; for

 the owner retains legal possession while all that the Licensee gets is a
permission to use the premises for a particular purpose or in a
particular manner but for the permission so given, the occupation
would have been unlawful (<a href="/doc/1719430/" id="a_99">Associated Hotels of India Ltd. v. R.N.

observations of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1357066/" id="a_100">Ram Swarup Gupta v. Vishu
Narayan Inter College</a>, AIR 1987 SC 1242, held that <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_101">Section 60</a> is
not exhaustive of the situations as to when a licence may be
revocable. For instance, the granter of the licence and the Licensee by
an agreement may make a licence irrevocable even though none of the
two clauses specified under <a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_102">Section 60</a> are fulfilled.         Such an
arrangement may be in writing or otherwise and its terms and
conditions may be expressed or implied. As a legal principle, what
has to be seen is whether in the facts of the present case, the licence
was revocable or irrevocable. Upon going through the terms of the
compromise decree as set out in detail, it is clear that the licence in
question is revocable.

 recovery of a certain amount advanced as loan to the Respondent No.1
for the purpose of his business. The Respondent No.1 executed a
demand promissory note and other documents. Respondent no.2 &amp; 3
had stood as guarantors for the repayment of loan. On their default,
the said suit was instituted. Respondents in their written statements
denied having taken the loan and took a stand that their signatures
were taken on blank papers. They also denied authority of the
signatory of the plaint. The Trial Court found the Respondents liable
to pay the amount but the suit was dismissed on the ground that the
signatory was not authorized and competent to file the suit. Both
principal debtor and the guarantors were held liable to pay the amount
but again dismissed the suit on the ground that the plaintiff has failed
to prove the authority of the signatory. The Regular Second Appeal
was also dismissed in limine which was challenged before Supreme

suit has been filed on the basis of forged and fabricated accounts and
the statement of account does not reflect the cash payment made to
the plaintiff. The authority of the signatory of the plaint was also
disputed. The Trial Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the

signatory of the suit appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and proved
the resolution. The witness was also cross-examined by the defendant.
The resolution did not mention regarding power to sign and verify the
plaint and thus the suit was dismissed. This Court following United
Bank of India (supra) held that the signatory has been authorized to
appoint a lawyer and sign all documents on behalf of the company
including making any statement in the Court by the said resolution. In
these circumstances, the Court held that suit filed by the companies
should not be dismissed on technical grounds once they are pursued to
the hilt. In the present case, no evidence was adduced by the plaintiff
and the resolution was not proved. This judgement is also
distinguishable on facts.

              their bids in the auctions did so with a full knowledge of
              the terms and conditions attaching to the auctions and
              that they could not be permitted to wriggle out of the

               well-founded, this Court observed : (SCC pp. 745-746,
              para 16)
                ―Those interested in running the country liquor
                vends offered their bids voluntarily in the auction
                held for granting licences for the sale of country
                liquor. The terms and conditions of auctions were
                announced before the auctions were held and the
                bidders participated in the auctions without a demur
                and with full knowledge of the commitments which
                the bids involved. Those who contract with open eyes
                must accept the burdens of the contract along with its
                benefits. The powers of the Financial Commissioner to
                grant liquor licences by auction and to collect licence
                fees through the medium of auctions cannot by writ
                petitions be questioned by those who, had their venture
                succeeded, would have relied upon those very powers
                to found a legal claim. Reciprocal rights and
                obligations arising out of contract do not depend for
                their enforceability upon whether a contracting party
                finds it prudent to abide by the terms of the contract.
                By such a test no contract could ever have a binding
                force.‖ (p. 263)
              At p. 266 (SCC p. 748) of the Report, the court further
              observed that the writ jurisdiction of High Courts under
              <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_115">Article 226</a> was not intended to facilitate avoidance of
              obligations voluntarily incurred.

              The occurrence of a commercial difficulty,
              inconvenience or hardship in the performance of those
              conditions, like the sale of liquor being less in summer
              than in winter, can provide no justification for not
              complying with the terms of the contract which they had
              accepted with open eyes.

              highest bidders in an auction for the sale of country
              liquor vends at various places in the State of Punjab. The
              appellants were called upon by the State to pay the
              amounts which they were liable to pay under the terms of
              the auction, whereupon they filed writ petitions in the
              High Court to challenge the demand. Relying upon the
              passage from Har Shankar [(1975) 1 SCC 737, 745-46]
              extracted above, the court held that the Licensees could
              not be permitted to avoid the contractual obligations
              voluntarily incurred by them and that therefore the High
              Court was right in refusing to exercise its jurisdiction

              upheld. We hold accordingly that the High Court was in
              error in entertaining the writ petitions for the purpose of
              examining whether the respondents could avoid their
              contractual liability by challenging the Rules under
              which the bids offered by them were accepted and under
              which they became entitled to conduct their business. It
              cannot ever be that a Licensee can work out the licence
              if he finds it profitable to do so; and he can challenge
              the conditions under which he agreed to take the

              allowed to adhere to and abide by some of the terms of

              repudiate the other terms of the same contract which
              might be disadvantageous to him. The maxim is qui
              approbat non reprobat (one who approbates cannot
              reprobate). This principle, though originally borrowed
              from Scots Law, is now firmly embodied in English
              Common Law. According to it, a party to an instrument
              or transaction cannot take advantage of one part of a
              document or transaction and reject the rest. That is to
              say, no party can accept and reject the same instrument
              or transaction.</blockquote>

         entered into with open eyes, a party cannot seek alteration of
         the terms expressly agreed to, on the ground of financial
         hardship. The State has no responsibility to ensure profit to
         everyone who contracts with it. The relevant portion of the
         judgment is reproduced hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">              ―14........The contract between the parties is governed by
              statutory provisions, i.e., provisions of the Act, the Rules,
              the conditions of licence and the counterpart agreement,
              they constitute the terms and conditions of the contract.
              They are binding both upon the Government and the
              Licensee. Neither of them can depart from them. It is
              not open to any officer of the Government to either
              modify, amend or alter the said terms and conditions,
              not even to the Minister for Excise.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">              21......It is not a case where any essential term of
              contract was kept back or kept undisclosed. The
              Government had placed all their cards on the table. If
              the Licensees offered their bids with their eyes open in
              the above circumstances they cannot blame anyone else
              for the loss, if any, sustained by them, nor are they
              entitled to say that license fee should be reduced
              proportionate to the actual supplies made.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">              23. Maybe these are cases where the Licensees took a
              calculated risk. Maybe they were not wise in offering
              their bids. But in law there is no basis upon which they
              can be relieved of the obligations undertaken by them
              under the contract. It is well known that in such contracts

               always an element of risk. Many an unexpected
              development may occur which may either cause loss to
              the contractor or result in large profit. Take the very case
              of arrack contractors. In one year, there may be
              abundance of supplies accompanied by good crops
              induced by favourable weather conditions; the contractor
              will make substantial profits during the year. In another
              year, the conditions may be unfavourable and supplies
              scarce. He may incur loss. Such contracts do not imply a
              warranty -- or a guarantee -- of profit to the
              contractor. It is a business for him -- profit and loss
              being normal incidents of a business. There is no room
              for invoking the doctrine of unjust enrichment in such
              a situation. The said doctrine has never been invoked in
              such business transactions. The remedy provided by
              <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_121">Article 226</a>, or for that matter, suits, cannot be resorted
              to wriggle out of the contractual obligations entered
              into by the Licensees.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">              26. Doctrine of fairness or the duty to act fairly and

              of justice where the action is administrative in nature.
              Just as principles of natural justice ensure fair decision
              where the function is quasi-judicial, the doctrine of
              fairness is evolved to ensure fair action where the
              function is administrative. But it can certainly not be
              invoked to amend, alter or vary the express terms of the
              contract between the parties. It must be remembered
              that these contracts are entered into pursuant to public
              auction, floating of tenders or by negotiation. There is
              no compulsion on anyone to enter into these contracts.</blockquote>

              of the State power being involved in such contracts. It
              bears repetition to say that the State does not guarantee
              profit to the Licensees in such contracts. There is no
              warranty against incurring losses. It is a business for
              the Licensees. Whether they make profit or incur loss is

              are going to pay more to the State in case they make
              substantial profits. We reiterate that what we have said
              hereinabove is in the context of contracts entered into
              between the State and its citizens pursuant to public
              auction, floating of tenders or by negotiation. It is not

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">               ―26. As observed above, the plaintiff had offered its bid
              for taking on licence the land on which the hotel is
              constructed. The terms and conditions of the auction
              were known to the plaintiffs before the auction was held
              and the bidders participated in the auction without a
              demur and with full knowledge of the commitments
              which the bids involved. The Government's acceptance
              of those bids was the acceptance of willing offers made
              to it and on such acceptance the lease agreement was
              executed between the parties which is binding between
              them. The commercial considerations may have revealed
              an error of judgment in the initial assessment of
              profitability of the adventure but that is a normal incident
              of trading transactions. Those who contract with open
              eyes must accept the burden of the contract alongwith
              its benefit. Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out
              of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon
              whether a contracting party finds it prudent to abide by
              the terms of the contract. By such a test, no contract
              could even have a binding force. The plaintiffs entered
              with full knowledge of conditions, which they had to
              carry out in the conduct of their business, on which
              they had willingly and voluntarily embarked. Merely
              because the plaintiffs are not finding the licence fee
              payable under the agreement to be viable for purposes
              of running the hotel, it cannot ever be said that a
              Licensee can work out the licence if he finds it
              profitable to do so and he can challenge the conditions
              under which he agreed to take the licence, if he finds it
              commercially inexpedient to conduct his business."</blockquote>

9.3.   The Licensee was well versed with the terms and conditions of

defendant. The Licensee having accepted the terms and conditions of
the licence deed and having acted upon the same, is estopped from

 challenging the terms and conditions of the licence deed as
unconscionable, arbitrary and unenforceable.
</blockquote><p id="p_119">9.4.   The Licensee submitted the highest bid in the tender for the plot
in question and became a successful bidder in respect of that tender
and having entered into a contract with open eyes and having acted
upon the same, the Licensee cannot wriggle out of the terms of the
licence deed. The important point to be noted is that NDMC has not
fixed the licence fee payable by the Licensee under the Licence deed.
The Licensee has given the highest bid in respect of the licence fee
which has been accepted. In that view of the matter, NDMC had no
control whatsoever in fixing the licence fee and therefore, the
Licensee cannot raise any objection with respect to the licence fee
fixed on the basis of highest bid.
</p><p id="p_120">9.5.   In commercial contracts entered into with open eyes, there
cannot be variation to the terms of a concluded contract which has
already been acted upon. The Licensee was under no pressure/force
to submit his bid with NDMC in which the Licensee became the
highest bidder. It is not the case of the Licensee that the Licensee was
unaware of the terms of the tender. The Licensee without any protest
agreed to the terms and conditions of the Licence deed and the
Licensee was well aware of the liabilities of the Licensee at the time
of entering into the contract with NDMC.
</p><p id="p_121">9.6.   The Licensee never raised any objection to validity of the
Licence deed till 1994. The Licensee was in use, occupation,
possession and enjoyment of licensed premises since 1981. The
Licensee has already acted upon the licence deed. The Licensee is

 estopped from challenging the licence deed 13 years after allotment.
9.7.   Since the inception of the licence, the Licensee has enjoyed the
benefits of the various terms of the said licence deed and therefore,
the Licensee cannot challenge the other clauses under which the
Licensee is under the liability to pay the agreed rate of licence fee.
9.8.   The Licensee cannot accept only those terms of the licence deed
that are advantageous to it and deny the terms which puts a liability on
it. When the Licensee is willing to take the benefit of the licence deed,
then the Licensee is also liable to undertake the liabilities under the
said licence deed. The maxim qui approbat non reprobat (one who
approbates cannot reprobate) is akin to the doctrine of benefits and
burdens which at its most basic level provides that a person taking
advantage under an instrument which both grants a benefit and
imposes a burden cannot take the former without complying with the
latter. A person cannot approbate and reprobate or accept and reject
the same instrument.
</p><p id="p_122">9.9.   The Licensee has become unauthorised occupant after the
cancellation/termination of the licence and cannot be permitted to
challenge the terms of the licence deed that too when the Licensee has
derived the benefit from the allotment of the licensed premises for
such a long time.
</p>
<p id="p_123">9.10. The burden of proof of Issue No.1 was upon the Licensee.
However, the Licensee neither pleaded nor proved any relevant fact to
show as to how the contract between the parties is void. The Licensee
did not lead any oral evidence despite numerous opportunities and
therefore, this Court vide order dated 13th May, 2002, closed the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">RFA 78-2014                                                   Page 54 of 156</span>
 evidence of the Licensee. As such, the Licensee has miserably failed
to discharge the burden imposed upon it.
</p><p id="p_124">9.11. Void contracts are defined in <a href="/doc/1562930/" id="a_131">Section 2(g)</a> of the Contract Act,
1872 as agreements not enforceable by law such as agreement with
unlawful consideration and objects (<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_132">Section 24</a>), agreement without
consideration (<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_133">Section 25</a>), agreement in restraint of marriage (Section

agreement by way of wager (<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_137">Section 30</a>). The licence deed dated 16th
July, 1982 is a lawful agreement enforceable by law within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1890444/" id="a_138">Section 2(h)</a> of the Contract Act, 1872. The charging of
lower minimum guarantee amount by the NDMC from other hotel
chains does not fall under any of provisions relating to void contracts
under the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_139">Contract Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_126">9.12. The Trial Court did not care to consider the relevant provisions
of law to examine as to how the contract between the parties was void.
The findings of the Trial Court holding Clause 3 of the licence deed
dated 16th July, 1982 as void, are therefore, perverse.
9.13. With respect to the Licensee's plea of comparison with other
hotels, the Licensee is not entitled to any benefit as the allotment was
done by the tender and admittedly, there was no discrimination in the
bidding process. The Supreme Court, in <a href="/doc/541216/" id="a_140">Radhakrishna Agarwal v.
State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1977 SC 1496, held that once the agreement is
executed, the parties are bound by the terms and conditions of the
agreement. Thus, the plea of discrimination is rejected. The relevant
portion of para 10 of the judgment is reproduced hereunder:
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">RFA 78-2014                                                 Page 55 of 156</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">               ―10.      ... But, after the State or its agents have
              entered into the field of ordinary contract, the
              relations are no longer governed by the
              constitutional provisions but by the legally valid
              contract which determines rights and obligations of
              the parties inter se. No question arises of violation
              of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_141">Article 14</a> or of any other constitutional provision
              when the State or its agents, purporting to act within
              this field, perform any act. In this sphere, they can
              only claim rights conferred upon them by contract
              and are bound by the terms of the contract only
              unless some statute steps in and confers some
              special statutory power or obligation on the State in
              the contractual field which is apart from contract.‖

9.14. That apart, the Licensee has failed to establish how it is
similarly placed with other instances. The size of the plot, the purpose
of the licence and the nature of construction in all the cases are
different and are not identical. No oral evidence was led by the
Licensee to bring on record the comparison between the property in
question with the properties involved in the said licence deeds. It is
well settled law that in order to claim parity it was mandatory for the
Licensee to bring on record the relevant facts namely the advantages
and disadvantages attached to the properties involved in the instances
with the property in question. The Licensee can claim parity only
when the advantages and disadvantages are identical with the land in
question. If this exercise has not been undertaken then the method of
comparison cannot be adopted. In the present case, the documents
sought to be relied by the Licensee for the purpose of comparison
were merely exhibited in terms of the order passed by this Court dated
12th September, 2013 in C.M. (M) No.102/2013. These documents

 were allowed to be exhibited by this Court with a caveat that the
validity of said documents would be considered at the time of hearing
of suit. These documents could not have been considered by the Trial
Court for comparison.

<p id="p_127">9.15. On the 03rd August, 2015, the Licensee made a statement before
this Court, that the Licensee gives up the prayer (i) of the plaint and
therefore, has no objection to the setting aside of the decree granted
by the Trial Court declaring the clause 3 of the licence deed dated 21 st
February, 1995 as void.
</p><p id="p_128">9.16. Applying the principles laid down in the judgments discussed
above, it is held that the Licensee's prayer (i) for declaring clause 3 of
the licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 as null and void, is barred by
law.
</p><p id="p_129">10.   Prayer (ii) of the suit for directing NDMC to increase FAR

10.1. So far as prayer (ii) of the plaint is concerned relating to
increase of FAR from 100 to 250, clause 12 of the licence deed
provides that the FAR can be increased upon increase of licence fee to
be decided by NDMC after giving reasonable opportunity to the
Licensee. Clause 12 of the licence deed is reproduced hereunder:-

       may be decided by the licensor after giving reasonable
       opportunity to the Licensees in this behalf.‖
10.2. Since the Licensee was admittedly never agreeable to increase
of licence fee, there was no cause of action in favour of the Licensee

 for increase of FAR. The Licensee has neither pleaded anywhere in
the plaint nor proved that Licensee has applied for increase of FAR
under clause 12 and was willing to pay the increased licence fee. In
that view of the matter, there was no cause of action in favour of the
Licensee to seek increase of FAR.

Licensee for any reason whatsoever and to take the possession of the
licence premises by recourse to the law as provided in the Public
Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act 1971. Clause 10
of the licence deed stipulates that the land for construction and youth
hostel would continue to vest in the licensor in whom the building so
constructed shall also vest. Clause 11 provides for termination for
breach of any terms and conditions of the licence deed. Clause 20(xii)
of the licence deed stipulates that the Licensee is not liable to pay
house tax on the land and building as the same vest in the licensor for
all intents and purposes. Clause 21(b) of the licence deed also
empowers the NDMC to re-enter upon the land and building in the
event of any breach or default of the performance of the licence deed.
Clause 29 provides that the building to be constructed by the Licensee
shall at all time vest in the Licensor together with all fittings, fixtures
and other installations. Clause 31 of the agreement further makes it
clear that the allotment is made on licence basis and the licenced

              ―39. The very idea of a licence being irrevocable is a bit
              of a contradiction in terms. From the clauses of the
              licence referred to above, it is clear that by its terms the
              licence is revocable. It is well known that a mere licence
              does not create any estate or interest in the property
              with which it is concerned. Normally a licence confers
              legality to an act, which would otherwise be unlawful. A
              licence can be purely personal, gratuitous or
              contractual. Whether a contractual licence is revocable
              or not, would obviously depend on the express terms of
              the contract. A contractual licence is normally
              revocable, except in certain circumstances that are
              expressly provided for in the <a href="/doc/82950642/" id="a_181">Easements Act</a>, 1882.</blockquote>

              something, which, in the absence of such right, could be
              unlawful, but such right does not amount to an easement

 crores. This Court held the plaintiff liable to pay the Court fees on
Rs.24 crores. The relevant portion of the said judgment is as under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">       ―28. ...The obvious attempt on the part of the plaintiffs
       is to stop the recovery in furtherance to the order of the
       Debts Recovery Tribunal and enforce the letter dated
       23rd July, 2005, which is stated to be the settlement,
       settling the claim of the bank for a sum of Rs. 24 crores.
       In any event the subject matter of the suit relates to the
       said letter which is for settlement for a sum of Rs. 24
       crores. As such the plaintiffs are trying to settle their
       accounts and are wanting to invoke the agreement which
       according to the plaintiffs is a concluded contract, and
       they are to pay the court fee, which is the ad valorem
       court fee, ex facie payable on such documents. By
       praying for injunction of a letter declining such a request
       on the basis that there is a binding contract founded on
       the principle of estoppel, what the plaintiff prays is
       enforcement of a contract which is for a consideration of
       Rs. 24 crores. It is not a case of claiming the relief of
       declaration simplicitor, but in substance, is to enforce the
       agreement alleged to have been entered into between the
       parties and prevent the bank from acting in furtherance
       to the order of recovery as well as for the letter dated
       22nd August, 2005 to be declared void and malafide,
       thus, enforcing the settlement dated 23rd July, 2005,
       which of course has to be examined on its own merits
       during the course of the trial. But the obligation on the
       part of the plaintiff to pay ad valorem court fee is an
       irresistible conclusion on the basis of the judgments
       afore-stated. Judgment in the case of Shamsher
       Singh (supra) has been correctly relied upon by the
       counsel appearing for the defendants. In that case the
       Supreme Court took the view that a suit by a son against
       his father and the mortgagee/decree holder for a
       declaration that the mortgage executed by the father in
       respect of the joint family property was null and void for
       want of legal necessity and consideration, though

        couched in a declaratory form, is in substance a suit
       either for setting aside the decree or for a declaration

<p id="p_155">       The Court also took the view that the court while

       allegations in the plaint to see what is the substantive

14.5. A perusal of the plaint as a whole and in particular paragraphs
29 and 33, it is clear that the Licensee has sought to get rid of clause 3
of the licence deed and to avoid the payment of Rs.3,05,67,355.20 to
the NDMC. The liability in term of the demand letters was known to
the Licensee. This is not a case where the claim was incapable of any
valuation and as such, liable to be arbitrary valued. The claim in such
a suit being capable of definite valuation, the Licensee cannot put any
arbitrary valuation and such valuation is rejected. Thus, the Licensee
was required to value to the suit at Rs. 3,05,67,355.20 and pay ad
valorem Court fees upon the same.
</p>
<p id="p_156">14.6. At the time of final hearing, the Licensee did not dispute the
under-valuation of the suit and agreed to pay the deficient Court fees.
However, the payment of the deficient Court fees would not cure the
defect of pecuniary jurisdiction of the Trial Court as admittedly, the
Trial Court did not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain and try a
suit with the valuation of Rs. 3,05,67,355.20. I therefore hold that the
Licensee had not valued the suit properly for the purposes of Court
fees as well as suit valuation and the Trial Court had no pecuniary

 jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_157">15.    The licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 does not suffer from any
arbitrariness. Under Section 141(2) of the NDMC Act, NDMC is
entitled to adopt a procedure by which it can get maximum return on
its properties as held by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1054935/" id="a_196">Aggarwal &amp; Modi
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. New Delhi Municipal Council</a> (2007) 8 SCC
75 as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">       ―22. The mandate of <a href="/doc/82950642/" id="a_197">Section 141(2)</a> is that any
       immovable property belonging to NDMC is to be sold,
       leased, licensed or transferred on consideration which is
       not to be less than the value at which such immovable
       property could be sold, leased, or transferred in fair
       competition. The crucial expression is ―normal and fair
       competition‖. In other words, NDMC is obligated to
       adopt the procedure by which it can get maximum
       possible return/consideration for such immovable
       property. The methodology which can be adopted for
       receiving maximum consideration in a normal and fair
       competition would be the public auction which is
       expected to be fair and transparent. Public auction not
       only ensures fair price and maximum return it also
       militates against any allegation of favouritism on the
       part of the Government authorities while giving grant
       for disposing of public property. The courts have
       accepted public auction as a transparent means of
       disposal of public property.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">       23. Disposal of public property partakes the character
       of trust and there is distinct demarcated approach for
       disposal of public property in contradiction to the
       disposal of private property i.e. it should be for public
       purpose and in public interest. Invitation for
       participation in public auction ensures transparency
       and it would be free from bias or discrimination and
       beyond reproach.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_158">16.    With respect to findings of the Trial Court on the interpretation
of the term ―Gross turnover‖, it is noted that there are no pleadings in
the plaint, there is no prayer for the same in the plaint, no issue was
framed by the Court and no evidence was led by the parties. In fact,
the Licensee sought amendment of the plaint at the stage of final
arguments to set up a new plea of interpretation of the term ―Gross
turnover‖ which was declined. In that view of the matter, the Trial
Court had no jurisdiction to interpret the term ―Gross turnover‖ and
the findings of the Trial Court are set aside as perverse and without
jurisdiction.   Even otherwise, there is no merit in the Licensee's
contention as NDMC has adopted the ‗Gross Turnover' determined by
the Licensee in their own audited accounts in terms of clause 5 of the
licence deed. The balance sheets of the Licensee for the year ending
31st March, 2014 filed in the Writ Petition reflects the admitted
licence fee of Rs.35,31,52,823/- payable by the Licensee. The balance
sheets further reveal that the Licensee has shown the licence fee as
expenses, deducted from gross income and has thereby derived the tax
benefits from the Income Tax authorities.

<p id="p_159">17.    The Licensee did not lead any oral evidence to prove the
authority of the person who signed, verified and instituted the suit.
The Licensee did not even prove the Board resolution of the Licensee.
In that view of the matter, finding of the Trial Court is not based on
any admissible evidence. At the time of final hearing, the Licensee
submitted that additional evidence may be permitted to prove the

 Board resolution, meaning thereby the Licensee admitted that the
finding of the Trial Court is not correct. Since the Licensee's suit is
barred by law, this Court is not basing the dismissal of the suit on this
ground and therefore, the judgments relied upon by the parties are not
being discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_160">18.    The Trial Court has completely ignored the loss to public
exchequer caused by the Licensee. As of today, the Licensee is liable
to pay outstanding dues of Rs.122 crores and NDMC is not able to
recover the said amount because of impugned judgment and decree.
After cancellation of its allotment, the Licensee became unauthorised
occupant of the property and liable to pay damages @ 30% above the
licence fee.
</p>
<p id="p_161">19.    The Licensee did not lead any evidence before the Trial Court
despite number of opportunities granted. In that view of the matter,
the Trial Court was required to consider the documentary evidence
mentioned in para 2.16 above and the applicable law. The findings of
fact of the Trial Court are not based on any evidence and are therefore
clearly perverse. The findings of law are in violation of the well
settled law.

other judgments cited by the Licensee do not support the Licensee. It
is well settled that judicial precedent cannot be followed as a statute
and has to be applied with reference to the facts of the case involved
in it.   The ratio of any decision has to be understood in the
background of the facts of that case. What is of the essence in a
decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what
logically follows from the various observations made in it. It has to be
remembered that a decision is only an authority for what it actually
decides. It is well settled that a little difference in facts or additional
facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a
decision. The ratio of one case cannot be mechanically applied to
another case without regard to the factual situation and circumstances
of the two cases.

       throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises
       jurisdiction. It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal
       over which the High Court has superintendence can ignore the
       law declared by that Court and start proceedings in direct
       violation of it. If a tribunal can do so, all the subordinate
       Courts can equally do so, for there is no specific provision, just
       like in the case of Supreme Court, making the law declared by
       the High Court binding on subordinate Courts. It is implicit in
       the power of supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that
       all the tribunals subject to its supervision should conform to the
       law laid down by it. Such obedience would also be conducive to
       their smooth working; otherwise there would be confusion in
       the administration of law and respect for law would
       irretrievably suffer. We, therefore, hold that the law declared
       by the highest Court in the State is binding on authorities, or
       tribunals under its superintendence, and that they cannot
       ignore it either in initiating a proceeding or deciding on the
       rights involved in such a proceeding. If that be so, the notice
       issued by the authority signifying the launching of
       proceedings, contrary to the law laid down by the High Court

challenged before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">       "15. The conduct of the appellant in not following previous

       laid down by the High Court and impair the constitutional
       authority of the High Court. His conduct is therefore
       comprehended by the principles underlying the law of
       Contempt. The analogy of the inferior court‟s disobedience to
       the specific order of a superior court also suggests that his
       conduct falls within the purview of the law of Contempt. Just
       as the disobedience to a specific order of the Court
       undermines the authority and dignity of the court in a
       particular case, similarly the deliberate and mala fide conduct
       of not following the law laid down in the previous decision
       undermines the constitutional authority and respect of the
       High Court. Indeed, while the former conduct has
       repercussions on an individual case and on a limited number
       of persons, the latter conduct has a much wider and more
       disastrous impact. It is calculated not only to undermine the
       constitutional authority and respect of the High Court,
       generally, but is also likely to subvert the Rule of Law and
       engender harassing uncertainty and confusion in the

       effective and efficient functioning of the judicial system. If the

       that such violation has to be of a specific order or direction of

       nature as it would not only be impracticable, but even
       impossible to regulate such orders of the court, is an
       argument which does not impress the court. As already
       noticed, the Constitution has placed upon the judiciary, the
       responsibility to interpret the law and ensure proper
       administration of justice. In carrying out these constitutional
       functions, the courts have to ensure that dignity of the court,
       process of court and respect for administration of justice is
       maintained. Violations which are likely to impinge upon the
       faith of the public in administration of justice and the court
       system must be punished, to prevent repetition of such
       behaviour and the adverse impact on public faith. With the
       development of law, the courts have issued directions and even
       spelt out in their judgments, certain guidelines, which are to be
       operative till proper legislations are enacted. The directions of
       the court which are to provide transparency in action and
       adherence to basic law and fair play must be enforced and
       obeyed by all concerned. The law declared by this Court
       whether in the form of a substantive judgment inter se a party
       or are directions of a general nature which are intended to
       achieve the constitutional goals of equality and equal
       opportunity must be adhered to and there cannot be an
       artificial distinction drawn in between such class of cases.
       Whichever class they may belong to, a contemnor cannot build
       an argument to the effect that the disobedience is of a general
       direction and not of a specific order issued inter se parties.

       though a judgment would be res judicata and not impeachable
       from within, it might be impeachable from without. In other
       words, though it is not permissible to show that the court was

       essential distinction between mistake and trickery. The clear

       judgment cannot be brought on the ground that it has been
       decided wrongly, namely, that on the merits, the decision was
       one which should not have been rendered, but it can be set

       the loss of another. Even most solemn proceedings stand
       vitiated if they are actuated by fraud. Fraud is thus an extrinsic
       collateral act which vitiates all judicial acts, whether in rem or

        There is no dispute that the relationship between the parties
        was of Licensor and Licensee. No oral evidence has been led
        by the parties. As such, the Trial Court was not required to do
        anything to discover the truth. The Trial Court was required to
        just apply the well settled law which was placed on record.
        However, the Trial Court has utterly failed in its duty of
        applying the binding law to the facts of the case doing the
        justice on the basis of truth.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_139">       "188. The number of similar litigants, as the parties in this
       group of cases, is on the increase. They derive their strength
       from abuse of the legal process. Counsel are available, if the
       litigant is willing to pay their fee. Their percentage is slightly
       higher at the lower levels of the judicial hierarchy, and almost
       non-existent at the level of the Supreme Court. One wonders
       what is it that a Judge should be made of, to deal with such

       grit and composure required to stand up to the pressures of
       today's litigants? What is it that is needed to bear the affront,
       scorn and ridicule hurled at officers presiding over courts?
       Surely one would need superhumans to handle the emerging
       pressures on the judicial system. The resultant duress is
       gruelling. One would hope for support for officers presiding
       over courts from the legal fraternity, as also, from the superior

       invaluable time briefing counsel and preparing them for his
       claim. Time which he should have spent at work, or with his
       family, is lost, for no fault of his. Should a litigant not be

       responsibility, to take decisions. So much so, that we have
       started to entertain the impression, that all administrative and
       executive decision making, are being left to Courts, just for that
       reason. In private litigation as well, the concerned litigant
       would continue to approach the higher Court, despite the fact
       that he had lost in every Court hitherto before. The effort is not
       to discourage a litigant, in whose perception, his cause is fair
       and legitimate. The effort is only to introduce consequences, if
       the litigant's perception was incorrect, and if his cause is found
       to be, not fair and legitimate, he must pay for the same. In the
       present setting of the adjudicatory process, a litigant, no matter
       how irresponsible he is, suffers no consequences. Every litigant,
       therefore likes to take a chance, even when counsel's advice is
       otherwise.

        Delhi High Court Rules, 1967 only, the manner in which counsel's
        fee may be computed in the appeal against the decree on the
        original side, is provided. There is no provision in the Delhi High
        Court Rules as to the manner in which the costs in appeals are to
        be evaluated or imposed. Guidance on the consideration by this

       down that one of the reasons for over-flowing of court dockets
       is the frivolous litigation in which the Courts are engaged by
       the litigants and which is dragged as long as possible. Even if
       these litigants ultimately loose the lis, they become the real
       victors and have the last laugh. This class of people who
       perpetuate illegal acts by obtaining stays and injunctions from
       the Courts must be made to pay the sufferer not only the
       entire illegal gains made by them as costs to the person
       deprived of his right and also must be burdened with
       exemplary costs. Faith of people in judiciary can only be
       sustained if the persons on the right side of the law do not feel
       that even if they keep fighting for justice in the Court and
       ultimately win, they would turn out to be a fool since winning
       a case after 20 or 30 years would make wrong doer as real
       gainer, who had reaped the benefits for all those years. Thus,
       it becomes the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong doers
       are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in
       prolonging the litigation due to their money power, ultimately
       they must suffer the costs of all these years long litigation.
       Despite settled legal positions, the obvious wrong doers, use
       one after another tier of judicial review mechanism as a
       gamble, knowing fully well that dice is always loaded in their
       favour, since even if they lose, the time gained is the real gain.
       This situation must be redeemed by the Courts."

        ground of discrimination is again of no consequence because
       licence fee determined is again of no consequence because
       licence fee determined in other cases was also on the basis of
       public tender. Thus fixing licence fee was not in the hand of
       NDMC. NDMC only followed the dictates of Section 141(2) of
       NDMC Act, which is the only fairest way to deal with public
       properties.
</p><p id="p_214">       (iii) Moreover, the case of the company in hand was different
       than other hotels, which are 5 Star Hotels. The land allotted to
       them was for constructing five star Hotels, while in the case of
       the Company, the licence was for setting up a Youth Hostel. It
       was not meant for running a 4 Star Hotel, for which the
       property is being used. This is violative of the terms of the
       licence deed and may result if imposition of penalty by L &amp;
       DO.
</p><p id="p_215">       (iv) Coming to the issue of FAR, it was provided for as per
       the norms available for construction of Youth Hostel. Merely
       because the licencee misused the property by using it as a
       Hotel instead of Hostel, he cannot claim a higher FAR.
       Moreover this issue has been examined by our Chief Architect
       and according to his report the existing FAR of the building is,
       more than permissible. If FAR available to hotel is applied
       than it will increase parking space, which is not available.
</p><p id="p_216">       10) Coming to the argument of the company that it was felt
       during the course of the construction itself that the project will
       not be viable and their reliance to the survey conducted by
       Indian Express, it is open for the company to surrender the
       premises under the terms of the licence deed. The accrued
       loses if any is creation of the company itself and cannot be a
       ground for NDMC to give up its right to claim licence fee fixed
       on the basis of public bid, which is as per Section 141(2) of the
       NDMC Act.
</p><p id="p_217">       11) The plea taken by the company that concessions have
       been granted to other hotels like CJ International etc. is
       without any basis. The same applies to their plea about not
       complying with assurances by NDMC in as much as no
       specific thing about any such assurance, which is claimed to
       have been given and not met, has been stated. The case of

           disinvestments can have no bearing on this case.
</p><p id="p_218">          12) As regard representation made by the company, the same
          is a matter of record. The representation submitted by the
          Administrator of which a reference has been made must be
          read in full. The Administrator while giving the representation
          to the Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has also observed
          that in the present case, the licence fee was determined on the
          basis of public tender.
</p><p id="p_219">          13) In so far as the judgment of Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.K.
          Mahajan delivered in the case of CJ International Hotels Ltd.,
          the only indulgence granted was with regard to the definition
          of Gross Turn Over. In the same Judgment the Court upheld
          the right of NDMC to claim licence fee as agreed between the
          parties in terms of the licence deed. This Judgment has been
          confirmed by a division bench of Delhi High Court in its order
          passed on 12-03-2003 in FAO (OS) No.310/2001. The
          principal laid down in the said Judgement is also supported by
          an earlier Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
          Gursharan Singh. Thus we find no merits in the representation
          made by the company.‖

On 09th October, 2006, the Licensee filed an application for directing
NDMC to produce the copy of the FIR/charge sheet registered against
their former chairperson and for production of copy of the receipt and
dispatch register. This application was partly allowed to the extent
that NDMC was directed to produce the certified copy of the receipt
and dispatch register. The Licensee challenged this order before this
Court in C.M.(M) 393/2009, which was dismissed on 01 st December,
2009. This Court observed that the Licensee had been intentionally
delaying the disposal of the suit because of the interim order in its
favour. This Court dismissed the petition as being baseless, dilatory
and vexatious and, therefore, directed the Trial Court to dispose of the
suit before 28th February, 2010. This Court also vacated the order
dated 10th September, 2002 whereby the proceedings under Public
Premises Act were stayed. Relevant portion of the order dated 01st
December, 2009 is being reproduced hereunder:

<blockquote id="blockquote_162">              " 14. It appears to this court that petitioner/plaintiff has
              been intentionally delaying the disposal of the suit
              because it has been enjoying interim orders in the suit
              in its favour and because it is in possession of valuable
              property and owing to the lackadaisical attitude of the
              respondent NDMC. Even though the proceedings under
              the Public Premises Act were stayed for the intervening
              period only, that is till the representation is considered,
              and report whereof came as far as in 2003 but it is
              stated that owing to the order dated 10th September,
              2002 the proceedings under the Public Premises Act,
              also remain in abeyance.

               purpose the documents, from the refusal of discovery
              whereof the petitioner is aggrieved, would serve in
              adjudicating the issues which alone are to be decided by
              the trail court. There can possibly be no connection.
              The petitioner cannot be permitted roving enquiry into
              the allegations against the Chairperson. The suit
              cannot be proceeded with as a writ petition and the
              aspects on which the suit has been kept pending for the
              last over seven years have no bearing whatsoever to the
              disposal of the suit.

              direction is issued to the trial court to dispose of the suit
              on or before 31st January, 2010. The counsel for
              the petitioner/plaintiff states that several interim
              applications are pending. However, in view of the
              conduct aforesaid of the petitioner/plaintiff, I am not
              willing to enlarge the time for disposal of the suit on the
              aforesaid plea. If the interim applications which are
              pending are as frivolous as the application from which
              this petition has arisen, the trial court will do well to
              deal with the same expeditiously. The suit be disposed
              of by that time.

              the petitioner under the Public Premises Act is vacated.
              The counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff at this stage
              states that the time for disposal of the suit be extended
              till 28th February, 2010. Subject to the counsel for the
              petitioner/plaintiff fully cooperating with the trial court
              and not pressing frivolous applications, the time is so
              extended till 28th February, 2010."

required of the litigant. He is bound not to make any statements

Occupants) Act, 1971 bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to
entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of the eviction of any

a permanent structure in case of revocable licence would also not
make the licence irrevocable.
</p><p id="p_245">29.7. The suit for declaration and injunction, for the purposes of
Court fees and jurisdiction, has to be valued on the basis of the
amount involved.
</p><p id="p_246">29.8. The law declared by the Supreme Court and High Courts of the
States is binding on Trial Courts. The failure to abide by the principles
laid down by the Supreme Court as well as this Court in binding
judicial precedents amounts to contempt.
</p><p id="p_247">29.9. Justice is truth in action. Truth is the foundation of justice.
Dispensation of justice, based on truth, is an essential and inevitable
feature in the justice delivery system.
</p><p id="p_248">29.10. It is the duty of the Judge to discover truth to do complete
justice. The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and
find out the real truth.
</p><p id="p_249">29.11. The justice based on truth would establish peace in the society.
For the common man truth and justice are synonymous. So when truth

 fails, justice fails. People would have faith in Courts when truth alone
triumphs.
</p><p id="p_250">29.12. Every trial is a voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest.
Truth should be reigning objective of every trial. Judge has to play an
active role to discover truth and he should explore all avenues open to
him in order to discover the truth.
</p><p id="p_251">29.13. Dishonest and unnecessary litigations are a huge strain on the
judicial system. The Courts are continued to be flooded with litigation
with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties.
The judicial system in the country is choked and such litigants are
consuming courts' time for a wrong cause. Efforts are made by the
parties to steal a march over their rivals by resorting to false and
incoherent statements made before the Court.
</p><p id="p_252">29.14. Unless the Courts ensure that wrongdoers are denied profit or
undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to
control frivolous and uncalled for litigations. In order to curb uncalled
for and frivolous litigation, the Courts have to ensure that there is no
incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of
common experience that the Courts' scarce and valuable time is
consumed or more appropriately wasted in a large number of uncalled
for cases. It becomes the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong
doers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in
prolonging the litigation, ultimately they must suffer the costs.
Despite settled legal positions, the obvious wrong doers, use one after
another tier of judicial review mechanism as a gamble, knowing fully
well that the dice is always loaded in their favour, since even if they

 lose, the time gained is the real gain. This situation must be redeemed
by the Courts.
</p><p id="p_253">29.15. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering
prosecution would go a long way in controlling the tendency of
introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated documents by
the litigants. The cost should be equal to the benefits derived by the
litigants, and the harm and deprivation suffered by the rightful person
so as to check the frivolous litigations and prevent the people from
reaping a rich harvest of illegal acts through Court. The costs imposed
by the Courts must be the real costs equal to the deprivation suffered
by the rightful person and also considering how long they have
compelled the other side to contest and defend the litigation in various
courts. In appropriate cases, the Courts may consider ordering
prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and
sanctity of judicial proceedings. The parties raise fanciful claims and
contests because the Courts are reluctant to order prosecution.
29.16. Any conduct which has the tendency to interfere with the
administration of justice amounts to criminal contempt.           A false,
misleading or a wrong statement deliberately and willfully made by
party to the proceedings to obtain a favourable order would
undoubtedly tantamount to interference with the due course of judicial
proceedings.
</p><p id="p_254">29.17. Contempt jurisdiction has been conferred on superior courts not
only to preserve the majesty of law by taking appropriate action
against the Contemnor, but also to keep the stream of justice clear and
pure so that the parties who approach the Court to receive justice do

 not have to wade through dirty and polluted water.
29.18. To enable the Court to ward off unjustified interference in their
working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury,
prevarication and motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt
with, without which it would not be possible for any Court to
administer justice in the true sense and to the satisfaction of those who
approach it in the hope that truth would ultimately prevail.
29.19. Unless lawlessness which is all pervasive in the society is not
put to an end with an iron hand, the very existence of a civilized
society is at peril if the people of this nature are not shown their place.
Further if the contemnor is allowed to go scot free, every law breaker
would violate the law with impunity.         Hence, deterrent action is
required to uphold the majesty of law.

licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 provides for increase of licence fee
upon payment of increased licence fee. However, since the Licensee
has never applied for increase of licence fee for seeking increase of

jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_270">Interpretation of the term „Gross turnover‟ by the Trial Court is
without jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_271">30.19. The findings of the Trial Court with respect to the interpretation
of the term ‗Gross turnover' are beyond the pleadings and evidence
before the Trial Court. On 03rd October, 2012, the Licensee filed an
application for amendment of the plaint under Order VI Rule 17<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_329"> of the
Code</a> of Civil Procedure to incorporate the new plea of meaning of the
term ‗Gross turnover', which was allowed by the Trial Court on 06 th
December, 2012, but set aside by this Court vide order dated 12 th
September, 2013 in CM(M) No.91/2013. However, this Court
permitted the Licensee to only take the legal pleas at the time of
arguments. As such, there were no pleadings or evidence before the
Trial Court with respect to the meaning of term ‗Gross turnover'.
Despite that the Trial Court considered the averments made in the
amendment application to interpret ‗Gross turnover'. The findings of
the Trial Court with respect to interpretation of the term ‗Gross
turnover' are perverse and therefore, set aside. Even otherwise, there
is no merit in the Licensee's contention as NDMC has adopted the
‗Gross Turnover' determined by the Licensee in their own audited
accounts in terms of clause 5 of the licence deed. The balance sheets
of the Licensee for the year ending 31st March, 2014 reflect the
admitted licence fee of Rs.35,31,52,823/- payable by the Licensee.
The balance sheets further reveal that the Licensee has shown the
licence fee as expenses, deducted from gross income and has thereby

Suit not valued properly for Court fees and jurisdiction and Trial
Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit
30.20. The Licensee has not valued the suit properly for the purposes
of Court fees and jurisdiction.    The Licensee was required to value
the suit for the purposes of Court fees and jurisdiction at
Rs.3,05,67,355.20/- and as per the said valuation, the Trial Court had
no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit.

Licensee did not prove the authority of the person to institute the

30.24. The Licensee did not lead any oral evidence to prove that the
suit has been signed, verified and instituted by a duly authorised
person. The Licensee also did not prove the resolution in favour of
the person who signed and verified the plaint and, therefore, the
findings of the Trial Court with respect to Issue No.3 are not correct.

 reasons recorded in the preceding paras, this Court is not basing the
dismissal of the suit on this ground.
</p>
<p id="p_274">30.25. Trial Court has completely ignored the loss to public exchequer
caused by the Licensee. As of today, the Licensee is liable to pay
outstanding dues of Rs.122 crores and NDMC is not able to recover
the said amount because of impugned judgment and decree. After
cancellation of its allotment, the Licensee became unauthorised
occupant of the property and liable to pay damages @ 30% above the
licence fee.
</p><p id="p_275">Conscious disregard of well settled law by the Licensee as well as by
the Trial Court
30.26. The impugned judgement and decree is vitiated on account of
conscious disregard of the well settled law by the Trial Court. The
Trial Court, who was obliged to apply law and adjudicate claims
according to law, is found to have thrown to winds all such basic and
fundamental principles of law. The Trial Court did not even consider
and apply its mind to the judgments cited by NDMC at the time of
hearing. The judicial discipline demands that the Trial Court should
have followed the well settled law. The judicial discipline is one of
the fundamental pillars on which judicial edifice rests and if such
discipline is routed, the entire edifice will be affected. It cannot be
gainsaid that the judgments mentioned below are binding on the
Licensee who could not have bypassed or disregarded them except at
the peril of contempt of this Court. This cannot be said to be a mere
lapse. The Trial Court has dared to disregard and deliberately ignore
the following judgments:-

discussed above, without any divergence of view whatsoever, I have
no other alternative but to conclude that the Licensee's suit for
declaration,     mandatory   and   permanent     injunction     was     not
maintainable and it amounts to gross abuse and misuse of the process

</p><p id="p_277">30.28. The impugned judgment under challenge, stands vitiated on
account of several serious errors of law, apparent on the face of it and
the Trial Court not only acted arbitrarily and irrationally on a perverse
understanding or misreading of the materials but also misdirected
himself on the vital issues before him so as to render the impugned
judgment to be one in utter disregard of law and the precedents.
Although the impugned judgment purports to determine the claims of
parties, a careful scrutiny of the same discloses total non-application
of mind to the actual, relevant and vital aspects and issues in their
proper perspective. Had there been a prudent and judicious approach,
the Trial Court could not have awarded any relief whatsoever to the
Licensee.
</p><p id="p_278">30.29. The impugned judgment is based on mere conjectures and pure
hypothetical exercises, absolutely divorced from rationality and
reality, inevitably making law, equity and justice, in the process, a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">RFA 78-2014                                                   Page 150 of 156</span>
 casualty.     The impugned judgment is so perverse, arbitrary and
irrational that no responsible judicial officer could have arrived at
such a decision.
</p><p id="p_279">30.30. The impugned judgment bristles with numerous infirmities and
errors of very serious nature undermining the very credibility and
objectivity of the reasoning as well as the ultimate conclusions arrived
at by the Trial Court. The impugned judgment has resulted in a
windfall in favour of the Licensee, more as a premium for their own
defaults and breaches. The Licensee has enjoyed the subject property
without paying the licence fee in terms of the licence deed which has
accumulated to the tune of Rs. 122 crores by virtue of the impugned
judgment of the Trial Court.
</p><p id="p_280">30.31. The conclusions in the impugned judgment are seriously
vitiated on account of gross misreading of the materials on record.
Conclusions directly contrary to the indisputable facts placed on
record throwing over board the well-settled norms, the basic and
fundamental principle that a violator of reciprocal promises cannot be
crowned with a prize for his defaults.
</p><p id="p_281">30.32. The conclusions arrived at by the Trial Court are nothing but
sheer perversity and contradiction in terms. Even common sense,
reason and ordinary prudence would commend for rejecting the claim
of the Licensee.
</p><p id="p_282">30.33. The manner in which the Trial Court has chosen to decree the
suit not only demonstrates perversity of approach, but per se proves
flagrant violation of the principles of law. The principles of well
settled law are found to have been observed more in their breach.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">RFA 78-2014                                                 Page 151 of 156</span>
<p id="p_283"> 30.34. The Trial Court appears to have relied upon mere surmises and
conjectures as though it constituted substantive evidence. The
impugned judgment suffers from obvious and patent errors of law and
facts.
</p><p id="p_284">30.35. The Trial Court failed in the duty and obligation to maintain
purity of standards and preserve full faith and credibility in the
judicial system. The impugned judgment, on the face of it, is shown to
be based upon a proposition of law which is unsound and findings
recorded are absurd, unreasonable and irrational.
30.36. This case warrants imposition of costs on the petitioners in
terms of the judgments of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/183635/" id="a_354">Ramrameshwari
Devi v. Nirmala    Devi</a> (supra)   and <a href="/doc/100486606/" id="a_355">Maria    Margarida      Sequeria

AD (Delhi) 373 and <a href="/doc/89844549/" id="a_359">Padmawati v. Harijan Sewak Sangh</a> (supra).
30.37. For the reasons discussed hereinabove, the appeal is allowed.
The Licensee's suit was not maintainable. The Trial Court had no
jurisdiction in this matter. The impugned judgment and decree are
non-est and therefore set aside. The Licensee's suit is dismissed with
costs of Rs.5,00,000/- to be paid by the Licensee to NDMC within
two months. All pending applications are disposed of.
30.38. This Court is constrained to hold that the Licensee made a false
claim, dragged the case for years by filing one application after the
other and misled the Court on law as well as facts. The Licensee did



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">RFA 78-2014                                                Page 152 of 156</span>
 not pursue the proceedings honestly before the Trial Court.
30.39. The next question that arises is as to what action should be
taken against the Licensee who has abused the process of the Court
and has indulged in frivolous litigation which is clear from the fact
that before this Court, the Licensee could not support prayer (i) of the
plaint and declaration granted by the Trial Court declaring clause 3 of
the licence deed as void. On 03rd August, 2015, the Licensee made a
statement to give up prayer (i) of the decree granted by the Trial
Court, meaning thereby, that the Licensee admitted that the impugned
judgment relating to prayer (i) was not sustainable in law. It further
implies that the Licensee had misled the Trial Court to pass an illegal
decree. The further implication is that the dropping of prayer (i),
which was the sole ground for avoiding the bar of Section 15 of the
Public Premise Act, would result in the remaining suit being clearly
barred by Section 15 of the Public Premises Act.
30.40. This Court strongly deprecates the manner in which the
successive applications were filed just to delay the hearing of the suit.
By filing one application after the other before the Trial Court, the
Licensee succeeded in enjoying the possession of the premises for the
last more than 18 years after the termination of the licence without
paying the licence fee in terms of the licence deed. About 170
hearings took place in the suit filed by the Licensee.
30.41. The Licensee has no respect for truth and has polluted the pure
fountain of justice with tainted hands. The Licensee has played tricks
by delaying the proceedings before the Trial Court for more than 18
years. The Licensee has interfered with the administration of justice.

<p id="p_285"> This case warrants strict action to be taken. It is a fit case for ordering
inquiry or initiating proceedings for contempt of Court. However, the
action against the Licensee is deferred for two weeks to enable the
Licensee to introspect and file an undertaking to abide by the terms of
the licence deed dated 16th July, 1982 and not to resort to any
frivolous proceedings/action in future. Since this appeal is being
disposed of, the Licensee shall file his undertaking before the Writ
Court in WP(C) No.1629/2015. In the event of the failure of the
Licensee to file such an undertaking within two weeks, NDMC is
permitted to initiate proceedings for criminal contempt against the
Licensee.
</p><p id="p_286">30.42. The Estate Officer is directed to expedite the proceedings
under <a href="/doc/27902/" id="a_360">Section 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1376406/" id="a_361">Section 7</a> of the Public Premises (Eviction of
Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 and endeavour to decide the same
within six months. The Estate Officer shall not permit the Licensee to
re-agitate the findings of this Court.
</p><p id="p_287">31. Post Script
31.1. This Court is of the view that there is need to evolve strong
measures to curb the frivolous litigation pending before the Trial
Courts. This case is an eye opener where the Licensee instituted a
frivolous suit which was clearly barred by law, succeeded in obtaining
an interim order and thereafter, the Licensee deliberately kept on
delaying the suit by filing one application after the other and thereby
succeeded in delaying the suit for more than 18 years. In the
meantime, the Licensee's liability, increased from Rs.3.5 crores in the
year 1995 to the tune of Rs.122 crores.

<p id="p_288"> 31.2. This Court is of the view that day to day trial should be
conducted in such frivolous suits. The first thing required in this
regard is to identify the frivolous cases pending before the Trial
Courts. All the Courts below are, therefore, directed to initially scan
the pending cases which are more than 5 years old and identify cases
in which there is prima facie material to show that having secured ad
interim order, the litigant is deliberately delaying the disposal of the
suit. The Trial Courts shall also identify the cases in which there is an
objection relating to the bar of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to
entertain and try the suit. The Trial Courts shall complete this exercise
within two months and submit their report with respect to the
particulars of such cases to the District Judge, who shall place the
report (through the Registrar General of this Court) before the ACR
Committee of the Trial Court judges. The Trial Court shall expedite
the hearing of such cases and also submit a report with respect to the
time frame required to decide those cases.
</p><p id="p_289">31.3. The report of the Trial Courts in respect of five year old cases
shall contain the relevant particulars, namely, suit number; nature of
suit; particulars of the interim order; whether any party delaying the
proceedings by filing applications or otherwise; whether evidence has
been concluded; how many applications have been filed in the matter;
and reasons for delay in disposal.
</p><p id="p_290">31.4. The Registrar General shall ensure the compliance of these
directions by all the Courts below. Copy of this judgment be sent to
the Registrar General.

 copy of this judgment be sent to the Delhi Judicial Academy. The
Delhi Judicial Academy shall sensitize the judges with respect to the
principles relating to the consequences for not following the well
settled law.
