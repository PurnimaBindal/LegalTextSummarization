<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3"> 	A Bench of three learned Judges of this Court made 
the following order of reference on 7th March, 2002: -
</p>
<p id="p_4">	"In the present case, under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> 
of the Consumer Protection Act, the 
President of the State Consumer Disputes 
Redressal Commission has to be appointed 
in consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
State.  The question which arises is 
whether consultation with an Acting Chief 
Justice is sufficient compliance or not.  This 
question involves interpretation of Articles 
217 and 223 of the Constitution and as 
there is no decision of this Court which can 
be applied in the present case, then by 
virtue of <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_2">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution 
this case involving the said question of law 
involving interpretation of the Constitution 
should be heard by a Bench of not less 
than five learned Judges.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Let the papers be placed before the 
Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for 
appropriate orders for hearing of the case 
as expeditiously as possible and within a 
period of four months."
</p>

<p id="p_6">Articles 217 to the extent relevant and 223 of the 
Constitution of India read: -
</p><p id="p_7">"217. Appointment and conditions of 
the office of a Judge of a High Court.  
(1) Every Judge of a High Court shall be 
appointed by the President by warrant 
under his hand and seal after consultation 
with the Chief Justice of India, the 
Governor of the State, and, in the case of 
appointment of a Judge other than the 
Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High 
court, and shall hold office, in the case of 
an additional or acting Judge, as provided 
in <a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_3">article 224</a>, and in any other case, until 
he attains the age of sixty-two years: 
</p>
<p id="p_8"> "223.	Appointment of acting Chief 
Justice.  When the office of Chief Justice 
of a High Court is vacant or when any such 
Chief Justice is by reason of absence or

his office, the duties of the office shall be 
performed by such one of the other Judges 
of the court as the President may appoint 
for the purposes."
</p>

<p id="p_9">	On 3rd March, 2000 The Financial Commissioner-cum-
Secretary (F&amp;S), Government of Himachal Pradesh, 
addressed a letter to Registrar General, Himachal Pradesh 
High Court stating that Justice P.N. Nag (retired Judge of 
the High Court) shall cease to hold the post of President of 
H.P. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, 
Shimla (for short 'the State Commission) on 4.3.2000, after 
attaining the age of 67 years.  In accordance with the 
provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_4">The Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986 
(for short 'the Act'), a person who is or has been a Judge of 
High Court can be appointed as President of the State 
Commission, after consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court.  After consideration the State Government 
decided to take the services of Justice Surinder Swaroop, a 
sitting Judge of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh for 
appointment as President of the State Commission.  
Therefore, he requested that the proposal of the State 
Government may kindly be placed before the Hon'ble Chief 
Justice, High Court for consideration and recommending the 
name of Justice Surinder Swaroop for appointment as 
President of the State Commission on part-time basis.
	On the same day the High Court addressed a letter to 
the State Government indicating that there was defect in 
the process adopted by the State Government and that the 
reference made by the State Government was not in 
conformity with the provisions of law as the executive is 
expected to approach the Hon'ble Chief Justice when the 
appointment was to be made, to initiate the proposal as per 
the procedure to be followed for appointment of High Court 
Judge.
</p><p id="p_10">	The State Government wrote the second letter to the 
Registrar General of the High Court requesting the Hon'ble 
Chief Justice to initiate the process for filling up the vacancy 
to the post of President of the State Commission in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act and the law laid 
down by this Court in <a href="/doc/1398587/" id="a_5">Ashish Handa, Advocate vs. 
Hon</a>'ble the Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab &amp; 
Haryana and others .
</p><p id="p_11">	On 7th March 2000 the Registrar General of the High 
Court addressed a letter to the Financial Commissioner-
cum-Secretary (F&amp;S) of the State Government conveying 
recommendation of the Chief Justice for appointment of Mr. 
Justice Surinder Swaroop, a sitting Judge of the High Court, 
as President of the State Commission holding additional 
charge of the post.  In the said letter it was also stated that 
the steps may be taken for appointment of Mr. Justice 
Surinder Swaroop (respondent No. 3 herein) as President of 
the State Commission in accordance with law and rules.  
Thereafter, a notification dated 13th March, 2000 was issued 
by the Governor, Himachal Pradesh, appointing Justice 
Surinder Swaroop as President of the State Commission.
	Appellant No. 1, a permanent resident of Namol and a 
practicing advocate at Solan and appellant No. 2, a retired 
Research Officer resident of Shimla, filed Civil Writ Petition 
No. 647 of 2000 in the High Court claiming to espouse 
public interest stating that they were interested in proper 
functioning of the State Commission.  According to them 
the appointment of respondent No. 3  Justice Surinder 
Swaroop  as President of the State Commission was not in 
accordance with law and was contrary to the decisions of 
this Court.  They sought for writ of quo warranto to the 
respondent No. 1 to quash the appointment of respondent 
No. 3 mainly contending that there was a defect in the 
initiation process for appointment to the post of President of 
the State Commission on the ground that the process was 
initiated by the State Government instead of Chief Justice 
and that the Acting Chief Justice did not consult the two 
senior most Judges of the High Court before recommending 
the name of respondent No. 3 for appointment as the 
President of the State Commission.  In support of these 
contentions they placed reliance on the decisions of this 
Court in <a href="/doc/1398587/" id="a_6">Ashish Handa, Advocate vs. Hon</a>'ble the Chief 
Justice of High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana and others 
(supra) and Supreme Court <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_7">Advocates-on-Record 
Association and others vs. Union of India</a> .
	Respondent Nos. 1 and 3 resisted the writ petition and 
respondent No. 2, the High Court, made the position clear 
having regard to the records.
</p><p id="p_12">	The High Court, after consideration of the respective 
contentions advanced on behalf of the parties and in the 
light of the decisions of this Court, held that the case of 
Ashish Handa (supra) related to the initiation of 'process', 
which was required to be followed in making appointment 
of President of the State Commission, and that such 
process should not have been initiated by the Government 
but it ought to have been initiated by the Chief Justice. On 
facts the High Court found that although initially the 
process was started by the Government proposing the name 
of respondent No. 3, respondent No. 2, however, was aware 
of the legal position and it immediately drew the attention 
of respondent No. 1 that the procedure adopted by 
respondent No. 1 was not in accordance with law.  
Therefore, second letter was addressed by respondent No. 
1 to respondent No. 2.  Respondent No. 2 on receipt of the 
second letter made the recommendation to appoint 
respondent No. 3 as President of the State Commission.  On 
that issue the High Court held that the action taken either 
by respondent No. 1 or by respondent No. 2 could not be 
said to be contrary to law or the directions issued by this 
Court in the case of Ashish Handa (supra). Consequently 
the writ petition was dismissed.  Hence, this appeal.
 	The High Court, in the impugned judgment, dealing 
with initiation of the process and consultation for 
appointment of respondent No. 3 as President of the State 
Commission, has observed, thus: -
</p><p id="p_13">"The counsel for the petitioners contended 
that appointment of a person as President 
to the State Commission, as ruled by the 
Supreme Court in Ashish Handa, has to be 
made in accordance with the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_8">Article 217</a> of the Constitution.  In other 
words, before an appointment of a sitting 
or retired Judge of a High Court is made as 
the President of the State Commission, 
there should be consultation at three 
levels; firstly, consultation with the Chief 
Justice of India, secondly, consultation with 
the Governor of the State and thirdly, 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court concerned.
</p><p id="p_14">xxx		xxx		xxx		xxx
	Hence, if the submission of the learned 
counsel is upheld, the result would be as 
under:
</p><p id="p_15">	Before the appointment of respondent 
No. 3 by respondent No. 1 as the President 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">of the State Commission, respondent No. 1 </span>
ought to have consulted the Governor of 
the State (the State Government), (which 
is the appointing authority in the instant 
case), the Chief Justice of India (not the 
Chief Justice of India in his individual 
capacity but collectively, along with the 
collegium), the Chief Justice of this Court 
(not the Chief Justice in his individual 
capacity, but with the collegium, that is, his 
two senior most colleagues) and also a 
Judge or Judges, who is/are in the 
Supreme Court who is/are likely to be 
conversant with the affairs of this High 
Court.  Unless the above procedure is 
strictly adhered to, the appointment of 
respondent No. 3 as the President of the 
State Commission cannot be held legal and 
lawful."
</p>
<p id="p_16">In relation to the law laid down by this Court in Ashish 
Handa the High Court noted that it was not the case before 
the High Court that the Chief Justice had consulted his two 
senior most colleagues before approving the name of 
Justice Agnihotri and yet the appointment was not 
interfered with.  The High Court also expressed that in 
Ashish Handa this Court has laid down that under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_9">Section 
16</a> of the Act process for appointment of a sitting or retired 
Judge as President of the State Commission should be 
initiated by the Chief Justice as is done in the case of 
appointment of a Judge to a High Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_10">Article 217</a> of 
the Constitution and that such process should not be 
initiated by the Government.  
</p><p id="p_17">	Before us, learned counsel for the appellants urged 
that: -
</p><p id="p_18">1.	since the recommendation to appoint respondent No. 
3 was made by the Acting Chief Justice without 
consulting two senior most Judges as required in the 
light of decisions of this Court in Supreme Court 
Advocates-on-Record Association (supra) and 
Ashish Handa (supra), the High Court ought to have 
allowed the writ petition and quashed the appointment 
of respondent No. 3.
</p><p id="p_19">2.	<a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_11">The Act</a>ing Chief Justice could not initiate the process 
for appointment of respondent No. 3 under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_12">Section 16</a> 
of the Act as it is only the Chief Justice, who is to be 
consulted; the Acting Chief Justice is not appointed to 
the Office of Chief Justice, he is only to discharge the 
duties of the Chief Justice.  Reliance was placed on the 
decision of High Court of Allahabad in <a href="/doc/229217/" id="a_13">Bishal Chand 
Jain vs. Chattur Sen and others</a> .
</p><p id="p_20"> 	In opposition learned counsel for the respondents in 
their arguments reiterated the submissions that were made 
before the High Court and supported the impugned 
judgment for the very reasons stated therein.
	The learned counsel for the Union of India and for 
Attorney General submitted that consultation should be as 
stated in two decisions of this Court in Ashish Handa and 
Supreme Advocates-on-Record Association (supra), 
i.e., the Chief Justice of a High Court has to consult two 
senior most Judges in the case of appointment of a sitting 
or retired Judge of the High Court as President of the State 
Commission.  As regards the discharge of duties of the 
Chief Justice by the Acting Chief Justice, the submission 
was that the Acting Chief Justice could perform all the 
functions of the Chief Justice by virtue of <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_14">Article 223</a> of the 
Constitution, otherwise there will be practical difficulty 
leading to anomalous situation in cases where the Chief 
Justices are not appointed for some reasons and Acting 
Chief Justices continue for longer period.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	<a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_15">Section 16</a> of the Act, to the extent relevant, reads: -
</p>

<p id="p_22">"16. Composition of the State 
Commission. - (1) Each State Commission 
shall consist of, - 
</p><p id="p_23">(a) a person who is or has been a Judge of 
a High Court, appointed by the State 
Government, who shall be its President : 
Provided that no appointment under this 
clause shall be made except after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court."
</p>
<p id="p_24">	In the case of Ashish Handa the question that came 
up for consideration was as to initiation of process in the 
matter of appointment.  A person, who is or has been a 
Judge of a High Court, shall be appointed by the State 
Government as President of the State Commission after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court as per 
<a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_16">Section 16</a> of the Act.  This Court held that the executive is 
expected to approach the Chief Justice when the 
appointment is to be made for taking the steps to initiate 
the proposal.  Para 3 of the judgment reads: -
"3. <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_17">The Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986 is 
an Act to provide for better protection of 
the interests of consumers "and for that 
purpose to make provision for the 
establishment of consumer councils and 
other authorities for the settlement of 
consumers' disputes and for matters 
connected therewith". The National 
Commission, the State Commission and the 
District Forum are established as the 
agencies for the redressal of consumer 
disputes by <a href="/doc/785641/" id="a_18">Section 9</a> of the Act. Section l0 
of the Act provides for composition of the 
District Forum, <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_19">Section 16</a> for the State 
Commission and <a href="/doc/1014113/" id="a_20">Section 20</a> for the 
National Commission. The scheme is that 
these three agencies constituted for 
redressal of consumer disputes at different 
levels have as its President a person who 
is, or has been a Judge at the 
corresponding level. This is so because the 
function of these agencies is primarily the 
adjudication of consumer disputes and, 
therefore, a person from the judicial branch 
is considered to be suitable for the office of 
the President. The appointment to the 
office of the President of the State 
Commission is to be made "only after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court" and to the office of the 
President of the National Commission "after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of 
India". Such a provision requiring prior 
consultation with the Chief Justice is 
obviously for the reason that he is the most 
suitable person to know about the 
suitability of the person to be appointed as 
the President of the Commission. The 
provisions in <a href="/doc/803902/" id="a_21">Section 16(1)(a)</a> for 
appointment of the President of the State 
Commission and in <a href="/doc/838485/" id="a_22">Section 20(1)(a)</a> for 
appointment of the President of the 
National Commission are in pari materia 
and have to be similarly construed. The 
construction of the proviso in <a href="/doc/803902/" id="a_23">Section 
16(1)(a)</a> and that in <a href="/doc/838485/" id="a_24">Section 20(1)(a)</a> must 
be the same because of the identity of the 
language. The expression "after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court" and "after consultation with the 
Chief Justice of India" must be construed in 
the same manner as the expression "after 
consultation with the Chief Justice of 
India,... the Chief Justice of the High Court" 
in <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_25">Article 217</a> of the Constitution of India 
made in Supreme Court Advocates-on-
</p><p id="p_25"><a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_26">Record Assn. v. Union of India</a> [(1993) 4 
SCC 441]. Accordingly, the opinion of the 
Chief Justice of the High Court and the 
requirement of consultation with him 
according to the proviso in <a href="/doc/803902/" id="a_27">Section 16(1)(a)</a> 
must have the same status as that of the 
Chief Justice of the High Court in the 
appointment of a High Court Judge under 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_28">Article 217</a> of the Constitution of India; and 
the process of appointment to the office of 
the President of the State Commission 
must also be similar. It is unnecessary to 
restate the same which is summarised in 
the majority opinion in the Judges-II case 
[(1993) 4 SCC 441]. This is necessary to 
maintain independence of the judiciary and 
to avoid any possibility of a sitting or a 
retired Judge depending on the executive 
for such an appointment. Our attention was 
drawn to certain observations in <a href="/doc/538878/" id="a_29">Sarwan 
Singh Lamba v. Union of India</a> [(1995) 4 
SCC 546 : 1995 SCC (L&amp;S) 546 : (1995) 
30 ATC 585], to suggest that the name for 
appointment to the Administrative Tribunal 
may be suggested even by the executive 
which may have the effect of initiating the 
proposal. In the facts of that case, 
substantial compliance of the requirement 
of approval by the Chief Justice of India 
was found proved and, therefore, the 
appointments were upheld. The 
requirement of consultation with the Chief 
Justice in the proviso to <a href="/doc/803902/" id="a_30">Section 16(1)(a)</a> 
and <a href="/doc/838485/" id="a_31">Section 20(1)(a)</a> of the Consumer 
Protection Act being similar to that in 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_32">Article 217</a>, the principles enunciated in the 
majority opinion in the Judges-II case must 
apply, as indicated earlier, even for 
initiating the proposal. The executive is 
expected to approach the Chief Justice 
when the appointment is to be made for 
taking the steps to initiate the proposal. 
and the procedure followed should be the 
same as for appointment of a High Court 
Judge. That would give greater credibility 
to the appointment made."
</p><p id="p_26">(emphasis supplied)
The aforementioned decision of this Court is to be read and 
understood on the facts and in the context in relation to 
initiation of the process for the appointment of a sitting or 
retired Judge as the President of the State Commission.  
The High Court in the impugned judgment also states that 
the judgment of this Court in Ashish Handa should not be 
understood or construed as insisting upon to follow the 
same procedure, which has to be followed for appointment 
of a Judge of a High Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_33">Article 217</a> of the 
Constitution.  If the judgment in Ashish Handa is to be 
read in the way the appellants projected, it will lead to 
anomalous situation and further it does not stand to reason.
	The process of consultation envisaged under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_34">Section 
16</a> of the Act can neither be equated to the constitutional 
requirement of consultation under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_35">Article 217</a> of the 
Constitution of India in relation to appointment of a Judge 
of a High Court nor can it be placed on the same pedestal.  
Consultation by the Chief Justice of the High Court with two 
senior most Judges in selecting a suitable candidate for 
appointment as a Judge is for the purpose of selecting the 
best person to the high office of a Judge of the High Court 
as a constitutional functionary.  Consultation with the Chief 
Justice of the High Court in terms of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_36">Section 16</a> of the Act is 
a statutory requirement.  This apart, the interpretation of a 
provision of the Constitution having regard to various 
aspects serving the purpose and mandate of the 
Constitution by this Court stands on a separate footing.  A 
constitution unlike other statutes is meant to be a durable 
instrument to serve through longer number of years, i.e., 
ages without frequent revision.  It is intended to serve the 
needs of the day when it was enacted and also to meet 
needs of the changing conditions of the future.  This Court 
in <a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_37">R.C. Poudyal vs. Union of India and others</a> , in 
paragraph 124, observed thus: -
</p><p id="p_27">"124.	In judicial review of the vires of the 
exercise of a constitutional power such as 
the one under <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_38">Article 2</a>, the significance 
and importance of the political components 
of the decision deemed fit by Parliament 
cannot be put out of consideration as long 
as the conditions do not violate the 
constitutional fundamentals.  In the 
interpretation of a constitutional document, 
"words are but the framework of concepts 
and concepts may change more than words 
themselves".  The significance of the 
change of the concepts themselves is vital 
and the constitutional issues are not solved 
by a mere appeal to the meaning of the 
words without an acceptance of the line of 
their growth.  It is aptly said that "the 
intention of a Constitution is rather to 
outline principles than to engrave details"."
</p>
<p id="p_28">In the first B.N. Rau Memorial Lecture on 'Judicial Methods' 
M. Hidayatullah, J. observed, "More freedom exists in the 
interpretation of the Constitution than in the interpretation 
of ordinary laws.  This is due to the fact that the ordinary 
law is more often before courts, that there are always dicta 
of judges readily available while in the domain of 
constitutional law there is again and again novelty of 
situation and approach.  Chief Justice Marshall while 
deciding the celeberated Mc. Culloch v. Maryland (4 
Wheaton 316, 407) made the pregnant remark  "We must 
never forget that it is the constitution we are expounding"  
meaning thereby that it is a question of new meaning in 
new circumstances.  Cardozo in his lectures also said: "The 
great generalities of the Constitution have a content and a 
significance that vary from age to age."  Chief Justice 
Marshall in Mc. Culloch vs. Maryland declared that the 
constitution was 'intended to endure for ages to come, and 
consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human 
affairs....'  In this regard it is worthwhile to see the 
observations made in paragraphs 324 to 326 in Supreme 
Court Advocates-on-Record Association: -
"324. The case before us must be 
considered in the light of our entire 
experience and not merely in that of what 
was said by the Framers of the 
Constitution. While deciding the questions 
posed before us we must consider what is 
the judiciary today and not what it was fifty 
years back. The Constitution has not only 
to be read in the light of contemporary 
circumstances and values, it has to be read 
in such a way that the circumstances and 
values of the present generation are given 
expression in its provisions. An eminent 
jurist observed that "constitutional 
interpretation is as much a process of 
creation as one of discovery." 
</p><p id="p_29">325. It would be useful to quote hereunder 
a paragraph from the judgment of 
Supreme Court of Canada in Hunter v. 
</p><p id="p_30">Southam Inc. [(1984) 2 SCR 145, 156 
(Can)] : 
</p><p id="p_31">"It is clear that the meaning of 
'unreasonable' cannot be 
determined by recourse to a 
dictionary, nor for that matter, 
by reference to the rules of 
statutory construction. The task 
of expounding a constitution is 
crucially different from that of 
construing a statute. A statute 
defines present rights and 
obligations. It is easily enacted 
and as easily repealed. A 
Constitution, by contrast, is 
drafted with an eye to the 
future. Its function is to provide 
a continuing framework for the 
legitimate exercise of 
governmental power and, when 
joined by a Bill or a Charter of 
Rights, for the unremitting 
protection of individual rights 
and liberties. Once enacted, its 
provisions cannot easily be 
repealed or amended. It must, 
therefore, be capable of growth 
and development over time to 
meet new social, political and 
historical realities often 
unimagined by its framers. The 
judiciary is the guardian of the 
Constitution and must, in 
interpreting its provisions, bear 
these considerations in mind. 
</p><p id="p_32">Professor Paul Freund expressed 
this idea aptly when he 
admonished the American 
Courts 'not to read the 
provisions of the Constitution 
like a last will and testament 
lest it become one'." 
</p><p id="p_33">326. The constitutional provisions cannot 
be cut down by technical construction 
rather it has to be given liberal and 
meaningful interpretation. The ordinary 
rules and presumptions, brought in aid to 
interpret the statutes, cannot be made 
applicable while interpreting the provisions 
of the Constitution. In Minister of Home 
Affairs v. Fisher [(1979) 3 All ER 21 : 
</p><p id="p_34">(1980) AC 319] dealing with Bermudian 
Constitution, Lord Wilberforce reiterated 
that a Constitution is a document "sui 
generis, calling for principles of 
interpretation of its own, suitable to its 
character". "
</p><p id="p_35">(emphasis supplied)
This Court in <a href="/doc/509065/" id="a_39">Ms. Aruna Roy and others vs. Union of 
India and others</a>  recalled the famous words of the Chief 
Justice Holmes that "spirit of law is not logic but it has been 
experience" and observed that these words apply with 
greater force to constitutional law.  In the same judgment 
this Court expressed that Constitution is a permanent 
document framed by the people and has been accepted by 
the people to govern them for all times to come and that 
the words and expressions used in the Constitution, in that 
sense, have no fixed meaning and must receive 
interpretation based on the experience of the people in the 
course of working of the Constitution.  The same thing 
cannot be said in relation to interpreting the words and 
expressions in a statute.
</p><p id="p_36"> 	Verma, J. (as he then was) speaking for the majority 
in the case of Supreme Court Advocates-on-Records 
Association, in paragraph 433, has stated, thus: -
"433.	It is with this perception that the 
nature of primacy, if any, of the Chief 
Justice of India, in the present context, has 
to be examined in the constitutional 
scheme.  The hue of the word 
'consultation', when the consultation is with 
the Chief Justice of India as the head of the 
Indian Judiciary, for the purpose of 
composition of higher judiciary, has to be 
distinguished from the colour and the same 
word 'consultation' may take in the context 
of the executive associated in that process 
to assist in the selection of the best 
available material."
</p>
<p id="p_37">(emphasis supplied)

	Pandian,J. in his concurring opinion in Supreme 
Court Advocates-on-Records Association 
aforementioned, with regard to meaning of the word 
'consultation' has observed that the derivative meaning of 
the word in the context depended not merely on its 
ordinary lexicon definition but greatly upon its contents 
according to the circumstances and the time in which the 
word or expression is used; therefore, in order to ascertain 
its colour and content one must examine the context in 
which that word is used.  In this regard in paragraph 163 it 
is stated that: -
</p><p id="p_38">	"The word 'consultation' is used in the 
context of appointment of Judges to the 
Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_40">Article 124(2)</a> and to 
the High Courts under <a href="/doc/259647/" id="a_41">Article 217(1).</a>  
Though such a consultation is not 
constitutionally required in the case of 
appointment of other constitutional 
appointees, which we have indicated and 
itemized in the proceeding part of this 
judgment."
</p><p id="p_39">(emphasis supplied)

Further, in paragraph 196 it is observed that in the 
background of the factual and legal position, meaning of the 
word 'consultation' cannot be confined to its ordinary 
lexicon definition; its contents greatly vary according to the 
circumstances and the context in which the word is used as 
in our Constitution.  In paragraph 195 it is stated that the 
consultation with the Chief Justice of India by the President 
is relatable to the judiciary and not to any other service; in 
the process of various constitutional appointments, 
'consultation' is required only to the judicial office in 
contrast to the other high ranking constitutional offices.
	It is thus clear that the expression 'consultation' used 
in <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_42">Article 217</a> of the Constitution of India in relation to 
appointment of High Court Judges cannot be read in the 
same way into 'consultation' as contemplated under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_43">Section 
16</a> of the Act in the light of what is stated above in the 
Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association.  
The meaning of the word 'consultation' must be given in the 
context of an enactment.  If the argument that the 
consultation process in regard to appointment of a Judge or 
retired Judge of High Court to the State Commission under 
<a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_44">Section 16</a> must be in the same manner as required under 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_45">Article 217</a> of the Constitution, it will lead to anomalous 
situation.  Under <a href="/doc/259647/" id="a_46">Article 217(1)</a> of the Constitution, 
consultation contemplated with constitutional functionaries 
mentioned therein is for the purpose of appointment of a 
Judge of a High Court and not for appointment of a person 
as the President of the State Commission under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_47">Section 16</a> 
of the Act.  If the consultation to be made for appointment 
of a person as President of the State Commission, as 
required under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_48">Section 16</a> of the Act, is to be similar as 
under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_49">Article 217</a> of the Constitution, then, even in case of 
appointment of a retired Judge as President of the State 
Commission, such consultation has to be made with all 
constitutional functionaries, which does not stand to reason.  
Hence, obviously for appointment of a person as President 
of the State Commission consultation as required under 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_50">Article 217</a> of the Constitution as against the requirement 
stated in <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_51">Section 16</a> of the Act is not necessary.  If that be 
so not only opinion of two senior most Judges of the High 
Court should be obtained but also the consultation should 
be made with other constitutional functionaries as 
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_52">Article 217</a> of the Constitution including 
the Chief Justice of India.  Hence insistence on 
'consultation' by the Chief Justice of a High Court with his 
two senior most colleagues in the High Court for the 
purpose of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_53">Section 16</a> of the Act, in our view, is 
unwarranted.
</p><p id="p_40">While dealing with the question of primacy of the 
opinion of the Chief Justice of India in that context this 
Court held that such opinion of Chief Justice is to be formed 
collectively after taking into account the views of his senior 
colleagues, who are required to be consulted by him for the 
formation of his opinion.  As is evident from paragraph 450 
of the same judgment consultation with the Chief Justice of 
India was introduced because of the realization that the 
Chief Justice is best equipped to know and assess the worth 
of the candidate and his suitability for appointment as a 
superior judge; and it was also necessary to eliminate 
political influence even at the stage of the initial 
appointment of a judge.  In order to select the best 
candidate and to give primacy to the opinion of the Chief 
Justice this Court held that consultation with two senior 
most Judges of the High Court was needed in the matter of 
recommending a candidate for appointment as Judge of the 
High Court.  Under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_54">Section 16</a> of the Act only a person, who 
is or has been a Judge of a High Court, is eligible to be 
appointed as President of the State Commission.  
 	In the matter of appointment of Judges of the High 
Court, in paragraph 478 of the same judgment, it is stated, 
thus: -
</p><p id="p_41">	"In matters relating to appointments in 
the High Courts, the Chief Justice of India 
is expected to take into account the views 
of his colleagues in the Supreme Court who 
are likely to be conversant with the affairs 
of the concerned High Court.  The Chief 
Justice of India may also ascertain the 
views of one or more senior Judges of that 
High Court whose opinion, according to the 
Chief Justice of India, is likely to be 
significant in the formation of his opinion.  
The opinion of the Chief Justice of the High 
Court would be entitled to the greatest 
weight, and the opinion of the other 
functionaries involved must be given due 
weight, in the formation of the opinion of 
the Chief Justice of India.  The opinion of 
the Chief Justice of the High Court must be 
formed after ascertaining the views of at 
least the two seniormost Judges of the High 
Court."
</p>
<p id="p_42">In regard to initiation of the process for appointment, in 
paragraph 478(10) it is stated: -
</p><p id="p_43">"(10)	To achieve this purpose, and to 
give legitimacy and greater credibility to 
the process of appointment, the process 
must be initiated by the Chief Justice of 
India in the case of the Supreme Court, 
and the Chief Justice of the High Court in 
the case of the High Courts.  This is the 
general practice prevailing, by convention, 
followed over the years, and continues to 
be the general rule even now, after <a href="/doc/1294854/" id="a_55">S.P. 
Gupta vs. Union of India</a> [1981 Supp. SCC 
87].  The executive itself has so understood 
the correct procedure, notwithstanding S.P. 
Gupta and there is no reason to depart 
from it when it is in consonance with the 
concept of the independence of the 
judiciary."
</p>
<p id="p_44">In Ashish Handa this Court, having regard to what is 
stated above, held that it is the Chief Justice of the High 
Court, who should initiate the process in the matter of 
appointment of a Judge, sitting or retired, as President of 
the State Commission.
</p><p id="p_45">In that case, as already noticed above, this Court was 
dealing with initiation of the process for appointment of a 
sitting or retired Judge as President of the State 
Commission.  It is in that context this Court held that the 
process must be initiated by the Chief Justice of the High 
Court and not by the executive of the State.  The reading of 
the judgment gives an impression that the consultation 
process must be the same in respect of appointment of a 
sitting or retired Judge to State Commission as is required 
for appointment of a High Court Judge in terms of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_56">Article 
217</a> of the Constitution.  Firstly, the said judgment should 
be read and understood in the context of that case, the 
question that arose for consideration and what was really 
decided, i.e., initiation of process by the Chief Justice of the 
High Court.  To remove doubt, if any, we make it clear that 
the consultation for the purpose of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_57">Section 16</a> of the Act in 
relation to the appointment of a Judge or a retired Judge of 
a High Court as President of the State Commission cannot 
be taken or equated to consultation process as required 
under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_58">Article 217</a> of the Constitution, which, in our view, is 
the correct position.  Certain statements made by this Court 
in Ashish Handa, in para 3, give an impression that Chief 
Justice of a High Court has to consult his two senior most 
colleagues before recommending a sitting or retired Judge 
for appointment as President of a State Commission as per 
<a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_59">Section 16</a> of the Act.  In our view that is not the correct 
position and we do not approve the same.  To put it 
positively, we state that for the purpose of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_60">Section 16</a> of 
the Act a Chief Justice of a High Court need not consult his 
two senior most colleagues in the High Court for 
recommending a sitting or retired Judge of a High Court for 
appointment as President of a State Commission.
	We must also keep in mind one more aspect. Under 
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_61">Article 217</a> of the Constitution for the purpose of 
appointment of a Judge to a High Court in view of decision 
in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Records Association 
and that too interpreting the constitutional provisions to 
maintain the independence of judiciary and to select the 
best of the persons as judges such a procedure is adopted.  
A person to be appointed as President of the State 
Commission has to be necessarily a sitting or a retired 
Judge of a High Court and not that any person can be 
appointed as President of the State Commission.  This being 
the position, it does not stand to the reason as to why 
again in respect of a sitting or retired Judge of a High Court 
the whole process contemplated under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_62">Article 217</a> of the 
Constitution must be resorted to.  To put in clear terms so 
as to remove any doubt we state that in the matter of 
appointment of a sitting or retired Judge of a High Court as 
President of the State Commission process must be initiated 
by the Chief Justice under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_63">Section 16</a> of the Act and 
'consultation' contemplated in the said Section is 
'consultation' only with the Chief Justice of the High Court 
and not with the collegium.
</p><p id="p_46">	Argument that the 'consultation' under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_64">Section 16</a> of 
the Act should be with the Chief Justice of the High Court 
and not with the Acting Chief Justice is not acceptable and 
this argument does not pose any serious problem having 
regard to the clear constitutional provision.  The decision in 
<a href="/doc/229217/" id="a_65">Bishal Chand Jain vs. Chattur Sen and others</a> (supra), 
cited on behalf of the appellants does not help them for the 
reasons more than one.  That decision was on the facts of 
that case and the question that has arisen for consideration 
in the present case did not arise there even remotely.  In 
that case plaintiff filed first appeal against the judgment 
and decree of Civil Judge made in the original suit.  In the 
first appeal a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of 
the appellant himself to the effect that the High Court was 
not properly constituted and that appeal could not be heard 
on the ground that the office of the Chief Justice of the High 
Court fell vacant as a result of the elevation of Mr. Justice 
V. Bhargava, Chief Justice of that High Court to the Bench 
of this Court; Nasirullah Beg, J., a senior most Judge of the 
Court was appointed as Acting Chief Justice of the High 
Court, but as oath of office had not been taken by him, the 
High Court could not be deemed to be properly constituted.  
Alternatively, there was no Chief Justice at that time and 
thus the Court was not properly constituted.  It was in that 
context the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, in 
paragraph 7, has stated thus: -
</p><p id="p_47">"(7)	 We are, however, of the view that 
<a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_66">Article 223</a> of the Constitution does not 
contemplate the appointment of a Chief 
Justice of a High Court or an appointment 
to the office of Chief Justice of a High 
Court.  In spite of such appointment being 
made under <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_67">Article 223</a>, the office of the 
Chief Justice remains vacant till a fresh 
appointment is made to that office.  It is on 
account of the existence of a vacancy in 
the office of Chief Justice that one or the 
other Judges of the High Court is appointed 
by the President for the purpose of 
performing the duties of the office of Chief 
Justice.  If such appointment is to be held 
to put an end to the vacancy, then the 
exigency of such an appointment ceases to 
exist.  It, therefore, follows that exercise of 
powers under <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_68">Article 223</a> of the 
Constitution by the President does not 
result in an appointment to the office of 
Chief Justice and in spite of such 
appointment, the office of the Chief Justice 
remains vacant.  All that happens is that 
during the continuance of that vacancy, the 
duties of that office are to be performed by 
one or the other Judges of the High Court 
as the President may appoint for the 
purpose.  The word "temporarily" used in 
<a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_69">Article 224</a> clause (2) governs the words 
"to act".  The language of clause (2) of 
<a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_70">Article 224</a>, therefore, does not mean that 
an appointment of a Judge of a High Court 
to perform the duties of the office of the 
Chief Justice under <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_71">Article 223</a>, is the 
appointment of a temporary Chief Justice.
	It is true that both in its marginal note 
and <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_72">Article 223</a> the words "appoint" or 
"appointment" has been used.  But from 
this it does not necessarily follow that the 
appointment is an appointment to the 
office of the Chief Justice.  In the marginal 
note, it is clear that the appointment is not 
of a 'Chief Justice' but of 'an acting Chief 
Justice'.  In the Article itself the word 
"appoint" relates to the appointment of 
such of the other Judges of that Court as 
the President may choose for the purpose 
of performance of the duties of the office of 
Chief Justice.  It is only when the 
appointment is not an appointment to the 
office of Chief Justice, that it could be said 
to be an appointment of one or the other 
Judges of that Court for the purpose of 
performing the duties of the office of Chief 
Justice.  We have, therefore, no hesitation 
in coming to the conclusion that an 
appointment of one or the other Judges of 
the High Court to perform the duties of the 
office of Chief Justice when that office is 
vacant, is not the appointment of a Chief 
Justice to that office.  It really results in an 
arrangement for the performance of the 
duties of the vacant office of the Chief 
Justice pending a fresh appointment to the 
office of Chief Justice."
</p><p id="p_48">A careful reading of the paragraph extracted above 
shows that an appointment of one or the other Judges of 
the High Court to perform the duties of the office of Chief 
Justice really results in an arrangement for the performance 
of the duties of the vacant office of the Chief Justice 
pending fresh appointment to the office of the Chief Justice.  
In that case the view was that even if an acting Chief 
Justice is appointed under <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_73">Article 223</a> of the Constitution for 
performance of the duties of the Chief Justice, the office of 
Chief Justice still remains vacant.  This also shows that one 
or the other Judges of the High Court can perform the 
duties of the Chief Justice.
</p><p id="p_49">	In the case on hand we have to consider whether 
acting Chief Justice could be consulted under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_74">Section 16</a> of 
the Act or the process initiated and opinion given by the 
acting Chief Justice could be valid to satisfy the requirement 
of the said Section.  
</p><p id="p_50"> 	In the very terms of <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_75">Article 223</a> of the Constitution, 
when the office of Chief Justice of a High Court is vacant or 
when any such Chief Justice is by reason of absence or 
otherwise, unable to perform the duties of the office of the 
Chief Justice, duties of the office of Chief Justice shall be 
performed by such one or the other Judges of the Court as 
the President may appoint for the purposes.  Plain reading 
of this Article shows that one or the other Judges of the 
High Court appointed in the vacancy of Chief Justice of a 
High Court for the time being can perform the duties of the 
office of Chief Justice.  No restriction or limitation in 
performance of duties by acting Chief Justice can be read 
into the said Article.  The Article also does not indicate as to 
which of the duties of the Chief Justice can be performed or 
which of the duties cannot be performed by the acting Chief 
Justice.  Appointment of one or the other Judges of a High 
Court as acting Chief Justice is meant to carry on the work 
of the High Court and the judiciary in the State.  May be 
sometimes appointment of Chief Justice to a High Court 
may take some time for various reasons and consequently 
acting Chief Justice continues to work for longer period, but 
that itself does not take away the powers conferred by the 
Constitution on a Judge to act as Chief Justice to perform 
the duties of the Chief Justice.  Normally the senior most 
puisne Judge is appointed as acting Chief Justice.  Such 
puisne Judge is expected to act appropriately in discharging 
the duties of the office of Chief Justice.  It is rule of 
prudence that the acting Chief Justice may not take major 
decisions which otherwise could have been taken by the 
Chief Justice or which decisions could wait for a Chief 
Justice.  Assuming that some decisions taken by an acting 
Chief Justice are required to be modified or corrected, that 
can be done either on administrative side or on the judicial 
side by the High Court or by this Court including the Chief 
Justice of India, as the case may be.  In some cases if 
appointment of Chief Justice of a High Court takes longer 
time and the acting Chief Justices cannot discharge the 
duties of the office of the Chief Justice the work of the High 
Court or the State judiciary or for the matter wherever the 
opinion of Chief Justice is required like the one under 
<a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_76">Section 16</a> of the Act, it will result in anomalous position 
leading to paralyzing the working or may be sometimes 
creating a deadlock.  When <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_77">Article 223</a> of the Constitution 
in specific terms confers powers on acting Chief Justice to 
discharge the functions of the office of Chief Justice without 
any limitation or rider, it cannot be accepted that an acting 
Chief Justice cannot perform the duties expected to be 
performed by him under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_78">Section 16</a> of the Act.  
Consultation with acting Chief Justice under <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_79">Section 16</a> of 
the Act is to be taken as consultation with the Chief Justice 
of a High Court.   Powers  conferred  under  <a href="/doc/1931158/" id="a_80">Article  223</a> of 
the  Constitution  on  an  acting  Chief Justice to perform 
the  duties  of  the  Chief  Justice  is  available  for  the 
purpose  of  <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_81">Section  16</a>  of the Act.  We may hasten to add 
that it is not the case of the petitioner in High Court that 
the Chief Justice of the High Court was going to be 
appointed shortly or the matter of appointment of President 
of the State Commission was such, which on the facts and 
in the circumstances of the case, did not call for an 
immediate decision by Acting Chief Justice and could have 
waited for the appointment of the Chief Justice of the High 
Court.  In other words, no statutory provision can stand in 
the way of constitutional provision in case of conflict 
between them.  
</p><p id="p_51">	Thus, having examined all aspects and in the light of 
what is stated above we are of the view that the High Court 
was right in dismissing the writ petition.  We do not find 
any good ground or valid reason to disturb the judgment 
under challenge.  Consequently the appeal is dismissed 
leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
