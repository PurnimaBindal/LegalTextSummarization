   Dated this the 26th day of February,2009

                   JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">    First defendant in O.S.2/1986 on the file

of District Court, Thiruvananthapuram is the

appellant.   On the death of the appellant

additional appellant was impleaded as his legal

heir.  Later  respondents  2  to  6  were  also

impleaded as other legal heirs of deceased

appellant.     Original   respondent   is   the

plaintiff in the suit,   an institution by name

"Santhigiri  Ashramam"  registered   under  the

Travancore  Cochin  Literary,   Scientific  and

Charitable Societies  Act.  Suit was filed for

a declaration that first respondent is the

exclusive owner of trade name "Santhigiri" and

for   a   permanent    prohibitory   injunction

restraining   defendants from using the trade

mark  'Santhigiri'   in   the   name   of   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">A.S. 3/1993                 2</span>


institutions sign boards, Bills, Vouchers, Labels

etc.      The allegations in the plaint are that late

Karunakara Guru founded Santhirigiri Ashramam 25

years      back  for  the  upliftment  and   spiritual

development of man and the Ashram is at Koliyakode

in     Thiruvananthapuram  and  it  has  branches   at

Palarivattom      (Ernakulam  District)   and   Kallar

(Idukki District) and Sultan Battery          (Wayanad

District) and     new branches  are being established.

Santhigiri Ashram was registered as an institution

under the Tranvancore-Cochin Literary, Scientific

and Charitable Societies Act      and the Ashram has

multifaced       activities    in    the    spiritual,

Educational, Medical and Women's <a href="/doc/179735/" id="a_1">Welfare Act</a>ivities

and      Koliyakode  is   the  seat   of   the   Guru.

Santhigiri     Vidhya  Bhavan  a  residential  English

Medium       School,   Santhigiri   Engineering    and

Construction     Company,  Santhigiri  Mathrumandalam,

Santhigiri Ayurveda Vaidyasala      are all being run

by Santhigiri Ashramam.     It is also alleged that an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">A.S. 3/1993               3</span>


Ayurvedic Hospital Complex at an estimated cost of

Rs.28 lakhs is nearing completion at Koliyakode

with the financial assistance of South Indian Bank

and Santhigiri Hospital cum Research Centre for

doing research in Ayurvedic, Homeo, Naturopathy and

Sidha Systems of medicine are   being started at the

Hospital Complex.     Santhigiri Vaidyasala products

carry a special label with letters "Santhigiri

Ayurveda Vaidyasala" on top and Santhigiri Ashram

with the address "Koliyakode     P.O., Venjaramoodu,

Trivandrum.    First respondent specifically pleaded

that Santhigiri is the trade mark designed and used

by the Ashram for the last more than 8 years prior

to the institution of the suit in the medical field

and it is the exclusive property and the name has

distinctive    feature of its own so that Santhigiri

has became a trade name of mark of Santhigiri

Ayurveda     Vaidyasala   products   and   services.

Defendants     have   published   an   advertisement

regarding the Santhigiri Health Complex       to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">A.S. 3/1993                 4</span>


inaugurated     by  the  Minister  at  Kalamasseri  on

2.2.1986.     It is contended that the use of the word

Santhigiri was given      with  malicious intention of

passing     off  the   institution  and  services  and

products of first respondent Ashram and it was to

deliberately mislead the public and if they are

allowed to use the trade name Santhigiri to their

institution,     it   will  pass  off  the  place   of

treatment and services of the first respondent and

therefore a decree is to be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.   Defendants in the joint written statement

contended that first respondent has no      registered

trade mark and respondent Ashram has not acquired

any trade name Santhigiri and the labels used by

first respondent for their medical products cannot

be treated as a trade mark and based on that usage

first respondent is not entitled to institute the

suit.      It was also contended that  defendants have

started Santhigiri Health Complex      at Kalamassery

and the name of the Health Complex was given after

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">A.S. 3/1993                 5</span>


its place where it is situated and the rooms of the

Health      Complex  building  are  let  out  by  the

appellant     to   persons who  come  over  there for

treatment and       second defendant is the person in

control of the medical treatment and the Health

Complex is not preparing any kind of medicine and

all the medicines used are the one prepared by the

second defendant in his P.N.V.M. Hospital and there

is no passing off the business or services of the

first respondent and therefore the suit is only to

be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.   Learned District Judge on the evidence of

Pws. 1 to 3 and Exts.A1 to A60 found that the term

Santhigiri has been used by the first respondent in

the name of Vydhyasala and also labels of its

medicines and it is the use the said trade name and

first      respondent  is therefore  entitled to  the

protection       for    the use of that trade name.

Finding that defendants started using the same

trade name for their Health Complex, it was held

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">A.S. 3/1993                 6</span>


that if the defendants are allowed to use the name

Santhigiri     for  the  Health  Complex  and   allied

business, it would amount to    passing off the name,

good will and reputation of the        respondent and

granted a decree declaring that first respondent is

the exclusive owner of the trade name Santhigiri

and      restraining    defendants  by   a  permanent

prohibitory injunction from using the trade name

or mark Santhigiri in their Signboards, Bills,

Vouchers, Labels and Designs or Symbols.          The

decree is challenged in this appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">       4.  Learned counsel appearing for the appellant

and the contesting respondents were heard.

</p><p id="p_5">       5.  Learned counsel appearing for the appellant

pointed out that the suit was instituted as if

first respondent has got a right to use the trade

name Santhigiri.     It is admitted case that no such

trade name was registered in favour of the first

respondent.      It was argued that the case of the

first      respondent   is   that   Karunakara   Guru

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">A.S. 3/1993                 7</span>


established Santhigiri Ashram and it is a society

registered under the Travancore Cochin Literary

Scientific      and  Charitable  Societies  Act   and

thereafter     a  Vydhyasala    by  name   Santhigiri

Vydhyasala which      started manufacturing ayurvedic

medicines       and   later    schools   and    other

establishments in the name Santhigiri were started

and as no such trade mark or trade name was

registered     as  provided    under  the  Trade  and

<a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_2">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,1958,       first respondent is

not entitled to seek a decree based on the trade

mark.      Learned counsel relying on the decision of

the     Apex  Court  in  <a href="/doc/44410582/" id="a_3">S.M.Dyechem Ltd  v.  Cadbury

(India) Ltd</a> (2000) 5 SCC 573), <a href="/doc/959595/" id="a_4">K.Narayanan and

another v. S. Murali</a> (2008) 10 SCC 479), and <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_5">Durga

Dutt Sharma v. N.P.Laboratories</a> (AIR 1965 SC 980)

argued that the learned District Judge did not

properly appreciate the case or decide the question

and     therefore  the  decree  is  not  sustainable.

Learned counsel also argued that      evidence of PW1

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">A.S. 3/1993                 8</span>


establish that the only similarity is usage of the

name Santhigiri by the appellant as       the name is

Santhirigi     Hospital   Complex  and   PW1   himself

admitted that that Hospital Complex is known as

P.N.V.M Santhigiri Hospital Complex      which cannot

be deceptively      similar to the name used by the

first      respondent  viz    Santhigiri  Ashram    or

Santhigiri     Ayurvedic   Medicines  or   Engineering

Schools.     It is therefore argued that the decree is

only to be set aside.     Learned counsel also pointed

out that apart from the evidence of PW1, there is

no evidence to prove that any person mistook the

Ayurvedic Hospital Complex run by the appellant as

an Institution run by the first respondent and as

appellant     is not manufacturing any medicines and

are only using the medicine prepared by P.N.V.M.

Hospital and therefore there is no passing of the

business of the first respondent and therefore

learned District Judge should not have granted the

decree.
</p>
<p id="p_6"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">A.S. 3/1993                 9</span>


</p><p id="p_7">       6.   Learned  counsel   appearing   for   first

respondent argued that      fact that Karunakara Guru

established     Santhigiri  Ashram  and     Santhigiri

Ashram is running a Santhigiri Ayurveda Vydhyasala,

Santhigiri Engineering and Construction Company,

Santhigiri     Vidhyabhavan  and  Santhigiri   Medical

Supplies     as found by the learned District Judge is

not disputed and therefore the fact that first

respondent has been using the trade name Santhigiri

previous to the use by the      appellant is admitted

and      though the trade mark or trade name is not

registered, as provided under sub section (2) of

<a href="/doc/1297323/" id="a_6">Section 27</a> of the said Act, the fact that trade

mark is unregistered does not affect the right of

action against the appellant for passing of goods,

as the goods of another person or seeking     remedies

in     respect  thereof  and  therefore  the  suit  is

maintainable.     The learned counsel also argued that

defendants did not adduce any evidence and the

evidence of first respondent establish that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">A.S. 3/1993                10</span>


word Santhigiri is being used as the trade name by

first      respondent  eight  years  prior   to   the

institution of the suit and therefore defendants

cannot use the same trade name Santhigiri which is

deceptively similar to the one which is being used

by     the  first  respondent and  therefore  learned

District Judge rightly granted the decree.    Learned

counsel relied on the decision of the Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/44410582/" id="a_7">S.M.Dyechem Ltd v. Cadbury (India) Ltd</a> (2000) 5 SCC

573, <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_8">Parle Products (P) Ltd v. J.P. &amp; Co. Mysore</a>

(AIR 1972 SC 1359) and <a href="/doc/833600/" id="a_9">Dhariwal Industries Ltd v.

M.S.S.     Food  Products</a>  (2005  (3)  SCC  63)   and

<a href="/doc/1732339/" id="a_10">N.R.Dongre and others v. Whirlpool Corporation    and

another</a> (1996) 5 SCC 714) and argued that the

decree granted is perfectly legal and correct.

</p><p id="p_8">       7. <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_11">Section 28</a> of the Trade &amp; <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_12">Merchandise Marks

Act</a>,      1958  provides  the  rights  conferred   by

registration     of  a  trade mark  and  <a href="/doc/1373361/" id="a_13">Section   29</a>

provides for       action for infringement of trade

marks.      Under sub section (1) of <a href="/doc/1295636/" id="a_14">Section 27</a>, no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">A.S. 3/1993                11</span>


person      shall  be   entitled  to  institute  any

proceeding to prevent, or to recover damages for,

the infringement of an unregistered trade mark.

But sub section (2) explicitly makes it clear that

nothing in <a href="/doc/1295636/" id="a_15">Section 27</a> shall be deemed to affect the

rights of action against any person for passing off

goods      as the  goods  of  another person or  the

remedies in respect thereof.       Therefore  reason

that a trade mark or trade name is not registered

as provided under the Act is not a bar for an

action for passing off goods as the goods of

another person.      An action for infringement of a

trade mark and an action for passing off are

different and distinct.      The right for an action

for passing off is not a statutory right but a

common law right.

action for passing off Apex Court held:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "While an action for passing

           off is a Common Law remedy

           being in substance an action

           for  deceit,   that  is,   a

           his own goods as those of

           another,  that  is  not the

           gist  of   an   action  for

           infringement.    The  action

           for   infringement   is    a

           statutory  remedy  conferred

           on the registered proprietor

           of a registered trade mark

           for the vindication of "the

           of   the   trade   mark  in

           relation  to  those  goods."

           (Vide S.21 of the Act).  The

           use by the defendant of the

           trade mark of the plaintiff

           is  not   essential  in  an

           action for passing off, but

           is the sine qua non in the

           case  of   an   action  for

           infringement.    No   doubt,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">A.S. 3/1993                16</span>


           where   the   evidence    in

           respect   of   passing   off

           consists   merely   of   the

           colourable    use    of    a

           registered trade mark, the

           essential features of both

           the actions might coincide

           in the sense that what would

           be a colourable imitation of

           a trade mark in a passing

           off  action  would  also  be

           such  in   an   action   for

           infringing of the same trade

           mark.      But   there   the

           correspondence  between  the

           two ceases.   In an action

           for     infringement     the

           plaintiff  must,  no  doubt,

           make out that the use of the

           similarity    between    the

           plaintiffs      and      the

           defendants mark is so close

           either             visually,

           phonetically  or   otherwise

           and the court reaches the

           conclusion that there is an

           imitation,    no     further

           evidence  is   required   to

           establish      that      the

           plaintiff's    rights    are

           violated.     Expressed   in

           another    way,    if    the

           essential  features  of  the

           trade mark of the plaintiff

           have  been  adopted  by the

           defendant, the fact that the

           get-up,  packing  and  other

           writing  or  marks  on  the

           clearly   a   trade   origin

           different from that of the

           registered proprietor of the

           mark  would  be  immaterial;

           whereas  in   the  case   of

           passing off, the defendant

           may escape liability if he

           can  show  that   the  added

           matter  is   sufficient   to

           distinguish his goods from

           those of the plaintiff."

</blockquote><p id="p_14">The     fact  that  neither  the  plaintiff nor  the

defendant has a registered trade mark as on the

date of the suit cannot stand in the way of

entertaining      the claim of the plaintiff in a

passing off action. (See 2005(3) SCC 63).    So also

the fact that as the trade mark was subsequently

registered in the name of the defendant will not

defeat an action for passing off     by the plaintiff.

          under  Point  5,  the  proof  of

          resemblance  or  similarity   in

          case   of   passing   off    and

          infringement are different.   In

          a passing off action, additions,

          get-up or trade-dress might be

in the light of the settled legal position.

</p><p id="p_18">       13.   What was claimed by the first respondent

in the plaint is that " Santhigiri is the trade

mark designed and used by the plaintiff for the

last more than eight years in the medical field

and it is exclusively its property.      This name has

a distinctive feature       of its own    so much   so

Santhigiri has become a trade name of mark of

Santhigiri     Ayuveda   Vydhayasala    products   and

services."      Learned District Judge relying on the

evidence of PW1 and Exts.A1 to A60 found that the

term Santhigiri is used by the first respondent in

the name of its Vydhyasala and labels of its

medicines and thus it is made the trade name and

first respondent is      entitled to protection of the

use of that trade name.
</p>
<p id="p_19"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">A.S. 3/1993                24</span>


</p><p id="p_20">       14. Though  PW1 has given evidence in support

of the claim of the first respondent, his evidence

do     not   establish  that  first  respondent  had

acquired a right in the trade name Santhigiri.

The      pleadings  and   the  evidence   show  that

Karunakara Guru founded an Ashram at Pothencode

which was later shifted to Koliyakkode       and the

name      of  the  Ashram   was  Santhigiri  Ashram.

Evidence     would  also  establish that   Santhigiri

Ashram is registered evidenced by Ext.A1, under

the Travancore Cochin      Literary, Scientific and

Charitable     Societies     Act.     Evidence  also

establish that subsequently      Ashram widened its

activities on education, medical and women welfare

activities.     It is in evidence that a residential

English Medium School Santhigiri Vidhyabhavan, an

Engineering      Construction   Company    by   name

Santhigiri Engineering     and  Construction Company

and a Hospital Complex by name Santhigiri Hospital

and Research Centre      was under the construction,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">A.S. 3/1993                 25</span>


at the time of institution of the suit which was

later      started  functioning.       Evidence  also

establish      that  Santhigiri  Ayurveda  Vydhyasala

started      manufacturing  medicines  in  the   name

Santhigiri      Vydhyala   and   thereafter   started

Santhigiri Medical Supplies       for the supply   of

medicines.      The evidence do not establish that

first      respondent  had  used  the     trade  name

"Santhigiri".      On the other hand,   evidence only

establish that along       with the name   Santhigiri

first respondent named the institution whether it

is a Vydhyasala or educational institution         or

Engineering Company.      The question is whether  by

such usage, it could be said that first respondent

had a right for the exclusive use of the word

Santhigiri and if that be so, whether the starting

of a Hospital Complex by name Santhigiri Health

Complex by the defendants would amount to passing

off the business or the service of the first

respondent.

</p><p id="p_22">       15.   As stated earlier, eventhough the proof

of     resemblance  or   similarity  in  a  case   of

infringement is not relevant, that is not the case

with an action for passing off. A suit for passing

off may fail, if there is difference in the get-up

and trade-dress,     though it may not be a defence

in an action for infringement of the trade mark.

If defendant could establish that the usage of

additional words distinguishes it from the other,

it     would be a relevant   factor in an action for

passing off,       though it is not relevant in an

action for infringement of the trade mark.     But if

the additions are sufficient enough to prevent it

from      being sold    as  the  other  it  would  be

sufficient     to non-suit the plaintiff in an action

for passing off.      Unfortunately this distinction

was not taken note of by the learned District

Judge.

<p id="p_23">       16.   Ext.A32 the  paper  publication  of  the

inauguration     of  the  Hospital  Complex  by   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">A.S. 3/1993               27</span>


appellant    in  the  name  of  Santhigiri  Hospital

Complex itself establish that anybody seeing     the

name would realise that      it is not a branch or

concern of the Santhigiri Ashram but a sister

concern     of  P.N.V.M.  Hospital.    PW1   himself

admitted that the Board of the appellant is to the

effect that it is the sister concern    of  P.N.V.M.

Hospital.     Therefore when the first respondent is

running a Hospital Complex, though in the name of

Santhigiri Hospital Complex, making it clear that

the hospital is not part of the Santhigiri Ashram

but a sister concern of P.N.V.M.        Hospital an

entirely    different  concern  of  reputation    it

cannot be said that service in the hospital of the

appellant     is being passed off    as that of the

first respondent.       This distinctive fact     is

sufficient to hold that first respondent is not

entitled to the decree granted by the learned

District    Judge.     When  the  evidence  do   not

establish that first respondent has any exclusive

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">A.S. 3/1993               28</span>


right in the name Santhigiri       learned District

Judge was not justified in granting a declaration

to that effect.       Evidence only establish that

first respondent is      having an Ashram  by name

Santhigiri and is      also running Vydhyasala  and

School all suffixing      the name with  Santhigiri

before the name of the respective institution.

But that will not give an exclusive right like a

trade      mark or  trade    name    to  the  first

respondent. Therefore the decree granted by the

learned District Judge is not sustainable.
