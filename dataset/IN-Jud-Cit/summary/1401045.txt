A cooking material made of hydrogenated vegetable oil, commonly known as ?Vanaspati?, was introduced in India.
The base of this material was groundnut oil.
The appellant company filed an application for registration of the mark ?Rasoi?
for their hydrogenated oil.
The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks rejected the application, stating that the mark was descriptive of the goods and not distinctive.
The company appealed to the court against the decision of the Deputy Registrar.
Whether the word ?Rasoi?
has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, and is therefore not eligible for registration under Section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act.
Section 6(1) of the Trade Marks Act provides that a trade mark must contain or consist of at least one of the particulars specified.
Section 6(1)(d) requires that the reference to the character or quality of the goods must be direct.
Section 6(1)(e) allows for registration of a word that refers directly to the character or quality of the goods, if its distinctiveness can be established by evidence.
The registration of a common word as a trade mark is not favored, as it may cause confusion and difficulty for other traders.
The court held that the word ?Rasoi?
has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, and is therefore not eligible for registration under Section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act.
The court also stated that even if the word ?Rasoi?
did not have a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, it would still need to be proved distinctive to be eligible for registration.
The court considered the Herschell Committee's report, which stated that the use to which a particular article is adapted and for which it is intended is a part of its character.
The court also noted that the word ?direct?
was inserted in the Trade Marks Act for the first time, and that the word ?Rasoi?
did not have a direct reference to the goods.
The court dismissed the appeal and held that the word ?Rasoi?
has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, and is not eligible for registration under Section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act.
