                     dated 28.1.2013 was registered against Darshan Singh and others. The

                     background, which led to the murder of Malo Devi, mother of the

                     petitioner and grievous injuries dangerous to life to Tara Chand-father of

                     the petitioner, is that the petitioner Ram Niwas had bought one plot.

                     Accused Darshan Singh etc. wanted to illegally possess this plot. The

                     proceedings under <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_10">Section 145</a> Cr.P.C. were carried out upon this plot, but

                     Shri Bhal Singh Bishnoi, the then SDM, Narwana, decided the matter

                     against the petitioner within six days of this proceeding to give benefit to

                     Darshan Singh etc., while he was under transfer. The petitioner filed

                     revision petition before the Additional Sessions Judge, Jind, who set aside

                     the order dated 11.4.2011 and directed the SDM, Narwana to decide the

                     case in accordance with law. It is also stated that on 28.1.2013, the

                     accused persons, namely, Darshan Singh, his son Bhupender Singh and

                     other relatives along with 10-12 unknown persons, armed with deadly

                     weapons forcibly entered into the house of the petitioner and inflicted

                     Hisar on 23.4.2013. The investigation was conducted and on completion

                     of the investigation, report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_12">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. was submitted in the

                                  Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the Police

                     wants to re-investigate the matter to declare the accused innocent, against

                     whom challan has already been presented. He further argued that the re-

                     investigation be got conducted from the C.B.I. and not from the Police.

                     well learned Additional Advocate General, Haryana appearing for

                     respondents No.2 to 6 contested the petition.

<p id="p_6">                                  From the record, I find that as per the reply of the State, they

                     have already presented the challan under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_14">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. and it is

                     stated that they have the right to make further investigation under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_15">Section

                     173(8)</a> Cr.P.C. as per law even without permission of the Court. It is

                     clearly stated in the reply that they are not going to reinvestigate the

                     matter in the present case. It is denied that the local/State Police is

                     playing in the hands of the accused persons. It is also submitted in the

                     reply that adequate security has already been provided to the petitioner

                     and his family members to protect their persons and property at state

                     expenses.    It is further stated that the Police is conducting further

                     investigation in a fair, proper, impartial and transparent manner in

                     prosecution evidence. Therefore, the question of re-investigation from

                     another agency does not arise. Otherwise also, as per law neither the

                     senior Police Officers nor the Court or even the Higher Court can order

                     the re-investigation. Only further investigation can be done under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_16">Section

                     173(8)</a> Cr.P.C. As per the reply, the Police is further investigating the

                     case. In the reply, it has been stated that the Police will make further

                     investigation only as per law and it will be proper and impartial. At this

                     stage, there is nothing to presume as to what will be the result of further

                     investigation. It is stated that the permission has already been taken from

                     the Sessions Judge for further investigation and that order is not under

                     challenge. Again, there is no averments in the present petition that in the

                     garb of the order of the learned Sessions Judge for further investigation,

                     the Police wanted to exonerate the present accused. Even if any report is

                     presented under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_17">Section 173(8)</a> Cr.P.C. by the Police after further

                     investigation, it is only for the trial Court to look into that report and to

                     see whether that investigation is further investigation or it amounts to re-

                     investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                 It is argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

                     trial is not going on. Rather, the trial Court is awaiting the report of

                     further investigation. On this argument, I find that the trial Court need not

                     to wait for the further investigation report. The trial Court can continue

                     with the proceedings. It is for the investigating agency/Police whether to

                     submit report under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_18">Section 173(8)</a> Cr.P.C. after making further

                     investigation or not. Therefore, the trial Court should continue with the
