                                                COMMON ORDER

                      V.PARTHIBAN, J.,

                            A batch of writ petitions have been filed by one group of petitioners

                      challenging the Notification issued by the Teachers Recruitment Board

                      [hereinafter referred to as &#x27;&#x27;TRB&#x27;&#x27;] dated 18.07.2018 for recruitment to the

                      post of Assistant Professors [Pre Law] in Government Law Colleges in

                      the State of Tamil Nadu for the year 2017-18. The essence of challenge

                      in the writ petitions is that among the other qualifications, prescription of

                      Masters Degree in Law of any recognized University with not less than

                      55% of marks and must have enrolled as an Advocate in the Bar Council.

                      These qualifications have been prescribed apart from the main

                      qualification, viz., Post Graduation Degree in the respective subject from

                                                                         WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      the Universities in the State of Tamil Nadu with not less than 55% of

                      marks and must have qualified in National Eligibility Test [in short

                      &#x27;NET&#x27;]. According to the candidates who have set up the challenge in

                      these writ petitions, the qualification of Masters Degree in Law and

                      enrollment as an advocate, are non-essential qualifications which have

                      absolutely no value addition to their appointment, as they are to be

                      recruited only for teaching pre-law courses in the subject concerned.

                            2      The prescription of qualifications in the subject recruitment

                      is assailed on various grounds as contended by the respective learned

                      counsels appearing for the writ petitioners. The uniform contention of all

                      the learned counsels appearing for the candidates is that no other

                      University or any Colleges, either in the State of Tamil Nadu or in the

                      entire country, prescribe these two qualifications, viz., Masters Degree in

                      Law and enrollment as an advocate, as qualifications for the purpose of

                      appointment to the post of Assistant Professors in pre-law courses. Only

                      in respect of the Government Colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu such

                      qualifications have been prescribed. According to them, qualifications as

                      prescribed above cannot stand the test of validity of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article 14</a> of the

                      Constitution of India, as the qualifications being thoroughly irrational,

                      unreasonable and arbitrary.

                            3      Mr.G.Murugendran, learned counsel appearing for some of

                      the writ petitioners would, at the outset, submit that there are two

                      Notifications which are the subject matter of challenge in the present

                      batch of writ petitions. One is the Notification issued in the year 2014

                      prescribing the same qualifications and the other is the Notification issued

                      in the year 2018 dated 18.07.2018. According to the learned counsel,

                      though the candidates he represent, did not have the qualification as

                      prescribed in the Notification, they were however, allowed to participate

                      in the selection in pursuance of the 2018 Notification, by an interim

                      order of this Court in one of the writ petitions in WP.No.19534/2018

                      dated 31.07.2018. A learned Judge of this Court directed TRB to accept

                      the application and allow the petitioner therein to participate in the

                      selection process and his participation and result, shall be subject to the

                      outcome of the writ petition. The learned Judge has given this direction

                      on a prima facie consideration of the issues raised in the writ petition and

                      the participation of such candidates are subject to the final outcome of the

                      pending writ petitions.



                            4      According to the learned counsel, the candidates who are not

                                                          27
                                                                          WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      having M.L., degree and not enrolled as advocates, were allowed to

                      participate in the selection and they were also provisionally selected upto

                      the level of interview and their final results have been withheld in view of

                      the pendency of these writ petitions. As far as the challenge to the 2014

                      Notification was concerned, a writ petition was filed by one of the

                      candidates challenging the original Government Orders passed in

                      G.O.Ms.No.1349, Education Department dated 19.11.1985 and amended

                      G.O.Ms.No.264,      Law    Department     dated   20.12.2005,        originally

                      prescribing the controversial qualification of M.L.Degree and enrollment

                      as an advocate. The learned Judge appeared to have dismissed the writ

                      petition and as against that, WA.No.533/2018 was filed. A Division

                      Bench of this Court, vide judgment dated 09.03.2018, dismissed the writ

                      appeal after extracting the observations of the learned Single Judge. The

                      learned Single Judge has held while dismissing the claim of the candidate,

                      stating that it was always open to the employer to fix higher qualification

                      than one fixed by the University Grants Commission [in short &#x27;UGC&#x27;] and

                      also that the Government Orders issued, had been in vogue several years

                      from 1985 and 2005 and the challenge after such a distance of time was

                      found to be unsustainable. The Division Bench which heard the writ

                      appeal, concurred with the legal findings of the learned Single Judge and

                      eventually dismissed the writ appeal on 09.03.2018.



                             5      According        to     the        learned        counsel,      as     against

                      WA.No.533/2018, Rev.Appln.No.195/2019 has been filed and the same

                      is also the subject matter of adjudication before this Court. Learned

                      counsel would submit that one other Division Bench has taken a similar

                      view   in    response     to    the     challenge          to    the    qualification      in

                      WA.No.2484/2018 dated 13.11.2018.                     The Division Bench, after

                      recording the reasons stated therein and also on consideration of a

                      decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India, did not agree with the

                      grounds raised in the writ appeal.                The learned counsel referred to

                      paragraph No.6 onwards of the judgment of the Division Bench which

                      are extracted hereunder:-

                                  for the appellant reiterated the grounds stated
                                  supra, we are not inclined to entertain the appeal
                                  for the following reasons,

                          Court, held that prescription of educational / other
                          qualifications is purely the prerogative of the
                          Government and that it is not open to the petitioner
                          or any other applicant to suggest what should be
                          the educational or other qualifications required for

                            6     The learned counsel would proceed to refer certain salient

                      facts and circumstances as to why the prescription of qualification of

                      M.L., Degree and enrollment as advocate, cannot be countenanced both

                      in law and on facts.    The learned counsel would premise his entire

                      arguments on the reason that for Assistant Professor to the post of pre-

                      law courses in the Law Colleges, requirement of M.L., Degree or

                      enrollment as an advocate cannot be insisted upon, as the Assistant

                      Professors are not required to take any courses relating to core law

                      subjects. After the introduction of the integrated Five Year Law Course,

                      several non law subjects have been introduced in the curriculum like

                      Economics, Sociology, Philosophy, Commerce, Science, Business

                      Management etc. In order to take classes of these non law subjects,

                      Assistant Professors are being recruited with Post Graduate Degree in the

                      relevant subject with 55% marks and also the clearance of NET. When a

                      candidate satisfies this criterion in the subject concerned, insisting of

                      M.L.Degree in law and enrollment as an advocate as a condition

                      precedent for being considered for appointment is ex-facie irrational and

                      acquisition of such degrees have no value addition at all in the actual

                      discharge of duties by these Assistant Professors.



                            7      The learned counsel would draw the attention of this Court

                      to the syllabus framed by the Department of Legal Studies in respect of

                      Five Year B.A.,L.L.B., course.      The learned counsel referred to the

                      syllabus taught in Economics as one of the candidates he represented,

                      had applied for the post of Assistant Professor [Economics]. He has

                      drawn the attention of this Court to various subjects listed under the

                      caption &#x27;&#x27;General Principles of Economics&#x27;&#x27;, in the First year pre-law

                      course. The various subjects listed under the broad caption Economics

                      relate to and connected with the various branches of Economics. When a

                      candidate is being recruited to take classes for Economics or Sociology,

                      as the case may be, the necessity of mandatory Masters Degree in Law or

                      enrollment, is bereft of any nexus with the job of Assistant Professor in

                      Economics or Sociology. According to him, M.L., degree or enrollment

                      as an advocate, is not a higher qualification, but it is a qualification

                      unconnected with the main qualification.

                            8      According to the learned counsel, the Division Bench

                      decisions dismissing the challenge earlier, the prescription was construed

                      as a higher qualification and therefore, the Bench held that it was always

                      open to the State or the University to prescribe higher qualification than

                      what prescribed by the Central Regulating Body, viz., UGC. However,

                      the Division Benches have lost sight of the fact that Masters Degree in

                      Law was not a higher qualification, but a qualification unconnected with

                      the Post Graduate qualification in the relevant subject which alone is

                      essential for effective discharge of duties as Assistant Professor teaching

                      pre-law courses.



                            9      The learned counsel has also drawn the attention of this

                      Court to various documents stating that how the candidates he

                      represented had been successful in the selection, but finally their results

                      had been withheld in view of the pendency of these writ petitions. He

                      relied on the following decisions, in support of his contentions.

                            [a]    2015 [8] SCC 129 [<a href="/doc/697794/" id="a_20">P.Suseela and others V. University

                      Grants Commission and Others</a>]. The above said decision has been

                      relied by the learned counsel in order to lay emphasis that prescription of

                      NET/SLET/SET as minimum eligibility condition for appointment as

                      Assistant Professor was held to be valid and effective from 30.06.2010

                      and no exemption is permissible.

                            [b]    On the same line, another decision was relied upon reported

                      in 2018 [3] SCC 329 [State of Madhya Pradesh and Others Vs. Manoj

                      Sharma and Others].       The above two decisions may not be strictly

                      relevant for consideration of this Court as the principal dispute to be

                      considered herein is whether the prescription of M.L.Degree and

                      enrollment as an advocate as the qualifications is valid or not in the facts

                      and circumstances of the case.

                            [c]    The learned counsel also relied upon the decision reported in

                      2014 [3] SCC 767 [Ganapath Singh Gangaram Singh Rajput Vs.

                      Gulbarga University represented by its Registrar and Others] and

                      2003 [3] SCC 548 [Yogesh Kumar and Others Vs. Government of

                      NCT, Delhi and Others]. The former decision is regarding the definition

                      of relevant subject for the post of Lecturer. In the said decision, the Apex

                      Court has held that a cross degree is not eligible and can be considered

                      as relevant subject. This Court feels that this decision does not advance

                      the case of the candidates for whom the learned counsel seek to represent

                      and that may become relevant when this Court considers whether cross

                      degree is permissible or not. As far as the latter decision is concerned, it

                      may be relevant to the extent that the present qualifications have been in

                      vogue in the Recruitment Rules for more than three decades, would not

                      mean that such invalid statutory requirements would continue when it is

                      put to challenge.

                            [d]    The last decision relied on by the learned counsel is the

                      decision reported in 2007 [2] SCC 202 [<a href="/doc/109500/" id="a_21">Bar Council of India V. Board

                      of Management, Dayanand College of Law and Others</a>]. This is the

                      decision where the Apex Court has held that the Bar Council of India

                      [hereinafter referred to as &#x27;BCI&#x27;] has an effective say in prescription of

                      norms for the legal education.            In fact, the Apex Court has

                      discountenanced the argument that BCI had no role in prescription of

                      qualifications for legal education.       The relevant paragraphs of the

                      judgment would be referred to infra at the appropriate place in the present

                      judgment.



                            10     The learned counsel therefore summed up that BCI has, in

                      fact, not prescribed M.L., qualification and enrollment as advocate as part

                      of the eligibility criteria for appointment of Assistant Professor in pre-law

                      courses.    As stated above, all Colleges in the entire country and

                      Universities which impart legal education, have not chosen to prescribe

                      the qualifications as prescribed by the Directorate of Legal Studies for the

                      Government Law Colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu.                In the said

                      circumstances, the learned counsel prayed before this Court to allow the

                      writ petitions by declaring the disputed qualifications as null and void as

                      being patently unreasonable, illegal, irrational and arbitrary.




                            11     Mr.G.Thyagarajan, learned counsel appearing for few of the

                      writ petitioners with the similar challenge, at the outset, would submit

                      that all the candidates he represent, have obtained both Under Graduate

                      and Post Graduate Degrees in the same subject and have also successfully

                      completed NET in the same subjects. Therefore, all the writ petitioners

                      whom he represent, are fully eligible to be appointed as Assistant

                      Professors in pre-law courses in the respective subjects. According to

                      him, at the time when the Five Year Integrated Law Courses were

                      introduced, there was only one subject and thereafter, over years, several

                      subjects have been introduced. In fact, he has referred to Part-I of the

                      Bar Council of India Rules [in short &#x27;BCI Rules&#x27;] which refer to number of

                      pre-law subjects which are being made as part of the curriculum in pre-

                               12     The learned counsel also referred to the Regulations of

                      Dr.Ambedkar Law University wherein Regulation 21 states that number

                      of teaching staff shall be appointed as per the norms prescribed by the

                      University/UGC/BCI. The Regulation also further states that no teacher

                      shall be appointed if he has not completely fulfilled the qualifications as

                      laid down by the UGC and the University. The teaching staff shall also

                      be paid as per the pay scale prescribed by UGC. According to the learned

                      counsel, neither UGC nor the University nor BCI prescribed the

                      qualifications which are presently under challenge. He also submitted

                      that as per the Regulations, Assistant Professors [Pre Law] cannot

                               13     Mr.Balan Haridas, learned counsel appearing for the

                      applicant/petitioner in Rev.Appln.No.195/2019 submitted that the

                      judgment rendered by the Division Bench, did not have an opportunity to

                      consider the various important issues that are being raised before this

                      Court.        The larger issues which are raised herein question the

                      constitutionality of the so-called higher qualifications prescribed by the

                      State Government. Although it is a fact that G.O.Ms.No.1349, Education

                      Department, dated 19.11.1985 followed by G.O.Ms.No.264, Law

                      Department, dated 20.12.2005, had been issued many years ago and have

                      been holding the field very unfortunately, but in the face of the present

                      challenge as to its&#x27; legality, delay cannot be put against the petitioners.

                      When the issue of constitutional validity of a particular rule is the subject

                      matter of challenge, the question of delay would not arise at all.

                            14     The learned counsel further submitted that the Division

                      Benches simply dismissed the writ appeals by extracting the observations

                      of the learned Single Judges, stating that nothing wrong in fixing a higher

                      qualification and also the Government Orders were issued long time ago

                      and hence, no interference was called for. When a specific question has

                      been put to the learned counsels by this Court, whether the arguments

                      before this Court had been canvassed for consideration before those two

                      learned Benches, the response of the learned counsels was simply &#x27;&#x27;No&#x27;&#x27;.

                      Therefore, it is not fair on the part of the learned counsels to find fault

                      with the decisions of the Division Benches, in the face of the admission

                      that no arguments were advanced in regard to the constitutionality of the

                      prescription of the controversial qualification.

                            15     Be that as it may, as the issues presently raised, assume

                      larger legal significance concerning the qualification of the legal education

                      in the State of Tamil Nadu, this Court is inclined to critically and

                      incisively examine the relevant statutory provisions/Regulations, the

                      legislative competence of the State in terms of Schedule-VII of the

                      Constitution of India and the decisions of the Apex Court and the High

                      Courts on the subject matter.

                            16     Coming back to the arguments advanced by Mr.Balan

                      Haridas, learned counsel, he has emphasized the fact that thorough

                      arguments have not been advanced before the Division Benches which

                      referred in earlier decisions. However, the observations of the Division

                      Bench that there is nothing wrong in prescription of higher qualification

                      by the Government or the University, may not be correct, as the higher

                      qualification would be a higher proficiency in the subject concerned and

                      not in a completely different subject like Masters Degree in Law.

                      Therefore, the decisions of the Division Benches are misplaced on a

                      wrong and faulty premise, resulting in filing of the Review Petition

                      No.195/2019. One more factor which assumes legal significance in that

                      writ petition in WP.No.33145/2017 which is the subject matter of
http://www.judis.nic.in

                      Rev.Petn.No.195/2019, is that the Rules have been challenged and in all

                      other writ petitions, the challenge is only the Notifications by the

                      Recruiting Agency. In fact, there are objections as to the maintainability

                      of the writ petitions challenging the Notification of the Recruiting Agency

                      in respect of the qualification on the ground that the Notification is only a

                      consequence of the Recruitment Rules and in such an event, the writ

                      petitions cannot be held maintainable. In the face of such legal objections

                      to the maintainability of the writ petitions challenging only the

                      Notifications, the adjudication of the Review Petition          No.195/2019

                      becomes a legal necessity.



                            17     Mr.R.Singaravelan, learned Senior counsel appearing for

                      some of the candidates who satisfied all the qualifications prescribed in

                      the said Notification, i.e., Masters Degree in Law as well as enrollment

                      as a lawyer, would submit that admittedly, the Rule is being followed

                      ever so many Notifications since 1985. Several appointments have been

                      made on the basis of the said qualifications and there is no justification

                      for this Court to revisit the qualification as prescribed, which admittedly

                      stood the test of time.

                            18        According to the learned Senior counsel, the disputed

                      qualifications have been prescribed by the Government only after taking

                      into consideration, the unique nature of syllabi that are being taught in

                      the Government Law Colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu. From the first

                      semester onwards, a mixture of subjects is being taught and every

                      Assistant Professor be it in the subject of Economics, Sociology etc., is

                      also expected to have knowledge in law, apart from the relevant subject

                      justifying his appointment as a full-time faculty. The learned Senior

                      Counsel referred to Rules of Legal Education as provided under Part-IV

                      of BCI Rules. He referred to Rule 2[a] and [b] which are extracted

                      The qualification thus prescribed by the two Government Orders

                      aforementioned and also in the Recruitment Notifications, are in

                      consonance with the requirement laid down by the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_24">Advocates Act</a>, 1961,

                      read with BCI Legal Education Rules. According to him, if only the

                      Assistant Professor has both Post Graduation in the relevant subject plus

                      Masters Degree in Law, he would be in a position to fulfill the norms of

                      UGC requirements of taking minimum 16 hours classes in a week. BCI

                      Resolutions as extracted above, insisted on full time members of the

                      faculty for the maintenance of good standards of legal education.



                            19     The learned Senior counsel drew the attention of this Court

                      to the syllabus prescribed by the Department of Legal Studies for the Five

                      Year Law Degree courses and the subjects that are taught during the first

                      two years, comprising four semesters. According to him, from the very

                      first year and from the first semester, apart form the pre-law subjects like

                      political science, economics, sociology etc., law subjects were also taught.

                      For instance, Law of Torts in the first semester, Law of Crimes in the

                      second semester and as the students progress to the 3rd and 4th semesters,

                      more number of law subjects relating to Contracts, Family Law, Clinical

                      Course etc., are made part of the curriculum. In the said factual scenario,

                      a person with a mere possession of Post Graduation Degree in the

                      particular subject would not be able to fulfill the norms prescribed by

                      UGC in taking classes of minimum 16 hours a week. In this connection,

                      the   learned    Senior    counsel    referred   to    the     relevant     UGC

                      Norms/Regulations and as per Appendix – III Table – 1, the direct

                      teaching hours week is mentioned as 16 hours for Assistant Professor and

                      14 hours for Associate Professor and 14 hours for Professor. In order to

                      fulfill these norms, with a single Post Graduation degree in relevant

                      subject, no Assistant Professor can satisfy the norms and in which case

                      that there cannot be any full time faculty at all. In the absence of full time

                      faculty, the legal education will surely witness fall in standards.



                            20     The Government of Tamil Nadu has taken all aspects into

                      consideration, while devising the mixed curriculum right from the first

                      semester onwards and also the fact that unlike the other Law Colleges or

                      the Universities, the Government Colleges does not offer many arts/

                      science subjects providing scope for adequate hours of work for the pre-

                      law Lecturers. According to him, the Government Law Colleges cannot

                      be compared to the National Law School or Ambedkar Law University as

                      they stand on a different footing.        The learned Senior counsel further

                      elaborated on the aspect of the subjects being taught in Ambedkar Law

                      University and also in the Government Law Colleges and reiterated that

                      the law subjects are integrated along with the other subjects as a

                      comprehensive course content and only the teachers who are holders of

                      both Post Graduation Degree in the relevant subject and Masters Degree

                      in Law would be in a position to handle the classes.

                              21   The learned Senior counsel while making the above

                      submissions, has made a frontal attack on the conduct of the candidates

                      who challenge the Notification. According to him, those candidates have

                      no locus standi to challenge, as they have participated in the selection

                      after fully knowing the qualification prescribed in the Notification.

                      Having participated in the selection, it is not open to the candidates to

                      challenge the very prescription of the qualifications and only on the basis

                      of the interim orders granted by this Court, they were permitted to

                      participate in the selection process.



                              22   The learned Senior counsel has referred to G.O.Ms.No.1349

                      dated    19.11.1985    and    also      the   other   Government       Order     in

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 20.12.2005. Both the Government Orders have

                      statutory force being issued under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_25">Article 309</a> of the Constitution and

                      were issued in pursuance of the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_26">Advocates Act</a>, 1961 and the Rules of

                      Legal Education.    Moreover the prescription of qualifications is the

                      exclusive domain of the employer and precisely that is what the Division

                      Benches have held while discountenancing the challenge made to the

                      Notification in the earlier round of litigation by the then unqualified

                      candidates. He has also referred to paragraphs Nos.6 to 9 of the Division

                      Bench judgment made in WA.NO.2484/2018 dated 13.11.2018, which

                      have already been extracted supra.



                            23    The learned Senior counsel in fact relied on the other

                      Division Bench decision made in WA.No.533/2018 dated 09.03.2018,

                      drawing support from the findings of that decision where the challenge

                      was discountenanced. As stated above, Rev.Petn.No.195/2019 is a part

                      of this Court consideration which arose out of the above said Division

                      Bench judgment dated 09.03.2018.          He also relied on a Full Bench

                      decision of this Court dated 23.07.2018 made in WP.No.44242/2016

                          the Bar Council of India, in its wisdom, framed the

                          rigid inter alia in respect of attendance in
                          classrooms. Combinations of subjects are
                          also inflexible.
                          41. Was the alternative system envisaged
                          under the Open University Act in
                          substitution of the formal system, is the
                          question. In our opinion, in the matter of
                          ensuring the standard of education, it is
                          not. The distinction between a formal system
                          and informal system is in the mode and
                          manner in which education is imparted. The
                          UGC Act was enacted for effectuating
                          coordination       and    determination     of
                          standards in universities. The purport and
                          object for which it was enacted must be
                          given full effect.
                          42. The provisions of the UGC Act are
                          binding on all universities whether
                          conventional or open. Its powers are very
                          broad. The Regulations framed by it in
                          terms of clauses (e), (f), (g) and (h) of sub-
                          section (1) of <a href="/doc/1275598/" id="a_28">Section 26</a> are of wide
                          amplitude. They apply equally to open
                          universities as also to formal conventional
                          universities. In the matter of higher
                          education, it is necessary to maintain
                          minimum standards of instructions. Such
                          minimum standards of instructions are
                          required to be defined by UGC. The

                             facilities in universities must be maintained
                             and for that purpose required to be
                             regulated. The powers of UGC under

                      The above decisions have been cited by the learned Senior counsel in

                      relation to the allied issues raised in these batch of writ petitions stating

                      that whether for appointment of a teaching faculty, Post Graduate degree

                      obtained through Open University or Distance Education Programme is

                      valid or not? According to the learned Senior counsel, the decision of the

                      Full Bench of this Court has concluded this issue once and for all that

                      once a recognized Board issues a Certificate, the validity of the same

                      cannot be questioned.       The Apex Court has also held that after

                      Annamalai University&#x27;s case, the degree awarded by the Open

                      University is in conformity with UGC Regulation and is equivalent to the

                      standards of legal education issued by the BCI.         He has specifically

                      referred to Schedules relating to the academic standards and the courses

                      to be studied including the subjects in liberal discipline in integrated

                      stream. He emphasized the fact that the programme is niche education

                      programme of fact and law, one complementing and supplementing the

                      other. The integrated programme is the study of two degree programmes

                      in tandem like arts and law, science and law, commerce and law, etc. In

                      view of such curriculum design, the M.L., degree is a must for any faculty

                      to fit into the system. However, this Court has been informed that the

                      latest Legal Education Rules, 2019 has not yet been notified. In any

                      event, the learned Senior counsel would submit that it may have a

                      persuasive value in order ot understand as to how the future legal

                      education would be conducted. The learned Senior Counsel relied on

                                matters. In dealing with the case presented before it
                                by the respondent, the High Court has criticised the
                                report made by the Board and has observed that
                                the circumstances disclosed by the report made it
                                difficult for the High Court to treat the
                                recommendations made by the expert with the
                                respect that they generally deserve. We are unable
                                to see the point of criticism of the High Court in
                                such academic matters. Boards of Appointments are
                                nominated by the Universities and when
                                recommendations made by them and the
                                appointments following on them, are challenged
                                before courts, normally the courts should be slow to
                                interfere with the opinions expressed by the
                                experts. There is no allegation about mala fides
                                against the experts who constituted the present
                                Board; and so, we think, it would normally be wise
                                and safe for the courts to leave the decisions of
                                academic matters to experts who are more familiar
                                with the problems they face than the courts
                                generally can be.&#x27;&#x27;

                                in this case indicates very clearly that he has
                                considered the recommendation of the Selection

                          (a) A doctorate in the subject of study concerned or
                          a published work of a high standard in that subject;
                          and
                          (b) Consistently good academic record (that is to
                          say, the overall record of all assessment throughout
                          the academic career of a candidate), with first class
                          or high second class that is to say, with an
                          aggregate of more than 54 per cent marks Master&#x27;s
                          Degree in the subject concerned or equivalent
                          degree of a foreign University in such subject.
                          (2) Where the Selection Committee is of the opinion
                          that the research work of a candidate, as evidenced
                          either by his thesis or by his published work, is of a
                          very high standard, it may relax any of the
                          qualifications specified in sub-clause (b) of clause
                          (1).”

                                 31. The minimum qualification prescribed for
                          the post is a doctorate in the subject of study
                          concerned or a published work of high standard in
                          the subject. The appellant then was found to have
                          an alternate qualification though not a doctorate in
                          the subject. The Selection Committee has accepted
                          the alternate qualification as sufficient and did not
                          relax the essential qualification prescribed for the
                          post. The Executive Council appears to have
                          committed an error in stating that the appellant has
                          lacked the essential qualification and the Selection
                          Committee has relaxed the essential qualification.
                          The Chancellor was, therefore, justified in rejecting
                          the opinion of the Executive Council.

                                32. It is not unimportant to point out that in
                          matters of appointment in the academic field the
                          court generally does not interfere. <a href="/doc/295084/" id="a_35">In the University

                               courts should be slow to interfere with the opinion
                               expressed by the experts in the absence of mala fide
                               alleged against the experts. When appointments are
                               based on recommendations of experts nominated by
                               the Universities, the High Court has got only to see
                               whether the appointment had contravened any
                               statutory or binding rule or ordinance. The High
                               Court should show due regard to the opinion
                               expressed by the experts constituting the Selection

                                      &#x27;&#x27;21. The High Court has lost sight of the fact
                               that education is a dynamic system and
                               courses/subjects have to keep changing with regard
                               to market demand, employability potential,
                               availability of infrastructure, etc. No institute can
                               have a legitimate right or expectation to run a
                               particular course forever and it is the pervasive
                               power and authority vested in the Government to
                               frame policy and guidelines for progressive and

                               technical education from time to time. Inasmuch as
                               the institutions found fit were allowed to run other
                               courses except the three mentioned above, the

                               disregarded by the State. Inasmuch as ultimately it

                                        &#x27;&#x27;67. It was argued by the learned counsel for
                                  the appellant that there could not have been a
                                  comparison between the provisions of the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_39">Payment

                                  deciding the constitutionality. For this purpose, the
                                  learned counsel relied on the law laid down by this
                                  Court in <a href="/doc/649393/" id="a_40">State of M.P. v. G.C. Mandawar</a> [AIR 1954

                                  of the provisions of the two enactments. The sources

                                68. It may immediately be clarified that
                          though it is true that both the laws i.e. the Shops
                          Act and the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_43">Payment of Gratuity Act</a> have been
                          passed validly under Entry 24 of List III of the
                          VIIth Schedule, it is incorrect to say that the High
                          Court has compared the two provisions. It is one
                          thing to refer to a provision and quite another to
                          compare it with the impugned provision.
                                 69. The High Court has actually gone into
                          the concept of gratuity right from its inception and
                          has come to the conclusion that for earning the
                          gratuity, the employee does not have to contribute
                          anything, as in the case of a provident fund.
                          Gratuity is more or less a gratuitous payment by
                          the employer in consideration of long and faithful
                          service by the employee. The concept of gratuity
                          came to be developed firstly in the industrial
                          jurisprudence and was crystallised by the Central
                          legislation by way of an Act, where a provision of
                          five years of minimum service was made for an
                          employee to be entitled for payment of gratuity.
                          However, as has been held in <a href="/doc/169015579/" id="a_44">Bakshish
                          Singh v. Darshan Engg. Works</a> [(1994) 1 SCC 9 :
                          1994 SCC (L&amp;S) 302 : (1994) 26 ATC 483] the
                          length of five years of service could not have been
                          reduced in an absurd manner to a minuscule
                          period of one year or even less than that. The High
                          Court, therefore, found fault that the basic concept
                          of gratuity was being abused by the reduction of
                          the required service to an almost non-existent level.
                          It cannot, therefore, be said that the High Court
                          compared the two provisions. This is apart from the
                          fact that the reduction to a period of six months was
                          already held to be unconstitutional in Suryapet

                                      70. The High Court found that instead of

                               one year. We are, therefore, unable to accept the
                               submission of the learned counsel for the appellant

                                     &#x27;&#x27;16. Similar is the case on facts here. A
                              vested right would arise only if any of the
                              appellants before us had actually been appointed
                              to the post of Lecturer/Assistant Professors. Till
                              that date, there is no vested right in any of the
                              appellants. At the highest, the appellants could only
                              contend that they have a right to be considered for
                              the post of Lecturer/Assistant Professor. This right
                              is always subject to minimum eligibility conditions,
                              and till such time as the appellants are appointed,
                              different conditions may be laid down at different
                              times. Merely because an additional eligibility
                              condition in the form of a NET test is laid down, it
                              does not mean that any vested right of the
                              appellants is affected, nor does it mean that the
                              regulation laying down such minimum eligibility
                              condition would be retrospective in operation. Such
                              condition would only be prospective as it would
                              apply only at the stage of appointment. It is clear,
                              therefore, that the contentions of the private
                              appellants before us must fail.

                                    “23. Reasonableness of restriction is
                             to be determined in an objective manner
                             and from the standpoint of interests of the
                             general public and not from the standpoint
                             of the interests of persons upon whom the
                             restrictions have been imposed or upon
                             abstract consideration. A restriction cannot
                             be said to be unreasonable merely because
                             in a given case, it operates harshly. In
                             determining whether there is any unfairness
                             involved; the nature of the right alleged to
                             have been infringed, the underlying
                             purpose of the restriction imposed, the
                             extent and urgency of the evil sought to be
                             remedied thereby, the disproportion of the
                             imposition, the prevailing condition at the
                             relevant time, enter into judicial verdict.
                             The reasonableness of the legitimate
                             expectation has to be determined with
                             respect to the circumstances relating to the
                             trade or business in question. Canalisation
                             of a particular business in favour of even a
                             specified individual is reasonable where the
                             interests of the country are concerned or
                             where the business affects the economy of

                                 “33. It is well settled that the concept of
                             legitimate expectation has no role to play
                             where the State action is as a public policy
                             or in the public interest unless the action
                             taken amounts to an abuse of power. The
                             court must not usurp the discretion of the
                             public authority which is empowered to take
                             the decisions under law and the court is
                             expected to apply an objective standard
                             which leaves to the deciding authority the
                             full range of choice which the legislature is
                             presumed to have intended. Even in a case
                             where the decision is left entirely to the
                             discretion of the deciding authority without
                             any such legal bounds and if the decision is
                             taken fairly and objectively, the court will
                             not interfere on the ground of procedural
                             fairness to a person whose interest based on
                             legitimate expectation might be affected.
                             Therefore, a legitimate expectation can at
                             the most be one of the grounds which may
                             give rise to judicial review but the granting
                             of    relief    is    very    much     limited.

                          was found that such exemption had a rational

                              even after the 2009 Regulations, a legitimate
                              expectation must always yield to the larger public
                              interest. The larger public interest in the present
                              case is nothing less than having highly qualified

                              Even if, therefore, the private appellants before us
                              had a legitimate expectation that given the fact that
                              UGC granted them an exemption from NET and

                              as made in the minimum qualification, now
                              provides that the exemption from NET shall be
                              given to the PhD degree-holders, only when PhD
                              degree has been awarded to them in compliance

                              thus, made it mandatory that for Lecturers NET
                              qualification is necessary and exemption shall be
                              granted to those PhD degree-holders who have
                              obtained PhD degree in accordance with the 2009

                          PhD degree-holders who had obtained PhD prior
                          to 11-7-2009. The writ petitions were filed in
                          different High Courts challenging the Regulations
                          on different grounds including that the Regulations
                          are arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_67">Article 14</a> which

                          there is a valid classification between the
                          candidates who have obtained degree prior to the
                          2009 Regulations of UGC (Minimum Standards

                          private respondent, the following was laid down in
                          paras 16, 17 and 18: (P. Suseela case [P.
                          Suseela v. UGC, (2015) 8 SCC 129 : (2015) 2 SCC

                                     “16. Similar is the case on facts here.
                              A vested right would arise only if any of the
                              appellants before us had actually been
                              appointed to the post of Lecturer/Assistant
                              Professors. Till that date, there is no vested
                              right in any of the appellants. At the
                              highest, the appellants could only contend
                              that they have a right to be considered for
                              the post of Lecturer/Assistant Professor.
                              This right is always subject to minimum

                          eligibility conditions, and till such time as
                          the appellants are appointed, different
                          conditions may be laid down at different
                          times. Merely because an additional
                          eligibility condition in the form of a NET
                          test is laid down, it does not mean that any
                          vested right of the appellants is affected,
                          nor does it mean that the regulation laying
                          down such minimum eligibility condition
                          would be retrospective in operation. Such
                          condition would only be prospective as it
                          would apply only at the stage of
                          appointment. It is clear, therefore, that the
                          contentions of the private appellants before
                          us must fail.
                          17. One of the learned counsel for the
                          petitioners argued, based on the language
                          of the direction of the Central Government
                          dated 12-11-2008 that all that the
                          Government wanted UGC to do was to
                          “generally”      prescribe    NET     as    a
                          qualification. But this did not mean that
                          UGC had to prescribe this qualification
                          without providing for any exemption. We
                          are unable to accede to this argument for
                          the simple reason that the word “generally”
                          precedes the word “compulsory” and it is
                          clear that the language of the direction has
                          been followed both in letter and in spirit by
                          the UGC Regulations of 2009 and 2010.
                          18. The arguments based on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_75">Article 14</a>
                          equally have to be rejected. It is clear that
                          the object of the directions of the Central
                          Government read with the UGC Regulations
                          of 2009/2010 are to maintain excellence in
                          standards of higher education. Keeping this
                          object in mind, a minimum eligibility
                          condition of passing the national eligibility

                                  test is laid down. True, there may have been
                                  exemptions laid down by UGC in the past,
                                  but the Central Government now as a matter
                                  of policy feels that any exemption would
                                  compromise the excellence of teaching
                                  standards                                  in
                                  universities/colleges/institutions governed
                                  by the UGC. Obviously, there is nothing
                                  arbitrary or discriminatory in this — in fact
                                  it is a core function of UGC to see that such
                                  standards do not get diluted.”
                                     19. Thus, from the above judgment, it is clear
                              that NET qualification is now minimum
                              qualification for appointment of Lecturer and
                              exemption granted to MPhil degree-holders has
                              been withdrawn and exemption is allowed only to
                              those PhD degree-holders who have obtained the
                              PhD degree in accordance with 11-7-2009
                              Regulations, namely, the 2009 Regulations of UGC
                              (Minimum Standards and Procedure). Although,
                              this aspect has not been noticed by the High Court
                              but since the learned Single Judge has directed the
                              consideration of the case of the writ petitioner on
                              the basis of MPhil degree which was obtained by
                              them by distance education mode prior to 2009, it
                              is necessary that their eligibility for the post be
                              examined taking into consideration the 2009
                              Regulations of UGC (Minimum Qualifications for

                          skill, mind and character of students by formal
                          schooling. The excellence of instruction provided
                          by an educational institution mainly depends
                          directly on the excellence of the teaching staff.
                          Therefore, unless they themselves possess a good
                          academic        record/minimum           qualifications
                          prescribed as an eligibility, it is beyond
                          imagination of anyone that standard of education
                          can be maintained/enhanced.
                          “18. … we have to be very strict in maintaining
                          high academic standards and maintaining
                          academic discipline and academic rigour if our
                          country is to progress.
                          30. … Democracy depends for its very life on a
                          high standard of general, vocational and
                          professional education. Dissemination of learning
                          with search for new knowledge with discipline all

                          p. 46, para 6)

                                 “6. … It is a constitutional mandate that the
                          State shall ensure proper education to the students
                          on whom the future of the society depends. In line
                          with this principle, the State has enacted statutes
                          and      framed    rules     and     regulations      to
                          control/regulate establishment and running of
                          private schools at different levels. The State
                          Government provides grant-in-aid to private
                          schools with a view to ensure smooth running of the
                          institution and to ensure that the standard of
                          teaching does not suffer on account of paucity of
                          funds. It needs no emphasis that appointment of
                          qualified and efficient teachers is a sine qua non
                          for maintaining high standards of teaching in any
                          educational institution.”
                                 33. In view of the above, it is evident that
                          education is necessary to develop the personality of
                          a person as a whole and in totality as it provides
                          the process of training and acquiring the
                          knowledge, skills, developing mind and character
                          by formal schooling. Therefore, it is necessary to
                          maintain a high academic standard and academic
                          discipline along with academic rigour for the
                          progress of a nation. Democracy depends for its
                          own survival on a high standard of vocational and
                          professional education. Paucity of funds cannot be

                          education to its future citizens. It is for this reason
                          that in order to maintain the standard of education

                          children to get proper and good quality education.
                          However, the quality of education would depend on
                          various factors but the most relevant of them is
                          excellence of teaching staff. In view thereof, quality
                          of teaching staff cannot be compromised. The
                          selection of the most suitable persons is essential in
                          order to maintain excellence and the standard of
                          teaching in the institution. It is not permissible for
                          the State that while controlling the education it may
                          impinge the standard of education. It is, in fact, for
                          this reason that norms of admission in institutions
                          have to be adhered to strictly. Admissions in mid-
                          academic sessions are not permitted to maintain
                          the excellence of education.

                                 56. It is a settled legal proposition that
                          <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_81">Article 14</a> is not meant to perpetuate illegality and
                          it does not envisage negative equality. Thus, even if
                          some other similarly situated persons have been
                          granted some benefit inadvertently or by mistake,
                          such order does not confer any legal right on the
                          petitioner to get the same relief. (Vide Chandigarh

                          becomes the solemn duty of the court to rectify the

                               authorities of the State which grant recognition to a
                               Committee of Management for opening or running
                               an educational institution. Affiliation is granted by
                               the particular university or Board for undertaking
                               the examination of the students of that college for
                               awarding degrees and certificates. Therefore, while
                               granting the recognition and affiliation even for
                               non-governmental and non-aided private colleges,
                               it is mandatory to adhere to the conditions imposed
                               by them, which also include the minimum eligibility
                               for appointment of teaching staff. The authority at
                               the time of granting approval has to apply its mind
                               to find out whether a person possessing the
                               minimum eligibility has been appointed. In the
                               instant case, it appears to be a clear-cut case of
                               arbitrariness which cannot be approved.&#x27;&#x27;

                               &#x27;&#x27;11. Rule 17(1) stipulates that no college after the
                               coming into force of the Rules shall impart
                               instruction in a course of study in law for enrolment
                               as an advocate unless its affiliation has been
                               approved by the Bar Council of India. Thus, though
                               the Bar Council of India may not have been
                               entrusted with direct control of legal education in

                               adequate power to control the course of studies in
                               law, the power of inspection, the power of

                                 13. The aim of most of the students who enter
                          the law college, is to get enrolled as advocates and
                          practise law in the country. To do that, they
                          necessarily have to have a degree from a university
                          that is recognised by the Bar Council of India.
                          Therefore, the court, in a situation like the present
                          one, has to ask itself whether it could not
                          harmoniously construe the relevant provisions and
                          reach a conclusion consistent with the main aim of
                          seeking or imparting legal education. So
                          approached, nothing stands in the way of the court
                          coming to the conclusion that though under the
                          relevant statute of the University as amended,
                          theoretically it may be possible to appoint a Doctor
                          of Philosophy or a Doctor of Science as the
                          Principal of a law college, taking into account the
                          requirements of the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_90">Advocates Act</a>, the Rules of the
                          Bar Council of India and the main purpose of legal
                          education, the court would be justified in holding
                          that as regards the post of the Principal of a law
                          college, it would be necessary for the proposed
                          incumbent also to satisfy the requirements of the
                          Rules of the Bar Council of India. Such a
                          harmonious understanding of the position
                          recognising the realities of the situation, would
                          justify the conclusion that a doctorate-holder in any
                          of the law subjects could alone be appointed as the
                          Principal of a law college. The High Court, in our
                          view, made an error in not trying to reconcile the
                          relevant provisions and in not making an attempt to
                          harmoniously construe the relevant provisions so
                          as to give efficacy to all of them. A harmonious
                          understanding could lead to the position that the
                          Principal of a law college has to be appointed after
                          a process of selection by the body constituted in
                          that behalf, under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_91">University Act</a>, but while
                          nominating from the list prepared, and while
                          appointing him, it must be borne in mind that he

                          should fulfil the requirements of the Rules of the
                          Bar Council of India framed under the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_92">Advocates
                          Act</a> and it be ensured that he holds doctorate in any
                          one of the branches of law taught in the law
                          college. We do not see anything in the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_93">University
                          Act</a> or the Statutes framed thereunder, which stand
                          in the way of the adopting of such a course.
                          Therefore, when a request is made for selection of a
                          Principal of a law college, the university and the
                          Selection Committee has to ensure that applications
                          are invited from those who are qualified to be
                          Principals of a law college in terms of the Rules of
                          the Bar Council and from the list prepared, a
                          person possessing the requisite qualification, is
                          nominated and appointed as the Principal of a law
                          college.
                                 14. It is clear from the decision of the
                          Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1413227/" id="a_94">O.N. Mohindroo v. Bar
                          Council of Delhi</a> [(1968) 2 SCR 709 : AIR 1968 SC
                          888] that in pith and substance, the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_95">Advocates Act</a>
                          falls under Entries 77 and 78 of List I of the
                          Seventh Schedule. That apart, it is not necessary to
                          postulate a conflict of legislation in this case as we
                          have indicated earlier. It is true that under the
                          <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_96">University Act</a>, the selection of a Principal of a
                          college affiliated to the university concerned has
                          been left to the Higher Education Services
                          Commission and Respondent 5 was included in the
                          panel of selected candidates pursuant to a due
                          selection by that Commission. It is also true that
                          theoretically the State Government on the
                          recommendation of the Director of Higher
                          Education could appoint any one from that list as
                          Principal of any college including a law college.
                          But when concerned with the appointment of a
                          Principal of the law college, there cannot be any
                          difficulty either for the recommending authority or
                          for the State Government in recognising the fact

                          that a person duly qualified in law is required to be
                          the Principal of that law college in the interests of
                          the students coming out of that college in the light
                          of the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_97">Advocates Act</a>, 1961 and the Rules framed by
                          the Bar Council of India governing enrollment of
                          advocates and their practice. It must be the
                          endeavour of the State and the recommending
                          authority to ensure that the students coming out of
                          the college are not put to any difficulty and to
                          ensure that their career as professionals is in no
                          way jeopardised by the action of the Government in
                          appointing a Principal of a law college. Therefore,
                          even while adhering to its process of selection of a
                          Principal, it behoves the State to ensure that the
                          appointment it makes is also consistent with the
                          <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_98">Advocates Act</a> and the Rules framed by the Bar
                          Council of India. It may not be correct to say that
                          the Bar Council of India is totally unconcerned with
                          the legal education, though primarily legal
                          education may also be within the province of the
                          universities. But, as the apex professional body, the
                          Bar Council of India is concerned with the
                          standards of the legal profession and the
                          equipment of those who seek entry into that
                          profession. The Bar Council of India is also thus
                          concerned with the legal education in the country.
                          Therefore, instead of taking a pedantic view of the
                          situation, the State Government and the
                          recommending authority are expected to ensure
                          that the requirement set down by the Bar Council of
                          India is also complied with. We are of the view that
                          the High Court was not correct in its approach in
                          postulating a conflict between the two laws and in
                          resolving it based on <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_99">Article 254(2)</a> of the
                          Constitution. Of course, the question whether the
                          assent to the Act would also extend to the statute
                          framed under it and that too to an amendment
                          made subsequent to the assent are questions that

                             26     There were objections by the candidates who are challenging

                      the Notification contending that some of the candidates who have been

                      selected, are found to be qualified having M.L., degree in Law, but in

                      fact, they had obtained their Post Graduation degree in the relevant

                      subject through Distance Education mode. The issue whether the Post

                      Graduate Degree obtained through Distance Education is valid enough to

                      be appointed as a teaching faculty in the pre-law course or another

                      connected issue as to whether a cross degree obtained by the candidate is

                      valid for appointment as an Assistant Professor in the pre-law course or

                      not, is also to be taken up for consideration by this Court. This Court

                      during the course of hearing of these writ petitions, was informed that

                      subjects other than the subject of their Post Graduate degree and

                      appointment only on the basis of the Post Graduate qualification. These

                      two facets of the dispute would also be dealt with appropriately, after

                      approach. According to him, there is a fine mixture of law and arts and

                      vehemently submitted that the writ petitions need to be dismissed on the

                      short ground that the qualifications prescribed in the Notification alone is

                      under challenge and not the Rules. The learned counsel referred to the

                      said Notification, impugned herein, dated 18.07.2018 and drew the

                      attention of this Court to &#x27;Note&#x27; below the qualification prescribed for

                      Assistant Professor pre-law course.        According to the &#x27;Note&#x27;, the

                      candidates who have obtained their Post Graduate degree in law through

                      Correspondence course, are not eligible to apply. All the candidates, he

                      represent, therefore are qualified in regular stream [M.L.] and not

                            28     According to the learned counsel, the Rules framed towards

                      prescription of qualification are framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_100">Article 309</a> of the

                      Constitution of India and the same have not been declared as illegal and

                      the selection which had already been concluded cannot be reopened at the

                      instance of the unqualified candidates. According to him, there are two

                      legal impediments for this Court to consider the case of challenge being

                      made to the qualifications, viz., one, the Rules are not challenged and

                      two, the selection was already over. He referred to the counter affidavit

                      on behalf of the State Government as well as the Director of Legal Studies

                      filed in WP.No.18328/2019 and particularly referred to paragraph No.12

                      which reads thus:-

                                 that a Post Graduate Degree obtained after

                            29     According to him, the respondents on a mistaken impression

                      that the petitioner therein had obtained Post Graduate degree in

                      Economics directly through Distance Education mode without obtaining

                      the basic three year degree have come up with the above statement. This

                      statement in the counter affidavit is incorrect. The petitioner therein had

                      studied regular under graduate course and then had obtained Post

                      Graduate degree by Distance Education mode. In the said circumstances,

                      reference to Section 25 of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants

                      [Conditions of Service] Act, 2016, is misplaced and misconceived. That

                      section deals with cases where a degree being obtained from the Distance

                                                                          WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      Education Mode or from the Open University without completion of

                      10+2+3 in the regular stream.       Therefore, the very rejection of that

                      petitioner&#x27;s candidature is on an erroneous ground and liable to be

                      interfered with by this Court.



                            30     He also referred to the educational qualification in

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 20.12.2005. What is prescribed therein is M.A.

                      degree in the subject.      In tune with the statutory requirement, the

                      Notification also prescribed only M.A., degree in the particular subject.

                      Therefore, what is to be seen is whether the candidate concerned has

                      obtained his M.A., degree after going through the regular Under Graduate

                      course or not and what subject he has studied in the Under Graduate

                      course. In any event, the statement in the counter affidavit for rejecting

                      the candidature of the writ petitioner therein, cannot be countenanced

                      both in law and on facts and therefore, the decision taken in that matter is

                      liable to be interfered with.



                            31     According to the learned counsel, the dispute started

                      pursuant to the order passed by the learned Judge of this Court in

                      WMP.Nos.22979         &amp;    22980/2018    in   WP.No.19534/2018            dated
http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                          85
                                                                          WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      24.04.2019. It was an interim order, wherein the learned Judge has made

                      the following observations:-

                                &#x27;&#x27;4.So also the candidates, who studied in the
                                correspondence courses and not attended the
                                regular colleges are not eligible for appointment to
                                the http://www.judis.nic.in 11 teaching faculty.
                                Teaching is a noble profession wherein the skill of
                                teaching is of paramount importance. The person
                                who has not studied in the regular course in the
                                college in the pattern prescribed by the UGC is
                                undoubtedly, not eligible for appointment to the
                                post of Assistant Professor (pre-law).

                                       5.This apart, the Teachers Eligibility Test
                                and National Eligibility Test must have been
                                completed in the relevant subject for which the
                                appointments are to be made. The candidates who
                                have completed the TET and NET in the concerned
                                subjects alone to be appointed to the post of
                                Assistant Professor (pre-law) in Government Law
                                colleges and Law University. It is needless to state
                                that these are all the minimum educational
                                qualification prescribed by the University Grants
                                Commission in its regulations. It is a surprise that
                                the officials competent, who all are well versed with
                                the regulations of UGC as well as the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_102">State Act</a> are
                                recruiting candidates, who all are not qualified in
                                accordance with the UGC regulations and as per
                                the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_103">State Act</a>.&#x27;&#x27;


                      Problem started therein which probably impelled the official respondents

                      from rejecting the candidature of the petitioner therein.

                            32      In support of his various contentions, Mr.G.Sankaran,

                      learned counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions with

                      relevant paragraphs:-

                            [a]     1990 [1] SCC 411 [<a href="/doc/1730767/" id="a_104">P.Mahendran and Others V. State of

                      Karnataka and Others</a>] :-

                                          &#x27;&#x27;4. There is no dispute that under the
                                  Recruitment Rules as well as under the
                                  advertisement dated October 6, 1983 issued by the
                                  Public Service Commission, holders of Diploma in
                                  Mechanical Engineering were eligible for
                                  appointment to the post of Motor Vehicle Inspectors
                                  alongwith holders of Diploma in Automobile
                                  Engineering. On receipt of the applications from
                                  the candidates the Commission commenced the
                                  process of selection as it scrutinised the
                                  applications and issued letters for interview to the
                                  respective candidates. In fact the Commission
                                  commenced the interviews on August 1984 and it
                                  had almost completed the process of selection but
                                  the selection could not be completed on account of
                                  interim orders issued by the High Court at the
                                  instance of candidates seeking reservation for local
                                  candidates. The Commission completed the
                                  interviews of all the candidates and it finalised the
                                  list of selected candidates by June 2, 1987 and the
                                  result was published in the State Gazette on July
                                  23, 1987. In addition to that the selected
                                  candidates were intimated by the Commission by
                                  separate letters. In view of these facts the sole
                                  question for consideration is as to whether the
                                  amendment made in the Rules on May 14, 1987
                                  rendered the selection illegal. Admittedly the
                                  amending Rules do not contain any provision
http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                           87
                                                                   WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch


                          enforcing the amended Rules with retrospective
                          effect. In the absence of any express provision
                          contained in the amending Rules it must be held to
                          be prospective in nature. The Rules which are
                          prospective in nature cannot take away or impair
                          the right of candidates holding Diploma in
                          Mechanical Engineering as on the date of making
                          appointment as well as on the date of scrutiny by
                          the Commission they were qualified for selection
                          and appointment. In fact the entire selection in the
                          normal course would have been finalised much
                          before the amendment of Rules, but for the interim
                          orders of the High Court. If there had been no
                          interim orders, the selected candidates would have
                          been appointed much before the amendment of
                          Rules. Since the process of selection had
                          commenced and it could not be completed on
                          account of the interim orders of the High Court, the
                          appellants&#x27; right to selection and appointment
                          could not be defeated by subsequent amendment of
                          Rules.

                                 5. It is well settled rule of construction that
                          every statute or statutory rule is prospective unless
                          it is expressly or by necessary implication made to
                          have retrospective effect. Unless there are words in
                          the statute or in the Rules showing the intention to
                          affect existing rights the rule must be held to be
                          prospective. If a rule is expressed in language
                          which is fairly capable of either interpretation it
                          ought to be construed as prospective only. In the
                          absence of any express provision or necessary
                          intendment the rule cannot be given retrospective
                          effect except in matter of procedure. The amending
                          Rules of 1987 do not contain any express provision
                          giving the amendment retrospective effect nor there
                          is anything therein showing the necessary
                          intendment for enforcing the rule with retrospective

                          effect. Since the amending Rules were not
                          retrospective, it could not adversely affect the right
                          of those candidates who were qualified for
                          selection and appointment on the date they applied
                          for the post, moreover as the process of selection
                          had already commenced when the amending Rules
                          came into force, the amended Rules could not affect
                          the existing rights of those candidates who were
                          being considered for selection as they possessed

                          amending Rules should be made in a reasonable
                          manner to avoid unnecessary hardship to those

                                 11. We would now consider the view taken by
                          this Court in <a href="/doc/1984913/" id="a_105">I.J. Divakar v. Government of Andhra

                          , as the Tribunal has placed strong reliance on the
                          observations made in that decision in setting aside
                          the selection made by the Public Service
                          Commission. It is necessary to ascertain the facts
                          involved in Divakar case [(1982) 3 SCC 341 : 1983
                          SCC (L&amp;S) 14] . The Andhra Pradesh Public
                          Service Commission invited applications for filling
                          posts of Junior Engineers. In response to the
                          advertisement several candidates applied for the
                          said post and appeared at the viva voce test. While
                          the Commission was in process of finalising the
                          select list, the Government of Andhra Pradesh
                          issued a government order under the proviso to

                          service on August 9, 1979 without subjecting them
                          to any test written or oral. The candidates who had
                          applied in response to the advertisement issued by
                          the Commission challenged validity of the
                          government order excluding the post of Junior
                          Engineers from the purview of the Commission and
                          also the validity of the decision by the government
                          to regularise the services of temporary employees.
                          Before this Court the government&#x27;s power of
                          framing regulations excluding any post from the
                          purview of the Commission under the proviso to
                          <a href="/doc/1634786/" id="a_107">Article 320(3)</a> was conceded. It was, however,
                          urged that since the advertisement had been issued
                          by the Commission inviting applications for the
                          posts of Junior Engineers and as the Commission
                          was in process of selecting candidates the power
                          under the proviso to clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_108">Article 320</a> of the
                          Constitution could not be exercised. This Court
                          rejected the contention with the following
                          observations: (SCC p. 344, para 4)
                          “The only contention urged was that at the time
                          when the advertisement was issued the post of
                          Junior Engineer was within the purview of the
                          Commission and even if at a later date the post was
                          withdrawn from the purview of the Commission it
                          could not have any retrospective effect. There is no
                          merit in this contention and we are broadly in
                          agreement with the view of the Tribunal that
                          inviting the applications for a post does not by
                          itself create any right to the post in the candidate
                          who in response to the advertisement makes an
                          application. He only offers himself to be considered
                          for the post. His application only makes him
                          eligible for being considered for the post. It does
                          not create any right in the candidate to the post.”
                          After making the aforesaid observations the court

http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                   90
                                                                   WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch


                          further held that the relevant service Rules
                          conferred power on the government to fill
                          emergently the vacancies to the post borne in the
                          cadre of service otherwise than in accordance with
                          the rules and therefore the government had power
                          to regularise temporary appointments made without
                          the consultation of the Public Service Commission.
                          Even after upholding the government order, the
                          court directed the Commission to consider the case
                          of all those candidates who had applied for the
                          post of Junior Engineers in response to the
                          advertisement issued by the Commission and to
                          finalise the select list on the basis of viva voce test
                          and to forward the same to the government. The
                          court further directed the government to make
                          appointments from the select list before any
                          outsider was appointed to the post of Junior
                          Engineers. Thus, the observations made by this
                          Court as quoted earlier were made in the special
                          facts and circumstances of the case, which do not
                          apply to the facts of the instant case. In Divakar
                          case [(1982) 3 SCC 341 : 1983 SCC (L&amp;S) 14]
                          since the jurisdiction of the Public Service
                          Commission had been denuded by the government
                          in exercise of its constitutional power the
                          Commission had no jurisdiction to conduct
                          selection or prepare select list. In this background
                          the court made observations that a candidate
                          merely by making applications does not acquire
                          any right to the post. It is true that a candidate
                          does not get any right to the post by merely making
                          an application for the same, but a right is created
                          in his favour for being considered for the post in
                          accordance with the terms and conditions of the
                          advertisement and the existing recruitment rules. If
                          a candidate applies for a post in response to
                          advertisement issued by Public Service Commission
                          in accordance with recruitment Rules he acquires

                                  right to be considered for selection in accordance
                                  with the then existing Rules. This right cannot be
                                  affected by amendment of any rule unless the
                                  amending rule is retrospective in nature. In the
                                  instant case the Commission had acted in
                                  accordance with the then existing rules and there is
                                  no dispute that the appellants were eligible for
                                  appointment, their selection was not in violation of
                                  the recruitment Rules. The Tribunal in our opinion
                                  was in error in setting aside the select list prepared
                                  by the Commission.&#x27;&#x27;


                      The above decision of the Apex Court laid down the principle that any

                      amendment to the Rule, will have prospective application and cannot be

                      retrospectively applied. According to the learned counsel, even if the

                      qualifications prescribed in the present selection were to be interfered

                      with, the selection which had already been concluded on the basis of the

                      existing qualifications, is not liable to be interfered with.

                            [b]     2009 [4] SCC 555 [Mohd. Sohrab Khan Vs. Aligarh

                      Muslim University and Others].              Learned counsel has drawn the

                      attention of this Court to paragraphs No.24, 25, 27 to 29 and 33 which

                      are extracted hereunder:-

                                        &#x27;&#x27;24. According to us, the Selection
                                  Committee as also the University changed the rule
                                  in the midstream which was not permissible. The
                                  University can always have a person as a Lecturer
                                  in a particular discipline that it desires to have, but

                                                                  WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch


                          the same must be specifically stated in the
                          advertisement itself, so that there is no confusion
                          and all persons who could be intending candidates,
                          should know as to what is the subject which the
                          person is required to teach and what essential
                          qualification the person must possess to be suitable
                          for making application for filling up the said post.
                          25. We are not disputing the fact that in the matter
                          of selection of candidates, opinion of the Selection
                          Committee should be final, but at the same time, the
                          Selection Committee cannot act arbitrarily and
                          cannot change the criteria/qualification in the
                          selection process during its midstream. Merajuddin
                          Ahmad did not possess a degree in Pure Chemistry
                          and therefore, it was rightly held by the High Court
                          that he did not possess the minimum qualification
                          required for filling up the post of Lecturer in
                          Chemistry, for Pure Chemistry and Industrial
                          Chemistry are two different subjects.
                          ..
                          27. The Selection Committee during the stage of
                          selection, which is midway could not have changed
                          the essential qualification laid down in the
                          advertisement and at that stage held that a
                          Master&#x27;s degree-holder in Industrial Chemistry
                          would be better suited for manning the said post
                          without there being any specific advertisement in
                          that regard. The very fact that the University is now
                          manning the said post by having a person from the
                          discipline of Pure Chemistry also leads to the
                          conclusion that the said post at that stage when it
                          was advertised was meant to be filled up by a
                          person belonging to Pure Chemistry stream.

                             it was the unamended rule which was
                             applicable. Once a process of selection
                             starts, the prescribed selection criteria
                             cannot be changed. The logic behind the
                             same is based on fair play. A person who
                             did not apply because a certain criterion
                             e.g. minimum percentage of marks can make
                             a legitimate grievance, in case the same is
                             lowered, that he could have applied
                             because he possessed the said percentage.
                             Rules     regarding      qualification    for
                             appointment if amended during continuance
                             of the process of selection do not affect the
                             same. That is because every statute or
                             statutory rule is prospective unless it is
                             expressly or by necessary implication made
                             to have retrospective effect. Unless there
                             are words in the statute or in the rules
                             showing the intention to affect existing
                             rights the rule must be held to be
                             prospective. If the rule is expressed in a
                             language which is fairly capable of either
                             interpretation it ought to be considered as

                                         &#x27;&#x27;14. The respondents (colleges and the
                                  students) submitted that in that particular year
                                  (2007-2008) nearly 5000 engineering seats
                                  remained unfilled. They contended that whenever a
                                  large number of seats remained unfilled, on
                                  account of non-availability of adequate candidates,

                                  by AICTE alone would apply. This contention is

                          position, emerging from these decisions:
                                 (i) While prescribing the eligibility criteria
                          for admission to institutions of higher education,
                          the State/University cannot adversely affect the
                          standards laid down by the central body/AICTE. The
                          term “adversely affect the standards” refers to
                          lowering of the norms laid down by the central
                          body/AICTE. Prescribing higher standards for
                          admission by laying down qualifications in
                          addition to or higher than those prescribed
                          by AICTE, consistent with the object of promoting
                          higher standards and excellence in higher
                          education, will not be considered as adversely
                          affecting the standards laid down by the central
                          body/AICTE.
                                 (ii) The observation in para 41(vi)
                          of Adhiyaman [(1995) 4 SCC 104] to the effect that
                          where seats remain unfilled, the State authorities
                          cannot deny admission to any student satisfying the
                          minimum standards laid down by AICTE, even
                          though he is not qualified according to its
                          standards, is not good law.

                          17. No student or college, in the teeth of the
                          existing and prevalent rules of the State and the
                          University can say that such rules should be
                          ignored, whenever there are unfilled vacancies in
                          colleges. In fact the State/University, may, in spite
                          of vacancies, continue with the higher eligibility
                          criteria to maintain better standards of higher
                          education in the State or in the colleges affiliated to
                          the University. Determination of such standards,
                          being part of the academic policy of the University,
                          are beyond the purview of judicial review, unless it
                          is established that such standards are arbitrary or
                          “adversely affect” the standards, if any, fixed by
                          the central body under a Central enactment. The
                          order of the Division Bench is therefore

                      In the above case, the Apex Court has held that even in the case of

                      unfilled vacancies, after conclusion of the selection, there cannot be any

                      relaxation in the qualification in order to fill up the vacancies. The State

                      10, which are extracted hereunder:-

                                        &#x27;&#x27;9. The     essential    qualifications     for
                                  appointment to a post are for the employer to
                                  decide. The employer may prescribe additional or
                                  desirable qualifications, including any grant of
                                  preference. It is the employer who is best suited to
                                  decide the requirements a candidate must possess
                                  according to the needs of the employer and the
                                  nature of work. The court cannot lay down the
                                  conditions of eligibility, much less can it delve into
                                  the issue with regard to desirable qualifications
                                  being on a par with the essential eligibility by an
                                  interpretive re-writing of the advertisement.
                                  Questions of equivalence will also fall outside the
                                  domain of judicial review. If the language of the
                                  advertisement and the rules are clear, the court
                                  cannot sit in judgment over the same. If there is an
                                  ambiguity in the advertisement or it is contrary to
                                  any rules or law the matter has to go back to the

                                 proceed in accordance with law. In no case can the
                                 court, in the garb of judicial review, sit in the chair
                                 of the appointing authority to decide what is best
                                 for the employer and interpret the conditions of the
                                 advertisement contrary to the plain language of the
                                 same.
                                        10. The fact that an expert committee may
                                 have been constituted and which examined the
                                 documents before calling the candidates for
                                 interview cannot operate as an estoppel against the
                                 clear terms of the advertisement to render an
                                 ineligible candidate eligible for appointment.&#x27;&#x27;


                      The above decision relates to the settled legal principle that essential

                      qualification for appointment to a post is for the employer to decide and it

                      is always open to the employer to prescribe additional or desirable

                      qualification.

                          and excellence in higher education, will not

                          remain unfilled, the State authorities cannot
                          deny admission to any student satisfying the
                          minimum standards laid down by AICTE,
                          even though he is not qualified according to
                          its standards, is not good law.
                          (iii) The fact that there are unfilled seats in
                          a particular year, does not mean that in that
                          year, the eligibility criteria fixed by the
                          State/University would cease to apply or
                          that the minimum eligibility criteria
                          suggested by AICTE alone would apply.
                          Unless and until the State or the University
                          chooses to modify the eligibility criteria
                          fixed by them, they will continue to apply in
                          spite of the fact that there are vacancies or
                          unfilled seats in any year. The main object
                          of prescribing eligibility criteria is not to
                          ensure that all seats in colleges are filled,
                          but to ensure that excellence in standards of
                          higher education is maintained.
                          (iv) The State/University (as also AICTE)
                          should periodically (at such intervals as
                          they deem fit) review the prescription of
                          eligibility criteria for admissions, keeping
                          in balance, the need to maintain excellence

                                 54. Quite unfortunately AICTE has filed a
                          counter-affidavit before this Court supporting the
                          case of the first respondent College and branding

                          the University as unwarranted. Such a stand on the
                          part of AICTE has compelled us to take note of
                          certain developments that have taken place after
                          2012 on AICTE front.
                          ..

                                 57. Though AICTE has reserved to itself the
                          power to conduct inspections and take penal action
                          against colleges for false declarations, such penal
                          action does not mean anything and does not serve
                          any purpose for the students who get admitted to
                          colleges which have necessary infrastructure only
                          on paper and not on site. The Regulations of
                          the AICTE are silent as to how the students will get
                          compensated, when penal action is taken against
                          colleges which host false information online in their
                          applications to AICTE. Ultimately, it is the
                          universities which are obliged to issue degrees and
                          whose reputation is inextricably intertwined with
                          the fate and performance of the students, that may

                                (“NIRF”), for ranking institutions including
                                universities in India. The ranking is based on
                                certain parameters such as:
                                (i) Teaching, learning and resources;
                                (ii) Research and professional practice;

                                (v) Peer perception.
                                   No State run university can afford to have a
                                laid-back attitude today, when their own
                                performance is being measured by international
                                standards. Therefore, the power of the universities
                                to prescribe enhanced norms and standards,
                                cannot be doubted.

                                universities cannot dilute the standards prescribed
                                by AICTE, they certainly have the power to stipulate

                      In the detailed judgment, the Apex Court has ultimately held inter-alia

                      that the University or the State can certainly have the power to stipulate

                      enhanced norms and standards. The qualifications as prescribed by UGC

                      or any other Regulating Body has to be followed as the minimum

                      standards, but prescription of an additional higher qualification is always

                      rest with the employer concerned which is ultimately held to be valid by

                      the Apex Court.



                            34     Drawing cumulative support from the above decisions, the

                      learned counsel submitted that unless the qualifications are unreasonable

                      and arbitrary having no nexus to the object which are sought to be

                      achieved, the same is not liable to be interfered with by this Court. He

                      also submitted that in a policy matter where a conscious decision has

                      been taken by the Government to prescribe the qualifications, after taking

                      into consideration, the nature of subjects being taught in the pre-law

                      courses and also the job assignment and the teaching scope as provided

                      and such policy decision is not open for interference of this Court.



                            35     Mr.S.Prabakaran, learned Senior counsel chipped in with his

                      arguments saying that the qualifications as prescribed for the Government

                      Law Colleges is a time tested qualification since 1985 and 2005 and

                      therefore, the same does not call for any interference. The learned Senior

                      counsel also referred to the syllabus as prescribed by the State

                      Government. According to him, the syllabus as prescribed, required the

                      prescribed qualifications and he also emphasized that the qualifications

                      cannot be changed after the selection was over.             As far as the

                      correspondence course degree is concerned, the learned Senior counsel

                      referred to the Notification and the Note appended therein stating that

                      correspondence degree in Law was not acceptable. The learned Senior

                      counsel, in substance supported the case of Mr.G.Sankaran and

                      Mr.R.Singaravelan, learned counsels.



                            36        Mr.S.R.Ragunathan, learned counsel appearing for the BCI,

                      at the outset, submitted that the stand of BCI is very clear, viz., for

                      teachers post in pre-law courses, no law qualification is required at all.

                      According to the learned counsel, all over the country, no such

                      qualification       has     been      prescribed    by        any        other

                      States/Universities/Colleges.      The qualifications of M.L.Degree and

                      enrollment as advocate, are prescribed peculiarly only in the State of

                      Tamil Nadu, that too, only for the Government run Law Colleges. Even

                      the State Ambedkar Law Univeristy and other Colleges affiliated to the

                      University, do not prescribe such qualifications for appointment of

                      teachers to take pre-law courses.



                            37     The learned counsel also concurred with the submission that

                      as far as teachers in the pre-law courses, they are required to take

                      minimum 16 hours a week in terms of the UGC Regulations. At the same

                      time, it is not desirable to have part-time faculty for taking pre-law

                      courses as the same would dilute the standards of legal education. In

                      facts, BCI insisted that there should be full time faculty in order maintain

                      the standards of legal education in the country. He also relied on Rule 17

                      of the Rules of Legal Education which insisted on full time faculty

                      members in each Centre of Legal Education to teach each subject for all

                      points of time for running the courses.       He would submit that the

                      contention on behalf of Mr.R.Singaravelan, learned Senior counsel on the

                      aspect of lack of adequate hours of work for full time pre-law lecturers in

                      all Centres, if they were to be engaged, he would submit that such issues

                      are entirely within the internal management of the University or the State.

                      It is incumbent upon the State Government or the Univeristy to device

                      programmes for full time employment of pre-law course Assistant

                      Professor. Any other arrangement like employment of part time faculty

                      would certainly dilute the standards of legal education and that is

                      impermissible in terms of the Rules framed by the BCI and the UGC

                      regulations.

                                38     The learned counsel, more importantly would submit that the

                      source of laying down the controversial policy decisions, viz.,

                      G.O.Ms.No.1349           dated   19.11.1985     and    G.O.Ms.No.264          dated

                      20.12.2005, are per se unconstitutional and to be declared as void ab

                      initio.        In this regard, he would submit that the prescription of

                      qualification by the State suffers from lack of legislative competence. In

                      order to bolster his argument as above, the learned counsel would draw

                      attention of this Court to Seventh Schedule in the Constitution of India.

                      He would draw reference to Entry 25 in Concurrence List – III, which

                      reads as under:-

                                           &#x27;&#x27;25:-    Education,    including    technical

                      He also referred to Entry 66 of the Union List – I in the same Schedule,

                      which reads thus:-

                                                                          WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      As per this Entry, <a href="/doc/1675749/" id="a_123">Section 7</a> [1][h] was incorporated in the Advocates&#x27;

                      Act, 1961. According to the said provision, the power is given to the BCI

                      to promote legal education and lay down standard for legal education in

                      consultation with the Universities in India imparting such education and

                      the State Bar Councils. In terms of the above provision, the Bar Council

                      alone is entitled to prescribe qualification in the field of legal education,

                      not even the UGC.



                            39     The learned counsel would thereafter refer to the Rules of

                      Legal Education given in Part IV of the BCI Rules. He would assert that

                      the BCI has not prescribed the qualification of M.L., or enrollment as

                      advocate for teaching faculty of pre-law courses. In the absence of any

                      such prescription by the competent Body, viz., the BCI, which has the

                      exclusive domain over such matters, the State Government laying down

                      unconnected qualifications, is unwarranted and also contrary to the Legal

                      Education Rules and to the legal principles laid down by the Apex Court

                      holding that BCI has the predominant say in the prescription of standards

                      of legal education, including qualifications.



                            40     In regard to the submission of legislative competence, the

                      learned counsel would elaborate that though the education is a subject

                      included in the Concurrent List, a specific entry is made [Entry 66] in the

                      Union List under Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. The

                      same alone will prevail in terms of the scheme of the Constitution, by

                      applying Doctrine of Pith and Substance. The prescription of different

                      qualifications is therefore are contrary to the qualifications laid down by

                      the BCI. Any action taken not in terms of Entry 66, tracing the power to

                      <a href="/doc/1675749/" id="a_124">Section 7</a>[1][h] of the Advocates&#x27; Act, 1961, has to be necessarily

                      declared as unconstitutional, illegal as they repugnant to the Central

                      legislation.



                             41      Regarding the principal role of the BCI in the matters of

                      laying down the norms and qualifications for the legal education in the

                      country, the learned counsel would refer to a decision reported in 2007

                      [2] SCC 202 [<a href="/doc/109500/" id="a_125">Bar Council of India V. Board of Management,

                          and 78 of List I of the Seventh Schedule. That
                          apart, it is not necessary to postulate a conflict of
                          legislation in this case as we have indicated earlier.
                          It is true that under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_128">University Act</a>, the selection
                          of a Principal of a College affiliated to the
                          concerned University has been left to a Higher
                          Education Services Commission and respondent
                          No. 5 was included in the panel of selected
                          candidates pursuant to a due selection by that
                          Commission. It is also true that theoretically the
                          State Government on the recommendation of the
                          Director of Higher Education could appoint any
                          one from that list as Principal of any College
                          including a Law College. But when concerned with
                          the appointment of a Principal of the Law College,
                          there cannot be any difficulty either in the
                          Recommending Authority or in the State
                          Government recognizing the fact that a person duly
                          qualified in law is required to be the Principal of
                          that Law College in the interests of the students
                          coming out of that College in the light of the
                          <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_129">Advocates Act</a>, 1961 and the rules framed by the
                          Bar Council of India governing enrolment of
                          Advocates and their practice. It must be the
                          endeavour of the State and the Recommending
                          Authority to ensure that the students coming out of
                          the College are not put to any difficulty and to
                          ensure that their career as professionals is in no
                          way jeopardized by the action of the Government in
                          appointing a Principal to a Law College. Therefore,
                          even while adhering to its process of selection of a
                          Principal, it behoves the State to ensure that the
                          appointment it makes is also consistent with the
                          <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_130">Advocates Act</a> and the rules framed by the Bar
                          Council of India. It may not be correct to say that
                          the Bar Council of India is totally unconcerned with
                          the legal education, though primarily legal
                          education may also be within the province of

                                Universities. But, as the apex professional body,
                                the Bar Council of India is concerned with the
                                standards of the legal profession and the
                                equipment of those who seek entry into that
                                profession. The Bar Council of India is also thus
                                concerned with the legal education in the country.
                                Therefore, instead of taking a pedantic view of the
                                situation, the State Government and the
                                Recommending Authority are expected to ensure
                                that the requirement set down by the Bar Council of
                                India is also complied with. We are of the view that
                                the High Court was not correct in its approach in
                                postulating a conflict between the two laws and in
                                resolving it based on <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_131">Article 254(2)</a> of the
                                Constitution. Of course, the question whether the
                                assent to the Act would also extend to the statute
                                framed under it and that too to an amendment
                                made subsequent to the assent are questions that
                                do not call for an answer in this case in the light of
                                the view we have adopted.&#x27;&#x27;


                      In the above ruling, the Apex Court has categorically held that the State

                      Government and the Recommending Authority are expected to ensure

                      that the requirements set down by the BCI is also complied with. The

                      Apex Court has also observed that as the apex Professional Body, BCI is

                      concerned with the standards of the legal education and the equipment of

                      those who seek entry into that profession. While making such succinct

                      observations, the Apex Court has also referred to the Advocates&#x27; Act,

                      1961 being an enactment that fell out of Entries 77 and 78 of List I of the

                      qualifications under the pretext of introducing higher qualification, cannot

                      be countenanced both in law and on facts.

                      placed reliance on the following decisions:-

                                  doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve
                                  any question of bona fides or mala fides on the part
                                  of the legislature. The whole doctrine resolves itself
                                  into the question of competency of a particular
                                  legislature to enact a particular law. If the
                                  legislature is competent to pass a particular law,
                                  the motives which impelled it to act are really
                                  irrelevant. On the other hand, if the legislature
                                  lacks competency, the question of motive does not

                          arise at all. Whether a statute is constitutional or
                          not is thus always a question of power
                          [ Vide Cooley&#x27;s Constitutional Limitations, Vol 1 p
                          379] . A distinction, however, exists between a
                          legislature which is legally omnipotent like the
                          British Parliament and the laws promulgated by it
                          which could not be challenged on the ground of
                          incompetence, and a legislature which enjoys only
                          a limited or a qualified jurisdiction. If the
                          Constitution of a State distributes the legislative
                          powers amongst different bodies, which have to act
                          within their respective spheres marked out by
                          specific legislative entries, or if there are
                          limitations on the legislative authority in the shape
                          of fundamental rights, questions do arise as to
                          whether the legislature in a particular case has or
                          has not, in respect to the subject-matter of the
                          statute or in the method of enacting it, transgressed
                          the limits of its constitutional powers. Such
                          transgression may be patent, manifest or direct, but
                          it may also be disguised, covert and indirect and it
                          is to this latter class of cases that the expression
                          “colourable legislation” has been applied in
                          certain judicial pronouncements. The idea
                          conveyed by the expression is that although
                          apparently a legislature in passing a statute
                          purported to act within the limits of its powers, yet
                          in substance and in reality it transgressed these
                          powers, the transgression being veiled by what
                          appears, on proper examination, to be a mere
                          pretence or disguise. As was said by Duff, J.

                          In other words, it is the substance of the Act
                          that is material and not merely the form or
                          outward appearance, and if the subject-
                          matter in substance is something which is
                          beyond the powers of that legislature to
                          legislate upon, the form in which the law is
                          clothed would not save it from
                          condemnation. The legislature cannot
                          violate the constitutional prohibitions by
                          employing an indirect method. In cases like
                          these, the enquiry must always be as to the
                          true nature and character of the challenged
                          legislation and it is the result of such
                          investigation and not the form alone that
                          will determine as to whether or not it relates
                          to a subject which is within the power of the
                          legislative authority [ Vide Attorney-

                          this investigation the court could certainly
                          examine the effect of the legislation and
                          take into consideration its object, purpose

                          relevant for the purpose of ascertaining the
                          true character and substance of the

                      powers of the legislature to legislate upon, the same is to be declared as

                      unconstitutional. The Apex Court has emphasized that the substance is

                      more important than the form of legislation. In this case, the learned

                      counsel would submit that the form of the Government Orders appear to

                      be prescribing higher qualification but in substance, it is beyond the

                      legislative competence of the State Legislature and therefore, prescription

                      of these qualifications amounted to a colourable exercise of power.

                          could not raise any contention on the merits of the
                          case in view of this Court having disposed of those
                          very contentions and that therefore he would
                          confine his arguments only to the question of the
                          vires of <a href="/doc/1590252/" id="a_143">Section 38</a>. The learned Judges, who heard
                          that appeal were of the view (1) that the Act was a
                          composite piece of legislation that it did not, as
                          held by the learned Single Judge, fall exclusively
                          under Entries 77 and 78 of List I but that it fell
                          partly under those entries and partly under Entry
                          26 of List III; (2) that <a href="/doc/948250/" id="a_144">Article 138</a> had no
                          application as the jurisdiction to entertain and try
                          appeals under <a href="/doc/1590252/" id="a_145">Section 38</a> was not ‘further
                          jurisdiction’ within the meaning of that Article; that
                          the jurisdiction to hear such appeals was already
                          vested in this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_146">Article 136</a> even without
                          <a href="/doc/1590252/" id="a_147">Section 38</a> as the Bar Councils of Delhi and of
                          India were quasi-judicial tribunals and that
                          therefore this Court had jurisdiction to entertain
                          and try appeals against their orders; and (3) that
                          the only effect of <a href="/doc/1590252/" id="a_148">Section 38</a> was that by providing
                          for an appeal Parliament removed the hurdle of an
                          appellant having to obtain special leave under
                          <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_149">Article 136.</a> On this reasoning the learned Judges

                              In this appeal the appellant challenges the
                              correctness of this view.
</p><p id="p_7">                                4. The question which falls for consideration
                          is one of interpretation of Entries 77 and 78 of List
                          I and Entry 26 of List III. If it is held that it is Entry
                          26 of List III under which the Act was enacted,
                          clause 2 of <a href="/doc/948250/" id="a_151">Article 138</a> would apply and in that case
                          a special agreement with the State Government
                          becomes a condition precedent to the enactment of
                          <a href="/doc/1590252/" id="a_152">Section 38</a> of the Act. In that case the difficulty
                          would be to reconcile Entries 77 and 78 of List I
                          with Entry 26 of the List III.
</p><p id="p_8">                                 5. It is a well recognised rule of construction
                          that the Court while construing entries must assume
                          that the distribution of legislative powers in the
                          three Lists could not have been intended to be in
                          conflict with one another. A general power ought
                          not to be so construed as to make a nullity of a
                          particular power conferred by the same instrument
                          and operating in the same field when by reading
                          the former in a more restricted sense, effect can be
                          given to the latter in its ordinary and natural
                          meaning. It is, therefore, right to consider whether
                          a fair reconciliation cannot be effected by giving to
                          the language of an entry in one List the meaning
                          which, if less wide than it might in other context
                          bear, is yet one that can properly be given to it and
                          equally giving to the language of another entry in
                          another List a meaning which it can properly bear.
                          Where there is a seeming conflict between one entry
                          in one List and another entry in another List, an
                          attempt should always be made to avoid to see
                          whether the two entries can be harmonised to avoid
                          such a conflict of jurisdiction. (C.P. &amp; Berar Sales

                          constitution and organisation of courts or their
                          jurisdiction and powers. These, as already stated,

                          of 1935 Act. It will, however, be noticed that Entries
                          77 and 78 in List I are composite entries and deal
                          not only with the constitution and organisation of

                          repugnancy of the provisions of the said two Acts,
                          therefore, does not arise. It is true that the
                          Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Open
                          University Act shows that the formal system of
                          education had not been able to provide an effective
                          means to equalise educational opportunities. The
                          system is rigid inter alia in respect of attendance in
                          classrooms. Combinations of subjects are also
                          inflexible.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                 41. Was the alternative system envisaged
                          under the Open University Act in substitution of the
                          formal system, is the question. In our opinion, in
                          the matter of ensuring the standard of education, it
                          is not. The distinction between a formal system and
                          an informal system is in the mode and manner in
                          which education is imparted. The UGC Act was
                          enacted for effectuating coordination and
                          determination of standards in universities. The
                          purport and object for which it was enacted must be

                          or disaffiliate an institution for not

                          significant to note that earlier education,

                          to the State Legislatures. However, this
                          entry was omitted by the Constitution
                          (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 with

                          including university education, was thus
                          transferred to the Concurrent List and in
                          the process technical and medical education
                          was also added. Thus, if the argument of the
                          appellants is accepted, it may render Entry
                          25 completely otiose. When two entries

                          Reading in this manner, it would become
                          manifest that when it comes to coordination

</p><p id="p_53">                          102. Most educational activities, including
                          admissions, have two aspects : the first
                          deals with the adoption and setting up the
                          minimum standards of education. The
                          objective in prescribing minimum standards
                          is to provide a benchmark of the calibre and
                          quality of education being imparted by
                          various educational institutions in the entire
                          country. Additionally, the coordination of
                          the standards of education determined
                          nationwide is ancillary to the very
                          determination of standards. Realising the
                          vast diversity of the nation wherein levels of
                          education fluctuated from lack of even basic
                          primary education, to institutions of high
                          excellence, it was thought desirable to
                          determine and prescribe basic minimum
                          standards of education at various levels,
                          particularly at the level of research
                          institutions, higher education and technical
                          education institutions. As such, while
                          balancing the needs of States to impart
                          education as per the needs and
                          requirements of local and regional levels, it
                          was essential to lay down a uniform
                          minimum standard for the nation.

                          objective of maintaining uniform standards
                          of education in fields of research, higher
                          education and technical education.

                          coordination of standards, on the other
                          hand, the original List II Entry 11 granted

                          maintenance of certain standards in certain

                          marks shall be deemed to have passed that
                          examination; and suppose the Bihar

                          obtained 20% of marks shall be deemed to
                          have passed the BA degree examination;

                          used, that the candidate should be a

                          while introducing Entry 66 of the Union List
                          was thus limited only to empowering the
                          Union to lay down a uniform standard of
                          higher education throughout the country
                          and not to bereft the State Legislature of its
                          entire power to legislate in relation to
                          “education” and organising its own
                          common entrance examination.
</p><p id="p_69">                          133. If we consider the ambit of the present
                          Entry 66 of the Union List; no doubt the
                          field of legislation is of very wide import
                          and determination of standards in
                          institutions for higher education. In the
                          federal structure of India, as there are
                          many States, it is for the Union to
                          coordinate between the States to cause them
                          to work in the field of higher education in
                          their respective States as per the standards
                          determined by the Union. Entry 25 in the
                          Concurrent List is available both to the
                          Centre and the States. However, power of
                          the State is subject to the provisions of
                          Entries 63, 64, 65, and 66 of the Union List;
                          while the State is competent to legislate on
                          the education including technical education,
                          medical education and universities, it
                          should be as per the standards set by the

                          and are exclusively covered by Entry 66 of
                          the Union List. The word “coordination”
                          means harmonisation with a view to forge a
                          uniform pattern for concerted action. The
                          term “fixing of standards of institutions for
                          higher education” is for the purpose of
                          harmonising coordination of the various
                          institutions for higher education across the
                          country. Looking at the present distribution
                          of legislative powers between the Union and
                          the States with regard to the field of
                          “education”, that State&#x27;s power to legislate
                          in relation to “education, including
                          technical education, medical education and
                          universities” is analogous to that of the
                          Union. However, such power is subject to
                          Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of the Union List,
                          as laid down in Entry 25 of the Concurrent
                          List. It is the responsibility of the Central
                          Government to determine the standards of
                          higher education and the same should not
                          be lowered at the hands of any particular

                          be clearly laid down that power of the
                          Union under Entry 66 of the Union List is

                          “determining the standards of higher
                          education” and not of laying down

                      certain principles as to how it should be understood in the context of the

                      to the general power and the Courts would always need to strike a

                      balance and construct the entries harmoniously. He would submit that

                      though the above decision stated that the State still has a space for

                      bringing in certain regulations relating to the field of medical education,

                      despite Entry 66 in List I, yet the highlight of the decision is that there is

                      a specific power of laying down standards in higher education being

                      traceable only to Entry 66 and the State Government is completely

                      denuded of its jurisdiction in such matters. He would therefore, submit

                      that the standards of legal education are prescribed only by the BCI in

                      terms of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_205">Advocates Act</a>, 1961. Therefore, there

                      cannot be any justification in prescription of M.L., degree and enrollment

                      as advocate for a faculty to teach pre-law courses, which in no way would

                      enhance the standards or improve the legal education.

                      stand of the BCI is concerned, the qualifications as prescribed by the

                      State Government only in respect of the Law Colleges which come under

                      its control, is completely unwarranted and therefore, the same are liable

                      to be declared as illegal and arbitrary.

                      the same has been obtained on a regular mode. She also referred to 2016

                      Amendment and also the subsequent amendments in the years 2018 and

                      2021. The Commission has framed guidelines for recognition of Ph.D.,

                      degree only if such degrees are conferred on a regular mode. In effect,

                      the learned counsel attempted to impress upon this Court that generally

                      when degrees are obtained through regular mode, such degrees alone are

                      to be recognized; but not the degrees obtained otherwise.

<p id="p_96">                      students ratio as per the norms of the UGC is 1:30. In many Government

                      and above in one section. In tune with the ratio of the UGC, the Colleges

                      can create that many sections on the basis of the actual students strength

                      and by such arrangement, quality of education would also improve and

                      the services of the pre-law faculty will also be utilised fully and they

                      could be made to work in terms of the minimum hours as prescribed by

                      the UGC. In any event, as on date, these pre-law faculties are performing

                      more than the minimum hours prescribed by UGC and the contention

                      extra qualifications as prescribed, suffer from grave irrationality without

                      any iota of any quality being added to the Post Graduation qualification

                      faculty as the relevant subject they have learnt is only for two years in the

                      Post Graduate course, which would not be sufficient for taking classes

                      effectively. They would also not be endowed with basic academic skills

                      in the relevant subject in the absence of the basic qualification being

                      different. The candidate with such qualification cannot be certainly called

                            50     Mr.R.Shanmugasundaram, learned Advocate General has

                      appeared and argued on behalf of the State Government in the batch of

                      writ petitions.   The learned Advocate General has made detailed

                      submissions touching upon all the facts as argued above by the respective

                      learned counsels for the writ petitioners.      According to the learned

                      Advocate General, the prescription of the additional qualifications are

                      required for the kind of subjects that are required to be taught even at the

                      level of the pre-law courses. Therefore, the Government felt the necessity

                      for having the faculty who are qualified both in the relevant subjects [pre-

<p id="p_99">                      law] and also M.L., qualification for attending to the additional

                      requirements of the students even during their study at the pre-law level.
</p>
<p id="p_100">                            51     According to the learned Advocate General, there is nothing

                      wrong in prescribing additional qualifications as it would be a value

                      addition for the students who are ultimately to be trained as Advocates to

                      be enrolled at the Bar. Further, for a teaching faculty, career progression

                      is possible only upto the level of Principal and above only when a person

                      is credited with Post Graduate degree in law. If a person merely in

                      possession of a Post Graduate Degree in any relevant subject cannot

                      aspire to go beyond the level of Head of Department [HOD]. Therefore,

                      both from the perspective of the students interest as well as the faculty&#x27;s

                      interest, such qualifications have been prescribed and the same cannot be

                      legally faulted with. The learned Advocate General therefore summed up

                      that there is no legal or constitutional infirmity in the prescription of the

                      additional qualifications and he therefore prays for dismissal of the writ

                      petitions challenging the qualifications.

                                     subject and the National Eligibility Test [NET] or an
                                     accredited test, are rationale, reasonable free from the vice

<p id="p_105">                               56   On the other side of the spectrum, the challenge has been

                      resisted that no legal or constitutional infirmity could be found in the

                      prescription of the additional qualifications, as such qualifications are

                      very much required with reference to the curriculum formulated in the

                            58     One of the objections to the challenge that without

                      challenging the statutory rules, as laid down in the Tamil Nadu Legal

                      Education Service, the writ petitioners assail only the consequential

                      incorporation of the qualifications in the recruitment Notification of the

                      years 2014 and 2018. In fact, detailed arguments have been advanced

                      drawing reference to two important Government Orders under the Legal

                      Education Service, viz., G.O.Ms.No.1349 dated 19.11.1985 and

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 20.12.2005. The qualifications as prescribed in

                      the Notifications under challenge could be traced to these two

                      Government Orders and in the said circumstances, a mere challenge to

                      the qualification prescribed in the Notifications without actually

                      challenging the rules, is unsustainable and liable to be dismissed on that

                      ground alone. According to the learned counsels, the Government Orders

                      have been issued in furtherance of the rule making power under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_207">Article

                      309</a> of the Constitution of India.

<p id="p_109">                            59     The further objection is the qualifications prescribed, have

                      stood the test of time from 1985 and several recruitments have taken

                      place for more than three decades and the candidates appointed with the

                      said qualification. In support of this contention, the learned counsels who

                      are opposed to the challenge, have relied on various decisions and

                      relevant observations rendered by the Courts which have been extracted

                      supra.
</p>


<p id="p_110">                               60   Countering the above arguments, it has been contended that

                      when the Notification was issued on 22.07.2014, both the Government

                      Orders, in G.O.Ms.No.1349 dated 19.11.1985 and G.O.Ms.No.264 dated

                      20.12.2005, had been put to challenge in WP.No.33145/2014 and the

                      challenge was discountenanced by a learned Single Judge and as against

                      that, a writ appeal was preferred in WA.No.533/2018 and a Division

                      Bench of this Court had dismissed the said writ appeal vide it&#x27;s judgment

                      dated 09.03.2018.          As against dismissal of the writ appeal,

                      Rev.Appln.No.195/2019 has been filed and the same is also tagged along

                      with this batch of writ petitions and the writ appeals. The answer to the

                      objection therefore is that challenge to the relevant rules is also before this

                      Court.

                      learned Division Benches had negatived the challenge against prescription

                      of additional qualifications. This Court has gone through the said

                      judgments, but eventually finds that elaborate submissions and

                      arguments made by the respective learned counsels in this batch of writ

                      petitions, had not been canvassed for consideration before the Division

                      Benches.    The Division Benches did not have the benefit of these

                      arguments. In the opinion of this Court, the issues raised in this batch

                      require a very incisive and critical examination, in view of the seminal

                      stakes involved in the field of legal education in the State of Tamil Nadu.

<p id="p_112">                            62     Both the learned Division Benches, had premised its&#x27; views

                      on the notion that the higher qualifications fixed by the employer than

                      fixed by the Central Regulating Agency like UGC, cannot said to be

                      improper and invalid. The learned Division Benches have also reasonsed

                      that the relevant Government Orders had stood the test of time from 1985

                      and 2005 onwards and it was too late in the day to challenge the same.

                      the employer to prescribe the required qualification for any post in

                      Others</a>].   The learned Division Bench had also dismissed the said writ

                      appeal on the facts of that case that the written examination for selection

                      was stated to be over and the aggrieved candidates approached the Court

                      after the last date of submission of the applications. This Court, being the

                      coordinate Bench, cannot make any remarks or express any opinion, as

                      the reasons which formed the basis of the conclusion by the Division

                      Benches are in consonance with the settled legal principles on the subject

                      matter.
</p>
<p id="p_114">                            63     However, inasmuch as being a Coordinate Bench, it is not

                      proper for this Court to differ, at the same time, in view of the

                      submissions as to the constitutionality of the prescription of the additional

                      qualifications and also pendency of the aforementioned Review

                      merits of the challenge without adopting a pedantic approach. Further,

                      considering the importance of the issues concerning the legal education

                      in the State of Tamil Nadu, this Court cannot afford to abdicate its

                      constitutional jurisdiction in preference to technicalities. Moreover, as

                      rightly contended by one of the learned counsels, that any offending

                      provision or rule can always be subjected to challenge, when rights of

                      candidates being infringed upon due to the application of the offending

                      rule. It is always open to this Court to consider the constitutionality

                      issue, notwithstanding the earlier decisions of this Court which

                      admittedly, did not have an opportunity to deal with issues as raised

                      herein.    This Court is in agreement with the submissions of the learned

                      counsels that the power of judicial review by the Constitutional Courts

                      cannot stand ousted because of the fact that the offending provision or

                      rule stood the test of time.
</p>


<p id="p_115">                            64     The other aspect of objection is that it is not open to the

                      candidates to challenge the qualifications prescribed after their

                      participation in the selection process. The learned counsels in support of

                      their contention, relied on some case laws. This Court cannot have any

                      quarrel on the consistent legal principles laid down by the Courts and it is

                      not open to the candidates to set up a challenge to the Regulations or the

                      Notifications, after their participation in the subject selection. Having

                      chosen to participate in the selection without demur, the candidates were

                      estopped from challenging the prescription in the Notification or in the

                      Rules. However, what calls for adjudication herein is not simple run off

                      the mill contestation qua parties, but it is about the interplay of powers in

                      authorities in the framework of the constitutional scheme.
</p>


<p id="p_116">                            65     This Court is also conscious of the settled legal principle that

                      unless and until the qualifications are declared illegal, arbitrary and void,

                      the same are valid and applicable.         In the said circumstances, the

                      qualification as prescribed in the impugned Notifications in terms of the

                      statutory Rules, cannot be thrown upon to challenge by the candidates,

                      who had participated in the selection only by virtue of the interim orders

                      obtained by them from this Court.         It is needless to state that their

                      participation in the selection process did not give them any right to get

                      selected or appointed as their participation was always subject to the final

                      outcome in the writ petitions.
</p>


<p id="p_117">                            66     There are two possible situations which may arise in regard

                      to the present objection. Firstly, these writ petitions by the candidates

                      who participated in the selection without any protest, can be simply

                      dismissed on the basis of the settled legal position in terms of the case

                      laws cited. Secondly, these writ petitions can be disposed of by a simple

                      decision that the selection process was already over long time ago and in

                      the event of this Court holding that the prescription of additional

                      qualification is unconstitutional and illegal, the same could have only a

                      prospective application. In such scenario, the exercise would become

                      only academic in respect of the writ petitioners herein as the candidates

                      have already been selected provisionally, in terms of the present

                      qualifications, as any ruling of the Court cannot be detrimental to the

                      accrued rights of the qualified participants as their participation in the

                      selection cannot be set at nought by this Court, by retrospective ruling.
</p>


<p id="p_118">                            67      The arguments advanced on behalf of the qualified

                      candidates in terms of the prescription in the Notification is that this is

                      not the case where unqualified candidates are sought to be selected, but it

                      is a strange case where the qualified candidates are sought to be

                      prevented from being selected at the instance of the unqualified

                      candidates.   This submission though valid and meaningful, yet when

                      interference of this Court is called for on the ground of constitutionality of

                      the policy action of the Government, the individual rights are subject to

                      the ultimate decision of this Court in the matter.

                      force in favour of the provisionally selected &#x27;&#x27;qualified&#x27;&#x27; candidates. But

                      once again looking at the larger picture of serious pitfalls being noticed in

                      the qualification aspects, even in respect of the qualified candidates, this

                      Court has to necessarily deal with the challenge from all dimensions for

                      the reasons set forth below.
</p>


<p id="p_120">                            69     Apart from the objections as above, a new twist has been

                      introduced in the batch in respect of the qualifications possessed by some

                      of the qualified candidates who appeared to have been in possession of

                      cross major degrees and not having both Under Graduate and Post

                      Graduate degree in the same relevant subject. Further, the Post Graduate

                      degrees had been obtained by some candidates through Distance

                      Education mode. According to the counsels, behind the objections, both

                      type of qualifications are not valid for being appointed as Assistant

                      Professor in the pre-law course. Although no particular rule or regulation

                      or any material has been brought to the notice of this Court, this Court

                      finds the objections are extremely important and relevant for

                      consideration of this Court. When standards of the legal education in the

                      State is the subject matter of examination of this Court, how the

                      qualifications had been acquired by the &#x27;&#x27;qualified candidates&#x27;&#x27; need to be

                                                                           WP.Nos.19534/2018 etc., batch

                      looked into beyond the realm of their possession of paper degrees. In

                      fact, this Court, during the Court during the course of arguments by the

                      learned counsels and also browsing through various judgments cited

                      supra, did not come across any judgments of the Apex Court on two

                      aspects, viz., cross major qualifications and     qualification by Distance

                      Education mode with specific reference to appointment to teaching posts.
</p>
<p id="p_121">                      The decisions cited at the Bar relate to the legal validity of the cross major

                      and degrees obtained through Distance Education mode, as those degrees

                      have been finally held to be valid.
</p>
<p id="p_122">                            70     But what is troubling this Court in the present adjudication

                      is whether these degrees are valid or fair enough for the purpose of

                      appointing the candidates with such degrees in the teaching profession

                      and in this case, Assistant Professors for pre-law courses.               These

                      objections have contemporaneous relevance, when there is a hue and cry

                      of fall in standard in the legal education, particularly imparted by the

                      Government run institutions.       Unfortunately there is no satisfactory

                      clarification, either from the State Government or from the Central

                      Regulating Body on these vital aspects. In the absence of clear principles

                      laid down on these aspects, the exercise of the power of judicial review of

                      this Court becomes all the more a constitutional imperative of ensuring

                      that the system of higher learning is not infused with the mediocrity. This

                      Court nonetheless is conscious of the legal position that judicial review on

                      academic matters is limited and circumscribed by the legal precedents as

                      laid down by the Apex Court, yet when the Courts find that there is

                      complete absence of clarity on the qualifications prescribed, the

                      Constitutional Court cannot be a mute spectator and be a witness to the

                      appointments of teachers who are under equipped and half baked with

                      the present unclear eligibility criteria.
</p>


<p id="p_123">                             71     In the said circumstances, this Court has to be certainly step

                      in with a view of ensure that the present policies of the Government need

                      a re-look so that unneeded qualifications are weeded out in the overall

                      interest of the institutional growth.        With this conclusion, this Court

                      hasten to proceed further with the main challenge in the writ petition, viz.,

                      additional qualifications.

<p id="p_124">                             72     As far as the additional qualifications are concerned, the

                      principal justification comes from the plea that the syllabus for the Five

                      Year Integrated Law Courses has been designed with the mixture of

<p id="p_125">                      This Court&#x27;s attention has been drawn to the factum of syllabus

                      prescribed by the Government and made applicable to the Government

                      Law Colleges in the State.

<p id="p_126">                            73     This Court has repeatedly encountered the advocates to

                      demonstrate as to how the syllabus prescribed for the Government Law

                      Colleges is materially and qualitatively different from the other curricula

                      that are made applicable to all the Universities and Colleges in the

                      country or even within the State like Dr.Ambedkar Law University.

<p id="p_127">                      However, no satisfactory submission was forth coming nor any clinching

                      materials were shown in support of the prescription of post graduate

                      degree in law and more particularly, enrollment as advocate.               The

                      teaching of subjects relating to law may commence even from the first

                      semester onwards in the integrated programme, as seen in the syllabus

                      but it does not mean that those classes need to be handled by the

                      Assistant Professors who are principally recruited to handle pre-law

                      courses in various subjects relating to arts, science, commerce etc. The

                      content required a degree in law, have miserably failed to demonstrate

                      before this Court as to what exactly the course content which is so unique

                      and singular and that unless a person with post graduate degree in law

                      the pre-law courses cannot be handled by a post graduate degree holder

                      in the relevant subject. The entire arguments in this regard, have been in

                      the realm of conjecture and supposition.

                      showing the contents of the syllabus, this Court is not convinced and

                      unable to persuade itself in accepting the submission of the counsels, with

                      cast iron conviction. Firstly, the syllabus that is made applicable as

                      between the Government Colleges and other institutions affiliated to

                      Dr.Ambedkar Law University in the State, this Court did not find any

                      palpable or material difference at all. Despite the painstaking efforts by

                      the counsels, the arguments and submissions of the counsels failed to

                      impress     upon     this    Court      authoritatively.   Secondly,        when

                      supporting the qualifications is completely out of tune with the reality of

                      the academic requirement of the course study in the integrated

                      programme of 5 year law degree.

                            75     The Legal Education Rules, 2019, which is yet to be

                      notified, what    is envisaged therein is very much discernible and

                      appreciable. The offer to students various options of          study in Arts,

                      Science, Commerce or Technology, does not mean that the subjects are to

                      be taught at a cursory or superficial level. The new rules presumably

                      only reinforce the obvious. In a higher education programme, when any

                      subject is prescribed as a specialization, the same cannot be treated as an

                      auxillary and make the students learn the peripheries of the subject.

<p id="p_131">                      Thus, the additional qualifications prescribed cannot said to be drawing

                      definite support from such slippery assertion or contention.

<p id="p_132">                            76     In the above backdrop, this Court has to approach the issue

                      whether the M.L., degree and also enrollment as advocate are essential

                      qualifications for the faculty whose recruitment is only with regard to

                      their appointments as pre-law teacher.       In fact, initially the learned

                      counsels on a mistaken or misplaced notion, contended that the Central

                      Regulating Body like the UGC sets only the minimum standards to be

                      followed in the University education and that it is always open to the

                      qualifications. This contention viewed in isolation, cannot be faulted with

                      at all as the Courts have consistently held so. Some decisions have also

                      been cited and relied upon by the counsels and this Court has also drawn

                      reference to the same. However, the issue herein is not the prescription of

                      higher qualification, but prescription of additional qualifications

                      unconnected to the main qualification.        At best it can said to be

                      supernumerary qualifications. In fact, the earlier decisions of the Division

                      Benches which have been referred to supra, had premised its views only

                      on the basis of the settled legal principle that there is no bar in

                      prescription of higher qualification by the University or the State

                      Government concerned. However, when the controversy herein is probed

                      profoundly, it could be seen that the disputed qualifications may not have

                      adjunct value to the teaching faculty solely employed for taking pre-law

                      courses.    On the other hand, with the additional qualifications,

                      particularly regular ML degree and enrollment as advocate, unlike the

                      core postgraduate degrees in the relevant subject, the focus of teaching is

                      forced to gravitate towards law from the pre-law level, thus defeating the

                      very concept of the integrated legal programme formulated by the

                      academia.

                            77    In order to become eligible for appointment as Assistant

                      Professor [pre-law], in terms of the present qualifications, one needs to

                      have post graduate qualification in the relevant subject, plus M.L., degree

                      and enrollment as advocate. The time spent on acquiring the minimum

                      qualification is 10+2 at the school level, 3+2, acquiring qualification in

                      the relevant subject and 3+2, Bachelor of Law and Master of Law, which

                      means that a candidate is required to undergo a minimum of 10 years in

                      higher education to acquire the basic qualification after school final. The

                      emphasis of the policy makers is more on the achievement of competency

                      in law than the relevant subject concerned at the pre level. Needless to

                      mention that one cannot qualify himself/herself with M.L., degree unless

                      he/she qualify as an under graduate in law. Unfortunately, this is not so,

                      in the subject concerned where a candidate who acquires his/her post

                      graduate qualification in the relevant subjects like economics, commerce,

                      sociology etc., need not required to possess under graduate degree in the

                      same subjects.     Incongruity is writ large on the prescription of the

                      qualifications as such. Such, prescription for pre-law teachers appear to

                      be ex facie lopsided and asymmetrical relegating the specialization like

                      Arts, Science, Commerce, Technology, etc., as a secondary and collateral

                      subject.

                            78     When a candidate is to be appointed to teach pre-law

                      courses, the stress must be that the person selected to teach a particular

                      subject must be intellectually equipped to handle classes for the students

                      in the subject of specialisation of the candidate concerned, in terms of

                      his/her post graduate degree.         Requiring more qualifications, not

                      connected to to the main qualification in the finer discharge of duties, the

                      teacher concerned would inevitably be a person of mediocre knowledge of

                      not excelling in the relevant subject or in law, either. This Court is also at

                      a loss to understand and perplexed that more than prescription of M.L.,

                      degree, the insistence of enrollment as advocate. How far enrollment as

                      advocate is going to be of any academic use in the discharge of duties by

                      the Assistant Professor, is a conundrum, as no definite or plausible

                      answers are to be found. In fact, from the entirety of arguments by the

                      learned counsels, this aspect has not been addressed at all. Hence, the

                      options to join the profession, as he is trained and tuned to be a lawyer,

                      midstream. The possession of law degree and enrollment at the Bar

                      would invariably act as a catalyst and inducement for the teacher of pre-

                      practical times of today&#x27;s context. On the other hand, if a candidate with

                      same subject, both at the under graduate and post graduate levels, such

                      their qualifications with reference to the posts they are sought to be

                      recruited. But the fact of the matter is that the objects and reasons behind

                      the policy decisions need to be explained and justified when the same

                      come under attack before this Court by the policy makers and not by the

                      candidates. This Court even otherwise is of the view that having gone

                      through all the materials and the respective pleadings, no amount of

                      justification could gain legal acceptance for the following reasons.

                      already been extracted supra, in the earlier part of this decision. The

                      learned counsel referred to five decisions in all, touching on the nucleus

                      of the controversy. According to the learned counsel, the BCI has a

                      predominant role in prescribing qualifications for legal education and this

                      position is not open to any debate. The learned counsel particularly

                      referred to paragraph No.14 of the decision reported in 2007 [2] SCC

                      202 which has been extracted supra. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of

                      India, in that decision has held that being the Apex Professional Body,

                      the BCI is concerned with the standards of the legal profession and the

                      equipment of those who seek entry into that profession. When the BCI

                      with this Court. In fact, the learned counsel has stated that after the

                      enactment of the Advocates&#x27; Act, 1961, the jurisdiction for laying down

                      standards and norms for the legal education had been carved from the

                      learned counsel for the BCI has referred to the Entries in the Seventh

                      Bench in the said decision referred to the observation of the other

<p id="p_151">                            86     In this case, admittedly, the BCI under the Legal Education

                      Rules, has not prescribed the disputed qualifications at all. But, at the

                      same time, the Constitutional Courts have also held that in a shared

                      legislative field, there is always a space for enacting laws on the subjects

                      falling both in the Union List as well as in the Concurrent List. In such

                      situations, the Courts have held doctrine of Pith and Substance need to be

                      applied, in order to uphold the validity of the legislation. In fact, the

                      learned counsel for the BCI emphasized this constitutional position when

                      he relied on paragraph No.9 in the decision of the Apex Court reported in

                      AIR 1953 SC 375 [cited supra]. The said paragraph has been extracted

                      supra. In the said decision, the Apex Court has observed that it is the

                      substance of the Act that is material and not merely the form or outward

                      appearance, and if the subject-matter in substance is something which is

                      beyond the powers of that legislature to legislate upon, the form in which

                      the law is clothed would not save it from condemnation.          The Hon&#x27;ble

                      Supreme Court also observed that the        legislature cannot violate the

                      constitutional prohibitions by employing an indirect method. As far as

                      the present disputation is concerned, the minimum standard prescribed

                      by the Central Regulating Body has been retained. Therefore, to that

                      extent, it cannot be held that there is a direct conflict by the State

                      Legislation encroaching upon the field of legislation as provided in Entry

                      66 of the Union List.

<p id="p_152">                            87     Be that as it may, what is to be seen in the exceptional

                      circumstances of the present case is not the action per se in prescription

                      of the minimum qualification by the State Government, but in

                      prescription of additional qualifications unconnected to the main

                      qualifications.   When the disputed qualifications are construed to be

                      unconnected and supernumerary qualifications, the same are to be

                      declared irrational, unreasonable and arbitrary. Indisputably, there is no

                      bar in prescription of higher qualifications by the appointing authorities,

                      particularly, in a shared legislative field like the present one where there

                      is an interplay of Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh

                      Schedule to the Constitution. But, the expression of higher qualification

                      must be necessarily relate to the qualifications as prescribed by the BCI.

                      qualification for the faculty in pre-law courses.      Any prescription of

                      higher qualification like M.Phil., Ph.D., in the subject concerned is

                      certainly desirable for enhancing the standards of teaching. In that case,

                      any statutory provision laying down higher academic norms cannot

                      attract constitutional controversy.        But, unfortunately under the

                      impression of prescribing higher qualifications, unneeded qualifications

                      have been prescribed focussing more on law than in the subjects like

                      Economics, Commerce, Technology etc., in the integrated degree

                      programme.

<p id="p_154">                            88     The qualification post graduate degree in the relevant subject

                      has been prescribed by the BCI in its Legal Education Rules and the

                      source of power for such prescription could be traced to <a href="/doc/1675749/" id="a_209">Section 7</a>[1][h][i]

                      of the Advocates&#x27; Act, 1961. The relevant provisions of the Advocates&#x27;

                      Advocates&#x27; Act, 1961 is a fall out of Entries 77 and 78 of List-I. When

                      prescription of qualification owes its origination in the Entries in List-I,

                      any further prescription of qualifications not in connection with the said

                      qualifications will have to be declared as unconstitutional as the State

                      authority is prohibited from laying down different qualification in terms

                      of the constitutional scheme of distribution of fields of legislation and

                      Regulating Body, in this case, the BCI, yet he/she becomes disqualified

                      not because any higher qualification prescribed, but because of

                          scope. It is further observed by this Court that it
                          deals with “coordination and determination of
                          standards” in institution of higher education or
                          research as well as scientific and technical
                          institutions. The words “coordination and
                          determination of standards” would mean laying
                          down the said standards. It is observed that thus,
                          when it comes to prescribing the standards for such
                          institutions of higher learning, exclusive domain is
                          given to the Union. The relevant observations are
                          in paragraphs 101 to 105, which read as under:
                          “101. To our mind, Entry 66 in List I is a specific
                          entry having a very specific and limited scope. It
                          deals with coordination and determination of
                          standards in institution of higher education or
                          research as well as scientific and technical
                          institutions. The words “coordination and
                          determination of standards” would mean laying
                          down the said standards. Thus, when it comes to
                          prescribing the standards for such institutions of
                          higher learning, exclusive domain is given to the
                          Union. However, that would not include conducting
                          of examination, etc. and admission of students to
                          such institutions or prescribing the fee in these
                          institutions of higher education, etc. In fact, such
                          coordination and determination of standards,
                          insofar as medical education is concerned, is
                          achieved by parliamentary legislation in the form
                          of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_213">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 and by

                          as well as coordination of standards and that of

                          regulating “education” as such, which includes

                          (which are imparting higher education), that is
                          prescribed in List III Entry 25, thereby giving
                          concurrent powers to both Union as well as States.
                          It is significant to note that earlier education,
                          including universities, was the subject-matter of
                          List II Entry 11 [“11. “Education” including
                          universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63,
                          64, 65 and 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III”].
                          Thus, power to this extent was given to the State
                          Legislatures. However, this entry was omitted by
                          the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act,
                          1976 with effect from 3-7-1977 and at the same
                          time List II Entry 25 was amended [Unamended
                          Entry 25 in List III read as:“Vocational and
                          technical training of labour”]. Education,
                          including     university education, was thus
                          transferred to the Concurrent List and in the
                          process technical and medical education was also
                          added. Thus, if the argument of the appellants is
                          accepted, it may render Entry 25 completely otiose.
                          When two entries relating to education, one in the
                          Union List and the other in the Concurrent List,
                          coexist, they have to be read harmoniously.
                          Reading in this manner, it would become manifest
                          that when it comes to coordination and laying down
                          of standards in the higher education or research
                          and scientific and technical institutions, power rests
                          with the Union/Parliament to the exclusion of the
                          State Legislatures. However, other facets of
                          education, including technical and medical
                          education, as well as governance of universities is
                          concerned, even State Legislatures are given power
                          by virtue of Entry 25. The field covered by List III
                          Entry 25 is wide enough and as circumscribed to
                          the limited extent of it being subject to List I Entries
                          63, 64, 65 and 66.

</p><p id="p_162">                          102. Most educational activities, including
                          admissions, have two aspects : the first deals with
                          the adoption and setting up the minimum standards
                          of education. The objective in prescribing minimum
                          standards is to provide a benchmark of the calibre
                          and quality of education being imparted by various
                          educational institutions in the entire country.
                          Additionally, the coordination of the standards of
                          education determined nationwide is ancillary to the
                          very determination of standards. Realising the vast
                          diversity of the nation wherein levels of education
                          fluctuated from lack of even basic primary
                          education, to institutions of high excellence, it was
                          thought desirable to determine and prescribe basic
                          minimum standards of education at various levels,
                          particularly at the level of research institutions,
                          higher education and technical education
                          institutions. As such, while balancing the needs of
                          States to impart education as per the needs and
                          requirements of local and regional levels, it was
                          essential to lay down a uniform minimum standard
                          for the nation. Consequently, the Constitution-
                          makers provided for List I Entry 66 with the
                          objective of maintaining uniform standards of
                          education in fields of research, higher education
                          and technical education.
</p><p id="p_163">                          103. The second/other aspect of education is with
                          regard to the implementation of the standards of
                          education determined by Parliament, and the
                          regulation of the complete activity of education.
                          This activity necessarily entails the application of
                          the standards determined by Parliament in all
                          educational institutions in accordance with the
                          local and regional needs. Thus, while List I Entry
                          66 dealt with determination and coordination of
                          standards, on the other hand, the original List II
                          Entry 11 granted the States the exclusive power to

                          standards and coordination which was in national
                          interest. Subsequently, vide the Constitution (Forty-

                          legislative field of the State Legislature with regard
                          to education was removed and deleted, and the
                          same was replaced by amending List III Entry 25
                          granting concurrent powers to both Parliament and
                          State Legislature the power to legislate with respect
                          to all other aspects of education, except that which

                          reference to List I Entry 66. It was held that the
                          power of the State to legislate in respect of
                          education to the extent it is entrusted to Parliament,
                          is deemed to be restricted. Coordination and
                          determination of standards was in the purview of
                          List I and power of the State was subject to power
                          of the Union on the said subject. It was held that

                          certain standards in certain classes of institutions,
                          namely, institutions imparting higher education,
                          scientific and technical institutions, institutions for

                          the BA Degree examination which is conducted by
                          the different universities in India. Now, most

                          be a graduate of a university. Now, suppose the

                          that the candidate should be a graduate, I think,
                          would be meaningless. Similarly, there are certain

                          introducing Entry 66 of the Union List was thus
                          limited only to empowering the Union to lay down a
                          uniform standard of higher education throughout
                          the country and not to bereft the State Legislature
                          of its entire power to legislate in relation to
                          “education” and organising its own common

                          legislation is of very wide import and
                          determination of standards in institutions for
                          higher education. In the federal structure of India,
                          as there are many States, it is for the Union to
                          coordinate between the States to cause them to
                          work in the field of higher education in their
                          respective States as per the standards determined
                          by the Union. Entry 25 in the Concurrent List is
                          available both to the Centre and the States.
                          However, power of the State is subject to the
                          provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65, and 66 of the
                          Union List; while the State is competent to legislate
                          on the education including technical education,
                          medical education and universities, it should be as

                          education” are the preserve of Parliament and are
                          exclusively covered by Entry 66 of the Union List.
                          The word “coordination” means harmonisation
                          with a view to forge a uniform pattern for concerted
                          action. The term “fixing of standards of institutions
                          for higher education” is for the purpose of
                          harmonising coordination of the various
                          institutions for higher education across the country.
                          Looking at the present distribution of legislative
                          powers between the Union and the States with
                          regard to the field of “education”, that State&#x27;s
                          power to legislate in relation to “education,
                          including technical education, medical education
                          and universities” is analogous to that of the Union.
                          However, such power is subject to Entries 63, 64,
                          65 and 66 of the Union List, as laid down in Entry
                          25 of the Concurrent List. It is the responsibility of
                          the Central Government to determine the standards
                          of higher education and the same should not be
                          lowered at the hands of any particular State.

                          clearly laid down that power of the Union under
                          Entry 66 of the Union List is limited to prescribing
                          standards of higher education to bring about
                          uniformity in the level of education imparted
                          throughout the country. Thus, the scope of Entry 66
                          must be construed limited to its actual sense of
                          “determining the standards of higher education”
                          and not of laying down admission process. In no

                          with the scope and ambit of Entry 66 List I, Entry
                          66 of List I is a specific entry having a very specific
                          and limited scope; it deals with “Coordination and
                          Determination of Standards” in institutions of
                          higher education or research as well as scientific
                          and technical institutions. It is further observed
                          that the words “Coordination and Determination of
                          Standards” would mean laying down the said
                          standards and therefore when it comes to prescribe
                          the standards for such institutions of higher
                          learning, exclusive domain is given to the Union. It
                          is specifically further observed that that would not
                          include conducting of examination etc. and
                          admission of students to such institutions or
                          prescribing the fee in these institutions of higher
                          education, etc. Thus, in exercise of powers under
                          Entry 66 List I, the Union cannot provide for
                          anything with respect to reservation/percentage of

                                 the States under Entry 25 of List III. In exercise of
                                 powers under Entry 25 List III, the States have
                                 power to make provision for mode of admissions,
                                 looking to the requirements and/or need in the
                                 concerned State.&#x27;&#x27;



                            90     From the above, it could be seen that the power of the State

                      Legislature is not altogether excluded, but it is restricted and

                      circumscribed to the Central enactment. The emphasis highlighted by the

                      Apex Court is the determination of uniform minimum standards in higher

                      education nationwide.

<p id="p_178">                            91     When the above ruling is to be applied in this case, the

                      requirement of the minimum qualification of ML Degree and enrollment

                      as advocate is a clear instance of varying the minimum standards fixed by

                      the Central body. In that view of the matter and to that extent, the two

                      Government Orders, viz., G.O.Ms.No.1349 dated 19.11.1985 and

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 20.12.2005, are to be necessarily held as invalid as

                      extracted supra. From the cumulative reading of the decisions of the

                      Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India and the relevant Constitutional Entries in

                      the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the Doctrine of Pith and

                      Substance in terms of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_230">Article 246</a> of the Constitution of India, this Court

                      has to come to an inexorable conclusion that the prescription of additional

                      qualifications, viz., M.L.Degree, and     enrollment as advocate, suffers

                      from lack of legislative competence.

                      Court has to necessarily conclude        that the additional qualifications

                      prescribed, run afoul of the qualifications prescribed by the Central

                      regard to the main challenge in the writ petitions. As outlined in the

                      earlier portion of the decision, there are two other issues that need to be

                      decided in the paramount interest of maintaining exemplary standard in

                      the field of legal education. There are two worrying scenarios that are

                      portrayed in the course of submissions by the learned counsels. Some of

                      the candidates have obtained their post graduate degree, though in the

                      relevant subject as per the Notification, but had obtained their degrees

                      through Distance Education mode. This Court, of course, cannot have

                      any quarrel, as degrees obtained through Distance Education mode, are

                      recognised, as held by the Apex Court as well as the Full Bench of this

                      Court referred to supra. Despite the recognition of the degrees, this Court

                      has a strong misgiving as to the suitability of such candidates for

                      appointment as faculty members. Although the validity of a degree is

                      degrees obtained through Distance Education mode or correspondence

                      required to be clarified.

<p id="p_182">                            95     Any recruitment to a post of teaching faculty in higher

                      education or any other education for that matter is not intended to provide

                      job opportunities to the potential candidates who apply for consideration.

<p id="p_183">                      The purpose of appointments of teaching faculty is towards fulfillment of

                      achieving higher academic standards in any field of education. In this

                      case, the focus is on the quality of the legal education. The quality of

                      education could only be measured through the type of teachers who are

                      appointed to handle the academics. If persons with no experience in

                      campus life having not studied and earned their degrees in the regular

                      considering the lack of access to regular education by the vast majority of

                      the disadvantaged class, yet in the larger interest of institutional growth of

                      higher education, the degrees obtained through Distance Education mode

<p id="p_188">                            98     In the realm of maintaining high standard in Legal

                      Education, how the postgraduate degree holders from Distant Education

                      mode can be an effective faculty member for taking regular classes in the

                      campus, a pertinent doubt but not dispelled to the satisfaction of this

                      Court. For such candidate, the campus atmosphere is an alien experience

                      and may lead to diffidence. In such scenario, it is too much to expect

                      great quality of pedagogical disposition from such faculty. On one hand,

                      there is a hue and cry for minimum standards in higher education and on

                      the other, paradoxically appointments are sought to be made with

                      candidates qualified through distance education mode. In fact, invariably

                      such degrees are earned only for the purpose of furthering their job

                      prospects in the employment market. Such degree holders, principally

                      look upon the appointment as a job opportunity as they go about

                      of the decisions cited and relied upon by the learned counsels supporting

                      the existing qualifications touch upon this aspect. Although the degrees

                      obtained through distance education mode is considered to be recognised

                      and valid, in terms of the rulings of the Courts, it is still open to the

                      appointing authority to prescribe the mode of study for appointment as

                      faculty members and this Court does not see any bar on the power of the

                      appointing authority in laying down the requirement. Thus the

                      postgraduate degree obtained through distance education mode or

                      through correspondence may not be valid enough for appointment as

                      faculty in the pre law courses.

<p id="p_190">                            100    The other crucial aspect is the cross major degrees. This

                      aspect is more serious than the earlier one.       When the Notification

                      prescribed postgraduate degree in the relevant subject as the minimum

                      qualification, it is to be implicitly understood that the undergraduate

                      degree should also be in the same subject as that of the postgraduate

                      degree.     Mr.G.Sankaran, learned counsel appearing for some of the

                      candidates who are in possession of cross major degrees contended that

                      what is prescribed in the subject Notifications or the Rules is only

                      postgraduate degree in the relevant subject and that requirement is

                      fulfilled by the candidates concerned. This Court considers the

                      submission as a specious argument. When a postgraduate degree is the

                      minimum qualification for a teaching faculty, obtaining only postgraduate

                      degree in the relevant subject and claiming eligibility on that account is a

                      clear attempt to hoodwink and get around the system due to lack of

                      clarity on the issue. This Court simply cannot comprehend the quality of

                      the teacher if he/she has two degrees in two different subjects and get

                      appointed as Assistant Professors for taking classes in major subjects like

                      Economics, Commerce, Technology, Business Administration, etc.

                      postgraduate degree alone in the relevant subject, cannot claim to have

                      the depth of knowledge as in the case of person studied both

                      undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the same subject.                 The

                      candidates with two degrees in different subjects at undergraduate and

                      postgraduate levels, could only said to be having fragmented knowledge

                      in two different subjects with no profound development of their cognitive

                      function in any particular subject. By all means, such candidates with

                      cross degrees ought to have been not included as eligible persons in the

                      Notification. It is unfortunate that such an important issue has not been

                      clarified in the Notifications. Whether the omission is deliberate or

                      inadvertent is again not clarified on behalf of the State Government. But,

                      in any event, the cross degrees obtained by the candidates, in the

                      considered view of this Court, cannot said to be a valid qualification and

                      hence, such of those candidates who have such cross major viz.,

                      undergraduate degree in different subject than the subject of study at the

                      postgraduate level are not to be considered as eligible for the subject

                      appointments. In order to save the existing standards and also to ensure

                      improvement in the standards of legal education in future, it must be

                      ensured that persons with degrees obtained through distance education

                      mode and with cross major degrees are to be declared as not qualified,

                      particularly in the total absence of any clarification or justification

                      emanating from the Government.

<p id="p_191">                            102    Further, when the Central Regulating Body prescribed the

                      postgraduate qualification in the relevant subjects, it is to be peremptorily

                      understood that degree at the undergraduate level ought to be in the same

                      subject.

                              103   Finally, coming back to the main challenge, when a

                      candidate is mandated to have two disjointed degrees, the adverse impact

                      of such insistence would not reflect on the quality and the depth of

                      knowledge of the candidate with such degrees. In all probability, the

                      degree holders in the relevant subject as well as in law, will suffer

                      deflection of their intellectual growth, lacking single dedicated direction.

<p id="p_193">                      They will also have the opportunity in pursuing two avenues of prospects

                      diluting their energy, focus and enthusiasm towards a particular

                      specialization. Only a focused specialization in a particular subject would

                      benefit the student community, as the purpose of education is to open the

                      windows of the minds as the saying goes. Moreover, the candidates with

                      two different qualifications are like a a proverbial jack of

                      all trades and Master of none. The job of a pedagogue is too important to

                      trifled with. It would be a travesty if persons with unsure academic

                      credentials are considered as qualified and eligible for appointment in

                      teaching posts, merely on the basis of the paper degrees obtained by

                      them.

                      no doubt authoritative pronouncements on various subjects like what is

                      arbitrariness,   the   concept   of legitimate expectation,        prospective

                      overruling, bar against negative equality and more importantly the power

                      of Courts in interfering in academic matters etc. But all the decisions are

                      to be held not applicable, as the Court eventually finds at the end of the

                      our quest that the action of the State authority which gave rise to the

                      controversy is a transgression of power vested, in terms of the scheme of
