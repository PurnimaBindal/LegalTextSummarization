(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE VIKASH JAIN)




</pre><p id="p_2">   1.         The instant Letters Patent Appeal ("LPA" for short) has been filed against the

   decision of the learned Single Judge dated 09.07.2009 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 2757 of

   2009, the text of which, as corrected on 17.07.2009 for a typographical mistake, stands

   as follows --
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "After having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
                      counsel representing the respondents it is not understood as to how
                      under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India this Court can
                      re-open certain issue or order of 1998 passed by a civil court which is
                      not subject matter of challenge. An I.A. has come to be filed only now
                      with a prayer that fraud has been played against the petitioner and
                      that should be the ground that every order passed thereafter should be
                      undone. This Court expresses inability to entertain such a prayer.

                      The I.A. as well as writ application is dismissed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                      Remedy lies before the appropriate court/forum and not before this
                      Court."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">

</blockquote><p id="p_3">   2.         The brief facts leading up to the present L.P.A. may be narrated hereafter.

</p><p id="p_4">   3.         As far back as 1967, the appellant's husband, Sri Lakshman Sharma, was

   allotted plot No. B-1 in Kankarbagh Colony, Patna. The adjacent plot No. B-5 was also

   purchased in 1971 by him for the benefit of their mentally retarded son. The appellant

   was later substituted in the place of her husband as nominee upon his death and was in

   quiet enjoyment and peaceful possession of the said two plots (aggregating to 5849

   sq.ft.) along with an extended area (1901 sq.ft.) in front of plot No. B-1 which was also

   allotted to the appellant by the Bank of Bihar Employees Co-operative House

   Construction Society Ltd. (respondent No. 5).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                               3</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">4.         The first seeds of dispute were sown when in March, 1987, the appellant's

husband, then alive, came to know that the two plots had been transferred on the basis

of some forged transfer letters in favour of one Shri Narendra Pratap Singh (respondent

No. 4) who had then taken possession of both plots. Such transfers were challenged vide

Case No. 124/1987 (plot No. B-1) and Case No. 123/1987 (plot No. B-5), before the

Registrar, Bihar Co-operative Societies, Patna.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.         Case No. 124/1987 relating to plot No. B-1 was decided in favour of the

appellant by order dated 18.09.1989 which, in turn, was also confirmed by this Court in

C.W.J.C. No. 9112/1989. The other Case No. 123/1987 relating to plot No. B-5 remained

pending for final disposal before the Joint Registrar, Bihar Co-operative Societies, Patna.

</p><p id="p_8">6.         It appears that sometime in 1990, a suit bearing T.M.S. No. 306/1990 was

instituted by the Union Bank of India (hereinafter, the "Bank") for realization of the loan

amount which had been sanctioned in favour of the partnership firm M/S Acmechem

Agency, comprising five equal partners including the appellant, her elder son (now

deceased), Smt. Sneh Singh (the wife of the respondent No. 4), and their two sons, Sri

Rajesh Pratap Singh and Sri Gyanesh Pratap Singh. Such loan had been advanced against

mortgage of certain immovable properties, some of which were in the names of Smt.

Sheh Singh as one of the partners of the firm with her husband as one of the guarantors,

while others were in the names of the appellant's husband with his close relatives as

guarantors.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.         On 24.09.1997, the entire agreed amount of Rs. 7.50 lacs against the Bank

loan was deposited with the bank and as such T.M.S. No. 306/1990 came to be settled

between the parties upon satisfaction of the loan.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.         In the meantime, respondent No. 4 had continued in illegal possession

despite the order passed in Case No. 124/1987. The appellant approached this Court in

C.W.J.C. No. 11700/1996 for recovery of possession of the plots. The writ petition was

allowed in November 1997, on the basis of which the appellant was finally able to

resume possession over plot No. B-1 along with the extended area in February, 1998,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                              4</span>




after a period of about 11 years of illegal possession by the respondent No. 4. Thereafter

she was able to remain in peaceful possession till about September 2003.

</p><p id="p_11">9.         It is stated that on 07.09.2003, the appellant came to learn from her tenants

that the possession over plot No. B-1 had once again been taken over by the respondent

No. 4 on the basis of some order said to have been passed in Execution Case No. 3/2001 in

pursuance of the aforesaid T.M.S. No. 306/1990. The appellant states that fraud was

committed by the respondent No. 4, when a petition was filed by him on 11.12.1997 in

T.M.S. No. 306/1990 for transposing himself as a plaintiff in place of the Bank, claiming

that the Bank's loan had been liquidated by him. This was done without any notice either

to the appellant or to the Bank. Moreover, the entire nature of the suit was sought to be

changed along with the prayer, party position etc. at the instance of the respondent No. 4.

</p><p id="p_12">10.        An order dated 26.02.1998 was thus obtained by the respondent No. 4 in

T.M.S. No. 306/1990 behind the appellant's back and the suit then proceeded ex-parte

thereafter, with the respondent No. 4 as the transposed co-plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_13">11.        In due course the T.M.S. No. 306/1990 came to be decreed on 16.08.2000 in

favour of the respondent No. 4, pursuant to which, the two plots were auctioned in

Execution Case No. 3/2001 and purchased by none other than the respondent No. 4

himself at what is alleged to be a throwaway price.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.        The appellant's objection petitions dated 03.09.2003 and 01.11.2004 filed

under Section 47 C.P.C. were dismissed on 23.04.2005 and 25.04.2005 respectively. A

fresh application was again filed on 17.08.2005 under Section 47 C.P.C. in view of the

liberty granted by this Court by its order dated 01.08.2005 in C.R. No. 937 of 2005 filed

against the earlier dismissal of the objection petitions, but was however also dismissed

on 16.12.2006 by the learned Sub Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.        This led the appellant to file the instant C.W.J.C. No. 2757 of 2007

purportedly under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, wherein she prayed for

quashing of the two orders, namely the order dated 26.02.1998 allowing the transposing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                                 5</span>




petition of the respondent No. 4, and the order dated 16.12.2006 passed in Execution

Case No. 3/2001, both by the learned Sub-Judge, Patna.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.           Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the order dated

26.02.1998 is unsustainable having been obtained by fraud. Consequently, the other

impugned order dated 16.12.2006 should therefore, also be held not sustainable on the

well settled principle that fraud negates all.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.           In support of her contention that the respondent No. 4 did indeed commit

fraud in obtaining the order dated 26.02.1998 from the Lower Court, the Appellant has

pointed out, among others, the following circumstances --
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (a)     It transpires on a perusal of the order sheet of the Lower Court that no notice

      appears to have been issued to the Appellant or the Bank in respect of the

      application for transposition filed by the Respondent No. 4.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (b)     The aforesaid application for transposition appears to have been taken up

      for consideration and has been disposed of behind the Appellant's back.


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (c)     The entire nature of the suit was changed at the instance of the respondent

      No. 4 by his application dated 11.12.1997 when he sought transposition of his name

      as plaintiff.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (d)     The party position was changed in the suit, and the names of the wife and

      two sons of the Respondent No. 4 were deleted as defendants pursuant to the order

      dated 09.09.1998 passed on his amendment petition, which was also heard and

      allowed without due notice to the Appellant.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (e)     The Respondent No. 4 claimed to have liquidated the entire amount of the

      Bank loan agreed upon to enable himself to be transposed as plaintiff, whereas the

      Appellant has consistently been claiming that the loan had been repaid jointly by all

      the partners of the firm.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                                  6</span><blockquote id="blockquote_11">




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (f)    Plot No. B-5 could not possibly have been auctioned during the pendency of

      Case No.123/1987 before the Joint Registrar, Bihar Co-operative Societies, and more

      so, without any prior notice to the appellant.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      (g)    The said plot No. B-5 could not have been alienated without the Court's

      permission, the same having been purchased for the benefit of the appellant's

      retarded son, which fact was well within the knowledge of the respondent No. 4 but

      had deliberately been suppressed by him.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      (h)    The extended area of 1901 sq.ft. in front of plot No. B-1 never formed part of

      any of the sale deeds mortgaged with the Bank, and the same had thus even ex-facie

      been fraudulently auctioned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">
</blockquote><p id="p_18">16.          Learned counsel for the appellant has placed strong reliance on <a href="/doc/1326950/" id="a_2">Section 44</a> of

the Evidence Act to submit that the order dated 26.02.1998 allowing transposition had

been obtained by fraud, and inasmuch as all actions tainted by fraud are vitiated, any

order passed or acts done in pursuance thereof have equally to be declared infirm and of

no consequence.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.          The respondent No. 4 has appeared and has been heard. He has restricted

the main plank of his attack only to the preliminary ground of maintainability of the

L.P.A. itself. He submits that no L.P.A. is maintainable against a decision of the learned

Single Judge passed in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India

and as such the present L.P.A. has necessarily to be dismissed. Learned counsel for the

respondent No. 4 has chosen not to travel into nor dispute the merits of the matter.

</p><p id="p_20">18.          We have heard the learned counsels for both the parties at length and also

gone through the materials available on records. In view of the complexities involved,

we called for the entire original records of the learned Lower Court and have examined

the same in extenso.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19.          It is necessary at the outset itself to deal with the objection of the respondent

No. 4 as regards maintainability of the L.P.A. against the decision of the learned Single
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                             7</span>




Judge passed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India. In this regard, Clause 10 of

the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court may be reproduced hereunder for the sake of

convenience and ready reference:
</p>
<p id="p_22">"10. Appeal to the High Court from Judges of the Court.--And We do further ordain that an
appeal shall lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Patna from the judgment (not being
a judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order
made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendence of
the said High Court, and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction
and not being a sentence or order passed or made in the exercise of the power of
superintendence under the provisions of Section 107 of the Government of India Act or in
the exercise of criminal jurisdiction) of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of
any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India Act, and that
notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided an appeal shall lie to the said High Court
from a judgment of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court,
pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India Act made on or after the first day of
February one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine in the exercise of appellate
jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction
by a court subject to the superintendence of the said High Court, where the Judge who
passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for appeal; but that the right of
appeal from other judgments of Judges of the said High Court or of such Division Court
shall be to Us, Our heirs or successors in Our or Their Privy Council, as hereinafter
provided."
</p>
<p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">20.        The question whether or not an LPA is maintainable against the judgment of

a Single Judge of the High Court now stands covered by the unequivocal pronouncement

of the Apex Court in Umaji Keshao Meshram &amp; Ors. Vs Radhikabai &amp; Anr. [1986 Supp.

SCC 401]. In that case, the Court was seized of the specific question as to whether an

appeal lies under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court (which is in

pari materia with clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court) to a Division

Bench of two Judges from the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a>

or 227 of the Constitution. In a well considered and detailed judgment tracing the

history of Letters Patent in our country and after considering the various judicial

decisions available on the issue under consideration, the Apex Court concluded that an

intra-court appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge in a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article

226</a> is not barred but however, no such intra-court appeal could be maintained against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                               8</span>




the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_7">Article 227</a> by reason of such appeal

being specially barred under Letters Patent (para 104 of the judgment).

</p><p id="p_25">21.         The aforesaid decision in Umaji's case has since been consistently followed

among the more recent line of such decisions. Reference may be made to <a href="/doc/1673900/" id="a_8">Ramesh

Chandra Sankla &amp; Ors. vs Vikram Cement &amp; Ors</a>. [(2008) 14 SCC 58]; <a href="/doc/1668065/" id="a_9">Shalini Shyam

Shetty &amp; Anr. vs Rajendra Shankar Patil</a> [(2010) 8 SCC 329]; and <a href="/doc/1156516/" id="a_10">Ashok K. Jha &amp; Ors vs

Garden Silk Mills Ltd &amp; Anr</a>. [(2009) 10 SCC 584].
</p>
<p id="p_26">


</p><p id="p_27">22.         While on this aspect, the very latest decision in <a href="/doc/1851595/" id="a_11">Fuerst Day Lawson Limited

vs Jindal Exports Limited</a> [(2011) 8 SCC 33] may also be touched upon and the

observation in para 36 (iv) of the judgment as follows be taken note of.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">            "If the pronouncement of the Single Judge qualifies as a "judgment", in the
            absence of any bar created by a statute either expressly or by necessary
            implication, it would be subject to appeal under the relevant clause of the
            Letters Patent of the High Court."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">


</blockquote><p id="p_28">The apparent divergence in view in the said case from the one taken in Umaji's case is

but illusory. A closer look at the facts and law involved in this decision shows that these

differed from the earlier cases and that the above observation was made in a different

context altogether. This was a case involving a statutory appeal under the provisions of

the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_12">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 against the decision of a Single Judge

rendered under that Act and the Court was not dealing with an application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_13">Article

227</a> of the Constitution. The main question for consideration of the Court was whether a

Letters Patent Appeal would be available regardless of the fact that no appeal was

provided under the statute itself. This decision was rendered in a completely different

setting which is distinguishable, and thus cannot be construed as a departure from the

ratio of Umaji's case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                                              9</span><p id="p_29">




</p><p id="p_30">23.        The instant matter however, requires to be looked at from another angle

altogether. The core issue to be considered is with regard to the true nature and

character of the application filed before the learned Single Judge and to ascertain

whether the same had been filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_14">Article 227</a>, or whether the same was in fact a

writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> filed under a wrong nomenclature.

</p><p id="p_31">24.        It is well settled that the true nature of the order passed by the Single Judge

has to be ascertained. A right of appeal against such judgment cannot be taken away by

the mere statement that power has been exercised under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_16">Article 227</a> if power is

otherwise found to have been exercised under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a>, as held in Ashok K. Jha &amp; Ors

Vs Garden Silk Mills Ltd &amp; Anr. [(2009) 10 SCC 584] --
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">              "The vital factor for determination of maintainability of the intra-court
              appeal is the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the party and the true nature
              of the principal order passed by the Single Judge."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">25.        Again, on the principles laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_18">M.M.T.C. Limited vs

Commissioner of Commercial Tax &amp; Ors</a>. [(2009) 1 SCC 8], it would not be proper to

proceed merely upon the cause title or nomenclature of the writ petition described as

being one under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_19">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. The real nature of controversy and the

prayer involved must also be examined in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the

application filed before the Single Judge indeed fell under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> or under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_21">Article

227</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_33">26.        Yet again upon a review of the various decisions on the subject, we find that

the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1465494/" id="a_22">State of Madhya Pradesh vs Visan Kumar Shiv Charan Lal</a> [(2008) 15

SCC 233], accepted the argument that nomenclature is of no consequence and that it was

the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the

Article which is applicable. The case therein was thus treated as falling under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a>

rather than under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_24">Article 227</a>, thereby concluding that the High Court had not been

justified in holding the letters patent appeal as not maintainable. The writ appeal was

accordingly directed to be heard by a Division Bench on merits.

</p><p id="p_34">27.           On a perusal of the writ petition and the order passed thereon in the instant

case, the emerging facts lead us to take the view that the true nature and character of the

petition filed is relatable to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a>, rather than to <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_26">Article 227.</a> The following aspects

of the matter are particularly noteworthy --
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      (a)     The application has been filed under the civil writ jurisdiction of this Court

      and duly registered as a civil writ jurisdiction case (C.W.J.C.). This is prima-facie

      relatable to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> inasmuch as an application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_28">Article 227</a> cannot be

      termed as a writ petition, as clearly held in Shalini Shyam Shetty's case [(2010) 8 SCC

      329].
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      (b)     Each of the reliefs claimed is for quashing of certain orders and for directions

      to release certain excess area of land and for obtaining possession over the two

      plots, and all of these are in the nature of reliefs which a Court ordinarily grants by

      issuance of writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226.</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      (c)     No prayer was made in the Writ Petition inviting the Court to exercise its

      supervisory jurisdiction over the action of the Lower Court. There is thus nothing to

      suggest that this Court was called upon to ascertain whether the Lower Court had

      acted in any manner outside the bounds of its authority, which is the hallmark of its

      supervisory powers under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_30">Article 227.</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      (d)     The body of the order dated 09.07.2009 passed by the Learned Single Judge

      mentions both Articles 226 and 227, which clearly shows that he was considering

      the matter under both the Articles. His observation with regard to filing of an

      Interlocutory Application in course of the proceedings which was being heard in its

      'writ' jurisdiction, as well as the dismissal of the petition as a 'writ' application, all go

      to show that he has passed orders on a writ petition, thus under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226.</a>




</blockquote><p id="p_35">28.           At this juncture, the observations of the Supreme Court in para 107 in

Umaji's case (supra) may fruitfully be reproduced --
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                                              11</span><p id="p_36">




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "In our opinion, where the facts justify a party in filing an application either under
      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> or 227 of the Constitution, and the party chooses to file his application
      under both these articles, in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to
      deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as
      being made under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a>, and if in deciding the matter, in the final order the court
      gives ancillary directions which may pertain to <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_34">Article 227</a>, this ought not to be held to
      deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent where the
      substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226."</a>




</blockquote><p id="p_37">29.           The above quoted passage carries the clear pronouncement that if remedy is

available under either <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> or 227 and a petition is filed citing both Articles 226

and 227, benefit ought to enure, as far as possible, in favour of maintaining an intra-

court appeal by construing such petition to have been filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Article 226</a> if it is so in

letter and spirit, rather than disentitling a person from the remedy of appeal.

</p><p id="p_38">30.           There can be no difficulty in applying the same principle in respect of an

application filed under the nomenclature of <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_38">Article 227</a> alone, where the true nature and

character thereof is found to fall under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Article 226.</a> For the reasons already stated

hereinabove, therefore, we treat the petition filed by the Appellant as being under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226</a> and the present LPA is accordingly maintainable.

</p><p id="p_39">31.           On merits, we find considerable force in the submissions of learned counsel

appearing for the appellant. The facts and circumstances adverted to are indeed

suggestive of at least a prima facie case of fraud having been committed by the

respondent No. 4, strengthened further by his repeated attempts at securing control

over the Appellant's property. The trials and tribulations faced by the hapless widow of

advancing years has even found narration in the judgment of this Court passed earlier in

CWJC No. 11700/1996 aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_40">32.           We are also entirely mindful of the well recognized doctrine that fraud

unravels everything, as we are of the pristine maxim "fraus et jus nunquam cohabitant",

that is, fraud and justice never dwell together, revisited in <a href="/doc/1329151/" id="a_41">Meghmala vs. G. Narasimha

Reddy</a> [(2010) 8 SCC 383].
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                                            12</span><p id="p_41">




</p><p id="p_42">33.         In our view, therefore, the objections u/s 47 CPC filed by the appellant on

17.08.2005 before the learned Sub Judge raising the plea of fraud ought not to have been

dismissed as perfunctorily done in his order dated 16.12.2006 on the footing that

nothing new had been brought on records by the Appellant, without however

appreciating that the earlier petition u/s 47 CPC was dismissed as the same was not

maintainable owing to various defects therein. More crucially, the Learned Sub-Judge did

not at all record a finding on the main contentions relating to fraud having been

committed upon the Appellant and nor those in respect of the failure of Natural Justice.

</p><p id="p_43">34.         As regards the impugned order of the Learned Single Judge, it appears to us

that he inadvertently and through oversight observed that the appellant came to raise an

objection based on fraud only in an Interlocutory Application filed during the pendency

of the writ proceedings. A perusal of para 25 of the writ petition, however, clearly

discloses that the appellant had duly raised her objection on the ground of fraud and

suppression very specifically therein itself.
</p>
<p id="p_44">35.         Moreover, while correcting the error in the year earlier written as 1996 in

place of the correct year 1998 as merely being a typographical mistake, the learned

Single Judge has however failed to appreciate the effect of such correction. Inasmuch as

the appellant had in fact challenged the order of 1998, to that extent the order of the

Learned Single Judge has been rendered contrary to the facts on record.

</p><p id="p_45">36.         We cannot, however, also lose sight of the fact that the appellant has chosen

to challenge only the two orders of the Lower Court dated 26.02.1998 and 16.12.2006,

without however questioning the decree dated 27.06.2000 itself passed in T.M.S. No.

306/1990. The pre-decree order dated 26.02.1998 bore an interlocutory character

which ceased with the passing of the decree, whereas the post-decree order dated

16.12.2006 cannot be faulted so long as the decree itself remained unchallenged, having

thus attaining finality.
</p>
<p id="p_46">37.         Taking the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, therefore, we are of

the view that the ends of justice will adequately be met if the impugned judgment of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                                                       13</span>




         learned Single Judge is set aside together with the order dated 16.12.2006 passed in

         Execution Case No. 3/2001, and the matter remanded to the file of the Learned Sub

         Judge IV, Patna, to reconsider the appellant's objection dated 17.08.2006 filed u/s 47 of

         the C.P.C. afresh, and pass such orders thereon on merits as may be deemed appropriate

         in accordance with law, after granting an opportunity of hearing to all the parties

         concerned.

<p id="p_47">         38.             The Registry is directed to return the original records to the Learned Lower

         Court immediately.
