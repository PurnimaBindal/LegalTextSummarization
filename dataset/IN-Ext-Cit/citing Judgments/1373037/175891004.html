Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.2403 of

1995.        The appellants are original respondent Nos.5 to 9

in Writ Petition.                    Respondent Nos.1 and 2 are respondent

Nos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition.                            Respondent Nos.5A to 5E

are original petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.               The facts involved in this appeal are that the

original petitioner had filed Return under Section 12 of

the Maharashtra Agricultural Land (Ceiling on Holdings)

Act, 1961.             He has shown 84 Acres and 32 Gunthas of land

and      seven        members         in    his       family.    The      Surplus           Land

Determination               Tribunal        ("SLDT",      for    short)         disallowed

the claim of the mother and declared the petitioner as

surplus holder to the extent of 18 Acres and 23 Gunthas.

Being        aggrieved           by    that      order,    the     petitioner             filed

appeal         before         the     Maharashtra         Revenue       Tribunal            (for

short, "M.R.T.").                    The M.R.T. Dismissed the said appeal

in the year 1976. The stay application filed by the

petitioner before the M.R.T. was also rejected before

dismissal of the appeal.                      Petitioner had then filed Writ

Petition No.2528/1976 at Bombay.                             Initially, stay was

granted.              In      the     year    1997,       the    Tahsildar            ordered

distributing               the       said    surplus      land     to     the       original

respondent              Nos.5         to    9.        Thereafter,        the        original

petitioner filed Writ Petition No.2403/1995 before the

learned Single Judge of this Court, to set aside the

order passed by the M.R.T. and SLDT.                        That writ petition

was allowed on 27th June, 2011 and the order passed by

the SLDT and order of allotment/disbursement of surplus

land passed by original respondent Nos.2 and 3 dated 20 th

April, 1987 and the judgment and order passed by M.R.T.

were set aside and it was declared that petitioner is

not surplus holder.                        Against that order, the present

Letters Patent Appeal is filed.

Appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submits that

though writ petition was filed against the order passed

by      the       M.R.T.,            the   learned    Single        Judge         invoked

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India and therefore, against the order passed by the

Single Judge, Letters Patent Appeal is tenable under

Clause 15 of the Letters Patent of High Court.

through the contents of writ petition and nature of the

clear that the learned Single Judge invoked supervisory

jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the

Constitution             of         India    and       therefore,          Letters          Patent

Appeal is not tenable.

                                                  15                               LPA248-2011

after       going        through         the    order       passed      by     the      learned

Single Judge, it emerges that the learned Single Judge

has considered the correctness of orders passed by the

SLDT and M.R.T., holding that the petitioner is surplus

holder of the land to the extent of 18 Acres 23 Gunthas.

The      learned         Single         Judge    found      that      SLDT       and      M.R.T.

disallowed the share of the mother in the agricultural

land held by the family of the petitioner.                                      Even though

objection regarding delay in filing Writ Petition has

been considered by the learned Single Judge, holding

that         the        delay          is      properly       explained.              Due        to

communication                gap       between        the     petitioner             and        his

counsel.           Before the subordinate Authorities, the M.R.T.

and before the High court, full opportunity of hearing

was      given       to      the      parties.         Therefore,          there        was      no

violation of principles of natural justice.                                     As observed

above,        SLDT       and         M.R.T.    acted    within        four       corners         of

their        respective               jurisdiction          and    even        it      is      not

contention             of       the      original       petitioner             that         these

Authorities               exceeded          their      jurisdiction.               Thus,         as

observed, there is no jurisdictional error while passing

the impugned order.                     The nature of the order passed by

the learned Single Judge is sufficient to hold that the

learned         Single         Judge        invoked     supervisory           jurisdiction
