<p id="p_4">     2.            The petitioners in all the writ petitions have challenged




                                                 
     the order passed by the learned Member of the Industrial Court,

     Thane in the complaint filed by the complainants under the

     Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair




                                                
     Labour Practices Act, 1971. The Corporation has challenged the

     order in so far as it allows the complaint filed by the workers




                                    
     granting them permanency and the benefits of permanency and

     all   other
                      
                    consequential    benefits    arising       therefrom.          The

     complainants have challenged the said order in so far as the
                     
     reliefs granted are only with effect from the date of the filing of

     the complaint.
</p>      

<p id="p_5">     The Complaint :
</p>   



<p id="p_6">     3.            The complainants filed the complaint under sections

     28 and 30 read with items 5, 6, 9 and 10 of Schedule IV of the

     Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair





     Labour Practices Act, 1971. They sought a declaration that the

     Corporation had engaged in and was engaging in unfair labour





     practices as defined under the said provisions and an order

     directing them to cease and desist from doing so and to confer

     upon them the status of permanency and benefits and privileges

     thereof. As consequential reliefs they sought a declaration that

     they are the permanent employees of the Corporation and an

     order   directing    the   Corporation     not    to    discontinue          their

     employment.
</p>



                                               
<p id="p_7">     4.          The complaint alleged that the complainants had been

     in the employment of the Corporation since 1997; that they had in

     response to an advertisement issued by the Corporation under the




                                              
     signature of the Commissioner applied for employment and that

     they were accordingly appointed pursuant to and in accordance




                                   
     with the advertisement. The complaint states that their service
                      
     conditions are governed by various settlements under the

     provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and the Model Standing
                     
     Orders framed under the <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_2">Industrial Employment (Standing Orders)

     Act</a>, 1946 in its application to the State of Maharashtra. It is
      

     alleged that though the complainants are appointed on a
   



     temporary basis the nature of their work is permanent and

     perennial in nature and that they are entitled for permanency as

     the posts in which they are appointed are sanctioned posts. It is





     also   averred   that   even   assuming    that     the     workmen          are

     discharging the work which is of temporary nature they are





     entitled to permanency by virtue of Model Standing Order 4C. It is

     further   alleged   that the complainants had entered                  into a

     settlement with the union whereby an employee who is appointed

     on a temporary basis is entitled for permanency after completion

     of five years of employment. The complainants alleged that they

     had completed 240 days or more in any preceding 12 calendar




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:41 :::</span>

     months. The Corporation not having granted them permanency




                                              
     despite these facts is, according to them, guilty of unfair labour

     practices as alleged. The workers have averred that all the posts

     on which they have been appointed have been sanctioned by the




                                             
     state   government.     Therefore,    according        to     them        their

     engagement on a temporary basis itself indicates that they were




                                  
     intentionally kept as     temporary with the sole intention of
                    
     depriving them the benefits, privileges and status of permanent

     employees. For that reason too it is alleged that the Corporation
                   
     had engaged in unfair labour practices under item 6 of schedule IV

     of the MRTU and PULP Act.

<p id="p_8">     The Corporation's written statement :
</p>   



<p id="p_9">     5.          The Corporation in its Written Statement denied all the

     averments and submissions in the complaint. The Corporation

     challenged the jurisdiction of the industrial court constituted under





     the MRTU &amp; PULP Act. It is contended that the the Corporation is

     established by the Government of Maharashtra under the Bombay





     Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 (hereinafter referred to

     as the BPMC Act); that they had to carry on their affairs within the

     framework laid down under this Act and as per the orders,

     guidelines or directives issued by the Government of Maharashtra

     from time to time; that as per the provisions of the BPMC Act

     every corporation may make rules prescribing qualifications

     required for each post and the procedure for recruitment in




                                             
     respect thereof; that they had made draft rules and sent the same

     for approval to the State Government; that the State Government

     raised various queries and directed them to rectify the same and




                                            
     that the respondents withdrew those rules with an intention to

     resubmit fresh/modified rules. It is submitted that permanent




                                 
     appointments can be made only on the posts approved by the
                      
     government; that they sent the establishment personnel schedule

     for sanction to the State Government on 30.5.1997 and the same
                     
     was sanctioned on 9.12.1999. Thus the appointments of the said

     workmen were not based on the sanctioned establishment
      

     schedule   and   their   appointments   were       made        purely       on
   



     temporary/ad hoc basis without following the due process as

     prescribed by the BPMC Act and the rules made thereunder as

     applicable to the Corporation. Moreover, it was submitted, that as





     per the report of the Jha Committee, personnel expenses of the

     Corporations are not to be more than 35% but that as of date this





     limit has been exceeded by the Corporations. It is submitted that

     as and when the Corporation finds that there is permanent

     increase in the work and/or posts are sanctioned by the

     government the same are filled up by recruitment and/or

     promotions as per the recruitment policy, reservation policy,

     roster, recruitment/selection procedure and merit-cum-seniority.

<p id="p_10">     The corporation then publishes an advertisement giving details of




                                              
     the vacancies to be filled up for permanent positions setting out

     therein the requirements as per the recruitment policy. Eligible

     candidates are accordingly appointed after following the entire




                                             
     procedure. In the case of the present workmen it is alleged that

     the procedure was not followed and that they were recruited and




                                 
     appointed only on a temporary and an ad-hoc basis. It is averred
                      
     that under the provisions of the BPMC Act the Commissioner does

     not have power to appoint a person for a period exceeding six
                     
     months. The Commissioner has to prepare an establishment

     schedule from time to time which has to be submitted to the
      

     standing committee and the Corporation for approval. The
   



     establishment schedule has thereafter to be sanctioned by the

     State Government. The appointments for the various posts are

     also required to be approved by the Corporation.
</p>




<p id="p_11">     6.         It appears that the respondents noticed various

     irregularities and illegalities in the matter of appointments to





     various posts. The government accordingly issued an order dated

     1.1.1998 directing that the appointments made in violation of the

     provisions of the BPMC Act should not continue in excess of six

     months.    The    respondents       accordingly       scrutinized           the

     appointments made.

<p id="p_12">                According to the Corporation the employees have

     purely on a temporary basis. Their last appointments from

     18.7.2006 to 17.1.2007 were again for the fixed period of six

     months on a temporary ad-hoc basis as Kamgars. The same was




                                                       
     renewed from 20.1.2007 to 19.7.2007. In the year 1997, the

     Corporation gave a notice affixed on the notice board which did




                                         
     not mention the post of Kamgar or garden worker (Bag kamgar).
</p>                       
<p id="p_13">     One post in this notice was mentioned as the post of workman

     (helper-cum-gardener) at serial No.35 with a specified pay scale.
</p>                      
<p id="p_14">     The notice did not mention the post of                     Kamgar. The notice

     mentioned the post of workman. It was therefore contended on
      

     behalf of the Corporation that the post was only for helper. A few
   



     of the workmen are stated to have been appointed as gardening

     workmen      (Bagkam        Kamgars)       from        23.5.1997      purely      on     a

     temporary ad-hoc basis for the period of one month as stipulated





     in   the    appointment           orders       dated     23.5.1997.        Thus        the

     appointments of these particular workers have nothing to do with





     the said notice. Sixteen other complainants had been appointed

     since the beginning as Kamgars only i.e. to a post not mentioned

     in   the   said   notice.    It    was     contended        therefore        that      the

     complainants had failed to show any connection between their

     appointments and the said notice. The appointments, therefore, it

     was further contended, were not in accordance with the statutory

     employees had applied for the post of workers in response to an

     advertisement published in a local newspaper on 28.5.1997. It is
                    
     pertinent to note at this stage that the appointment of these

     they were appointed on permanent sanctioned posts; that each of

     were therefore entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the

     M.S.O. 4-C by which the Corporation is governed. It is alleged that

     that some of the employees were initially employed as labourers

     perusing the newspaper advertisement dated 28.5.1997 and the





     notice, admitted that the same did not mention the post of

     Bagkam Kamgar but that it mentioned at serial No.35 "helper





     gardner". He further stated that as per the appointment order

     dated 23.5.1997, some of the workmen were appointed as helper

     gardner, whereas each of the others were appointed as a

               appointment, to all the said complainants every
               year by giving one day break. It is correct to say

     that before making an appointment to any post referred to in Rule




                                                         
     1, which includes the said posts, applications shall be invited by

     advertisements in the local newspapers. The complaint merely

     states in paragraph 3(iii) that the complainants had been




                                                        
     appointed   by    virtue    of      the    advertisement           issued       by     the

     Corporation. There are no particulars as to the advertisement. In




                                         
     his examination-in-chief, the complainants' witness stated that the

     employees    had
                       igapplied        for    the     post     in    response         to    an

     advertisement dated 28.5.1997.
</p>                     
<p id="p_68">                 This however, as Mr.Rao rightly pointed out, could not

     have been so as the said workmen had been appointed prior
      

     thereto viz. on 23.5.1997. The appointment orders were prior to
   



     the date of the advertisement viz. 28.5.1997 and that therefore, it

     cannot be stated that the said workmen                      had been employed

     pursuant to the said advertisement.
</p>




<p id="p_69">     18.         Faced    with         this,    it    was     contended           that      the

     advertisement dated 28.5.1997 was actually only reissued and





     that the advertisements inviting the applications were issued even

     prior thereto. This contention was sought to be supported on the

     basis of a news item on the same page as the advertisement to

     this effect. It was also contended that this case was not put to the

     complainants     witness.    It     was        further   submitted         that      even

     assuming the argument to be correct, it would at the highest

     indicate that the first letter of appointment was not pursuant to




                                              
     the advertisement. Admittedly, thereafter for ten years fresh

     letters of appointment albeit for six months each had been issued

     with a break of one day between each of them.
</p>



                                             
<p id="p_70">     19.           Even assuming this to be so, it would not advance the

     complainants case for in any event the appointments being on a




                                    
     temporary basis, could not have been for more than a period of
                      
     six months in view of the provisions of Section 53 of the B.P.M.C.
</p>
<p id="p_71">     Act. In view of the above provisions of the B.P.M.C. Act, a
                     
     temporary appointment could not be for more than six months.
</p>
<p id="p_72">     Any extension beyond the period therefore would be void. Even if
      

     each appointment is considered to be a fresh appointment, it
   



     would   not    support   the   complainants   case     for    every       such

     appointment is then merely on a temporary basis.
</p>
<p id="p_73">     20.           The appointments could never be considered valid on





     a regular basis for every appointment must be made not merely

     pursuant to an advertisement but also in accordance with the





     other provisions    of the B.P.M.C. Act set out above, especially

     <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_22">Section 54</a> read with Chapter-III of Schedule-D. There was no Staff

     Selection Committee. The question therefore of the selection of

     the complainants being as per the manner prescribed in the rules

     made by the Staff Selection Committee does not arise. The

     appointment orders were not given by the Corporation but by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:42 :::</span>

     recommended by the Employment Exchange.
</p>
<p id="p_74">     21.           The effect of such appointments on the claim for

     sanction to the State Government only on 30.5.1997 and the same

     was sanctioned thereafter on 9.12.1999. Thus when the said

     employees were appointed i.e. before 9.12.1999, there were no

     sanctioned posts, as the provisions               of <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_23">Section 51</a> had not even

     been implemented. All that the cross-examination establishes is

     earlier, the Corporation has in fact denied even the existence of

                adhered to and the constitutional scheme of
                public employment is bypassed. The Union, the




                                           
                States, their departments and instrumentalities
                have     resorted   to   irregular   appointments,
                especially in the lower rungs of the service,
                without reference to the duty to ensure a proper
                appointment procedure through the Public




                                
                Service Commissions or otherwise as per the
                rules adopted and to permit these irregular
                   
                appointees or those appointed on contract or on
                daily wages, to continue year after year, thus,
                keeping out those who are qualified to apply for
                  
                the post concerned and depriving them of an
                opportunity to compete for the post. It has also
                led to persons who get employed, without the
                following of a regular procedure or even through
                the backdoor or on daily wages, approaching the
      

                courts, seeking directions to make them
                permanent in their posts and to prevent regular
   



                recruitment to the posts concerned. The courts
                have not always kept the legal aspects in mind
                and have occasionally even stayed the regular
                process of employment being set in motion and in
                some cases, even directed that these illegal,





                irregular or improper entrants be absorbed into
                service. A class of employment which can only be
                called "litigious employment", has risen like a
                phoenix seriously impairing the constitutional
                scheme. Such orders are passed apparently in





                exercise of the wide powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of
                the Constitution. Whether the wide powers under
                <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> of the Constitution are intended to be
                used for a purpose certain to defeat the concept
                of social justice and equal opportunity for all,
                subject to affirmative action in the matter of
                public employment as recognised by our
                Constitution, has to be seriously pondered over. It
                is time, that the courts desist from issuing orders
                preventing regular selection or recruitment at the
                instance of such persons and from issuing

       secured regular appointments as per procedure

       continuance      tends   to    defeat    the     very
       constitutional scheme of public employment. It
       has to be emphasised that this is not the role
       envisaged for the High Courts in the scheme of




                                   
       things and their wide powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a> of

       the    purpose     of   perpetuating     illegalities,
       irregularities or improprieties or for scuttling the
       whole scheme of public employment. Its role as




                        
       the sentinel and as the guardian of equal rights
       protection should not be forgotten.
</blockquote>          
<p id="p_88">      12.         In spite of this scheme, there may be
      occasions when the sovereign State or its
      instrumentalities will have to employ persons, in
         
      posts which are temporary, on daily wages, as
      additional hands or taking them in without
      following the required procedure, to discharge the
      duties in respect of the posts that are sanctioned
      and that are required to be filled in terms of the
      


      relevant     procedure     established      by    the
      Constitution or for work in temporary posts or
   



      projects that are not needed permanently. This
      right of the Union or of the State Government
      cannot but be recognised and there is nothing in
      the Constitution which prohibits such engaging of





      persons temporarily or on daily wages, to meet
      the needs of the situation. But the fact that such
      engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to
      defeat the very scheme of public employment.
      Nor can a court say that the Union or the State
      Governments do not have the right to engage





      persons in various capacities for a duration or
      until the work in a particular project is completed.
      Once this right of the Government is recognised
      and     the   mandate      of   the    constitutional
      requirement for public employment is respected,
      there cannot be much difficulty in coming to the
      conclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for the
      Courts whether acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the
      Constitution or under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_30">Article 32</a> of the

      employment of those who have been engaged
      without following a due process of selection as




                                  
      envisaged by the constitutional scheme.
</p><p id="p_89">      13.          What is sought to be pitted against
      this approach, is the so-called equity arising out
      of    giving   of    temporary    employment      or
      engagement on daily wages and the continuance




                                 
      of such persons in the engaged work for a certain
      length of time. Such considerations can have only
      a limited role to play, when every qualified citizen
      has a right to apply for appointment, the adoption




                       
      of the concept of rule of law and the scheme of
      the Constitution for appointment to posts. It
      cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of
         
      the courts to ignore, encourage or approve
      appointments made or engagements given
      outside the constitutional scheme. In effect,
        
      orders based on such sentiments or approach
      would result in perpetuating illegalities and in the
      jettisoning of the scheme of public employment
      adopted by us while adopting the Constitution.
      The approving of such acts also results in
      


      depriving many of their opportunity to compete
      for public employment. We have, therefore, to
   



      consider the question objectively and based on
      the constitutional and statutory provisions. In this
      context, we have also to bear in mind the
      exposition of law by a Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/560061/" id="a_31">State





      of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh</a>. It was held therein:
      (SCR pp. 971-72)
      "In our opinion where a government servant has
      no right to a post or to a particular status, though
      an authority under the Government acting beyond
      its competence had purported to give that person





      a status which it was not entitled to give he will
      not in law be deemed to have been validly
      appointed to the post or given the particular
      status."
</p><p id="p_90">      43.         Thus, it is clear that adherence to the
      rule of equality in public employment is a basic
      feature of our Constitution and since the rule of
      law is the core of our Constitution, a court would
      certainly be disabled from passing an order




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:42 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                            29</span>




                                                           
      upholding a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_32">Article 14</a> or in ordering
      the overlooking of the need to comply with the




                                   
      requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Article 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_34">Article 16</a> of
      the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the
      scheme for public employment, this Court while
      laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that
      unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant




                                  
      rules and after a proper competition among
      qualified persons, the same would not confer any
      right on the appointee. If it is a contractual
      appointment, the appointment comes to an end at
      the end of the contract, if it were an engagement




                       
      or appointment on daily wages or casual basis,
      the same would come to an end when it is
         
      discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee
      could not claim to be made permanent on the
      expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to
        
      be clarified that merely because a temporary
      employee or a casual wage worker is continued
      for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he
      would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular
      service or made permanent, merely on the
      

      strength of such continuance, if the original
      appointment was not made by following a due
   



      process of selection as envisaged by the relevant
      rules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular
      recruitment at the instance of temporary
      employees whose period of employment has
      come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by





      the very nature of their appointment, do not
      acquire any right. The High Courts acting under
      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, should not
      ordinarily     issue   directions   for   absorption,
      regularisation, or permanent continuance unless





      the recruitment itself was made regularly and in
      terms of the constitutional scheme. ................
</p>

<p id="p_91">      45.         While directing that appointments,
      temporary or casual, be regularised or made
      permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that
      the person concerned has worked for some time
      and in some cases for a considerable length of
      time. It is not as if the person who accepts an

      is not aware of the nature of his employment. He
      accepts the employment with open eyes. It may




                                   
      be true that he is not in a position to bargain - not
      at arms length -- since he might have been
      searching for some employment so as to eke out
      his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But
      on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate




                                  
      to jettison the constitutional          scheme     of
      appointment and to take the view that a person
      who has temporarily or casually got employed
      should be directed to be continued permanently.
      By doing so, it will be creating another mode of




                       
      public appointment which is not permissible. If
      the court were to void a contractual employment
         
      of this nature on the ground that the parties were
      not having equal bargaining power, that too
      would not enable the court to grant any relief to
        
      that employee. A total embargo on such casual or
      temporary employment is not possible, given the
      exigencies of administration and if imposed,
      would only mean that some people who at least
      get employment temporarily, contractually or
      

      casually, would not be getting even that
      employment when securing of such employment
   



      brings at least some succour to them. After all,
      innumerable citizens of our vast country are in
      search of employment and one is not compelled
      to accept a casual or temporary employment if
      one is not inclined to go in for such an





      employment. It is in that context that one has to
      proceed on the basis that the employment was
      accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the
      consequences flowing from it. In other words,
      even while accepting the employment, the person





      concerned knows the nature of his employment. It
      is not an appointment to a post in the real sense
      of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post
      in which he is temporarily employed or the
      interest in that post cannot be considered to be of
      such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of
      the procedure established, for making regular
      appointments to available posts in the services of
      the State. The argument that since one has been
      working for some time in the post, it will not be
      just to discontinue him, even though he was

<p id="p_94">     30.         A workman does not have an absolute right of
                    
     permanency under M.S.O. 4-C irrespective of the nature of his

     appointment.   An   employer       is    entitled    to    make       temporary
                   
     appointments depending upon the exigencies                  of a situation. It

     may be necessary for an employer to engage the workmen on a
      

     temporary basis in view of its urgent requirements and till the
   



     employer is able to make a regular employment in accordance

     with the provisions of the Constitutional mandate. In these

     circumstances, an employer may even relax the prescribed





     qualifications if the urgent necessity justifies the same. It may be

     necessary to appoint workers for a particular scheme. There





     would be no right to permanency even                  under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_37">Industrial

     Disputes Act</a> ("<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">I.D. Act</a>") in such a case. Nor would such employees

     view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_40">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of the I.D. Act. It would

<p id="p_96">     Where a person is appointed only under a scheme, the provisions

     can be easily reconciled. The benefits of M.S.O. 4-C would apply




                                    
     only in cases where the concerned person is duly qualified,

     is not absolute. M.S.O. 4-C does not operate either independently

<p id="p_98">                 The first part provides that nothing contained in the

     Standing Orders shall operate in derogation of any law for the

     time being in force. The Standing Orders are thus, made subject




                                            
     to the provisions of any law for being in force. The provisions of

     the B.P.M.C. Act are therefore not affected           by the Standing




                                  
     Orders. To hold otherwise, would operate the Standing Orders in
                    
     derogation of the provisions of the B.P.M.C. Act, which is contrary

     to the provisions of Clause 32.
</p>                   
<p id="p_99">                 Secondly, Clause 32 provides that nothing contained in

     the Standing Orders shall operate to the prejudice of any right
      

     under a contract of service, custom or usage or any agreement,
   



     settlement or award applicable to the establishment. The two

     parts have nothing to do with each other. The second part of

     Clause 32 pertains to saving any benefit that a workman may be





     entitled to under a contract of service, custom, or usage or an

     agreement, settlement or award applicable to the establishment.
</p>




<p id="p_100">     In other words, in the event of a workman being entitled to any

     higher or better rights under a contract of service, agreement,

     settlement etc. than that provided in the Standing Orders, the

     Standing Orders shall not deprive the workman of the same.

     part of clause 32 and not the first. This is clear from paragraph 19

     of the judgment relied upon by Mr.Pendse. What fell for the

     consideration of the learned Judge was not the M.S.O. qua any




                                            
     legislation but qua a contractual provision. The learned Judge did

     not even observe that the M.S.O's. shall operate in derogation of




                                  
     or contrary to an existing enactment. Paragraph 19 of the

                 also be well described as inconsistent with the
                 Model Standing Orders and the Standing
                 Orders must prevail over the contract of
                 employment.      At this stage, it would be
      

                 relevant even to refer to Standing Order No.32

      as well as the learned single Judge erred in
      ignoring this well-settled law while holding that




                                  
      the appellants had indulged in unfair labour
      practice under Item No.6 of Schedule-IV of the
      said Act in relation to the respondent.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_104">      9.           It is then sought to be contended that




                                 
      the Model Standing Orders clearly provide under
      Clause 4-C that the employees who have
      completed 240 days of uninterrupted service
      would be entitled for permanency in service.
      Undisputedly, inspite of this Clause 4-C of the




                       
      Model Standing Orders, the employees' Union of
      which the respondent was a member, had
          
      entered into a settlement being settlement of
      September, 1989 and in terms thereof it was
      agreed that the claim of permanency would be
         
      available to the employees only on completion of
      continuous service of five years. It is also not in
      dispute that all other employees who have
      completed five years continuous service have
      been granted permanency in accordance with the
      

      settlement of September, 1989 as and when
      permanent vacant post duly approved by the
   



      competent authority had become available with
      the appellants. Besides, the Clause 4-C of the
      Model     Standing     Orders    cannot   be  read
      disjunctively and ignoring the well-settled law





      repeatedly reiterated by the Apex Court in
      various decisions. Once it is settled principle of
      law that mere completion of 240 days in service,
      in the absence of availability of permanent vacant
      post duly approved by the competent authority,
      would not be sufficient to claim permanency, and





      at the same time one cannot ignore the lawful
      settlement of September, 1989, arrived at
      between the parties. Besides, the Clause 32 of
      the same Standing Orders clearly provides:

<p id="p_106">                Once it is not in dispute that under the valid and

<p id="p_115">                This   judgment   of   the    Supreme        Court      is    of    no

     assistance to the workmen as it dealt with a case entirely different




                                  
     from the ones before me. In that case, the workman's letter of
                    
     appointment stated, he would be on probation for a period of six

     months. He however, continued to serve on his post as a
                   
     watchman even after the expiry of this period. Thereafter the

     Company discharged him for the reason that his services were no
      

     longer required by the Company. The Union contended that his
   



     employment on probation for six months was in contravention of

     the Standing Order which provided a two month probation period

     and that he automatically became a permanent workman on the





     expiry of two months. According to the Standing Order, the

     workman was not to be kept on probation for more than two





     months. If he had worked during these two months to the

     satisfaction of the Company, he became permanent. Thus, as

     observed by the Supreme Court, the Standing Orders stated

     "confirm him on the expiry of two months", whereas the

     agreement stated, "no, wait till the expiry of six months." There

     was thus a conflict between the agreement and the Standing




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:43 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                       40</span>




                                                                      
     odder. The Supreme Court held that the two could not co-exist




                                              
     and that the agreement was inconsistent with the Standing Order

     to the extent of an additional four months probation. The Supreme

     Court held that the terms of the employment specified in the




                                             
     Standing order would prevail over the corresponding terms in the

     contract of service in existence on the date of the enforcement of




                                  
     the Standing order. It was however, held that while the Standing
                     
     orders were in force, it would not be permissible to the employer

     to seek statutory modification of them so that there may be one
                    
     set of Standing Orders for some employees and another set for

     the rest of the employees. The Supreme Court therefore, held that
      

     the Standing Orders       will prevail over the provisions of an
   



     agreement inconsistent with the Standing Orders. The Supreme

     Court did not consider the effect of the Standing Orders qua any

     legislative enactment.
</p>




<p id="p_116">                 In view thereof, it cannot be held that the workman is

     entitled to benefit of permanency under M.S.O. 4-C contrary to or





     in derogation of the provisions of the B.P.M.C. Act.

     Standing Orders. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Western

     India Match Co. Ltd., however, makes it clear that in the event of




                                  
     there being a conflict between the provisions of the Standing

     already noted, the rest of the judgment in <a href="/doc/67507/" id="a_48">Pune Municipal

<p id="p_118">     38.        In   Oil and Natural Gas Ltd. v. Eng. Doorman Sang,

     (2007) 1 SCC, 250, the O.N.G.C. carried out certain surveys for





     exploration of petroleum. The work was seasonal, confined to only

     a part of the year. On the commencement of the season, the





     O.N.G.C.   recruited   the   workmen    for   specific       periods       and

     terminated their services at the end of the season. The practice

     had continued    since inception. The    Union raised an industrial

     dispute demanding regularization of such workmen. The Tribunal

     came to a finding that only a temporary workman who had put in

     not less than 240 days of attendance in a period of twelve




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:43 :::</span>

     consecutive months was entitled to be considered for conversion




                                             
     as a regular employee. The Tribunal observed that keeping

     workmen on casual/badli or temporary basis over long spells of

     time amounts to unfair labour practice and observed that there




                                            
     had to be some scheme for regularizing such workmen. The

     Tribunal took recourse to the Certified Standing Orders which




                                  
     governed the parties. Rule 2 thereof provided inter-alia that a
                    
     temporary workman who had been on the rolls of the O.N.G.C.,

     who had put in not less than 240 days of attendance in any period
                   
     of twelve consecutive months and who possessed the minimum

     qualifications prescribed by the Commission, may be considered
      

     for conversion as a regular employee.
</p>   



<p id="p_119">                The O.N.G.C. challenged the order before the Gujarat

     High Court. The High Court observed that though regularization

     could not be effected in the absence of availability of permanent





     posts, the availability of a permanent post is a fortuitous

     circumstance   and   consequential    confirmation        is,    therefore,





     uncertain, but that there was no ban against treating a person to

     be regular even if a permanent post was not available. Directions

     were therefore issued modifying the order of the Tribunal inter-

     all the employees who fulfilled the requirements of completion of

     240 days or more and that such employees should be considered

     granted even without waiting for the availability of vacancies to

     regular posts. The Division Bench further directed that the said

     workmen    should be notionally treated       as regularized.            The




                                           
     Supreme Court held as under :-

                submissions made on behalf of the respective




                                 
                parties and we are unable to agree with the
                reasoning both of the learned Single Judge as well
                    
                as the Division Bench of the High Court in firstly
                directing that the 153 workmen concerned be
                treated on a par with regular employees as far as
                   
                all benefits are concerned, except for being given
                permanent status and the subsequent direction of
                the Division Bench directing that they be treated
                as having been notionally regularised with effect
                from 1-5-1999. Having regard to the nature of
      

                employment and the period during which these
                field workers are employed, it would create
   



                various difficulties if the seasonal workmen were
                to be treated on a par with regular employees as
                directed by the learned Single Judge. It would be
                even more difficult for the appellant to adjust the
                workmen in permanent employment when the





                need for them was only seasonal. Admittedly,
                these workmen who are employed for field survey
                work are employed for about six months in a year
                between November and May. If at all they are to
                be regularised, the appellant will have to find





                work for them during the months when their
                services would otherwise have not been required.
                As pointed out by Mr Salve, previously the
                appellant had monopolistic control over geological
                survey work for oil and natural gas but today the
                scene has changed and it is just another
                competitor along with others, notwithstanding the
                fact that they are a government company. The
                appellant is now required to compete with others
                in securing exploration work and can only recruit
                field workers as and when required. Even then the

     Schedule-IV of the M.R.T.U. &amp; P.U.L.P. Act, 1971, alleging that they
                    
     had not been granted permanency with an object to deprive them

     of the benefits of permanency which constituted              unfair labour
      

     practices. The employees claimed permanency on account of their
   



     having put in 240 days of service in the preceding years. One of

     the contentions raised on behalf of the Appellants was that the

     Model Standing Orders are subject to the constitutional scheme of





     public employment. It was submitted that the Respondents had

     no legal right to the post as they could not be deemed to have





     held any post in view of their     having been appointed without

     undergoing a selection process. The Division Bench formulated

<p id="p_128">      "18.         The said decision applies with all force
      to the facts of this case. In Mahendra L. Jain this
      court has categorically held that the Standing
      Orders governing the terms and conditions of




                        
      service must be read subject to the constitutional
      and statutory limitations for the purpose of
          
      appointment both as a permanent employee or as
      a temporary employee. An appointment to the
      post of a temporary employee can be made
         
      where the work is essentially of temporary
      nature. In a case where there existed a vacancy,
      the same was required to be filled up by resorting
      to the procedures known to law i.e. Upon fulfilling
      the constitutional requirements as also the
      

      provisions contained in the 1976 Regulations. No
      finding of fact has been arrived at that before the
   



      respondent was appointed, the constitutional and
      statutory requirements were complied with."
</p>
<p id="p_129">      "22.         Such appointments in our opinion,





      having regard to the decisions in Mahendra L. Jain
      and Manoj Shrivastava must be made in
      accordance with extent rules and regulations. It is
      also a well settled legal position that only because
      a temporary employee has completed 240 days of
      work, he would not be entitled to be regularised





      in service. Otherwise also the legal position in this
      behalf is clear as would appear from the decision
      of this Court in Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd. Vs.
      Bhola Singh apart from Mahendra L. Jain."
</p>
<p id="p_130">      Placing reliance on the Supreme Court judgments
      referred to herein above, the learned counsel for
      the    Appellant   has    contended    that   the
      Respondent's complaint filed before the Industrial
      Court is conspicuously silent in regard to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:43 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                            49</span>




                                                          
      mode and manner of appointment. It is pointed
      out that the Respondents did not even aver much




                                  
      less establish that they were appointed in
      conformity with the prescribed procedure after
      undergoing a process of selection. This aspect of
      the matter has neither been considered by the
      Industrial Court nor the learned Single Judge.
</p>



                                 
<p id="p_131">      According to the Appellant, daily wagers are
      never appointed by following the prescribed
      procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_132">      17.         Reverting back to the facts in the




                       
      present case, it is crystal clear that there are no
      sanctioned posts and vacancies in existence in
          
      the petitioner's concerned department. Hence the
      claim for permanency could not have been
      granted by the Industrial Court. By observing that
         
      sanction for the posts could be asked for and
      obtained from the State by the authority
      concerned clearly indicate absence of sanctioned
      vacant posts. No finding has been recorded either
      by the Industrial Court or by the Learned Single
      

      Judge that the respondents were appointed in
      adherence to the rules regulating appointment.
</p>   



<p id="p_133">      The Respondents did not even claim that they
      were appointed in adherence to the procedure
      prescribed for appointments. From the very
      nature of appointment as 'daily wagers', it is





      obvious that the respondents have not been
      appointed in compliance of the procedure
      prescribed for making the appointments. As the
      respondents have failed to demonstrate that their
      appointments were made in accordance with the
      procedure     prescribed     for    selection   and





      appointment and as they have further failed to
      establish that there exists sanctioned vacant
      posts, it would be wholly unjust to direct the
      appellants    to   grant    permanency      to  the
      respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_134">      The learned Single Judge has concluded the issue
      by placing reliance on the Model Standing Orders
      which regulates the terms and conditions of
      service in the matter of grant of permanency on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:58:43 :::</span>

                  completion of 240 days of service without dealing
                  with the effect of non availability of sanctioned




                                              
                  posts and the requisite vacancies. In our
                  considered view, the order passed by the learned
                  Single Judge cannot be sustained. Provisions of
                  Model Standing Order by themselves cannot and
                  does not confer any right of permanency unless




                                             
                  and until the other two prerequisites are satisfied
                  i.e. (1) appointment being in conformity with the
                  rules relating to appointment and (2) permanent
                  sanctioned vacant posts being in existence.
</p>



                                     
<p id="p_135">                  18.          In the above premise, we conclude
                  that the Appellant State is obliged to make
                      
                  appointments in adherence to the constitutional
                  scheme of Public employment which regulate the
                  appointments in the Government's Milk Scheme.
</p>                     
<p id="p_136">                  We also hold that as the Respondents/'Daily
                  Wagers' were appointed without following the
                  prescribed procedure for selection by passing
                  public participation, they do not acquire any legal
                  right to claim permanency. We also hold that the
      

                  provisions of Model Standing Orders are subject
                  to the Rules regulating selection and appointment
   



                  so also subject to the constitutional scheme of
                  public employment."

     which arises in the present case and which arose before the

     industrial establishment which did not prescribe any age of
      

     superannuation. The      electricity undertaking of the firm was
   



     purchased by the Appellant under the <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_57">Electricity (Supply) Act</a>,

     1948, as a result whereof the workmen became the employees of

     the U.P.S.E.B. It was conceded that the Standing Orders as





     applicable to the said firm continued to apply to the U.P.S.E.B. The

     U.P.S.E.B. itself did not get certified any Standing Orders.

<p id="p_151">       27.         No notification has been brought to
       our notice that the Standard Standing Orders had
       been made applicable to the appellants. It is
       furthermore not in dispute that the Adhiniyam




                       
       came into force in 1973. The statute, rules and
       regulations framed by the State govern the terms
       and conditions of service of the employees of the
          
       respondent. The terms and conditions of service
       contained in the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules are
       not in derogation of the provisions contained in
         
       the Schedule appended to the 1961 Act.
</p><p id="p_152">       28.        The 1961 Act provides for classification
       of employees in five categories. The 1973 Act, as
       noticed hereinbefore, clearly mandates that all
      

       posts should be sanctioned by the State
       Government and all appointments to the said
       cadre must be made by the State Government
   



       alone. Even the appointments to the local cadre
       must be made by the Authority. The said
       provisions were not complied with. It is accepted
       that no appointment letter was issued in favour of





       the appellants. Had the appointments of the
       appellants been made in terms of the provisions
       of the Adhiniyam and the Rules framed
       thereunder, the respondent Authority was
       statutorily enjoined to make an offer of
       appointment in writing which was to be accepted





       by the appellants herein. Who made the
       appointments of the appellants to the project or
       other works carried on by the Authority is not
       known.     Whether   the   person    making      an
       appointment had the requisite jurisdiction or not
       is also not clear. We have noticed hereinbefore
       that in the case of Om Prakash Mondloi, the CEO
       made an endorsement to the effect that he may
       be tried in daily wages and should be entrusted
       with the work of progress collection of ODA work.

<p id="p_153">                 The said order is not an "offer of appointment" by
                 any sense of the term.

<p id="p_154">                 33.         For the purpose of this matter, we
                 would proceed on the basis that the 1961 Act is a
                 special statute vis-à-vis the 1973 Act and the
                 Rules framed thereunder. But in the absence of
                 any conflict in the provisions of the said Act, the




                                              
                 conditions of service including those relating to
                 recruitment as provided for in the 1973 Act and
                 the 1987 Rules would apply. If by reason of the
                 latter, the appointment is invalid, the same




                                  
                 cannot be validated by taking recourse to
                 regularisation. For the purpose of regularisation
                 which would confer on the employee concerned a
                    
                 permanent status, there must exist a post.
                 However, we may hasten to add that
                 regularisation itself does not imply permanency.
</p>                   
<p id="p_155">                 We have used the term keeping in view the
                 provisions of the 1963 Rules."
</p>      

<p id="p_156">     44.        The position is similar in the present case. There is no

     conflict between the provisions of M.S.O. 4-C and the provisions of
   



     the B.P.M.C. Act. The B.P.M.C. Act regulates                 the mode of

     appointment only. In the event of the appointment having been





     made validly would the provisions of M.S.O. 4-C apply. A view to

     the contrary would result in regularizing/validating a void act.
</p>
<p id="p_157">     M.S.O. 4-C neither permits nor contemplates the same.                 As held





     in the above judgments, if the appointment is not made in

     accordance with the constitutional scheme it is void ab-initio and,

     therefore, there can be no claim to regularization in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_158">     Moreover M.S.O. 32 expressly provides that the Standing Orders

     are not in derogation of any other law.

<p id="p_162">       "13.        To be seen that, in the impugned

       law laid down by this Court, status of permanency
       could not be granted. In spite of this the High
       Court indirectly does what it could not do directly.
       The High Court, without granting the status of
       permanency, grants wages and other benefits




                                  
       applicable to permanent employees on the
       specious reasoning that inaction on the part of the
       Government in not creating posts amounted to
       unfair labour practice under Item 6 of Schedule IV
       of the MRTU &amp; PULP Act. In so doing the High




                        
       Court    erroneously    ignores   the   fact   that
       approximately 2000 workmen had not even made
          
       a claim for permanency before it. Their claim for
       permanency had been rejected by the award
       dated 20-2-1985. These workmen were only
         
       seeking quantification of amounts as per this
       award. The challenge, before the High Court, was
       only to the quantification of the amounts. Yet by
       this sweeping order the High Court grants, even
       to these workmen, the wages and benefits
      

       payable to other permanent workmen.

<p id="p_165">       The complaint was against the Universities. The
       High Court notes that as there were no posts the
       employees could not be made permanent. Once it
       comes to the conclusion that for lack of posts the
       employees could not be made permanent, how
       could it then go on to hold that they were
       continued as "badlis", casuals or temporaries with
       the object of depriving them of the status and
       privileges of permanent employees? To be noted

                Universities. The inaction on the part of the State
                Government to create posts would not mean that
                an unfair labour practice had been committed by
                the Universities. The reasoning given by the High
                Court to conclude that the case was squarely

                impugned judgment has to be and is set aside. It
                is however clarified that the High Court was right
                in concluding that, as per the law laid down by




                                   
                this Court, status of permanency could not be
                granted. Thus all orders wherein permanency has
                     
                been granted (except award dated 1-4-1985 in IT
                No. 27 of 1984) also stand set aside."

     post of Safai Jamadar fell vacant and the Petitioner was appointed

     to that post by an order dated 13.12.1984 for the period of three

     for the post of Safai Jamadar and he would be paid the salary
                   
     accordingly. There were no complaints about him. He was

     reverted by an order dated 30.7.1984. The Petitioner challenged

<p id="p_170">     IV of M.R.T.U. &amp; P.U.L.P. Act. The learned Judge found that there

     of his appointment expressing a view that a Safai Jamadar should

     be a matriculate.   The Petitioner was governed by the Model





     Standing Order, wherein the period of probation was three

     months. The learned Judge held that he ought to have been made

     permanent after having completed that period satisfactorily. It

     was contended on behalf of the Respondent that the municipal

     contended that upon the expiry of the period of appointment, the
                       
     same automatically stood discontinued. It was thus contended

     that the employee had not been working continuously. The
      

     Petitioner contended that the work was of a temporary nature and
   



     that the appointment orders of a period of one month every year

     was made during the period from 1983 to 1987. However,

     thereafter, the practice had been stopped in view of certain





     Government orders. It was further contended on behalf of the

      from 16-2-1988, the appointment on regular post
      of Forest Guard could only be made after they
      have been selected and recommended by the
      Selection Board. Admittedly, at the time when the




                      
      complainants-employees were initially appointed
      in the year 1983 and 1984, there was no such

      appointments to be made on or after 16-2-1988

                 those employees who were already working as
                 Forest Guards, need not comply with the physical
                 standard and/or required prescribed qualification




                                  
                 for making them permanent. That was the reason
                 that before the Industrial Court no arguments
                    
                 were advanced about the applicability of the
                 Forest Guards Recruitment Rules, 1987. Even in
                 the memo of all the writ petitions, no such ground
                   
                 has been set up and for the first time during the
                 course of arguments, the learned Counsel for the
                 employer raised argument that on coming into
                 force of the Forest Guard Recruitment Rules,
                 1987 the employees could be recruited under the
      

                 rules and cannot be made permanent otherwise
                 and for the reasons stated above, the said
   



                 argument has no merit and deserves to be
                 negatived."

<p id="p_182">     Thus, the facts of the case were entirely different from the facts in

     the above Writ Petitions. The provisions of the B.P.M.C. Act were

     applicable before the said workers were appointed.                    Further





     M.S.O. 4-C does not deal with the recruitment of an employee but

     confers upon an employee already recruited/employed, a right of

     permanency upon the conditions therein being satisfied. There is

     therefore, no conflict between the B.P.M.C. Act and the Model

     Standing Orders. In the above case, there was a clear conflict

     involve an operation of any rules as contemplated under Section

     13-B of the I.E. Act. The provisions of the B.P.M.C. Act are

<p id="p_183">     50.         Mr.Pendse relied upon the judgment of the Supreme

     Kondhare and others</a>, 1996 SCC (L &amp; S) 500, in support of his

     contention that once the ingredients of M.S.O. 4-C are satisfied in
                    
     respect of a person employed in a sanctioned post, nothing more

     is required to entitle him to the benefit of permanency. The
      

     judgment does not support the submission.
</p>   



<p id="p_184">                 Firstly, it does   not deal   with a situation where the

     initial appointment is itself illegal. Secondly, it is clear from the

     judgment that whether there has been any unfair labour practice,





     is a question of fact to be determined in each case. There is

     nothing in the judgment which indicates that the mere existence





     of the ingredients of M.S.O. 4-C necessarily results in an employee

     getting the benefit of permanency to the post              even if it is a

     sanctioned post.

     Ltd. And another</a>, 2006 (6) SCC 310. The Supreme Court found




                                            
     that the employees had been doing the work of a permanent

     nature and that they were required to do work which was being

     done by the skilled employees. It was further found that there was




                                           
     sufficient work for them; that the Respondents transferred the

     employees from one project to another and also granted them




                                 
     certain benefits such as T.A., D.A. etc.         Mr. Pendse placed
                    
     considerable reliance upon a sentence in paragraph 35, where the

     Supreme Court observed that once the employee completes 240
                   
     days, he is deemed to be a permanent employee. It                would be

     incorrect to read the sentence by itself. It must be read in the
      

     context of the entire judgment. The judgment so read does not
   



     support the absolute proposition advanced by Mr.Pendse to the

     effect that once    the ingredients of M.S.O. 4-C are present

     permanency follows. Apart from the above findings, the Supreme





     Court also found that it was the usual practice of the Respondent

     to keep such workmen for long duration of time and offer regular





     employment periodically which had abruptly stopped due to the

     unfair attitude of the Management. Despite all these findings, the

     Supreme Court in paragraph 38 held that the worker in order to

     succeed would have to substantiate their claim as per established

     principles of law. In paragraph 39, the Supreme Court held as

     Liquidator v. Dayanand and others, (2008) 10 SCC 1 dealt with a

     case where the question was whether the persons appointed by

     the Official Liquidator under the orders of the respective High




                                            
     Courts under Rules 308 and 309 of the Companies (Court), Rule,

     1959 are entitled to equal pay and regularization as the




                                  
     employees appointed by the Central Government in the office of
                    
     the Official Liquidator. The Court appointed staff based their claim

     on the fact that they had been discharging identical duties and
                   
     functions as   the regular employees, had been               continuously

     working for a period ranging from twenty to twenty five years,
      

     that they had been paid only a fixed salary without any other
   



     benefits and that such employees appointed upto 1.7.1978 had

     been regularized by the Government. The Supreme Court rejected

     the contention. Paragraph 52 of the judgment reads as under :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">                "52.         As mentioned above, while approving
                the reasons and conclusions recorded by the two
                High Courts and dismissing the appeals, this Court
                not only permitted the Government of India to





                frame a scheme modelled on the 1978 Scheme
                but also stayed implementation of the orders
                impugned in the appeal and the one passed by
                itself in the transferred writ petition. If the Court
                intended that all members of the company-paid
                staff working on the date of judgment i.e.
                27-8-1999 should be absorbed in the regular
                cadres against Group C and D posts, then a
                simple direction to that effect would have been
                sufficient and there was no occasion to stay the
                implementation of the orders of the High Courts

               for six months with liberty to the Government of
               India to frame a new scheme within the same




                                            
               period. The absence of such a direction shows
               that the Court was very much conscious of the
               fact that recruitment to the regular cadres is
               governed by the rules framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_84">Article 309</a> of
               the Constitution and it would be highly




                                           
               detrimental to public interest to issue direction for
               wholesale     absorption/regularisation     of   the
               company-paid staff and thereby abrogate/stultify
               opportunity of competition to younger generation
               comprising more meritorious persons who may be




                                
               waiting for a chance to apply for direct
               recruitment. Obviously, the Court did not want to
                   
               sacrifice merit by showing undue sympathy with
               members of the company-paid staff who joined
               service with full knowledge about their status,
                  
               terms and conditions of their employment and the
               fact that they were to be paid from the company
               fund and not Consolidated Fund of India. In this
               context, we may also mention that though the
               Official Liquidators appear to have issued
      

               advertisements for appointing the company-paid
               staff and made some sort of selection, more
   



               qualified and meritorious persons must have
               shunned from applying because they knew that
               the employment will be for a fixed term on fixed
               salary and their engagement will come to an end
               with the conclusion of liquidation proceedings. As





               a result of this, only mediocres must have
               responded to the advertisements and joined as
               company-paid staff. In this scenario, a direction
               for absorption of all the company-paid staff has to
               be treated as violative of the doctrine of equality





               enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the
               Constitution."</blockquote>

                entitled to be regularised in terms of the policy

<p id="p_195">                The question whether the Electricity Board could

                simply adverted to the facts of the case and held that

       discriminated in the matter of implementation of the
       policy of regularisation. Therefore, the two-Judge

       Benches. In some cases, the High Courts have gone to
       the extent of ignoring the law laid down by this Court
          
       without any tangible reason. Likewise, there have
       been instances in which smaller Benches of this Court
       have either ignored or bypassed the ratio of the
       judgments of the larger Benches including the
         
       Constitution Benches. These cases are illustrative of
       non-adherence to the rule of judicial discipline which
       is sine qua non for sustaining the system. <a href="/doc/1999403/" id="a_94">In

<p id="p_197">       this Court observed: (AIR p. 941, para 19)
   



       "19. ... If one thing is more necessary in law than any
       other thing, it is the quality of certainty. That quality
       would totally disappear if Judges of coordinate
       jurisdiction in a High Court start overruling one





       another's decisions. If one Division Bench of a High
       Court is unable to distinguish a previous decision of
       another Division Bench, and holding the view that the
       earlier decision is wrong, itself gives effect to that
       view the result would be utter confusion. The position
       would be equally bad where a Judge sitting singly in





       the High Court is of opinion that the previous decision
       of another Single Judge on a question of law is wrong
       and gives effect to that view instead of referring the
       matter to a larger Bench. In such a case lawyers
       would not know how to advise their clients and all
       courts subordinate to the High Court would find
       themselves in an embarrassing position of having to
       choose between dissentient judgments of their own
       High Court." (emphasis added)

                what is its effect? No doubt, Standing Order 503

     that the Standing Orders, in that case, could not be elevated to

     the effect of the Standing Orders and held that the same do not

     have statutory force and that the breach of Standing Orders by
                   
     the Corporation was itself an unfair labour practice. It is of vital

     importance to note that the Standing Orders, in that case, were
      

     non-statutory Standing Orders. In the present Writ Petitions there

      Then and then alone, this practice could be

           employer guilty of such unfair labour practice as
           described in entry 6, something more is required.
           There must be "tangible evidence" to show that




                                      
           this was deliberately done. The words "with the

           employees could not be made permanent. Once it
           comes to the conclusion that for lack of posts the
   



           employees could not be made permanent how
           could it then go on to hold that they were
           continued as "badlis", casuals or temporaries with
           the object of depriving them of the status and





           privileges of permanent employees. To be noted
           that the complaint was not against the State
           Government. The complaint was against the
           Universities. The inaction on the part of the State
           Government to create posts would not mean that
           an unfair labour practice had been committed by





           the Universities. The reasoning given by the High
           Court to conclude that the case was squarely
           covered by Item 6 of Schedule IV of the MRTU and

                or temporaries for years with the object of

                the employment or reemployment of probationers

                Rules, 1959 lays down the Model Standing Orders.
                Under MSO 3, workmen have to be classified as
                permanent workmen; probationers; badlis or
                substitutes;     temporary    workmen;       casual




                                  
                workmen; and apprentices. A temporary workman
                is defined by MSO-3(2)(d) as a workman who has
                    
                been appointed for a limited period for work which
                is of an essentially temporary nature and who is
                employed temporarily as an additional workman
                   
                in connection with temporary increase in work of
                a permanent nature. Under MSO 4-C, a badli or
                temporary workman who has put in 190 days'
                uninterrupted service in the aggregate in any
                establishment of a seasonal nature or 240 days'

                other establishment, during the period of the
   



                preceding twelve calendar months, shall be made
                permanent in that establishment by an order in
                writing signed by the Manager. The petitioners
                who had been appointed under fixed term





                contracts in order to complete and fulfill specified
                items of work cannot possibly claim the benefit of

     not having been followed, the complainants are not entitled to be

     regularized and to the        benefit of permanency. Thus the

     Corporation not having granted them the benefits which they are

     in law not entitled to cannot be said to have indulged in any unfair

     443/2010 and 565/2010 sets out the pleadings and the arguments

     elaborately.
</p>                    
<p id="p_244">     66.        There are three findings of fact. Firstly, that the said
                   
     employees had worked from 1997 - 1999, onwards with only a

     day's technical break between successive letters of appointment.

<p id="p_245">     Secondly, that the Corporation's witness admitted that all the
   



     complainants were employed and recruited pursuant to the said

     advertisement dated 28.5.1997.       Thirdly, it is held that it was

     admitted   by the Corporation's      witness that the Complainants





     were working on clear vacant and sanctioned posts, "which have

     been already sanctioned by the State Government in the year





     1999 as per the administrative schedule which was placed before

     the State Government for getting appropriate sanction".
</p>
<p id="p_246">     67.        The first finding is correct to the extent that the

     Complainants/employees have been working since the year 1997

     to 1999.

     case, were appointed in the year 1997. I have already dealt with




                                               
     the second finding, namely as to whether the complainants had

     been appointed pursuant to the said advertisement                        dated

     28.5.1997 or not. I have held that they were not and that,even if




                                              
     they were, it would make no difference to the Complainants' case.
</p>
<p id="p_248">     69.         The third finding is correct to the extent that the posts




                                  
     were sanctioned by the State Government in the year 1999 as per
                    
     the administrative schedule placed before the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_249">     That, however, would not enure to the benefit of the complainants
                   
     /employees for they were admittedly appointed prior thereto,

     namely in the year 1997. They were, thus, not appointed against
      

     the sanctioned posts. The posts being sanctioned subsequently,
   



     cannot entitle them to permanency on the basis that the posts

     were subsequently sanctioned.         The posts were sanctioned in

     general. They were not sanctioned for the benefit of or qua the





     Complainants/employees.
</p>
<p id="p_250">                 The complainants have no right to the posts which





     were sanctioned subsequent to their appointments, which, as I

     have stated earlier, is not in accordance with law.
</p>

       admitted      by     the        witness       that      all     the
       Complainants are working on clear vacant and

       sanctioned by the State Government in the year
       1999 as per the administrative schedule which
            
       was placed before the State Government for
       getting appropriate sanction. Thus, considering
           
       the oral as well as documentary evidence placed

       documents on record and after reading between
   



       the lines, the contents of the citations and case
       laws referred by the rival parties, it cannot be
       said   that    in    the        entire    proceedings,          the





       Complainants           have       not     proved        that    the

       years together i.e., from 1997, 1999 till date as
       temporary employees.              Hence, considering            the
       provisions of the Standing Orders and other legal
       provisions applicable in the present proceedings,
       it   cannot    be      disputed          after    taking       into

       Court in the latest case law and Judgment cited
       by the rival parties. I have to conclude that the




                                    
       Respondents have engaged and are engaging in
       the unfair labour practice under Items 5, 6 and 9
       of Schedule IV of the Act by continuing the




                                   
       Complainants as temporaries for years together.
       Hence, for the reasons, I       conclude that the
       Complainants    are eligible and entitled for the




                          
       reliefs as prayed in the    prayer      clause of the
       Complainant and the Complaint filed for getting
          
       permanency and regularization. Considering the
       facts on record, the reliefs which need to be
         
       considered     cannot be considered in toto as
       prayed, but regarding regularization needs to be
       considered as prayed. Regarding monetary and
      


       consequential benefits     which are arrived from
   



       the said permanency needs to be considered by
       granting from the date of filing of the present
       Complaint and the Respondents need be directed





       that all the monetary and consequential benefits
       arrived out of the said permanency be awarded
       to the Complainants within a period of two
       months from the date of this Order. Hence, for





       the reasons as well as considering the               latest

     learned Counsel did submit that the result in this Writ Petition




                                             
     would follow the result in Writ Petition Nos. 443/2010 and

     565/2010. It is, however, important to note that in paragraph 10 of

     the impugned judgment in this Writ Petition, the learned Member




                                            
     has held that the Complainants were working on clear sanctioned

     posts. This finding itself is incorrect and contrary to the record.

<p id="p_260">     Even in the impugned order in other Writ Petitions, the learned
                    
     Member has at least recorded that the posts were sanctioned only

     in the year 1999.

<p id="p_261">     74.        Secondly, the learned Member has held that the

     Corporation's witness had admitted that the Complainants had
      

     been employed after following the due procedure of recruitment
   



     which needs to be followed as per the rules and regulations as

     mentioned "in the said advertisement". Even assuming that this

     finding is correct, it would make no difference        for the question





     that required consideration was whether the procedure prescribed

     by law, namely the provisions of the B.M.P.C. Act were followed





     or not.   This was even noted by the learned Member while

     narrating the facts. There is no finding in this regard. The matter

     has not even been considered.        The entire basis for granting

     reliefs appears to have been that the Complainants had been

     working for a long period of time and the same was itself an unfair

     labour practice, entitling them to the benefit of permanency.

       categorically proved beyond doubt that                     as per
   



       the ratio developed by the Apex Court in the
