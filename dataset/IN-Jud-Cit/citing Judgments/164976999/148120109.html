                          him or his counsel. Counsel for the petitioner/defendant had
                          inspected the file on 22.08.2022, 25.08.2022 and 28.08.2022 and had
                          applied for the certified copies of the plaint and its annexures. The
                          same were received by the counsel for the petitioner/defendant on
                          08.09.2022.

                          out that the suit is deficit in proper and correct court fee, upon which
                          the respondent/plaintiff undertook to make good the deficit fee
                          during the course of the day. At this stage again, petitioner/defendant
                          asked for directions for supply of plaint with documents which were
                          ordered to be supplied.

                          of suit amount by NBCC and release of remaining amount withheld

                          argued that the Trial Court has failed to consider that the Respondent
                          had filed a defective suit without court fees and without adopting
                          mandatory provision under section 12-A Commercial Courts Act and
                          was therefore, not a duly instituted suit. Separate applications for not

                          the Trial Court has not applied its judicial mind to the suit. He
                          submits that therefore, the Trial Court neither issued any notice to the
                          petitioner nor ordered filing of any process. Thus, he submits that the
                          suit as laid by the respondent is not a properly instituted suit.

                          furnishing of complete set of plaint and its annexures despite
                          requests, the petitioner was constrained to inspect the judicial file
                          through its counsel on 22.08.2022, 25.08.2022 and 28.08.2022
                          whereby it was revealed that the applications filed by the Respondent
                          have not been considered and order of issuance of the process has not
                          been issued by the trial court. Learned Senior Counsel submits that
                          the petitioner had filed three applications i.e., an application for early
                          hearing, application under Order XXXVIII Rule 4 and application
                          under Order VIII Rule 1 CPC, on 31.08.2022. Learned Senior
                          Counsel further submits that the trial court directed the respondent to
                          supply copy of the plaint on 15.09.2022.

                          20.09.2022 and the same was filed on 24.09.2022.

                          petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner had not admitted the claim of the
                          Respondent No.1 which is the basic requirement of proviso to Rule 1
                          of Order V, CPC, 1908. He submits that Trial Court failed to

<p id="p_19">                          10.   Learned counsel further submits that on 18.12.2020, the
                          respondent sent a scanned copy of the plaint along with complete
                          documents to the petitioner through email and also apprised him
                          about the next date of hearing i.e. 21.12.2020. Learned counsel
                          further submits that on 04.01.2021, petitioner appeared in person
                          through video conferencing and Trial Court passed an order directing
                          &#x27;status quo&#x27; in respect of payment and that none of this is denied by
                          the petitioner.

<p id="p_20">                          11.   Learned counsel submits that when no written statement was
                          filed by the petitioner, on 07.08.2021, the respondent moved an
                          application under Order VIII Rule 10 r/w with section 151 CPC,
                          1908 seeking foreclosure of the right of the petitioner to file the
                          written statement and for pronouncing judgment.

                          namely, Mr. Khan appeared but still chose not to file any written
                          statement. He further submits that Mr. Khan is defending the
                          petitioner in the proceedings initiated against the petitioner under

                          educated person, had knowledge of the case and entered appearance
                          in person as also through his counsel and therefore, is deemed to
                          have waived service through summons. He further submits that the
                          petitioner was duly represented by a counsel who knew the strict
                          timelines prescribed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 as well
                          as the amended provisions of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908.
                          Thus, learned Counsel submits that the plea of the petitioner that
                          since the summons were not served upon him, the time as prescribed
                          for filing written statement had not commenced, cannot be accepted.

<p id="p_23">                          14.   Learned counsel for the Respondent relied upon the judgement
                          of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/290974/" id="a_4">Sunil Poddar and Ors. vs. Union

                          to submit that the question was not whether the defendant was
                          actually served with the summons in accordance with the procedure
                          laid down and in the manner prescribed under Order V of the Code of
                          Civil Procedure, 1908 but whether the defendants had sufficient
                          notice of the date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear and
                          answer the claim of the plaintiffs. Learned counsel thus submits that
                          having appeared before the Trial Court, the Petitioner was precluded
                          from using false defenses.

                          restrictive and circumscribe the right of the defendant to necessarily
                          file his written statement within 30 days. The proviso further curtails
                          and restricts the inherent power of the Court to grant extension of
                          time beyond 30 days, extendable upto 120 days from the date of
                          service of summons. The proviso simultaneously places a
                          responsibility upon the Court to record its reasons while granting
                          extension of time to defendant who may default in filing the written

                          stipulates that the right to file written statement beyond 120 days by
                          the defendant is automatically extinguished by operation of law.
</p><p id="p_33">                          22.   Thus, there is no iota of doubt that Order VIII Rule 1 CPC read
                          with proviso as amended by virtue of the Commercial Courts Act,
                          2015 is prohibitive as well as restrictive in its nature in
                          contradistinction to Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC, 1908 as applicable
                          to ordinary suits.
</p><p id="p_34">                          23.   The wisdom of the legislature in drafting such a strict and
                          rigorous provision is not far to see, in that, commercial suits should
                          not be lingering in courts for years and ought to be resolved at the
                          earliest. This obviously would be in the commercial interest of the

                          taken away and the courts are divested of their powers of extending

                                 Order V, in rule 1, in sub-rule (1), for the second Proviso,
                                 substitute the following proviso, namely:-
</p><p id="p_39">                                       Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the
                                 written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be
                                 allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be
                                 specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on
                                 payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be
                                 later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of
                                 summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date
                                 of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file
                                 the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written
                                 statement to be taken on record.&quot;
</p><p id="p_40">                                                                                 (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_41">                          27.   The plain reading of the proviso to Rule 1 Order V CPC brings
                          to fore the same aspect as was intended while substituting the proviso
                          to Rule 1 of Order VIII, CPC.
</p><p id="p_42">                          28.   Rule 1 of Order V, CPC makes it clear that once a suit is
                          instituted, summons may be issued to the defendant to appear and
                          answer the claim and to file the written statement within 30 days
                          from the date of service of summons. However, under first proviso,
                          which is applicable to the ordinary suits, the defendant is permitted to
                          file written statement beyond the 30 days period but within the 90
                          days from the date of service of summons. It is trite that this proviso
                          has been held to be construed liberally and written statement even
                          beyond 90 days period has been directed to be taken on record, for
                          justifiable reasons. The said proposition is settled by the Supreme
                          Court in <a href="/doc/877414/" id="a_5">Kailash vs. Nanhku &amp; Ors</a>, reported in 2005 (4) SCC 480.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                          29.   The second proviso to Rule 1 of Order V, CPC as amended
                          and made applicable to the commercial suits is restrictive in its nature
                          when compared to the first proviso as applicable to the ordinary suits.

</p><p id="p_44">                          30.    Another provision which may be germane to the resolution of
                          the present dispute in the opinion of this Court would be Rule 5 of
                          Order V, CPC, 1908. The same is extracted hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                &quot;5. Summons to be either to settle issues or for final disposal.- The
                                Court shall determine, at the time of issuing the summons, whether it
                                shall be for the settlement of issues only, or for the final disposal of
                                the suit; and the summons shall contain a direction accordingly:
                                 Provided that, in every suit heard by a Court of Small Causes, the
                                summons shall be for the final disposal of the suit.&quot;</blockquote>


<p id="p_45">                                 It is manifest that Rule 5 requires the court issuing summons to
                          determine at the time of issuance of summons whether it shall be for
                          settlement of issues only, or for the final disposal of the suit and
                          directs that the summons shall contain a direction in accordance
                          thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                          31.    When the provisions of Rule 5 of Order V CPC are viewed in
                          conjunction with and as made applicable to commercial suits, it is
                          logical that the same shall be read and applied in the manner as
                          provided under second proviso to Rule 1 of Order V as well as
                          proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC, 1908.
</p>
<p id="p_47">                          32.    When viewed in the aforesaid manner, it appears both logical
                          as also in consonance with the strict liability that is sought to be
                          brought upon a defendant in a commercial suit.

                          commercial suits is a strict and mandatory provision, extension
                          whereof would be subject only to the conditions specified therein. In
                          this view of the matter, it becomes relevant to consider as to from
                          which day, the 30 days period is to be reckoned, for the purpose of
                          filing written statement by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                          34.   There is no manner of doubt, as stipulated in proviso to Rule 1
                          of Order V and Rule 1 of Order VIII CPC, that the 30 days period
                          would commence on and from the date of service of summons
                          containing a stipulation that it is obligatory on the part of the
                          defendant to file his written statement, which would be a necessary
                          concomitant to construe if any default in filing the written statement
                          has occasioned.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                          35.   This Court is, therefore, of the opinion that it is imperative to
                          direct the Civil Courts adjudicating commercial suits, while issuing
                          summons of the suit to the defendant, to necessarily incorporate the
                          endorsement that, &quot;defendant should file his written statement of
                          defence within 30 days from the date of service/receipt of
                          summons&quot; on the notice of summons. It is also apparent from a plain
                          and harmonious reading of all the aforesaid three provisions of the
                          CPC that service of summons itself is a very important procedural
                          step undertaken by the court and there cannot be any laxity insofar as
                          commercial suits are concerned.

                                     Summons and not the date a Defendant first enters appearance.
                                     In other words, a party or its Advocate/s can no longer rely on
                                     the above notification and avoid serving the writ of summons on
                                     the Defendant/s. However, in order to ensure expeditious
                                     disposal of Commercial Suits and in order to save time of this

                                     appearance and by consent, agrees to waive service, the period
                                     of 120 days will commence from the date of such waiver. In such
                                     instance, there would be no requirement to serve the Writ of
                                     Summons. This will prevent the loss of days involved in serving
                                     the Writ of Summons and will expedite commencement of trial
                                     and consequently, disposal of Commercial Suits.&quot;

                                   summons pertains to the procedural law and that, therefore,
                                   non-compliance or any irregularity in that regard would not
                                   relate to the jurisdictional error. Failure to comply with the

                                   enable the defendant to file the written statement cannot be said
                                   to be a mere procedural irregularity. The provisions of law
                                   essentially prescribe fetters on the power of the Court to

                                                Order V Rule 1(1) CPC, it is evident that when a
                                                suit is regarded as having been &#x27;duly instituted&#x27;, a
                                                summons may be issued to the defendant. The use
                                                of the expression &#x27;duly instituted&#x27; has to be seen in
                                                the context of the provisions of Orders VI and VII
                                                of the CPC. In the present matter, it is nobody&#x27;s

                                                requirements of Order VI and VII CPC. It is

                                                under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. The present case

                                                examined is whether the Court had a discretion to
                                                issue or not to issue summons given that the suit
                                                had been duly instituted. In our view, the use of
                                                the word &#x27;may&#x27; does not give discretion to the
                                                Court and does not make it optional for it to issue
                                                summons or not. This is further fortified by the
                                                fact that the first proviso to Order V Rule 1(1)
                                                itself gives a situation where summons must not

                                                appears at the presentation of the plaint and
                                                admits the plaintiffs claim. Therefore, in such a

                                waiver of service of the summons of the suit. However, in the
                                present case, the Trial Court itself was satisfied after
                                scrutinizing its record that no order to issue summons was at
                                all passed by the Trial Court nor was any summons issued.

<p id="p_56">                          39.   Applying the aforesaid principle to the facts of the present
                          case, it is clear from the impugned order that the Trial Court itself
                          observed that the summons in the present case were never issued to
                          the defendant. Once the learned Trial Court concluded, upon the
                          perusal of its record, that summons under Rule 5 of Order V CPC,
                          1908 were never issued in accordance with the prescribed procedure,
                          the failure thereof cannot be detrimental to the rights provided to the
                          defendant.

                          well settled by a catena of judgments of the Supreme Court. This

                          obligation to file the written statement within a period of 30 days
                          from the date of the service of summons. Logically, since no such
