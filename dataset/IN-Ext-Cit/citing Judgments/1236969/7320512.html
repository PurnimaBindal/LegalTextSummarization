<p id="p_1"> PER SUDHANSHU SRIVASTAVA, JUDICIAL MEMBER:

</p><p id="p_2">      All these four appeals have been preferred by the assessee. ITA

No.3532/Del/2010       challenges   the    order      of     the      learned

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-XII, New Delhi and pertains

to Assessment Year 2007-08. ITA No.3533/Del/2010 challenges the

order of the learned CIT (Appeals) - XI, New Delhi for Assessment

Year 2008-09. ITA No.1507/Del/2014 and ITA No.1508/Del/2014

are the assessee's appeals against the penalty imposed u/s

271(1)(c) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (hereinafter called as 'the Act')

for the two captioned assessment years . For          the        sake           of

convenience all the four appeals were heard together and they are

being disposed of through this a common order for the sake of

convenience.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.0        The brief facts of the case are that the assessee is a

company engaged in the business of Real Estate Development. On

31st January, 2008 one Sh. Vipin Verma, an employee of the

assessee was intercepted by the Police at Rajpura while he was

travelling to Amritsar. Rs.1.98 Crores in cash along with an


                                                                           Page | 2

unsigned photocopied agreement dated 30.09.2006, which was

alleged to have been executed between the assessee and one <a href="/doc/1870389/" id="a_2">M/s

V.M. Reality</a>, were seized from his possession. As per this unsigned

photocopied agreement, the assessee company had made payment

of Rs.5 <a href="/doc/1870389/" id="a_3">Crores to M/s V.M. Reality</a> towards transactions of land and

a cash payment of Rs.70 lacs was also alleged to have been made.

This agreement was signed by Sh. Hira, the Managing Director of

M/s. V.M. Reality and name of one Sh. Hemant Kapoor was

mentioned as being the authorized signatory on behalf of the

assessee company. However, nobody had signed on behalf of the

assessee company. It is the assessee company's contention that Sh.

Hemant Kapoor as neither an employee of the company nor he was

authorized by the assessee company to enter into any such

transaction. Sh. Hemant Kapoor also in his statement recorded

categorically stated that he was not aware of any such agreement

and the assessee also vehemently denied having entered into any

such agreement. Even in the statement recorded of Sh. Vipin

Verma, Sh. Vipin Verma never stated that such agreement belonged

to the assessee. Subsequently, notice was issued u/s 153C of the

Act and assessment for assessment year 2007-08 was completed,

thereafter, at an income of Rs.11,21,82,737/- after making an

addition of Rs.70 lacs which was alleged to have been made by the

assessee company in cash during the year under consideration to

<a href="/doc/1236969/" id="a_4">M/s V.M. Reality Pvt. Ltd</a>. out of unexplained sources and in terms

of the above said agreement. In assessment year 2008-09, the

assessment was completed at an income of Rs.25,14,13,359/- after

making an addition of Rs.1.98 crores on account of unverifiable

cash credits appearing in the books of accounts of the assessee

which as per the Assessing Officer (AO) reflected unsubstantiated

credits.

<p id="p_4">2.1        Penalty u/s 271(1)(c) amounting to Rs.23,56,200/- was

imposed for assessment year 2007-08 and a similar penalty of

Rs.66,64, 680/- was imposed for Assessment Year 2008-09.

2.2        The assessee's appeals against the quantum additions

and the penalties were upheld by the learned CIT (Appeals) and the

appeals of the assessee were dismissed.

2.3        Aggrieved, the assessee is now before the Tribunal

challenging the quantum additions as well as the penalties imposed

u/s 271(1)(c) for Assessment Years 2007-08 and 2008-09.

2.4        The respective grounds of appeal raised in the four

appeals are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      ITA No.3532/Del/2010 for Asst. Year 2007-08

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      1.    That the entire assessment proceedings are null &amp; void
      and being without jurisdiction since mandatory requirements
      of section 153C (1) of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_5">I.T. Act</a> 1961(in short 'Act') had not
      been strictly complied with. The CIT(A) was not justified in
      rejecting, summarily the legal ground challenging the
      jurisdiction of the AO u/s 153C of the Act, without examining
      the relevant facts and material on record and in simply
      relying on the assessment order.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      2.    That the impugned copy of agreement is not signed on
      behalf of the assessee and therefore, it has no evidentiary
      value in the eye of law in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble
      jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT v kulwant Rai
      291 ITR 36 (Del). Consequently, the alleged agreement could
      not be treated as a evidence against the assessee. Hence, no
      addition could be made solely on the basis of the alleged
      agreement.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">      3.   That the presumption raised by the lower authorities
      against the assessee to the effect that the said agreement
      belong to assessee is illegal since presumption, if any, can
      be raised only against Shri Vipin Verma from whose
      possession the said agreement was taken in to custody by
      the police as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">section 292C</a> of the Act
      which are applicable in the present case. No question was
      ever asked from Mr Vipin Verma in respect of such document
                                                                            Page | 5

                                     (Asst.Years:2007-08 &amp; 2008-09)



and therefore, in the absence of any corroborating evidence,
question of holding that this document belongs to assessee
does not arise. Consequently, question of making any
addition solely on the basis of such document does not arise.


</p><p id="p_9">4.   Through the onus was on revenue to prove the
genuineness of the agreement, the assessee produced the
Balance sheet of <a href="/doc/1870389/" id="a_7">M/s V.M. Reality</a> by way of additional
evidence under Rule 46A which should have been admitted
in the interest of justice. The CIT(A) was not justified in
refusing to admit the same as additional evidence.

</p><p id="p_10">5.   On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law,
the addition of Rs.70 lakhs is not justified and deleted after
the providing an opportunity of being heard to the appellant.

In ITA No.3533/Del/2010 for Asst. Year: 2008-09

</p><p id="p_11">1.     The entire assessment proceedings are null &amp; void and

strictly complied with. The CIT(A) was not justified in
rejecting, summarily the legal ground challenging the
jurisdiction of the AO u/s 153C of the Act, without examining
the relevant facts and material on record and in simply
relying on the assessment order.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.    Without prejudice to above ground, the assessment
made is without jurisdiction since mandatory requirement of
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">section 153C</a> r/w <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">section 153A</a> of the Act remains to be
complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_13">3.    Without prejudice to above grounds, the assessment
made is without jurisdiction since issue of notice u/s 143(2)
of the Act was itself illegal as the mandatory requirement of
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">section 153A</a> itself was not complied with.

</p><p id="p_15">4.   That the addition of Rs.1.98 crore cannot be
made/sustained under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1389379/" id="a_13">section 69A</a> of the
Act since the money was found to be duly recorded in the
books of account. Any asset which is duly recorded in the
books of account cannot be the subject matter of addition
u/s 69<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_14">A of the Act</a>. The CIT(A) was also not justified in not
adjudicating the legal ground .
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.     On merits, the addition made by the Assessing Officer
is illegal because:-
</p>
<p id="p_17">A) the inferences that

</p><p id="p_18">     (i) when cash was found and seized by the police,
     neither there was any entry in the books nor any
     voucher was existing. It was later on that the cash
     credits were arranged and the entries were passed in
     the books of account in the back dates to create the
     sufficient balance in the books of accounts on
     31.01.2008(para 4.8, page 4)and is pad in cash out off
     unexplained sources (para 8), are based on conjecture
     and surmises.
</p>
<p id="p_19">B)    That every employee of an assessee is not supposed to
know the source of money handed over to him for carrying
out the required job and therefore AO was not justified in
holding that assessee could not explain the source of cash
particularly when no statement of any responsible person
was recorded and entries were found duly recorded when
the tax officials made enquiries on 2.2.08.

C)    It is for the businessman to decide in what manner the
business is to be carried on and not for the tax authorities to
decide as to how the business is to be carried on. Hence, AO
was not justified in observing that there was no necessity for
sending the cash to Amritsar for purchasing the property.



</p><p id="p_20">                                                                      Page | 7

                                     (Asst.Years:2007-08 &amp; 2008-09)



D)    That no adequate opportunity was provided to
assessee for producing the cash creditors since for the first
time on 9.12.2009, the assessee was asked to produce them
onl4.12.2009. Despite the paucity of time, the assessee did
produce two of the creditors on 14.12.09 who were
examined by the AO. Both of them admitted that cash
payments were made after making withdrawals from
books/bank. Rajesh Bhalla as well as Hemant Kapoor had
clearly stated in their statements that cash withdrawals
were duly recoded in their books of account but the AO
arbitrarily rejected their explanations without asking them to
produce the relevant books or the bank statements. Such
action of AO was not legally justified. Further, no proper
opportunity was given to produce the remaining parties.
Thus, there was also breach of principles of natural justice.

</p><p id="p_21">6.    On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law,
the addition of Rsl.98 crore is not justified. Hence, it is
prayed that the impugned assessment be quashed or in the
alternative, the necessary relief be allowed after providing
an opportunity of being heard to the appellant.

<p id="p_29">      In view of the above grounds, the appellant respectfully
      pray to the Hon'ble Bench to please delete the unwarranted
      penalty of Rs.66,64,680/- levied u/sec. 271(l)(c) of the Act
      by providing an opportunity of being heard to the appellant.


3.0        At the outset, the learned Authorized Representative (AR)

submitted that an essential legal ground was being raised by the

assessee wherein in ground no. 1 pertaining to assessment year

2007-08 it is the assessee's contention that the assessment framed

u/s 153C was without jurisdiction as the statutory notice u/s 153C

was issued by the ACIT, Circle-9(1) New Delhi based on the

satisfaction note prepared by the ITO, Ward-48(4), New Delhi i.e.,

AO of the searched persons before the issuance of notice u/s 153A

to the searched person. The learned Authorised Representative

submitted that no lawful satisfaction was recorded regarding the

seized unsigned agreement alleged to have been belonging to the

assessee. The learned Authorized Representative submitted that the

notice u/s 153C of the Act was issued on 27.11.2008 after receipt


                                                                             Page | 11

of satisfaction note dated 27.11.2008 from the Assessing Officer of

Sh. Vipin Verma and the assessment order u/s 153C was passed

on 31.12.2009 after making an addition of Rs.70 lacs towards

alleged cash payments for assessment year 2007-08. The learned

Authorized Representative (AR) further submitted that notice u/s

153A was issued to Sh. Vipin Verma on 06.01.2009 and the

assessment was made u/s 143(3) r.w. sec 153A vide order dated

31.12.2009. The learned Authorized Representative (AR) drew our

attention to the copies of the various notices and the assessment

orders to demonstrate the dates on which the above said notices

and assessment years were passed. The learned AR contended that

it is settled law that notice u/s 153C cannot precede notice u/s

153A and, therefore, the notice issued u/s 153C in the case of the

assessee company was unlawful making the assessment null and

void. The learned AR placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/164973756/" id="a_17">CIT vs. Calcutta Knitwears</a> reported in

[2014] 43 Taxmann.com 446 (SC) to buttress his argument that

satisfaction note could not be prepared prior to the issuance of

notice against the searched persons. Reliance was also placed on


                                                                         Page | 12

CBDT Circular No.24/2015 dated 31.12.2015 wherein the CBDT

had clarified that the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court laying

down the guidelines for assessments u/s 158 BD (in the case of <a href="/doc/164973756/" id="a_18">CIT

vs. Calcutta Knitwears</a> (supra)) is also be applicable to proceedings

u/s 153C. Reliance was also placed on certain other judicial

precedents from the Tribunal on the same issue.

3.1       With respect to assessee's appeal for Assessment Year

2008-09, the learned AR submitted that in this year, the

assessment year deserved to be quashed on the ground of non-

issuance and non-service of the mandatory notice u/s 153C of the

Act to the assesse. The Ld. AR submitted that in this case the

search was initiated on 31.01.2008 (relevant to assessment year

2008-09) and the AO of the searched person recorded the

satisfaction note and handed over the requisite material alleged to

be belonging to the assessee to the Assessing Officer of the assessee

on 27.11.2008 relevant to Assessment Year 2009-10 and, therefore,

in view of the settled legal position, the six years in the case of the

assessee will be from the assessment year 2003-04 to Assessment

Year 2008-09 and as such assessment year 2008-09 was to be


                                                                           Page | 13

                                        (Asst.Years:2007-08 &amp; 2008-09)



covered under the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_19">section 153C</a>. Further, the learned

AR submitted that it is borne out from the assessment records and

the satisfaction note that no notice u/s 153C was issued for

assessment year 2008-09 and notices only were issued u/s 143(2)

and the that the assessment was based on the original return filed

on 17.03.2009. The learned AR placed reliance on the numerous

judicial precedents and submitted that in absence of issuance and

service of notice u/s 153C, the jurisdiction for framing the

impugned assessment was wrongly assumed and, therefore, was

unsustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_30">3.2       The learned AR submitted that if the legal grounds were

to be decided in favour of the assessee, no arguments would be

required on the merits of the addition as the grounds pertaining to

the same would become academic in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_31">3.3       The learned AR also submitted that the penalty appeals

would have a consequential effect.

<p id="p_32">4.0       In response, the learned CIT-DR placed reliance on the

concurrent findings of both the lower authorities. The learned CIT-

DR also submitted that the case laws being relied upon by the

assessee were distinguishable on facts and would not squarely

cover the case of the assessee. The learned CIT-DR also submitted

that there were also judicial precedents wherein it had been held

that addition to assessee's income relying on statement recorded

during the search operations cannot be deleted without proving the

statements to be the incorrect. The learned CIT-DR also submitted

that even a statement recorded during the course of survey could be

relied upon for the purposes of assessment in absence of any

contrary evidence or explanation as to why such statement was to

be disbelieved.   The learned CIT-DR submitted that the assessee

had failed to substantiate with cogent evident that no cash

transaction had taken place and in absence of any evidence to the

contrary, it could not be held that agreement was not genuine. The

learned CIT-DR vehemently argued that the assessee's appeals

should be heard on merits also and relief should not be give to the

assessee on mere technicalities.

153<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_20">A of the Act</a> in the case of Sh. Vipin Verma i.e., the searched

person from whom the cash was seized. This notice is undisputedly

dated 6th January, 2009. We also note that in the case of the

assessee, the notice u/s 153C was issued on 27.11.2008 right after

the receipt of the satisfaction note dated 27.11.2008 from the

Assessing Officer of the searched person i.e., Sh. Vipin Verma. The

assessment order was passed on 31.12.2009 in the case of the

assessee whereas and in the case of the Sh. Vipin Verma i.e., the

searched person the notice u/s 153A was issued on 06.01.2009

and   the   assessment   was    completed    on     31.12.2009.            Thus,

admittedly and undisputedly the notice u/s 153C in the case of the

assessee was issued prior to the issuance of notice u/s 153A in the

case of the searched person. We agree with the contention of the ld.

AR that issuance of notice u/s 153C cannot precede issuance of

notice u/s 153A. In this regard, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in

<a href="/doc/164973756/" id="a_21">CIT vs. Calcutta Knitwears</a> (supra), while adjudicating on the timing

of recording of satisfaction note u/s 158BD, that satisfaction note

<p id="p_34">5.1          However, in this case, for assessment year 2007-08, the

notice u/s 153C has been issued prior to the issuance of notice u/s

153A to the searched person. The CBDT Circular No.24/2015 dated

31.12.2015 has instructed that guidelines issued by the Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of Calcutta Knitwears (supra) will also be

applicable to proceedings u/s 153C and, therefore, we are afraid

that the Revenue has no case in terms of the judgment of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/164973756/" id="a_22">CIT vs. Calcutta Knitwears</a>

Since, undisputedly, the satisfaction note in the case of the

assessee was prepared prior to the issuance of notice to the

searched person, the assessment for assessment year 2007-08

becomes null and void because the assumption of jurisdiction u/s

and undisputedly no notice u/s 153C was issued in assessee's case

for assessment year 2008-09 and only notice u/s 143(2) was

issued, it is our considered opinion that the impugned assessment

has not been passed in conformity with the provisions of law. We

note that the impugned assessment order has been passed u/s

143(3) and no notice u/s 153C has been issued although this year

falls within the period of six years when counted from the date of

recording of satisfaction note which is deemed date of search. The

Assessing Officer should have framed the assessment u/s 153C of

the Act for assessment year 2008-09 also and should have at the

time of initiating the proceedings against the assessee issued notice

u/s 153C of the Act which has not so be done in this case. The

issuance of notice u/s 153C is mandatory and is a pre-condition if

the case falls within the block period of six years. The assessment
