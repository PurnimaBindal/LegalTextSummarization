 SUIT FOR DAMAGES OF RS.5,00,000/­ (RUPEES FIVE LACS
ONLY) AND FOR PERMANENT &amp; MANDATORY INJUNCTIONS


JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">    1.            The present suit has been against the defendant
         seeking permanent, mandatory injunction along with
         damages to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/­        for using the
         registered trademark of the plaintiff in respect of his
         business.
</p>

<p id="p_2">BRIEF FACTS


</p><p id="p_3">    2.            As per averments made in the plaint, plaintiff, a
         partnership firm, is engaged in the business of bakery i.e.
         manufacturing, processing, preparing and selling of breads,
         biscuits, cakes, rusk, pastry etc. under the its registered
         trademark 'SSSB' vide No.01882532. It is averred that the
         trademark/ tradename/ "SSSB" due to long, continuous,
         extensive and exclusive use for over 15 years has become
         distinctive and has earned wide recognition, reputation
         and good will among the general public since plaintiff has
         been investing huge amount on the advertisement,
         promotion, sale and publicity of the same through printing,
         visual and electronic media.

<p id="p_4"> Shri Sahu Bakers vs. Jamaluddin



</p><p id="p_5">    3.            It is further averred that defendant, who is also
         engaged in the business of bakery, has been using the
         trademark "SB" in relation to its business which is similar
         to the registered trademark of the plaintiff. Even the colour
         combination and packing i.e. wrappers, use of sun, and
         ingredients of products used by the defendant are similar
         to that of the plaintiff with the malafide intention to
         mislead the public and thereby infringing the plaintiff's
         proprietory rights. It is the grievance of the plaintiff that
         use of its registered trademark by the defendant for its
         bakery business is creating confusion and deception among
         the public and trade channel. Consequently, plaintiff issued
         a legal notice dated 15.01.2011 to the defendant calling
         him upon to desist from manufacturing, selling and
         offering for sale under the trademark "SB" but despite
         service, defendant did not reply to the same. Hence, the
         present suit for permanent, mandatory injunction and
         damages against the defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_6">WRITTEN STATEMENT


</p><p id="p_7">    4.            On service of summons of the suit, defendant
         appeared before the Court and filed his written statement
         wherein he took the preliminary objection that the suit of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Suit No.52/2016                                              Page 3 of 24</span>
 Shri Sahu Bakers vs. Jamaluddin



         the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed on the ground of same
         having been filed without any cause of action; that plaintiff
         did not approach the court with clean hand; that plaintiff
         did not pay the property court fee; that the suit has been
         filed on false &amp; frivolous grounds; that there is no violation
         of the trademark of the plaintiff; and that plaintiff is not
         the registered owner of the trademark. On merits,
         defendants denied all the allegations made by the plaintiff
         and prayed for dismissal of the suit.

         raised by the defendant by reiterating the averments made

         cross examination on behalf of defendant, he admitted that
         the logo registered by the Registrar is to be used the same
         as it is in all the packing material without any difference
         either in font, colour, scheme, design etc.; that the logo

         registered and is depicted on the Registration Certificate­

         Ex.PW1/X3 did not bear any logo and the logo on
         Ex.PW1/X2 is different from the logo depicted on

</p><p id="p_38">    11.           I have heard the Learned counsel for the plaintiff
         and have gone through the record. Learned counsel for the
         plaintiff has invited the attention of this court towards the
         certificate of registration­ Ex.PW1/14; Ex.PW1/2­certified
         copy of "Additional Representation" filed by the plaintiff
         while contending that the plaintiff has been using the
         trademark "SSSB" from the year 2009 and that the
         application has been duly published in the trademark
         journal on 27.09.2010. He has contended that as per the
         certificate Ex.PW1/2 and the copy of the extracts from the
         trademark journal Ex.PW1/5, the trademark "SSSB" with
         the graphic representation of Sun over the word "SSSB"
         have been registered in the name of the plaintiff's
         partnership concern, in Class­30, relating to the Bread,
         Biscuits, cakes, rusks and pastry. Learned counsel for the
         plaintiff has further contended that Ex.PW1/8 and

         trademark "SSSB" consistently, as a registered trademark

         No.1882532. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further
         invited attention of this Court towards the packaging being
         used by the defendant­Ex.PW1/X2 and Ex.PW1/X3. He has
         contended that from the packaging­Ex.PW1/X2, it is more
         than clear that the defendant has been encashing upon the
         trademark of the plaintiff in as much as the mark being
         used by the defendant is almost identical to the trademark
         of the plaintiff and the colour scheme of the trade­dress/
         packaging also is absolutely the same. He has further
         contended that even the other features of the packaging
         like the placement of "Suji Toast", "Special Gull Ka Toast,",
         "Suji ke Toast" as well as placement of "100% Pure
         Vegetarian", "Choice of Millions", the placement of green
         dot indicating vegetarian product, as well as the terms
         "delicious and crunchy snack" as printed towards the foot
         of the packaging are absolutely same barring the font type
         and size. He has further contended that even the spelling
         mistake in the term "crunchy" (printed as cauranchy) has
         also been copied absolutely by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_39">    12.           Plaintiff side has further contended that it is a clear
         case whereby the defendant has adopted "SB" in order to
         pass off his goods as the goods of the plaintiff, knowingly
         well that the trademark "SSSB" stands duly registered. It is
         further contended that even as per the application placed

         by the defendant, user of their proposed mark is from June,
         2010, which is subsequent to the user by the plaintiff in
         relation to the plaintiff's trademark.
</p><p id="p_40">    13.              Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further
         contended that the colour scheme and overall get up of the
         packaging clearly indicate that it is a case of copying the
         trademark and trade­dress of the plaintiff, in order to
         encash upon the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation and
         even on the back­side of the packaging, the similarity is
         quite noticeable.
</p><p id="p_41">    14.           Defendant side has not come present nor has filed
         any written submissions despite opportunities. Although
         certain documents have been placed by the defendant but
         the same have not been proved in accordance with law.
         Before proceeding further, the law relating to the grant of
         injunction and requisites in passing off action needs
         reference.
</p><p id="p_42">    15.           The Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also invited
         attention of the Court to the Ex.PW1/14­ certificate of
         registration issued on 23.03.2011 i.e. some time after the
         filing of the suit. He submitted that the certificate has been
         issued subsequently but the application was filed in the
         year 2009.

         governing the reliefs of infringement and action of passing
         off seems desirable, which are reproduced as under:
</p><p id="p_44">         (i)      <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_1">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. vs. The Zamindara
         Engineering Co</a>. 1969 (2) Supreme Court Cases 727,
         Hon'ble Supreme Court held that an infringement action is
         quite distinguished from a 'passing off action' although the
         two are similar also in same respects.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  "In passing off action the issue is:­

                  Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed
                  or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are
                  plaintiff's goods?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  But in an infringement action the issue is:­

                  Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or
                  which is a coloured imitation of the plaintiff's registered
                  trade mark.</blockquote>


<p id="p_45">                  On the other hand the gist of a passing off action is that A
                  is not entitled to representation his goods as the goods of B
                  but it is not necessary for B to prove that A did this

                  defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of
                  which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar. This has
                  necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two
                  marks­ the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist
                  to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying
                  down objective standards. The persons who would be
                  deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is
                  the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of
                  consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or
                  in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The
                  purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the
                  essential features of the plaintiff's trademark are to be
                  found in that used by the defendant. The identification of
                  the essential features of the mark is in essence a question of
                  fact and depends on the judgment of the Court based on the
                  evidence led before it has regards the usage of the trade. It
                  should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the
                  equity in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the
                  defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the

         interconnected. Having regard to the above submission,
         and having gone through the records placed by the
         plaintiff, the Court is of the opinion that the defendant, in
         utter disregard to the Intellectual Property rights of the
         plaintiff, has copied the trademark, the colour scheme, the
         trade­dress of the plaintiff, indiscriminately, and to such an
         extent that even the spelling mistakes have been copied,
         without any application of mind. The similarity between
         the trademark and trade­dress/ packaging is to such an
         extent that the plaintiff's case "likelihood of confusion" is
         fully established. True that in the trademark adopted by
         the defendant, there is difference of letters "S" in as much
         as the plaintiff's trademark comprises of "SSSB" and the
         defendant's mark is "SB", which is super imposed over the
         graphic representation of Sun with rays emanating
         therefrom, but the difference is just symbolic, and carefully
         crafted.

         point of an ordinary customer, and not necessarily from the

         that the products are common, merchandise, being used by

         likelihood of confusion.
</p><p id="p_64">    20.           As regards the deception, the overall get up, as has
         been used by the plaintiff for its trademark and packaging,
         has been copied indiscriminately and there is no evidence
         on record that the same is bonafide. By any stretch of
         imagination such an imitation cannot be assumed to be
         bonafide or innocent adoption of the trademark and trade­
         dress of the plaintiff. Besides since the plaintiff was able to
         highlight certain similarities, it fell upon the defendant,
         quite heavily, to prove the adoption as bonafide and not to
         deceive.
</p><p id="p_65">    21.           The mark adopted by the defendant, when collated
         with that of the plaintiff, shows that the defendant had
         willfully and consciously adopted the term "SB", sign of
         "Sun with emanating rays", positioning of other texts/

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                  "Proof of actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a
                  passing off action whether the relief asked for is

<p id="p_73">    27.           It has been held that actual damages is not
         necessary. Considering that the plaintiff have been able to
         prove blatant passing off by the defendant, the plaintiff is
         entitled to damages. The absence of any evidence in this
         regard cannot be amounted to deny damages to the
         plaintiff. Having regard to the nature of the business, the
         products line, and other relevant considerations, I am of
         the opinion that a sum of Rs.2,00,000/­ would suffice the
         purpose of damages.
