<p id="p_167">P.K. Misra, C.J. In these writ petitions, the primary challenge is to the validity of

        notification issued by the State Government fixing the rate of duty payable

        by the various sugar mills and other organizations generating electricity in

        their own power plants.

        consumption of electrical energy in the State of Bihar. Its validity was

        legislative competence.

<p id="p_176">The validity of this notification has been challenged by the very same Sugar

Mill Association by filing CWJC No. 13614 of 2006.                  The Indian Oil

Corporation has also filed separate writ petitions viz. CWJC Nos.5906 and

5708 of 2009 challenging the validity of the provisions in <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_33">Section 3(1)</a> as

amended in 2005 and the notifications issued. The other writ petitions have

been filed by various Sugar Mills challenging the orders of assessment. The

contentions which are raised in the batch of writ petitions being similar, all the

writ petitions have been heard together and are being disposed of by the

present common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_177">4          The basic contention raised in all the writ petitions is to the effect that

by incorporating an additional provision in <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_34">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act delegating

the power of levying tax on the basis of the "value of electrical energy

consumed or sold" without giving any guidelines, such amended provision has

become ultra vires as it has delegated the legislative function to the Executive,

that too without laying down any guidelines whatsoever, thereby making such

provisions arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_178">4.1        While elaborating upon the above basic contention, the counsel

appearing for the various petitioners and more particularly Dr. Debi Pal,

Senior Advocate, have submitted that as per the provision of <a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_35">Section 3</a> before

its amendment and <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_36">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_37">5</a> which have not been amended, duty is

required to be paid "on the units of energy consumed or sold", but, as per the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                     16</span>


amended <a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_38">Section 3</a>, it is now contemplated that duty shall be paid either "on

the units of energy consumed or sold" or "on the value of energy consumed or

sold". This is impermissible, according to the learned counsel, being contrary

to the scheme of the Act, more particularly <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_39">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_40">5</a>, which have not

been amended.
</p>
<p id="p_179">4.2     The next submission is to the effect that even though the amended

provision contemplates payment of duty "on the value of energy consumed or

sold", the important question, as to how "value of energy consumed or sold" is

to be ascertained, has not been indicated in the statutory provision and has

been left to the unbridled discretion of the Executive without laying any

guideline whatsoever and thus it amounts to excessive delegation of legislative

function.
</p>
<p id="p_180">4.3         It is further submitted that the provision does not lay down any

principle or guideline as to in which case the duty is to be levied, "on the unit

of energy consumed or sold" and "on the value of energy consumed or sold",

thereby giving scope for arbitrary exercise of executive power. The effect of

the amendment makes the statutory provisions contained in <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_41">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_42">5</a>

totally unworkable, making it impossible for the assessee to file return as per

the statutory provisions, the rules and the prescribed forms.
</p>
<p id="p_181">4.4     So far as the validity of the subsequent notification - S.O No.14 dated

4.3.2005 is concerned, it has been submitted that <a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_43">Section 3</a> as amended only

permits the Executive, that is to say the State Government, to specify the rates

at which the duty is to be levied by issuing notification. But, in the present

case, the State Government has apparently issued a notification incorporating a

definition of the expression "value of energy" by prescribing that "the value of

energy ...... shall be equivalent to the energy tariff as fixed by B.S.E.B",
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                      17</span>


thereby arrogating to itself the legislative function of defining a particular

expression.
</p>
<p id="p_182">4.5     The other ground of challenge to the validity of the said notification is

that by indicating that the rate of duty of 6% of the energy tariff as fixed by the

Bihar State Electricity Board (the Board, for brevity), the State Government,

which is the delegated authority to fix the rate at which duty is to be levied,

has further sub-delegated such power to the Board. In other words, the rate is

now fixed by the Board and not by the State Government in as much as if the

Board increases the tariff, the 6% of "value of energy" would go up and if, on

the other hand, the Board decreases the tariff, the 6% of "value of energy"
</p>
<p id="p_183">would be reduced and, therefore, ultimately, it is the discretion of the Board,

which will ultimately determine the rate at which the duty shall be levied and

not of the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_184">4.6     It is further submitted that there is no basis for laying down that the

person, who is consuming electrical energy generated by its own captive DG

set or power plants, has to pay duty at 6% of the value of energy, which is

equivalent to the energy tariff fixed by the Board, whereas others have been

subjected to payment of duty at a different rate. In the absence of any basis for

such classification and nexus between the basis of classification and the object

sought to be achieved, the provision suffers from the vice of arbitrary

discrimination, thereby violating <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_44">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_185">5       In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State, it is contended that

there is no excessive delegation of any essential legislative function and the

amendment of <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_45">Section 3(1)</a> as well as the notification issued by the State

specifying the rate as contained in the Schedule is valid.
</p>
<p id="p_186">5.1     The learned Advocate General, appearing for the State, has submitted

that while imposing a tax, the State must have the necessary leeway or „play at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                        18</span>


the joints‟ and can tax at different rates. In the present case, according to him,

the electrical energy used or sold for irrigation purpose is subjected to payment

of duty at a different and may be reduced rate, but the classification itself is

self-explanatory as there is justified and felt necessity for encouraging

agricultural activities. It has been further submitted by him that the expression

"value of energy" can have an accepted meaning by keeping in view the

purpose for which the energy is used and it is obvious that the amount which a

person is liable to pay is the value of such energy. If the energy is „consumed‟,

the amount which a person is required or would be required to pay for such

energy is obviously the value of such energy and keeping in view this well

accepted meaning, it has been specified in the notification dated 4.3.2005 that

the value will be equivalent to the energy tariff as fixed by the Board. It is

further submitted that if the energy is used or consumed for domestic purpose,

the tariff as applicable to such domestic user would represent the value and if

energy is used or consumed for commercial purpose, the tariff as applicable

for commercial purpose would be the value and similarly if the energy is used

for industrial purpose, the tariff as fixed for industrial purpose would represent

the value and, therefore, it cannot be said that there is any confusion.

<p id="p_187">6        Before we delve further, it would be appropriate to notice some of the

relevant decisions touching upon the question relating to interpretation of

taxing statutes.
</p>
<p id="p_188">6.1      <a href="/doc/1609912/" id="a_46">In M/s. Govind Saran Ganga Saran v. Commissioner of Sales Tax

and others</a> (AIR 1985 SC 1041), it was observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                                    ―6. The components which enter into the concept
                    of a tax are well known. The first is the character of the
                    imposition known by its nature which prescribes the taxable
                    event attracting the levy, the second is a clear indication of the
                    person on whom the levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay
                    the tax, the third is the rate at which the tax is imposed, and the
                    fourth is the measure or value to which the rate will be applied
                    for computing the tax liability. If those components are not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                        19</span>


                    clearly and definitely ascertainable, it is difficult to say that the
                    levy exists in point of law. Any uncertainty or vagueness in the
                    legislative scheme defining any of those components of the levy
                    will be fatal to its validity‖. (emphasis added)


6.2     <a href="/doc/1350547/" id="a_47">In A.V Fernandez v. State of Kerala</a> (AIR 1957 SC 657), the

Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court observed thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">                                     ―29. It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal
                    statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one
                    must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to
                    the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law. If the Revenue
                    satisfies the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions
                    of the law, the subject can be taxed. If, on the other hand, the
                    case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of
                    the taxing statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or by
                    analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the
                    legislature and by considering what was the substance of the
                    matter. We must of necessity, therefore, have regard to the actual
                    provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder before we
                    can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to
                    assessment as contended by the Sales Tax Authorities.‖

                    shall not interpret the statutory provision in such a manner
                    which would create an additional fiscal burden on a person. It
                    would never be done by invoking the provisions of another Act,

                    the provisions in favour of a taxpayer and against the Revenue.‖



  7     We have already noticed the provisions of the Act keeping in view the

  historical perspective. If one compares the provision of <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_49">Section 3(1)</a> as it

  originally stood with such provision after amendment, the following

  distinctive picture emerges. As per the provision contained in <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_50">Section 3(1)</a>

  before amendment, the consumer of electricity or the seller of electrical

  energy was required to pay at a particular rate to be fixed by the Legislature

  in the Schedule as per the unit of electricity consumed or sold. In other

  words, the rate was fixed by the Legislature and the liability to pay duty was

  measured on the basis of the unit of energy consumed or sold. As per the

amended provision, the levy can be either on units of the energy consumed

or sold or "on the value of energy" consumed or sold. As per the unamended

provision, the rate of levy on the unit consumed was being fixed by the

Legislature in the Schedule, whereas as per the amended provision, the rate

at which the levy is to be made on the unit consumed or sold is left to be

specified by the State Government in a notification. In addition to the above

method, the amended provision also contemplates that the rate can be fixed

by the State Government by notification "on the value of energy" consumed

or sold. As per the amended provision, while the first proviso empowers the

State Government to specify different rates of duty in respect of different

categories of consumption or sale of energy, as per the second proviso, it is

laid down that the duty shall not exceed 20 paise per unit consumed or sold

and shall not exceed 10% of the value of energy in case the duty is levied on

the basis of the value of energy.

<p id="p_189">7.1    We have also extracted the notification which was issued in the year

2002 which indicates that for the electrical energy consumed or sold for the

purpose of irrigation, the concerned person was required to pay at the rate of

4 paise per unit and in respect of electrical energy consumed or sold for any

purpose other than irrigation, the person concerned was required to pay 6%

of the value of energy. Under the subsequent notification dated 4.3.2005, as

per the third entry added to the schedule, a person is required to pay at the

rate of 6% of the value of energy in respect of consumption of electrical

energy generated by the captive DG set/captive power plants. It has been

indicated that the value of energy shall be equivalent to the energy tariff

fixed by the B.S.E.B.
</p>
<p id="p_190">8      The expression "value of energy" is not defined in the Statute. The

word „value‟ can be used either as a noun or as a verb. When used as a noun,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                    21</span>


it means, as per the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, „how much is

worth in money or other goods for which it can be exchanged‟. In the

Chambers Dictionary, the meaning of the word „value‟, when it is used as a

noun, is „worth; a fair equivalent; intrinsic worth or goodness‟. When used

as a verb, the meaning is given as „to estimate the worth of; to rate at a

price‟. When any particular expression used in a Statute is not defined, its

well accepted meaning in ordinary parlance is required to be applied.
</p>
<p id="p_191">9      Can it be said that the expression „value of energy‟ has a well

accepted meaning leaving no scope for any ambiguity? If a person purchases

energy and consumes the same, the amount spent for the purchase of such

energy can be considered as the value of such energy. If a person purchases

energy and sells the same, what is the value of energy so far as he is

concerned? Is it the amount spent by him for the purchase of such energy or

is it the amount for which he sells such energy? When a person generates

energy and consumes the same, what is the value of energy so far as he is

concerned? Is it the cost of generation? Or is it the „profit‟ he makes that is to

say the cost of such energy which he would have otherwise paid minus the

cost of generation? Or is it the entire cost of energy he which would have

otherwise paid if he would have purchased the same from available source?
</p>
<p id="p_192">9.1    It is interesting to note that in the counter affidavit, which has been

filed on behalf of the State in the batch of writ petitions, wherein the

notification - S.O No.137 dated 21.10.2002 was challenged, it has been

indicated that the expression „value of energy‟ is equivalent to the cost of

manufacture of such energy incurred by the various sugar mill owners. In

other words, at that point of time, even the State Government considered that

the value of energy was equivalent to the cost of generation of such energy.
</p>
<p id="p_193">9.2    Thus it appears that the expression "value of energy" is a verbal cast
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                    22</span>


of many colours and cannot be said to have a precise meaning to be adopted

in every case. If it is purchased from some source and consumed, the value

may be the cost of such purchase. If it is generated by the person concerned

and thereafter consumed by him, the value may be equivalent to the cost of

generation or the „saving‟ made. . If it is sold, the value may be equivalent to

the sale price, whereas if it is not sold, the value may be different.
</p>
<p id="p_194">10     In such a scenario, the amended provision leaving it open to the State

Government to levy duty on the value of energy consumed or on the value of

energy sold can be held to be an obvious instance of excessive delegation of

power, leaving it to the unbridled discretion and the unguided wisdom of the

Executive to adopt any method.
</p>
<p id="p_195">11     In this context, it has to be remembered that if a person purchases

electrical energy from any licensee, he has to pay certain amount for

purchase of such energy. The value or price at which such energy is sold by

the licensee is dependent upon so many factors such as the expenses, the

margin of profit, loss of energy in transmission and transformation, the

policy of subsidizing a particular sector of consumer and the like.           A

consumer who generates electricity and consumes such energy by himself

and the consumer who purchases electricity and consumes the same cannot

be treated alike. If the price of the energy supplied also includes certain

amounts towards the loss of energy in transmission and transformation and

yet the value of energy is calculated by taking into account such tariff, it

would obviously be contrary to the provision contained in <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_51">Section 3(1)</a>,

which envisages levy of duty either on the unit or on the value of the energy

consumed or sold, excluding loss of energy in transmission and

transformation. Though there may be some justification in assuming that the

value of energy, so far as the purchaser is concerned, is equivalent to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                   23</span>


price paid by such purchaser for availing the energy, can it be said that it is

of the same value qua a person who generates electricity and consumes it

himself? Since all these factors are left to the wisdom and discretion without

any guideline whatsoever, in our considered opinion, the provision, so far as

it envisages payment of duty on the value of energy consumed or sold, is

liable to be struck down on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative

function.
</p>
<p id="p_196">12     The subsequent amendment as per S.O No.14 dated 4.3.2005 cannot

have the effect of improving the matter for the State in as much as such

notification, in effect, purports to provide a definition for the expression

„value of energy‟ by indicating that the value of energy shall be equivalent to

the energy tariff as fixed by the Board. This amendment has been made

applicable for the persons who are consuming electrical energy generated by

their own captive DG/power plants. In this connection, it has been rightly

submitted by the counsel appearing for all the petitioners and more

particularly Dr. Debi Pal that by the notification, the State Government has

further delegated its power of fixing the rate to the Board. This is

impermissible as it is well known that a delegated authority cannot further

sub-delegate its power. If the notification is accepted as valid, it would mean

that whenever the Board enhances the energy tariff, there will be automatic

enhancement of the duty which would be offending the scheme of the

provision. As per the provision in <a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_52">Section 3</a> as amended, it is for the State

Government to specify the rate at which duty is payable. By stating that the

person will be liable to pay 6% of the value of energy which is equivalent to

the energy tariff as fixed by the Board, the delegated power to fix the rate at

which „duty‟ is payable is further sub-delegated to the Board. In other

words, it is ultimately the tariff fixed by the Board which would be the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    24</span>


governing factor and it cannot be said that the rate is being fixed by the State

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_197">13     It is, no doubt, true that as per <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_53">Section 3(1)</a> as amended and more

particularly as per the proviso to sub-section (1), the State Government may

specify different rates of duty in respect of different categories of

consumption or sale of energy. It is well known that while fixing tariff, the

Board or the Regulatory Commission fixes different tariff for different

categories of consumers. The domestic user is normally called upon to

purchase energy from the licensee at a lower rate as compared to a

commercial user or an industrial user. Similarly at times distinction is made

between the consumers in a rural area and the consumers in an urban area.
</p>
<p id="p_198">Distinction is also at times made between the consumers during peak hours

and non-peak hours and, therefore, it is obvious that the State Government

may specify different rates of duties in respect of different categories of

consumption or sale of energy, obviously, keeping in view the relevant

factors. However, the provision in <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_54">Section 3(1)</a> that duty can be levied on the

units or on the value of energy consumed or sold does not contain any basic

policy giving any guideline. It is not discernible from the statutory provision

itself as to in which case duty will be levied at the rate calculated on the basis

of the "unit consumed or sold" or "on the value of energy consumed or sold".
</p>
<p id="p_199">The legislature, instead of indicating instances wherein the duty will be

leviable „on the value of energy consumed or sold‟ and instances where it

will be on the basis of the units of energy consumed or sold, has left it to the

unguided wisdom of the executive. It is, no doubt, true that ultimately the

value of energy has to be measured keeping in view the sum total or the

aggregate of all the units consumed or sold. However, without providing the

basic guideline in which case it would be on the basis of units consumed or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                       25</span>


in which case it is on the basis of value of energy, in our considered opinion,

the legislature has abdicated its function and left the matter to the unguided

discretion of the executive. It can be said that there is an effacement to such

an extent that the provision can be said to be arbitrary and hit by the principle

of excessive delegation.

                Schedule are taken into consideration. For the purpose of
                levying any charge, not only has the charge to be authorised by
                law, it has also to be computed. The charging provision and

              that the dominance of public interest is significant and we refer
              to the various factors, namely, (a) prevailing charges for
              supply of energy in any area, (b) the generating capacity of any
              plant, (c) the need to promote industrial production generally

              different classes of consumption of energy or allow any

              Government, the High Court was of the view that the said
              observations of the State Government clearly showed that the
              State Government did not address itself to the need of
              promoting aluminium industry for increasing production of
              aluminium which would in the long run save foreign exchange.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">              We are unable to agree. What was paramount before
              introduction of the development programme and how the funds
              should be allocated and how far the Government considers
              negligible increase and rise in the cost of aluminium for the
              purpose of raising monies for other development activities are
              matters of policy to be decided by the Government. It is true as
              the High Court has pointed out that the question regarding
              public interest and need to promote indigenous industrial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                     29</span>


production was related with the question of exemption of duty.
</blockquote><p id="p_201">But what the High Court missed, in our opinion with respect,
was that a matter of policy which should be left to the
Government. Reading the order of the Government, it appears
to us that the Government had adverted itself to all the aspects
of sub-s. (4) of<a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_77"> S. 3</a> of the Act. It is true that certain amount of
encouragement was given to Hindalco to start the industry in a
backward area. After considerable point of time the very low
rate of duty was charged. But if we need other sectors of
growth and development for example, food, shelter, water,
rural electrification, the need for encouragement to aluminium
industry had to be subordinated by little high cost because that
is a matter on which the Government as representing the will
of the people is the deciding factor. Price fixation, in our
opinion, which is ultimately the basis of rise in cost because of
the rise of the electricity duty, is not a matter for investigation
of Court. This question was examined by this Court in <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_78">Union of
India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a> (1987) 2 SCC 720: (AIR 1987 SC
1802) where one of our learned brothers who delivered the
judgment of the High Court of Allahabad was a party. There in
exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_79">section 3(2)(c)</a> of the Essential
Commodities Act, the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1979 was
made. The Central Government thereafter issued notification
thereunder. At page 741 (of SCC) at p.1810 of AIR) of the
report, Chinnappa Reddy, J. speaking for the Court referring
to a passage of the Administrative Law by Schwartz with
approval expressed the view that those powers were more or
less legislative in character. Fixation of electricity tariff can
also to a certain extent be regarded of this category.
Chinnappa Reddy, J observed at page 735 (of SCC) : (at p.
1806 of AIR) of the report that price fixation is more in the
nature of a legislative activity than any other. He referred to
the fact that due to the proliferation of delegated legislation,
there is a tendency for the line between legislation and
administration to vanish into an illusion. Administrative, quasi-
judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and,
conversely, legislative activity tends to fade into and present an
appearance of an administrative or quasi-judicial activity. Any
attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and
administrative functions, it has been said, is ‗difficult in theory
and impossible in practice'. Reddy, J. insisted that it is
necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different
legal rights and consequences may ensue. It appears to us that
sub-section (4) of<a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_80"> S. 3</a> of the Act in the set up is quasi-
legislative and quasi-administrative in so far as it has power to
fix different rates having regard to certain factors and in so far
as it has power to grant exemption in some cases, in our
opinion, is quasi-legislative in character. Such a decision must
be arrived at objectively and in consonance with the principles
of natural justice. It is correct that with regard to the nature of
the power under<a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_81"> S. 3(4)</a> of the Act when the power is exercised
with reference to any class it would be in the nature of
subordinate legislation but when the power is exercised with
reference to individual it would be administrative. Reference
was made in this connection to the cases of <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_82">Union of India v.
Cynamide India Ltd</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/231666/" id="a_83">P.J Irani v. State of Madras</a>,

</p><p id="p_203">                    90. In the premises, the High Court was in error in setting
                    aside the order of the State Government in its entirety. The
                    High Court should have allowed the claim of Hindalco for the
                    reduced rate of bill on the basis that Renusagar Power Plant
                    was its own source of generation under <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_84">section 3(1)(c)</a> and the
                    bills should have been made by the Board on that basis. But the
                    High Court was in error in upholding the respondents'
                    contention that the State Government acted improperly and not
                    in terms of <a href="/doc/860740/" id="a_85">section 3(4)</a> of the Act and in violation of the
                    principles of natural justice. We, therefore, allow the appeal to
                    the extent indicated above and set aside the judgment of the
                    Allahabad High Court to that extent and restore the State
                    Government's impugned order subject to the modification of
                    the bills on the basis of own source of generation. We,
                    therefore, direct that the electricity bills must be so made as to
                    give Hindalco the benefit of the rate applicable to its own
                    source of generation from Renusagar Plant‖.

<p id="p_204">16      We do not think the aforesaid decision, in any way, advances the

cause of the State Government. <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_86">In U.P. Act</a>, sufficient guidelines had been

provided as to under what circumstances exemption can be granted or not. In

the present case, in the absence of any parameters indicated in the Statute

regarding evaluation of „value of energy consumed or sold‟, the executive by

taking upon itself the task of defining the meaning of „value of energy‟ as

equivalent to the tariff fixed by the Board has far exceeded its assigned and

delegated role of fixing the rate of duty.

                    delegation of legislative power outside the permissible limits is
                    again without any merit. It was settled by the majority

                    1912 etc', AIR 1951 SC 332 (B) that essential powers of
                    legislation cannot be delegated. In other words, the Legislature
                    cannot delegate its function of laying down legislative policy in
                    respect of a measure and its formulation as a rule of conduct.
                    The Legislature must declare the policy of the law and the
                    legal principles which are to control any given cases and must
                    provide a standard to guide the officials or the body in power
                    to execute the law. The essential legislative function consists in
                    the determination or choice of the legislative policy and of
                    formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct.

<blockquote id="blockquote_55">                                   In the present case the Legislature has laid
                   down such a principle and that principle is the maintenance or
                   increase in supply of essential commodities and of securing
                   equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. The

                   is unnecessary therefore to consider this question in greater
                   detail.‖

There cannot be any doubt about the proposition of law as expounded in AIR

1951 SC 332, which has been subsequently followed and applied to facts and

circumstances of a particular case, in many subsequent Supreme Court

decisions, including Harishankar Bagla's case (supra). In Harishankar

Bagla's case (supra), in the facts and circumstances of that case, it was found

that sufficient guidelines had been indicated and only the non essential

functions have been delegated. In the present case, in our considered opinion,

in the absence of any precise meaning attributable to the expression „value of

energy‟, the amended provision has become unworkable and susceptible of

being applied differently by the executive without any basic guideline relating

to exercise of such power and, therefore, is vulnerable. Similarly, the views

expressed in <a href="/doc/797174/" id="a_92">Pandit Banarsi Das Bhanot and others v. State of Madhya

Pradesh and others</a> (AIR 1958 SC 909) pressed into service by the learned

Advocate General are of no assistance in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_207">18    It has to be found out in every case whether there is delegation of

legislative function or whether any guideline has been provided for exercise of

executive power. <a href="/doc/1231443/" id="a_93">In the Corporation of Calcutta and another v. Liberty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                     32</span>


Cinema</a> (AIR 1965 SC 1107), the provision contained in Section 548(2) of the

Calcutta Municipal Act was found not vitiated by the principle of excessive

delegation. It was observed that fixation of rate of tax may be legitimately left

by a statute to a non-legislative authority. The challenge in the present case is

not relating to delegation of authority to fix the rate inasmuch as the upper

limit of rate which can be fixed has been indicated by the legislature. But the

challenge is on the ground that enabling the executive to fix tax at a rate

depending upon the „value of energy‟, without defining what is the meaning of

value of energy, has made the provision vulnerable to the challenge on the

ground of excessive delegation. Similarly, the observation made in <a href="/doc/883586/" id="a_94">M/s. Devi

Das Gopal Krishnan and others v. State of Punjab and others</a> (AIR 1967

SC 1895) is also not applicable to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the

present case.
</p>
<p id="p_208">19    In view of the above discussion, the amendment of <a href="/doc/1753421/" id="a_95">Section 3(1)</a>, so far

as it provides for payment of duty "on the value of energy", is liable to be

struck down as there is no guideline provided in the statute as to in which case

the duty will be payable calculated on the basis of the value of energy

consumed or sold. Similarly, the notification dated 21.10.2002 providing for

payment of duty at 6 percentum of the value of energy is liable to be quashed

as there is no guideline provided for ascertaining the value of energy. The

subsequent notification - S.O No. 14 dated 4.3.2005 is also liable to be struck

down on the self same ground. Since the amendment and the notifications are

found to be inoperative, it is obvious that the duty will be payable as per the

schedule which was in vogue by virtue of the Bihar Electricity Duty

(Amendment) Act, 1993.
