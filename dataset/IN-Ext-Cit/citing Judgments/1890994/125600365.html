                      Senior Counsel appearing for the respective parties, it is but necessary to

                      understand the background to the issuance of the impugned Government

                      Order as well as the consequential tender notification.

</p><p id="p_19">                            3.2   The genesis of the mid-day meal scheme is traceable to

                      Pre-Independence India, when a scheme was introduced in 1925 in the

                      Madras Corporation. This was later followed by Pondicherry Government

                      under French Administration in the year 1930. Thereafter, the then State

                      of Madras pioneered the first full-fledged mid-day meal programme, in

                      primary schools in the year 1962-63 with the twin objects of providing

                      at least one good meal a day to young children and to increase the

                      number of children attending the primary schools. Consequently, the

                      Government of Tamil Nadu upgraded the said programme into the

                      Nutritious Meal Programme in the year 1982 to combat widespread

                      malnutrition amongst the children and subsequently, introduced a

                      Scheme for supplying boiled eggs in the noon meal, in the year 1989 with

                      one egg per week and thereafter, it was improved by providing two eggs

                      in a week. The provision of eggs in the noon meal scheme was

                      discontinued temporarily and it was re-introduced in the year 2004. From

                      2010, eggs are provided on all five days in a week from Monday to Friday

                      to all the beneficiaries in the school noon meal centres.

</p><p id="p_20">                            3.3   Originally, eggs were procured through a Centralised State

                      level single tender system. Thereafter, in the year 2006, District-wise

                      tender was floated first by three months and then by every month, which

                      was in vogue till 2012, which led to the formation of cartels and other

                      defects.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                            3.4   To rectify all the defects, the first respondent passed

                      G.O.Ms.No.264,     Social     Welfare   and    Nutritious   Meal   Programme

                      Department, dated 17.10.2012 (for short, “G.O.Ms.No.264”) and adopted

                      the methodology of floating State-wise tender for the supply of eggs to all

                      the noon meal centres in the entire State. As per the said G.O., the

                      Tender Inviting Authority floated State level tender and the terms and

                      conditions were designed as per the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders

                      Act (for short, “the Act”) and the Rules made thereunder and contracts

                      were awarded to the qualified tenderers for the past five years from

                      2013-14 to 2017-18.

<p id="p_22">                            3.5   In   the   mean    while,   the   said   Government    Order   was

                      challenged before this Court by filing various writ petitions and writ

                      appeals, which were dismissed and the same was also affirmed by the

                      Supreme Court. For the year 2018-19, tender was floated on 11.06.2018

                      and bids were received, in which, 6 firms participated. However, none got

                      qualified in the technical bid. Hence, fresh tender was notified on

                      24.07.2018, the technical bid of which was scheduled to be opened on

                      submitted by the Tamil Nadu Muttai Kozhi Pannaiyalargal Marketing

                      Society, the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.57 revoking the earlier

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 17.10.2012 and replacing the State level annual

                      tender system to zone-wise tender system for six months. Consequently,

                      the second respondent floated the impugned tender notification dated

<p id="p_25">                           4.1   Mr.S.Parthasarathy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

                      State-wise tender has proved to be a success, which was even

                      acknowledged by the Government as recently as on 18.07.2018, when it

                      came out with a Press release recognising the history behind the

                      introduction of G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 17.10.2012. Further, the said

                      Government Order has also received the express approval of this Court as

                      well as the Supreme Court, whereas, the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57, which

                      excluded the egg processing units from participating in the tender

                      process, is unconstitutional and therefore, it deserves to be struck down.

                      The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the stand of the

                      respondents that it is a policy decision, which cannot be challenged, is not

                      reflective of the correct proposition of law. According to him, even a policy

                      decision is amenable to judicial review. In support of the said submission,

                      he placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/121952/" id="a_13">Union of India

                      v. Dinesh Engineering</a> [(2001) 8 SCC 491] and the Division Bench of the

</p>
<p id="p_26">                            4.2   Adding further, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that the

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 is hit by <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_15">Article 13(2)</a> and is in violation of a

                      number of fundamental rights, including the right to equality guaranteed

                      under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. To substantiate the same, he

                      referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/433582/" id="a_17">Railway Board v.

                      Observor Publications</a>, [(1972) 2 SCC 266]. He also submitted that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article

                      14</a> forbids class legislation, but does not prohibit reasonable classification

                      and placed reliance on the judgments in <a href="/doc/1905739/" id="a_19">Budhan Choudhary v. State of

                      Bihar</a> [AIR 1955 SC 191] and <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_20">State of WB v. Anwar Ali Sarkar</a>, [AIR 1952

                      SC 75]. According to him, the object of the Government Order is to

                      ensure proper supply of eggs to the noon meal programme and hence,




http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                          13</span>

                      the classification between the producers and processors of eggs, cannot

                      bear any rational nexus with the object, as there is nothing to suggest

                      that the egg processors are somehow incapable of supplying eggs of

                      sufficient quality to the noon meal programme. In support of this

                      submission, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/94231062/" id="a_21">Kailash

                      Chand Sharma v. State of Rajasthan</a> [(2002) 6 SCC 562], wherein, it is

                      held that a classification made must be based on empirical data and

                      and submitted that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_24">Article 14</a> embodies a guarantee against arbitrariness

                      and it strikes at arbitrariness in executive/administrative action, because,

                      any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of

                      equality and as such, the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 offers no rationale

                      whatsoever for the change of decision to go from a State-wise tender to a

                      District-wise tender for procurement of eggs for the Nutritious Meal

                      Programme. Furthermore, the circumstances under which G.O.Ms.No.264

                      came to be enforced, have not been negated. Further, according to the

                      learned Senior Counsel, the validity of a Government Order ought to be

                      petitioner in WP.No.22888 of 2018 submitted that the decision taken by

                      the second respondent is not a policy decision, but an executive order of

                      the Government. He further submitted that the documents filed by the

                      respondents would show that such decision was taken by the Minister for

                      Social     Welfare   and   Nutritious   Meal   Programme   based   on   the

                      representation dated 06.08.2018 given by the Tamil Nadu Muttai Kozhi

                      Pannayalargal Marketing Society, which was registered only in the year

                      2015; the minutes of the meeting stated that only two departments have

                      recommended calling of zone-wise tender for procurement of eggs for the

                      benefit of poultry farmers, besides the Additional Chief Secretary,

                      Finance, whereas, as per the Constitution of India, policy decision has to

                      be taken by the Cabinet Ministers/Council of Ministers chaired by the

                      Chief Minister and as the nutritious noon meal scheme is not the policy

                      decision of the Government, the decision now taken by the respondents

                      cannot be sustainable in law.

                           5.2   The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that when the

                      earlier decision taken by the respondents vide G.O.Ms.No.264 was

                      challenged and was ultimately affirmed by the Division Bench as well as

                      the Supreme Court, the respondents are estopped from proceeding with a

                      different method, which was negatived in the earlier round of litigation.

                      That apart, the present Government Order was issued nullifying the

                      Supreme Court decision, which is not permissible under law. Thus,

                      according to the learned Senior Counsel, under the new system of zone-

                      wise tender, there is neither equitable opportunity given to the persons

                      like that of the petitioner nor beneficial to State Exchequer and that, the

                      petitioner and the similarly placed persons are continuously denied their

                      right to participate in the tender due to arbitrary and discriminatory

                      conditions imposed by the respondents.

                      or validate the restriction on egg producers from outside the State from

                      participating in the tender; there is no reasonable justification for

                      restricting the participation of the egg producers; the embargo on egg

                      producers from outside State from participating in the tender has no

                      rationale to the object sought to be achieved; there are various

                      procedural defects, such as, non-publication in Indian Trade Journal and

                      All India News Papers by the respondents; since a prospective bidder is

                      entitled to bid for a minimum of three zones, the value of the tender

                      comes to more than Rs.100 crores and therefore, publication in the All

                      India Trade Journal is mandatory; a policy can always be challenged on

                      the grounds of unreasonableness, discrimination, arbitrariness, perversity

                      and mala fides;   non-participation of the petitioner in the tenders from

                      2012 would not stand in their way from challenging the present impugned

                      tender notification; the executive powers are co-extensive with the

                      legislative powers of the State and hence, the respondents cannot pass an

                      executive order, which creates an artificial restriction on Inter state trade

                      and commerce; and such an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction has

                      been held to be unconstitutional by the Apex Court in Jindal Stain steel

                      Senior Counsel, the impugned Government Order, which prohibits

                      participation of bidders from other States, is ultra vires Articles 19(1)(g)

                      and 301 to 304 of the Constitution of India and the same is liable to be

                      block level supply of eggs to the beneficiaries under the Noon Meal

                      Programme. According to him, when the representation of the petitioner

                      for floating block level tender was pending from 2013, without any

                      consideration, the Government passed the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 in a

                      hasty manner by considering the representation of Tamil Nadu Muttai

                      Kozhi Panniayalargal Marketing Society, which would amply prove that the

                      respondents are acting under the behest of some big poultry farmers and

                      in the name of public interest. Hence, the learned Senior Counsel sought

                      came to be issued based on the representation given by the Tamil Nadu

                      Muttai Kozhi Pannaiyalargal Marketing Society, which is only a lame

                      excuse. In fact, the said Society never participated in the tender process;

                      it has no capacity to supply eggs; it has no grading equipment; and it

                      cannot obtain “Agmark” certification. Hence, the representation of such

                      society cannot be cited as a reason for radical alteration of the tender

                      format. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that there was no

                      necessity to revisit the tried and tested earlier Government Order; none

                      of the poultry businessmen was informed of the meeting alleged to have

                      been held on 14.08.2018; the haste with which the policy decision has

                      been taken smacks of mala fides and the decision is arbitrary. According

                      to the learned Senior Counsel, the small producers cannot satisfy the

                      requirement of the present tender as they cannot show an average

                      annual turnover of Rs.10 crores for participating in each zone; only a very

                      few small producers can supply 1 lakh eggs per day; any farmer with a

                      capacity to supply 1 lakh eggs per day would not be a small farmer and

                      hence, the supply could be made only by forming cartels. They further

                      submitted that the zone wise tender will also lead to corrupt practices and

                      forming of cartels, whereas under old system, all successful bidders were

                      collecting eggs from several small farmers and they were benefitted; and

                      no one has challenged the yearly tender for all these years and as such, it

                      was working really well. The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that

                      since the petitioner has been a successful tenderer for 3 consecutive

                      years by supplying 60%, 30% and 20% of the required numbers and the

                      supply was always upto the standard expected by the respondents, the

                      supplying eggs to nutritious meal programme for the past 5 years under

                      the State level annual tender; they are the Agmark licence holder of eggs

                      and they have the sufficient grading capacity to supply to the mid-day

                      meal programme. According to the learned Senior Counsel, there is no

                      complaint received by the Government during the period of functioning

                      the State level tender; G.O.Ms.No.264 brought back a time tested and

                      efficient method of ensuring supply of eggs and the same was well

                      reasoned, the validity and efficacy of which, were upheld by the Division

                      WP.Nos.25284 and 27059 of 2018 submitted that by the impugned

                      G.O.Ms.No.57 as well as the consequential notification, the petitioner,

                      who is an egg supplier, has been precluded from participating in the

                      tender and only the egg producers have been made eligible to participate

                      in the tender, which is arbitrary, unjust and illegal. According to him, the

                      stand of the Government that a producer of eggs would be a better suited

                      person than a supplier such as the petitioner to ensure adequate and

                      proper uninterrupted supply of eggs to the several thousand noon meal

                      centres all over the State, lacks basis or reasoning. The learned Senior

                      Counsel further submitted that when Clause 2(13) specifies that the eggs

                      should be delivered directly to the Anganwadi/Noon Meal centres,

                      ensuring prompt supply of the requisite quantity of eggs requires a

                      central delivery system involving sufficient manpower and skillfully

                      planned logistic support, which can be efficiently executed by a supplier of

                      goods, who has a predominant activity rather than a poultry farmer and

                      hence, the tender condition for the alleged reason of benefitting poultry

                      farmers, has seriously compromised and jeoparadised the main object of

                      supplying quality eggs to the noon meal centres for the benefit of

                      children. The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the previous

                      capacity to produce 1 lakh eggs per day and therefore, any poultry farmer

                      had the possibility to have a consortium with such other person, who had

                      to benefit the poultry farmer, cannot and will not be achieved in terms of

                      the conditions stipulated in the present tender and hence, the tender

                      conditions in the present tender are arbitrary, unreasonable and

                      discriminatory,   insofar   as   they    prevent   the   egg   suppliers   from

                      participating in the tender. Adding further, the learned Senior Counsel

                      strongly contended that unless there being very compelling reasons, it is

                      not open to the respondents to change the methodology approved by the

                      Division Bench as affirmed by the Supreme Court, especially when there

                      is no change in circumstances. He also placed reliance on the following

                      judgments to support the aforesaid submissions:

                             10.2 The learned Senior Counsel further contended that when the

                      tender document does not stipulate that an agreement with the vendor of

                      the eggs should be submitted along with the tender document and the

                      agreement furnished by the petitioner was only an additional document to

                      establish its bona fides to supply eggs punctually and promptly, the

                      second respondent ought not to have rejected the petitioner's bid on the

                      ground that the agreement of the petitioner with vendors of the eggs was

                      only for a period from 01.05.2016 to 30.04.2019 and it falls short of three

                      months for the tender period i.e., 31.07.2019. The learned Senior

                      Counsel also contended that the petitioner has not filed an appeal within

                      10 days from the date of rejection of its bid, in terms of Section 11 of the

                      Act, as the subsequent tender notification was floated on 20.08.2018; the

                      statutory period permitting an appeal to be filed within a period of 10

                      days is procedural in nature, whereas the right to file an appeal is

                      substantive in nature; and the substantive right of the petitioner cannot

                      be denied for mere procedural infraction, especially when the respondents

                      will not be prejudiced in any manner. Thus, the learned Senior Counsel

                      sought to allow the writ petitions.

<p id="p_54">                            11.   Ms.Sumathy,      learned    counsel   for   the   petitioner   in

                      WP.No.26282 of 2018 submitted that by the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 as

                      well as the tender notice, the second respondent has introduced new

                      qualifications/conditions for the tenderers, which are highly arbitrary and

                      contradictory to the spirit of the benefitting the poultry farmers/stake

                      holders of the State of Tamil Nadu and also opposed to the Tamil Nadu

                      Transparency in Tenders Act 1998 and the Rules 2000. She further

                      submitted that both the conditions in Clauses 2(3) and 2(4) have no

                      rationale and logic and it would not serve the purpose of restoring the

                      zonal wise tender. Further, there is lack of transparency and bona fides in

                      the process of floating the tender. That apart, Clause 2(5) stipulates that

                      a tenderer can bid for a maximum of three zones only, either individually

                      or by the way of consortium, which gives a scope of two monopolies in

                      the State. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the tender condition is

                      in no way giving any scope for the poor farmers like the petitioner to

                      participate in the tender and hence, the same is liable to be quashed.

                      detail, in all the writ petitions, inter alia stating that the policy decision of

                      the Government issuing G.O.Ms.No.264 for procuring eggs at the State

                      level by conducting annual egg tender for one year instead of District

                      level monthly tender, has already been upheld by this Court vide

                      judgement dated 25.04.2014; the present G.O.Ms.No.57 is actually

                      complementing /supplementing the earlier Government Order; there are

                      thousands of poultry farmers in Tamil Nadu producing around 3.5 to 4

                      crore eggs per day, but under the egg scheme, the average daily

                      requirement of eggs is around 50 lakhs only and hence, it has been

                      decided to procure eggs from egg producers in Tamil Nadu only who

                      otherwise    may   be   exploited   by    middlemen;        the   Tender   Scrutiny

                      Committee has designed the tender conditions wherein fair opportunities

                      have been given to egg producers of the State to participate directly in

                      the tender process in order to bring healthy competition among the egg

                      suppliers; the minimum production capacity of the prospective bidder has

                      been fixed as 1 lakh egg per day instead of fixing minimum 60% of the

                      tender quantity with the noble intention of allowing more poultry farmers

                      to participate in the tender process; if no minimum capacity of production

                      is fixed, it will not be possible to regulate thousands of farmers, who, with

                      production   capacity   of   even   1000      eggs   will    be   manipulated   by

                      unscrupulous elements to participate in the tender and try to create

                      unnecessary difficulties in finalizing the tender, besides trying to create

                      hurdles in providing eggs to poor beneficiaries in Tamil Nadu numbering

                      about 58 lakhs; the State has the freedom of contract and right to decide

                      the conditions of eligibility and it is well settled by a number of judgments

                      of the Supreme Court that the terms and conditions of eligibility in inviting

                      tenders cannot be judicially reviewed and as such, there is no violation of

                      Articles 301 and 303 and 304 of the Constitution; in order to stop

                      exploitation of small farmers by big farmers and traders, the Tender

                      Scrutiny Committee had formulated the tender condition giving scope for

                      entering into an agreement between the tenderer and small farmers; by

                      strictly following all the provisions of the Act and Rules and the various

                      Government Orders, the tender conditions have been framed for the

                      benefit of the beneficiaries and to bring healthy competition among the

                      egg suppliers and support the egg producers of the State. Thus, according

                      to   the   respondents,   G.O.Ms.No.57     and   the   consequential    tender

                      and the Director of Integrated Child Development Services Scheme have

                      been called for, who, in turn, have submitted the merits and demerits of

                      Additional Chief Secretary (Finance), the Principal Secretary (Social

                      he should have been a producer of eggs in Tamil Nadu for the past three

                      years, the learned Advocate General submitted that the suppliers should

                      not be excluded. According to him, the terms and conditions of the tender

                      are beyond the purview of judicial review and the impugned Government

                      Order is a policy decision of the Government and it cannot be subject to

                      judicial review. That apart, it is the submission of the learned Advocate

                      General that nutritious scheme is a very sensible social welfare legislation

                      and 6 separate evaluation has to be done and hence, it is not necessary

                      to publish the tender in Indian Trade Journal, as such, Rule 11(b) is not

                      applicable to the facts of the present case. Further, it is a short tender as

                      per para 7(3) of the tender document and each zone has separate bank

                      guarantee and EMD, which shows that there is separate tender for each

                      zone.
</p>
<p id="p_59">                              13.3        The learned Advocate General also submitted that the

                      earlier   counter   filed in previous round    of litigation in favour     of

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 is not binding on the respondents and the earlier

                      judgment is with regard to upholding the earlier policy decision and

                      hence, they are not estopped from changing the policy decision. On that

                      score, the present policy cannot be tested. Adding further, there is no

                      undue haste in framing the policy as there was a short time due to the

                      expiry of the earlier contract. According to the learned Advocate General,

                      the tender notification need not be published in tender journal as it is a

                      authorities to reconsider the State Level tender; accordingly, the

                      Government has passed the present Government Order, by which, they

                      extended a helping hand to protect the poultry farmers by enabling them

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 is not the complements/supplements of the

                      earlier G.O.Ms.No.264, but only to satisfy a section of people. According

                      to him, such action of the respondents is arbitrary, discriminatory and

                      unfair, inasmuch as, it targets the upper segment of poultry farmers and

                      egg producers for participation in tender and eliminates small farmers like

                      that of the petitioner. The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the

                      achieved and the whole object of the tender to promote competition, as

                      healthy competition is sought to be achieved between the tenders as

                      major chunk of small farmers like that of the petitioner are still outside

                      the realm of tenders called for by the respondents; there is no fair and

                      equitable treatment of all the tenderers; hence, the questions of fairness,

                      public confidence and interest; and transparency in the matter of

                      procurement are all strikingly absent in the said tender.

                      of the learned Advocate General by stating that any reasonable

                      restrictions in tenders in public interest have to be brought about only by

                      way of amendment of the Act, which shall be introduced in the Legislature

                      only; further, the right of the State to enter into contract as covered by

                      Articles 298 and 299 of the Constitution is subject to Articles 301 to 304;

                      hence, the State cannot violate the Constitution of India and the act of

                      the State infringing the freedom of trade is unconstitutional. It is pointed

                      out that each and every action of the State is tested on the touch stone of

                      the Constitution and if any act of the State is found to be ultra vires the

                      Constitution, the same should be struck down as unconstitutional. The

                      learned Senior Counsel also submitted that though it is the stand of the

                      and support the egg producers of the State, in reality, it is just

                      disadvantageous to the small egg producers like that of the petitioners,

                      who are simply left at the mercy of the large players and are eagerly

                      awaiting the decision of the State to encompass within its fold by framing

                      appropriate tender conditions, in order to enable the petitioners to

                      participate in the tender. Denying that if the egg producers are from

                      Tamil Nadu, the respondents can keep a watch on their quality, the

                      learned Senior Counsel submitted that the respondents have no power to

                      supervise the egg producers, since it is only the officers under the Food

                      Safety and <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_59">Standards Act</a> that can do so; if the quality of the eggs given

                      is not upto the mark, it is open to the respondents to follow due

                      procedure in law under the Food Safety and <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_60">Standards Act</a> and report it to

                      the concerned authorities in accordance with law; this can be done to egg

                      producers outside Tamil Nadu also by the respondents and this reasoning

                      by the respondents is flawed; further, once the tender is awarded, the

                      terms of the tender will prevail and the tender does not contemplate any

                      inspections or checks by the respondents, that duty falls upon the

                      successful tenderer to submit periodical reports on the hygiene of the

                      poultry farm; and public interest is the consumers and not the egg

                      producers, since the respondents are not defending a taxing statute.

                      petitioner in WP.No.25142 of 2018, in his reply, stated that the petitioner

                      is not questioning the right of the Government to change the policy, but

                      the manner in which it has been done. According to him, while issuing the

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 as well as the consequential tender notification,

                      all the earlier safeguards framed by the Government for providing good

                      quality eggs to beneficiaries, who are all school going children, have been

                      completely given a go by, which may be detrimental to their interest;

                      further, the Government, while dealing with the State largess, cannot

                      have the right to choose a buyer from a particular group of individual,

                      which is against <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_61">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. The learned Senior

                      Counsel also submitted that one of the sound reasonings assigned by the

                      Government in arriving at the earlier policy decision in 2012 is that in a

                      single State level tender system, a firm and stable price could be fixed

                      due to the fluctuating price of eggs, whereas, the present tender

                      notification is a notification inviting six separate tenders, which will again

                      bring instability in the price of eggs. Further, there was no reason

                      assigned by the Government in the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 as to how it

                      seeks to achieve the object of a stable and firm price. The learned Senior

                      Counsel further submitted that there was no rhyme or reason for speedy

                      decision taken by the Government on the representation submitted by the

                      Association. It is also submitted that the Government, in its press release

                      dated 18.07.2018, has substantiated that there is no flaw in the existing

                      State level single tender system being carried on by it, whereas, the

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 does not reveal any reason as to why the

                      departure is being made from State level single tender to Zone-wise

                      tender. Thus, according to the learned Senior Counsel, when a change is

                      brought to an existing policy decision, it is the duty of the Government

                      that such change is fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent,

                      non-capricious, unbiased, without favouritism or nepotism, in pursuit of

                      promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment, as otherwise,

                      the process of decision making by the Government is subjected to judicial

                      review and the Courts can interfere with the same.

                      appearing for the petitioner in W.P.Nos.25284 and 27059 of 2018

                      submitted that G.O.Ms.No.264 was propounded as a policy decision for

                      the introduction of State level tender, after much deliberation and

                      consideration of pros and cons at several levels by the officers of the

                      departments over a long period extending about 6 months in public

                      interest for the welfare of the children being the objective sought to be

                      achieved, whereas, G.O.Ms.No.57 is not a policy decision. The learned

                      Senior Counsel further contended that the decision to introduce zonal

                      level tender and the exclusion of egg suppliers from participation cannot

                      be termed to be fair, just and legally valid; and the decision making

                      process has not considered the relevant factors and the same is not

                      justified, since the facts which ought not to be considered for arriving at

                      the same, had been providing avenue of business to a few egg producers

                      only. Adding further, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that contrary

                      the present tender has been devised for promoting egg commerce and

                      market to the poultry owners; it has been floated for supply of eggs for 6

                      months only without any nexus to the object sought to be achieved viz.,

                      ensuring uninterrupted competitive one price for one year for supply of

                      quality eggs to the children; and procurement of very large quantity of

                      eggs from Namakkal area and transportation of the same throughout

                      Tamil Nadu to about 1 lakh centres are the major operations in the

                      tendered work and not production of eggs and hence, there is no added

                      advantage or benefit to the Government to justify the modification of the

                      methodology of having State wise tender to zone wise tender and hence,

                      it is arbitrary and unreasonable. According to the learned Senior Counsel,

                      there was no study or report by the higher officials to arrive at the

                      decision of zone wise tender and in the absence of there being any

                      concrete material that zone wise tender will benefit poultry farmers and

                      be better than the previous policy decision, particularly excluding traders

                      like the petitioner, the decision to have zone wise tender is an arbitrary

                      one. He further submitted that even the egg producers themselves will

                      not be able to supply 60% quantity on their own, without procuring from

                      other farmers and as such, the alleged object of zone wise tender i.e., to

                      promote competition among egg producers, is negatived by the tender

                      conditions themselves, since, admittedly, hundreds of farmers have been

                      advantageous to refer to the following judgments of the Supreme Court

                      down the following guiding principles:
</p>
<p id="p_102">                            “94. 1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in
                            administrative action.

</p><p id="p_104">                                2) The Court does not sit as a court of appeal but
                           merely reviews the manner in which the decision was
                           made.
</p>
<p id="p_105">                                  3) The Court does not have the expertise to correct
                           the administrative decision. If a review of the
                           administrative decision is permitted it will be substituting
                           its own decision, without the necessary expertise which
                           itself may be fallible.
</p>
<p id="p_106">                                 4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be
                           open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is
                           in the realm of contract. Normally speaking, the decision to
                           accept the tender or award the contract is reached by
                           process of negotiations through several tiers. More often
                           than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts.

                           However, the decision must not only be tested by the

                           reference to a given case. This position is well settled in
                           the Indian administrative law. Therefore, to a limited
                           extent of scrutinising the decision- making process, it is
                           always open to the court to review the evaluation of facts

                      [(2014) 3 SCC 760], the Supreme Court held thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                 “8. The scope of judicial review in matters relating to
                           award of contract by the State and its instrumentalities is
                           settled by a long line of decisions of this Court. While these
                           decisions clearly recognize that power exercised by the
                           Government and its instrumentalities in regard to allotment
                           of contract is subject to judicial review at the instance of
                           an aggrieved party, submission of a tender in response to
                           a notice inviting such tenders is no more than making an
                           offer which the State or its agencies are under no
                           obligation to accept. The bidders participating in the tender
                           process cannot, therefore, insist that their tenders should
                           be accepted simply because a given tender is the highest
                           or lowest depending upon whether the contract is for sale
                           of public property or for execution of works on behalf of
                           the Government. All that participating bidders are entitled
                           to is a fair, equal and non-discriminatory treatment in the
                           matter of evaluation of their tenders. It is also fairly well-
                           settled that award of a contract is essentially a commercial
                           transaction which must be determined on the basis of
                           consideration that are relevant to such commercial
                           decision. This implies that terms subject to which tenders
                           are invited are not open to the judicial scrutiny unless it is
                           found that the same have been tailor made to benefit any
                           particular tenderer or class of tenderers. So also the
                           authority inviting tenders can enter into negotiations or
                           grant relaxation for bona fide and cogent reasons provided
                           such relaxation is permissible under the terms governing
                           the tender process.

</p><p id="p_121">                                 9. Suffice it to say that in the matter of award of
                           contracts the Government and its agencies have to act
                           reasonably and fairly at all points of time. To that extent
                           the tenderer has an enforceable right in the Court who is
                           competent to examine whether the aggrieved party has
                           been treated unfairly or discriminated against to the
                           detriment of public interest.”



                      Thus, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgments

                      is that the Courts can scrutinise the award of the contracts by the

                      Government or its agencies in exercise of its powers of judicial review to

                      prevent arbitrariness or favoritism. Further, the Supreme Court indicated

                      that interference in the contractual matters is permissible, if decision-

                      making process is illegal, irrational, arbitrary and procedural impropriety

                      and it must meet the test of reasons and relevance.

                      From a reading of the contents of the aforesaid Government Order, it

                      becomes apparent that since the technical bids submitted by the six firms

                      pursuant to the tender notification floated on 11.07.2018, were found to

                      be technically not qualified, a fresh tender was notified on 24.07.2018 for

                      Thus, it is evident that the only reason pointed out for passing the said

                      20.08.2018 floated pursuant to the said G.O. Since the grounds of attack

                      by each of the petitioners is no different, but one and the same, this

                      Court does not propose to delve into the grounds of each of the

                      impugned decision made in G.O.Ms.No.57 excluding the egg suppliers

                      from participation in the tender called for the procurement of eggs to the

                      alleged that the said decision is also violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_70">Article 14</a> of the

                      Constitution.   According   to   them,    the   classification   made   by   the

                      respondent authorities between the producers and suppliers of the eggs

                      with regard to the object of the Scheme, is totally unreasonable,

                      irrational, arbitrary and discriminative in nature; the decision to move

                      away from a centralized State level tender to zone wise tender is also

                      arbitrary, unfair and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under

                      the Constitution. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners further

                      submitted that the executive powers of the State are co-extensive with

                      the legislative powers and the respondents cannot pass an executive

                      order, which creates an artificial restriction on Inter-State Trade and

                          the Court thinks it to be unwise.

                                  discretion and in contracts having commercial element

                                  This requirement is necessary to avoid unreasonable

                      responsibility towards the welfare of poultry farmers, it has been decided

                      to procure eggs from the egg producers in Tamil Nadu only, who

                      otherwise   may   be   exploited   by    middlemen;   the   Tender   Scrutiny

                      the tender process, in order to bring healthy competition among the egg

                      to impose reasonable restrictions on the said right in the interest of

                      egg suppliers from participation in the tender in question is a reasonable

                      classification. The respondents further stated that there is no prohibition

                      or restriction on the petitioners for selling the eggs in Tamil Nadu, if they

                      are the producers from neighbouring States; there are thousands of

                      poultry farmers in Tamil Nadu producing around 3.5 to 4 crores eggs per

                      day, whereas, under the scheme in question, the average daily

                      requirement of eggs is around 50 lakhs only and hence, it is certainly

                      open to the petitioners to bring eggs from neighbouring States and sell

                      the same in the open market; thus, the eligibility condition in the tender

                      that the petitioners should be the egg producers from Tamil Nadu, in no

                      manner, affects the right of the egg producers from other States to sell

                            such deprivation or exclusion is present in this case. The
                            petitioners are free to sell their goods not only throughout the
                            country but also in the State of UP. The total market of
                            electronic goods in the UP is Rs.16 crores out of which the
                            purchase by the Government is only Rs.3 crores. The
                            petitioners business does not consist only in selling to the
                            Government nor is it a case where they cannot carry on their

                            command that the decision of Andhra Pradesh High Court in
                            Mahindera &amp; Mahindra, AIR 1986 Andh Pra 332 (supra), is not
                            correct in so far as it holds that <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_105">Art. 301</a> was violated by the

                          Merchant Patiala versus Union of India (1984 (1) SCR
                          657 (682). In the said case, the Coal Merchant
                          challenged the vires of <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_110">Section 27A</a> of the Indian
                          Railways Act and circular issued thereunder relating to
                          preferential Traffic Schedule providing for priorities for
                          movement of different goods. A circular was issued by
                          the Ministry of Railways in connection with movement
                          of some goods including coal. The petitioners who
                          were coal merchants, alleged that sum total of various
                          restrictions imposed by giving abbreviation GX against
                          all way side stations in the coal belt and restricting
                          loading of coal in wagons from the stations
                          categorised as GX and introducing preferential Traffic
                          Schedule, in their cumulative effect resulted in total
                          ban on transport of coal by Railways at their instance
                          and such actions were violative of Articles 14 and
                          19(1) (g) of the Constitution. Repelling such
                          contention, it has been held by this Court that
                          whenever the court is called upon to examine the
                          complaint that restrictions imposed on the freedom to
                          carry on trade are unreasonable, it is necessary to find
                          out what is the trade and business of the complainant-
                          petitioner and to what extent the restriction, if any, is
                          imposed upon the freedom to carry on trade or
                          business and then to determine whether the
                          restriction is' reasonable or not. It is the direct impact
                          of the restriction on the freedom to carry on trade that
                          has to be kept in view and not the ancillary or
                          incidental effects of the governmental action on the
                          freedom to carry on trade.

                          by the Railways by not being able to provide transport
                          facilities. Railway is not the only means of transport.
                          There are other means of transport by which coal can
                          be transported by the petitioners to their respective
                          place of business. Even assuming that the direct

                            25.4 This Court considered the rival submissions. Now, it is

                      required to be noted here that <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_124">Article 19(1)(g)</a> provides a citizen a right

                      to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or

                      business. At the same time, <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_125">Article 304(b)</a> empowers the State

                      Government to impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of

                      trade, commerce or intercourse, with or within that State, as may be

                      required in the public interest, but, a bill for this purpose has to be

                      introduced or moved in the Legislature only with the previous sanction of

                      the President. Such being the legal position, the classification made by the

                      respondent authorities between the producers and suppliers of eggs is

                      certainly unreasonable. Similarly, the embargo on the egg producers from

                      outside Tamil Nadu is absolutely unfair, arbitrary and also discriminatory.

                      Further, there was no rational nexus between the differentia made and

                      the object to be achieved. That apart, the decisions relied on by the

                      respondents, cannot be applicable to the facts of the present case, as the

                      same stand in a different footing. In such view of the matter, applying the

                      ratio laid down by the Supreme Court that the Executive should only

                      adopt rational means while entering into contracts and if rationality is not

                      present, the Courts can intervene, this Court comes to the conclusion that

                      the classification made in the impugned G.O is violative of Articles

                      19(1)(g), 301, 304 and 305 of the Constitution and it also infringes

                      <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_126">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

                      giving an opportunity of hearing to various stake holders, including the

                      petitioners. According to the petitioners, the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 has

                      been passed only based on the representation made by the Tamil Nadu

                      Muttai Kozhi Pannaiyalargal Marketing Society, within a short period of

                      6 working days and there is no plausible reason/explanation given for

                      taking such a decision quickly, that too, without providing an opportunity

                      of hearing to all the stakeholders/poultry farmers and the reason stated

                      therein is only vague in nature.

                      been passed, with an object to bring healthy competition among the eggs

                      suppliers and to support the egg producers of the State to directly

                      participate in the tender process, for the procurement of eggs under the

                      Noon Meal Programme; even otherwise, judicial review is not warranted

                      in the case of undue haste on the part of the respondents in taking such a

                      decision. To substantiate the same, the learned Advocate General relied

                      on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Chairman and MD, BPL Ltd

                      case, wherein, at para 34, it has been pointed out as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">                                       “34.Undue haste also is a matter, which by itself
                                 would not have been a ground for exercise of the
                                 power of judicial review, unless it is held to be
                                 mala fide. What is necessary in such matters is not the
                                 time taken for allotment but the manner in which the
                                 action had been taken. The Court, it is trite, is not
                                 concerned with the merit of the decision, but the
                                 decision-making process. In the absence of any finding
                                 that any legal malice was committed, the impugned

                      for remarks from the authorities concerned on 07.08.2018; while the

                      Commissioner gave his remarks on the same day itself, the Director gave

                      his remarks on 09.08.2018; meeting was convened on 14.08.2018; the

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 came to be passed on 20.08.2018; and tender

                      notice also came to be issued on the same day itself. Thus, it could safely

                      be inferred that the action so taken, on the representation of the said

                      Marketing Society, without even providing an opportunity to all other

                      stakeholders/poultry farmers, would clearly show the mala fide act on the

                      part of the respondents to favour someone.

<p id="p_183">                           26.4 At this juncture, the submission of Mr.K.M.Vijayan, learned

                      Senior Counsel for the petitioner in WP.No.22956 of 2018 that the

                      interest of the agriculturist has been purposefully ignored and there is no

                      relief to the petitioner, who made representation for floating block level

                      tender in the year 2013 itself, even though their grievances were

                      promised to be addressed by the Government, is to be recollected. No

                      doubt, taking into consideration the larger public interest, the attempt of

                      the respondent authorities to travel at a great speed is laudable.

                      However, it should not be forgotten by them that at times, travelling at

                      such a breakneck speed, amounts to driving in a rash and negligent

                      manner, leading to unforeseen accidents. Hence, this Court is of the

                      opinion that the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 has been passed in a complete

                      hasty manner and hence, the same is liable to be quashed.

                            27.1 The next plank of ground made by the petitioners is that the

                      impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 is to create cartel and monopoly. According to

                      the petitioners, the impugned G.O and consequential tender notice create

                      two classes of poultry farmers -one, who is able to bid under the tender

                      notification and another is meant to be kept out of the purview of the

                      tender notification intentionally, with a view to help the upper segment of

                      poultry farmers, for the reasons best known to the respondents; though it

                      is the stand of the respondents that the tender has been floated with a

                      view to safeguard and support the egg producers of the State, in reality,

                      it is just against the small egg producers like those of the petitioners, who

                      are simply left at the mercy of the large players and are eagerly awaiting

                      the decision of the State to encompass within its fold by framing

                      appropriate tender conditions, in order to enable the petitioners to

                      participate in the tender. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners

                      further contended that the reservation or restriction, if any, based on

                      some policy or principle, should be formed by the respondent authorities

                      with the object of prohibiting monopolistic tendency and encouraging

                      healthy competition with reasonableness and non-arbitrariness, whereas,

                      the qualifying condition prescribed in the tender notice with regard to

                      eligibility of tenderers, is nothing but arbitrary and unreasonable, as it

                      would only give way for monopolising the business, which would

                      otherwise be against the public interest. <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_127">In Union of India v. Hindustan

                          Merchant Patiala versus Union of India (1984 (1) SCR
                          657 (682). In the said case, the Coal Merchant
                          challenged the vires of <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_132">Section 27A</a> of the Indian
                          Railways Act and circular issued thereunder relating to
                          preferential Traffic Schedule providing for priorities for
                          movement of different goods. A circular was issued by
                          the Ministry of Railways in connection with movement
                          of some goods including coal. The petitioners who
                          were coal merchants, alleged that sum total of various
                          restrictions imposed by giving abbreviation GX against
                          all way side stations in the coal belt and restricting
                          loading of coal in wagons from the stations
                          categorised as GX and introducing preferential Traffic
                          Schedule, in their cumulative effect resulted in total
                          ban on transport of coal by Railways at their instance
                          and such actions were violative of Articles 14 and
                          19(1) (g) of the Constitution. Repelling such
                          contention, it has been held by this Court that
                          whenever the court is called upon to examine the
                          complaint that restrictions imposed on the freedom to
                          carry on trade are unreasonable, it is necessary to find
                          out what is the trade and business of the complainant-
                          petitioner and to what extent the restriction, if any, is
                          imposed upon the freedom to carry on trade or
                          business and then to determine whether the
                          restriction is' reasonable or not. It is the direct impact
                          of the restriction on the freedom to carry on trade that
                          has to be kept in view and not the ancillary or

                          by the Railways by not being able to provide transport
                          facilities. Railway is not the only means of transport.
                          There are other means of transport by which coal can
                          be transported by the petitioners to their respective
                          place of business. Even assuming that the direct

                          will none-the -less be reasonable because petitioners

                      by G.O.Ms.No.57, made irrational and unreasonable classification among

                      the egg producers and egg suppliers and from and out of the Tamil Nadu

                      for   supplying   eggs   to   the   Noon   Meal   Programme,     which   would

                      automatically create cartel or monopoly in trade and business of the

                      procurement of eggs. The Supreme Court, time and again, held that any

                      act, which excluded competition from any part of the trade or commerce

                      by forming cartels, should not be permitted. As such, this Court has no

                      hesitation to hold that the tender condition has resulted in eliminating a

                      wider participation and keeping out suppliers, who are otherwise eligible

                      and the same formed a cartel or monopoly in trade and business of the

                      procurement of eggs. On this ground as well, the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57

                      as well as the tender notice is liable to be set aside.

                      respondents have violated the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Transparency

                      in Tenders Act, 1998 (for short, “the Act”) and Tenders Rules, 2000 (for

                      short, “the Rules”). According to them, as per Rule 11 of the Rules, the

                      Tender Inviting Authority shall have the notice inviting tenders published

                      in the Indian Trade Journal in all cases where the value of the

                      procurement exceeds Rs.50 crores; and the provisions of Rule 11 is also

                      supported by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_146">Section 9(3)</a> of the Act. They further

                      submitted that the respondents have also violated Rule 20 of the Rules by

                      not providing 30 days time for the submission of the tenders between the

                      date of publication of notice inviting tenders and the last date for

                      submission of tenders. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Sri

                      Venkatram Spinners Pvt. Ltd v. State of Tamil Nadu and others

                      (W.P.Nos.17261, 18987 and 18988 of 2017), the petitioners stated that

                      when Rule 20(2) of the Rules is not followed, then the tender is liable to

                      be quashed and it is not open for the respondents to claim that the

                      notification dated 20.08.2018 is liable to be quashed. The learned Senior

                      period of six months only and therefore, the respondent authorities have

                      to advertise and follow the procedure for the tendering process every six

                      months, which is going to cost enormous expenditure to the State

                      exchequer, which was sought to be avoided in the centralized system, as

                      per the statement of the respondent authorities in the earlier writ

                      petitions. It is also submitted that Clause 2(13) specifies that eggs should

                      be delivered directly to the Anganwadi/Noon Meal Centres; each zone has

                      nearly 15,000 centres (approx.) and totally one lakh centres located all

                      over the State, to which a minimum of 250-500 eggs (approx.) will have

                      to be supplied twice a week; as such, ensuring prompt supply of the

                      requisite quantity of eggs requires a central delivery system involving

                      sufficient manpower and skilfully planned logistic support, which can be

                      efficiently executed by a supplier of goods, who has that as a

                      predominant activity, rather than a poultry farmer whose primary

                      occupation is rearing layer hens; therefore, the tender condition for the

                      alleged reason of benefiting poultry farmers has seriously compromised

                      and jeopardized the main object of supplying quality eggs to the Noon

                      Meal Centres for the benefit of children.

                      not exceed Rs.75 crores. It is further averred in the counter affidavit that

                      there is no vagueness in the tender conditions and the terms and

                      conditions of the tender are transparent. Hence, they strongly refuted the

                      allegations so made against the respondent authorities.



</p><p id="p_206">                            28.3 Before going into the rival submissions, it is to be noted that

                      the Act was enacted with the object of (a) eliminating irregularities and

                      corrupt practices in the tender processes, (b) to provide for fair and

                      equitable   treatment to    all,   and    (c)   to   make   the   whole   process

                      transparent. Therefore, the tripod on which the Act stands, comprises (i)

                      fairness, (ii) equitable treatment of all, and (iii) transparency. Admittedly,

                      the tender notification was not published in the Newspapers and in the All

                      India Trade Journal. As per the provisions of <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_147">Section 9(3)</a> of the Act, the

                      Tender Inviting Authority shall also publish the notice inviting tenders in

                      Indian Trade Journal and in daily Newspapers having wide circulation

                      depending upon the value of the procurement prescribed. As per Rule

                      11 (1) of the Rules, the Tender Inviting Authority shall have the notice

                      inviting tenders published in the Indian Trade Journal in all cases where

                      the value of procurement exceeds Rs.50 crores. Therefore, as per <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_148">Section

                      9(3)</a> of the Act and Rule 11 (1) of the Rules, if the value of the tender is

                      more than Rs.50 crores, the tender notice should be published in the

                      Indian Trade Journal. <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_149">Under the Act</a>, the aforesaid objects are sought to

                      be achieved by looking at the whole tender process in a three dimensional

                      setting. All the provisions of the Act and the Rules are aimed at taking

                      care of (i) the best interests of the procuring entity (for whose benefit the

                      tender is floated), (ii) the perspective of those who eventually lose in the

                      race, and (iii) the perception of the public about the manner in which the

                      whole exercise was undertaken. Once these underlying principles behind

                      the Act and the Rules are violated, then, this Court has to exercise its

                      power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_150">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to interfere with the same.

                      Rule 11(3) states that the tender ought to be published in an All India

                      Newspaper, the reason being that Act and Rules visualize participation

                      from all over the country, since the object of the Act and Rules is for

                      wider participation so as to make the tender process more competitive.

                      As such, this Court is of the view that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1902628/" id="a_151">Section 9(3)</a> and

                      Rule 11(1) are mandatory and the said provisions cannot be given a go-

                      the Government cannot avert judicial scrutiny of a perfunctory executive

                      order    sans   any   policy;   on   the        other   hand,   G.O.Ms.No.264   was

                      propounded as a policy decision for the introduction of State Level

                      Tender, after much deliberation and consideration of pros and cons at

                      several levels by the officers and departments over a long period

                      extending about 6 months in public interest for the welfare of the

                      i.e., the same was brought about within 6 working days; the decision to

                      introduce Zonal level tender and the exclusion of egg suppliers from

                      participation cannot be termed to be fair, just and legally valid; the

                      decision making process has not considered the relevant factors and it is

                      not justified, as to why such a decision was arrived at; the qualifying

                      such a way that the successful poultry farmers are going to do the same

                      work as the egg traders and suppliers in the single state level tender, but

                      by excluding them; as such, the terms and conditions of the tender

                      excluding the egg traders and suppliers are veritably colourable exercise

                      [1996(5) SCC 268], it was held by the Supreme Court thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                        “3.In the light of the above policy question
                                 emerges whether the Government is bound by the
                                 previous policy or whether it can revise its policy in
                                 view of the changed potential foreign markets and the
                                 need for earning foreign exchange? It is true that in a
                                 given set of facts, the Government may in the
                                 appropriate case be bound by the doctrine of
                                 promissory estoppel evolved in Union of India Vs.
                                 Indo-Afghan Agencies [(1968) 2 SCR 366]. But the
                                 question revolves upon the validity of the withdrawal
                                 of the previous policy and introduction of the new
                                 policy. The doctrine of legitimate expectations again
                                 requires to be angulated thus: whether it was revised
                                 by a policy in the public interest or the decision is
                                 based upon any abuse of the power? The power to lay
                                 policy by executive decision or by legislation includes
                                 power to withdraw the same unless in the former case,
                                 it is by malafide exercise of power or the decision or
                                 action taken is in abuse of power. The doctrine of
                                 legitimate expectation plays no role when the
                                 appropriate authority is empowered to take a decision
                                 by an executive policy or under law. The Court leaves
                                 the authority to decide its full range of choice within
                                 the executive or legislative power. In matters of
                                 economic policy, it is a settled law that the Court gives
                                 the large leeway to the executive and the legislature.
                                 Granting licences for import or export is by executive
                                 or legislative policy. Government would take diverse
                                 factors for formulating the policy for import or export

                                 policy. A prior decision would not bind the Government
                                 for all times to come. When the Government are
                                 satisfied that change in the policy was necessary in the
                                 public interest, it would be entitled to revise the policy
                                 and lay down new policy. The Court, therefore, would
                                 prefer to allow free play to the Government to evolve
                                 fiscal policy in the public interest and to act upon the
                                 same. Equally, the Government is left free to
                                 determine priorities in the matters of allocations or
                                 allotments or utilisation of its finances in the public

                                 hold that the petitioners have no vested or accrued
                                 right for the issuance of permits on the MEE or NQE,
                                 nor the Government is bound by its previous policy. It

                           29.3 On     a careful scrutiny of the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57, it is

                      manifest that the tenders will be floated separately for each zone and bids

                      will be invited for the respective zones. It is pertinent to point out here

                      that the only reason given for changing the existing methodology of

                      floating state level tender to zone-wise tender is the representation dated

                      06.08.2018 given by Tamil Nadu Muttai Kozhi Pannaiyalargal Marketing

                      Society. Pursuant to the said G.O, the tender notification dated

                      20.08.2018 came to be issued, which is neither in furtherance or

                      supportive of the alleged reasoning viz, benefitting poultry farmers, nor

                      has any nexus to the object of the nutritious meal scheme viz., ensuring

                      uninterrupted supply of quality eggs to the children. Further, the said G.O

                      does not state that the methodology has also been changed either for

                      overcoming the difficulties or problems faced in the execution of the

                      contracts in the previous methodology or the methodology is changed on

                      account of it being a more efficient and safer way of ensuring

                      uninterrupted quality eggs. It may not be out of place to point out at this

                      juncture that the very same respondent authorities had filed a detailed

                      counter affidavit in support of their earlier decision to have a State-wise

                      tender to overcome the difficulties of having District-wise tenders, which

                      has been accepted by the Division Bench of this Court for the reason of

                      State-wise tenders being in larger public interest and the welfare of the

                      children, who are the beneficiaries of the nutritious noon meal scheme.

                      Such being the case, the issuance of G.O.Ms.No.57 changing its policy

                      decision, excluding the egg suppliers and creating embargo on the egg

                      producers from outside the State is a colourable excise of power and

                      infringes the rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

                      G.O.Ms.No.57    is   only   supplement/complement       of   the   earlier

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 and the averments made in the counter affidavit in the

                      the validity of the present G.O.Ms.No.57. In support of the same, the

                      learned Advocate General placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme

                                 not justified in retracting from its earlier stand. The
                                 Madurai Bench further observed that the impugned

                                 not based upon any statistics and therefore granting
                                 relaxation to advance social justice “…. is nothing but a
                                 myth and is not based on facts and figures”. On behalf of
                                 the appellants much reliance was placed upon the earlier
                                 stand of the Government to contend that when the
                                 Government had earlier taken the stand that it would not
                                 grant relaxation of marks for TET pass and dilute the
                                 standards of education, the Government cannot
                                 approbate and reprobate at the same time by changing
                                 its stand. It was further submitted that the teachers are
                                 responsible for moulding the younger minds and any
                                 dilution of standards of TET would be detrimental to the

                                 Government. Considering the representation from
                                 various quarters, it was a policy decision taken by the
                                 Government to relax marks for TET pass for specified
                                 and under-privileged communities. It is a matter of

                                 the ground that the relaxation has been given to suit
                                 some specific class of individuals.”

                                 14.5.2012, to the Director of Social Welfare regarding
                                 restructuring of tender and sought to clarify the
                                 following points:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">                                 “1) Egg prices show huge monthly or weekly
                                 variations. Hence better price discounting is possible
                                 only through monthly tenders and not quarterly or
                                 weekly tenders.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">                                 2) The possibility of cartelization is much higher in
                                 State level tender than district tenders as in the later,
                                 relatively smaller players who have the capacity to
                                 supply to one or few districts can also participate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">                                 3) A district wide tender can factor in transportation
                                 costs better than a Zone based tender.

</p><p id="p_222">                               4) It is always better that the procuring authority and
                               the quality enforcement authority is the same.

</p><p id="p_223">                               5) There is no guarantee that the State level tender
                               will not end in prices higher than NECC rates.
</p>
<p id="p_224">                               6) The present system is working well. In the absence
                               of any clear advantage from a different system there
                               is no need to disturb a well functioning system.

</p><p id="p_225">                               7) State level half yearly tender is neither feasible nor
                               advisable because of

                                     I. Wide fluctuation in prices

                                    II. Already the prices go up at the start of the
                               month due to our monthly tender. If it is a half yearly
                               tender, then there is every probability of a rate raise
                               and the quantity being contracted at that price for a
                               six months period.
</p>
<p id="p_226">                               8) Hence a State level quarterly tender is the only
                               option available, which also does not seem to offer
                               any concrete advantages over the existing system.

</p><p id="p_227">                               9) If State level tender is resorted to it can be done
                               as trial in one Zone of five to six districts, and the
                               advantages over existing system may be compared
                               and then if advantageous, it may be expanded to the
                               rest of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_228">                               10) Villupuram or Thiruvannamalai are having
                               problems in procurement. In that case monthly tender
                               or Zonal base as indicated above may be
                               implemented in the Zone covering these two
                               contiguous districts. The periodicity of the tenders
                               may be at least monthly, given the frequent price
                               fluctuations.”

                          reference No.13, the above said letter dated 14.5.2012, has
                          also been referred. In paragraph No.4 of the above said
                          Government Order, it has been stated that the Director of
                          Social Welfare, who was consulted in the matter, has stated
                          that the State Level Tender System has both advantageous
                          and disadvantageous and the advantageous are that cartel
                          formation by the contractors may be avoided, expenditure on
                          advertisement and staff cost at district level may be reduced
                          and more organisations will participate in the tender and
                          disadvantageous are that separate arrangement has to be
                          made to monitor the supply and quality of egg and if any court
                          case is filed for any reason in State Level Tender, the
                          distribution of eggs in all districts will be affected. In
                          paragraph No.5 of the said Government Order, the Principal
                          Secretary/Special Commissioner, ICDS Scheme, has stated
                          that the centralized tender system will bring savings in
                          advertisement cost and saves time for calling and finalizing
                          the tender at all district levels and cartelization can be avoided
                          in the system and the system has disadvantageous also like
                          creation of monopoly in egg trade due to huge production
                          capacity and the cost and this will eliminate small and medium
                          poultry farmers. In paragraph No.6 of the Government Order,
                          all the above mentioned issues among others, were discussed
                          by the Chief Secretary with the Principal Secretaries, Finance
                          Department, Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme

                          30.8.2012, and data collected, were critically analyzed and
                          based on detailed deliberation, decisions were arrived. The
                          Division Bench at para 29 of its judgement, extensively stated
                          the contents of the said G.O. It would be profitable to extract
                          the said paragraph, which reads as under:

                          Tender have been analyzed and discussed in detail and in
                          depth and the Government has decided to accept the

                          price fixation will absorb month to month fluctuation in the
                          market price of the egg and at the same time it will also
                          counter year to year increase in the price of eggs.

                          b. The quotation through open tender system should be
                          compared with the average National Egg Co-ordination
                          Committee rates and reasonableness of the rate quoted

                      Thus, the Division Bench, while dealing with the aforesaid questions

                      raised therein, has in clear terms held that the Government had

                      considered all the advantages and disadvantages before passing the said

                      Government Order, apart from holding that great care has been bestowed

                      by the Government for ensuring supply of huge quantity of quality eggs

                      on time without any hiccups, as a successful tenderer has to deliver 50

                      lakhs egg per day to various centres. It was further held that the tender

                      documents calling for tenders were also in consonance with the said

                      Government Order and ultimately, it was held that there was no reason

                      for it to interfere in the tender process. The Division Bench was also of the

                      opinion that G.O.Ms.No.264 dated 17.10.2012, came to be issued by the

                      first respondent after elaborate discussion and consideration of all

                      relevant aspects including pros and cons of the State-wise as well as

                      District-wise tender systems and the same, though administrative in

                      nature, contains elaborate reasons as to the passing of the said

                      Government Order and therefore, it cannot be treated as arbitrary or

                      discriminatory or passed in favour of a particular person/group of persons

                      and accordingly, the said Government Order was confirmed. Aggrieved

                      over the said judgment, the Government preferred SLP No.6375 of 2015,

                      which was dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 13.04.2015,

                      confirming the judgment passed by the Division Bench. In such

                      circumstances, this Court has no hesitation to hold that when the earlier

                      G.O.Ms.No.264 attained finality, the same cannot be subjected to

                      modification by supplementing/complementing any clauses, as it amounts

                      to contrary to the settled decision. On this score also, the impugned

                      G.O.Ms.No.57 is liable to be quashed.

                      and the consequential tender notice issued by the respondent authorities

                      and placed reliance on a catena of decisions with regard to the scope of

                      judicial review in tender matters, the same do not inspire the confidence

</p>
<p id="p_258">                            33.1 The policy decision of the Government can always be

                      subjected to judicial review on the grounds of unreasonableness,

                      discrimination, arbitrariness, perversity and mala fides. The impugned

                      G.O.Ms.No.57 modifying the State-wise tender to that of a zone-wise

                      tender      does   not   contain   any    valid   and   acceptable   reason

                      necessitating/warranting modification of the earlier policy decision of

                      G.O.Ms.No.264, by which, directions were given to float State-wise

                      tenders. The impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 does not also contain any reason to

                      come to the conclusion that zone-wise tenders will be more beneficial to

                      the Government than State-wise tenders, as compared to G.O.Ms.No.264

                      especially when G.O.Ms.No.264 was confirmed by the Division Bench of

                      this Court, vide judgment dated 25.04.2014 in W.A.Nos.574 and 776 of

                      2013 accepting the stand and reasoning put forth by the Government and

                      the same was also affirmed by the Supreme Court vide order dated

                      13.04.2015 in SLP No.6375 of 2015. Further, the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57

                      has been issued within a short span of time i.e., within six working days

                      and there is no nexus corresponding to the object sought to be achieved

                      and the decision to introduce Zonal level tender and the exclusion of egg

                      suppliers from participation cannot be termed to be fair, just and legally

                      valid. That apart, the qualifying conditions for deciding the eligible

                      tenderers and other stipulations mentioned in the consequential tender

                      notification dated 20.08.2018 issued pursuant to G.O.Ms.No.57, are

                      neither supportive of the alleged reasoning i.e., benefiting poultry

                      farmers, nor have any nexus to the object of the Nutritious Meal Scheme

                      i.e., ensuring uninterrupted supply of quality eggs at a competitive same

                      price for the whole year to the children. The terms and conditions framed

                      in the tender notification dated 20.08.2018 are violative and contrary to

                      the relevant Act and Rules. That apart, there is no basis to state that

                      producers of eggs would be better suited persons than the egg suppliers

                      to ensure adequate and proper uninterrupted supply of eggs to several

                      thousand noon meal centres all over the State. Thus, this Court is of the

                      opinion that the impugned G.O.Ms.No.57 and the tender notification have

                      nothing to offer to the beneficiaries, who are covered under the Noon

                      Meal programme, but it is only a lame excuse that even small producers

                      would get benefit by the issuance of the said G.O. When the decision

                      taken by the Government was challenged and was subsequently,

                      approved by the Supreme Court, they are estopped from adopting

                      different method, which was negatived in the earlier proceedings.

                      G.O.Ms.No.57 and the subsequent tender notification are arbitrary,

                      mala fide, bad in law and not in public interest, as the same are contrary

                      to the judgment of the Supreme Court and it creates monopoly in favour

                      of one party, without affording an opportunity to others to compete. Since

                      the same are not based on any rational or relevant principle, it is violative

                      of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_159">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and also the rule of administrative law,

                      which inhibits the arbitrary action by the State. Hence, issuance of
