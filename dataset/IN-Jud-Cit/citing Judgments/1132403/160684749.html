<p id="p_13">    2.8       That it is a well settled principle that the test of comparisons of the marks

    many differences           may yet have an element of similarity which will cause

    the Plaintiff's mark, and in view only of the general recollection that such person

    has of what the nature of the Plaintiff's mark was, would be liable to be deceived,

    to another, the broad and essential features of the two marks are                       to be

    considered and they should not be placed side-by-side to find out if there are any

    prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the

    that the trade marks whose registration is sought, contains the said

    distinguishing or essential feature or convey the same idea, then ordinarily the




                                              
    Registrar would be right if he came to the conclusion that the trade mark should
                                   
    not be registered. The real question is as to how a purchaser, who must be looked
                                  
    upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a particular

    trade mark what association he would form by looking at the trade mark, and in
        

    what respect he would connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be
     



    purchasing. It is impossible to accept that a man looking at a trade mark would

    take in every single feature of the trade mark. The question would be, what





    would he normally retain in his mind after looking at the trade mark? What

    would be the salient features of the trade mark which in future would lead him to

    associate the particular goods with that trade mark?."

<p id="p_20">    2.16 That if the Court feels satisfied on inspection of the mark itself, in coming

    to the conclusion that some particular feature is the distinguishing feature of the

    adding what the Defendant describes as a drop of water as a background to the

    essential feature, makes no difference. Similarly, using the essential feature of

    the Plaintiff's logo in a reverse manner also makes no difference.                     The




                                                            
    background device, which the Defendant claims to be a drop of water, does not

    make the impugned mark different from the Plaintiff's logo.                  An overall




                                               
    impression which one gets looking at the impugned mark is that it is a copy of the
                                   
    Plaintiff's logo inasmuch as the whole of the Plaintiff's logo is, though in a reverse
                                  
    way incorporated in the impugned mark. A purchaser familiar with the Plaintiff's

    logo is bound to get confused when he sees the impugned mark, because he does
        

    not have both the marks before him and he has a general impression of the
     



    Plaintiff's logo.

<p id="p_22">    2.18 That in the present case, this Court need not push further the enquiry as





    to whether the impugned mark is deceptively similar or not, because the

    Defendant intended to create deception or confusion. The intention of the

    Defendant to create deception or confusion is clear from the fact that the





    Plaintiff's logo has been registered from 1999 and has been extensively used by

    the Plaintiff and it is not even denied by the Defendant that the Defendant was

    not aware of the Plaintiff's logo; the Defendant is not honest or candid in giving

    water bubble that envelopes the 'c' and 'e' to stand for clean water. That is

    totally absent in the Plaintiff's logo.

<p id="p_45">    (iv)      The impugned logo symbolizes water i.e. the industry in which the
        



    Defendant operates, the said being treatment of waste-water, and the same is

    completely different in comparison to the Plaintiff's logo i.e. the letter 'R', which

    of blue and green colour obviously signifies 'water' and the 'environment'. The

    Defendant being engaged in the business of waste water purification, reuse

    systems and solid waste re-cycling, has adopted a logo which conveys the idea of




                                                           
    conservation of the environment and water.          As opposed to this, the idea

    conveyed by the Plaintiff's logo is totally different. The Plaintiff itself calls its




                                               
    logo, available in various colours, as an 'R' logo. "R" obviously signifies
                                   
    "Reliance Industries Limited", a corporate entity. The middle portion of its logo
                                  
    is a "flame'' according to the Plaintiff's own case. The Plaintiff's logo does not

    convey the idea of water or environment, let alone conservation of water or
        

    environment.       In fact, in more ways than one, the idea conveyed              by the

    completely distinct from that of the 'curve' of the Plaintiff's logo. Further,

    such a 'rotated' logo of the Plaintiff conveys no idea whatsoever, while the





    Defendant's logo exhibits the idea of conservation of water and environment, in

    not a sound one, because it is unlikely that the purchaser will have the two marks

    before him. Therefore, what is required to be determined by the Court is

    whether a purchaser who sees the impugned mark in the absence of the Plaintiff's




                                                             
    mark, would only on the basis of a general recollection of what the nature of the

    Plaintiff's mark was, think that the trade mark before him is the same as the




                                                
    Plaintiff's mark, and thereby be deceived.

<p id="p_84">    9.        According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant has in its impugned logo taken
                                  
    the whole of the Plaintiff's logo (the curve) which is an essential feature of the

    Plaintiff's mark/logo, and is therefore guilty of infringement.             In my view,
           


    assuming that the Plaintiff's curve is an essential feature of its mark, the alleged
        



    essential feature of the Plaintiff's logo cannot be said to be a part of the

    impugned logo of the Defendant. There is no similarity between the Plaintiff's





    logo (curve) and the curve used by the Defendant. There is a clear difference

    and/or distinction between the Plaintiff's curve which is in round circular shape





    and the curve used by the Defendant. In fact, what is referred to as the 'curve'

    used by the Defendant is, as explained by the Defendant, the initials of the

    Defendant i.e. 'c' and 'e', which are artistically depicted inside the water

    droplet, which is an essential feature of the Defendant's logo. As against this,

    the Plaintiff itself calls its logo ('curve') as the 'R' logo, since the letter 'R' is




                                                             
    written in an artistic manner inside the circle. In the Plaintiff's 'R' logo, 'R' is

    formed in inverse space that is white colour or no colour. It therefore cannot be

    held that any person on seeing the impugned logo of the Defendant, would in

    to think that the trade mark before him is the same as the Plaintiff's mark.

<p id="p_85">    Therefore it can be safely concluded that the impugned logo of the Defendant
                                   
    does not contain any essential or distinguishing feature of the Plaintiff's logo as
                                  
    alleged or at all.

<p id="p_86">    10.       It is submitted on behalf of the Defendant that it is trite law that a mark
        


    should be compared as a whole. The Defendant is correct in its submission that
     



    weightage is required to be given to each feature of the rival mark such that they

    are compared as a whole. The rival logos are required to be compared as a whole





    without disregarding any feature thereof, more importantly, in the present case

    the essential feature of a water droplet which dominates the Defendant's logo.

    be an inverted or reversed or mirror image of the Defendant's logo.             I am in

    inverted or reversed or mirror image of such 'rotated' logo is deceptively similar
                                   
    to the Defendant's logo, so as to cause confusion. Again such a 'rotated' logo of

    the idea of conservation of water and environment in the manner set out

<p id="p_97">    17.       Again it is trite law that to decide the question of deceptive similarity, the

    nature and kind of customers who are likely to buy, as also other surrounding
        


    circumstances, play an important factor. This was held in no uncertain terms by
     



    the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/507033/" id="a_27">Khoday Distilleries Ltd. vs. Scotch

    Whisky Association</a> (supra), and by this Court in the case of Hiralal Parbhudas





    (supra).         In the present case, the Defendant is engaged in the business of

    development, manufacturing and installation of waste water treatment and reuse





    systems as well as solid waste re-cycling. Such products are not sold across the

    counter. The customers and/or purchasers who buy the Defendant's products

    would be such         as would not buy the Defendant's products without any

    deliberation. These factors, apart from the fact that the rival logos are not similar

<p id="p_98">    18.         Since the rival logos are completely different and/or distinct, the




                                                          
    question of there being any likelihood of confusion and/or damage to the

    Plaintiff, and the goods of the Defendant being passed-off as that of the Plaintiff




                                              
    does not arise, and the Plaintiff's case in respect of passing-off fails. Again in
                                   
    view of there being no similarity between the rival logos, which in fact are

    completely dissimilar, by no stretch of imagination can it be said that a person
                                  
    after seeing the rival marks would be of an opinion or would get an impression

    that the Defendant's logo appears to be a copy of the original. Therefore the
        


    allegation made by the Plaintiff that the Defendant is guilty of infringement of
     



    copyright is also not established.

<p id="p_99">    19.       Though there can be no dispute as regards the findings of the Hon'ble

    Courts in the decisions relied upon by the Plaintiff, in view of the facts of the

    present case, and the findings arrived at herein, the same does not lend assistance





    to the Plaintiff.

<p id="p_100">    20.       The Plaintiff has therefore failed to make out a prima facie case. The

    rival logos being completely different, and/or distinct, and/or even otherwise

    question as to whether the Plaintiff's mark/logo is a well known mark/logo and
