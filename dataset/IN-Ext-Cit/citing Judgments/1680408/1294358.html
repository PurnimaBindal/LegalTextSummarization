<p id="p_1">            Delivered on 25th  day of  March 2010

WRIT PETITION UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a> OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA            


</p><p id="p_2">  1.   Challenge  in  this petition is to  the  order  dated

       31.12.2007 (Annexure P/2) passed by the respondent No. 4,

       i.e. the Collector, Mahasamund, whereby the appointment of

       the petitioner alongwith 18 others by order dated 18.07.2007

       (Annexure P/4) passed by the respondent No. 5 i.e. Chief

       Executive Officer, Janpad Panchayat, Basna, on the post of

       Shiksha Karmi Grade III, was cancelled, and further, the

       order  dated 24.12.2008 (Annexure P/1) passed by  the

       respondent No. 3, i.e. Director Panchayat, whereby the

       appeal preferred by the petitioner alongwith others, against

       the order dated 31.12.2007 (Annexure P/2) in Appeal Case No.

       163/B.121/07.08, was rejected upholding the order passed by

       the Collector.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The brief facts, as projected by the petitioner are
that pursuant to the advertisement dated 20.02.2007
(Annexure P/3) issued by the respondent No. 5, for selection
and appointment on available vacancy of 89 posts of Shiksha
Karmi Grade III, the petitioner alongwith others made an
application. A select list of 81 candidates was declared on
approval by the General Administration Committee.  Out of 81
selected candidates, 38 persons joined the service on the
basis of appointment orders. The petitioner was one of the
38 persons who also joined the service on the basis of
appointment order dated 18.7.2007 (Annexure P/4). 43 posts
remained vacant on account of non-joining of the remaining
candidates. Though, there was no waiting list, a new list of
43 persons for appointment on the post of Shiksha Karmi
Grade III was declared on 12.10.2007. Pursuant to the select
list dated 12.10.2007, 10 persons joined and 33 persons
again did not join. Further a list of 115 persons for
appointment on the post of Shiksha Karmi Grade III was
issued on 6.11.2007. On a complaint, a Committee was  
constituted by the Chief Executive Officer, Janpad
Panchayat, Mahasamund to enquire into the appointments of  
Shiksha Karmi Grade III, pursuant to three different lists
issued by the then Chief Executive Officer, Janpad
Panchayat, Basna. In enquiry, subsequent list of 43 persons
and 115 persons dated 12.10.2007 and 06.11.2007  
respectively, were found defective and illegal. Accordingly,
subsequent select lists of 43 persons and 115 persons were
quashed on the basis of recommendation made by the  
Committee. On the basis of report submitted to the Collector
under section 85(1) of the Panchyat Raj Adhiniyam, 1993, the
respondent No. 4  cancelled the appointment of 19 persons
including the petitioner also, who were appointed by order
dated 18.7.2007 on the basis of first select list of 81
persons, without assigning any reason.
</p><p id="p_4">3.   Thereagainst, the petitioner alongwith others preferred
an appeal before the Director, Panchayat in appeal case No.
163/B.121/07.08. The Director, Panchayat found that the
appointment of the petitioners alongwith others was not in
accordance with law, on the basis of report submitted by the
Committee to the Chief Executive Officer, Jila Panchayat,
Mahasamund, without assigning any reason. The Director, in
his order has not discussed any reason for cancelling the
appointment of 19 Shiksha Karmis out of 38 Shiksha Karmis 
who were appointed vide the select list dated 18.07.2007.
The subsequent select lists dated 12.10.2007 and 06.11.2007
were cancelled in their entirety. Thus, this petition.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   Shri Pradhan, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner would submit that this is an individual case
where basic principles of natural justice were required to
be complied with as the petitioner has not admitted the fact
that the documents was not proper or genuine.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   Shri Pradhan would further submit that this is not a
case of quashing of the selection on account of
irregularities committed on mass scale. The petitioner was
appointed pursuant to the first select list dated
18.07.2007. The petitioner obtained information under the
Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_2">Information Act</a>, 2000 whereunder it was found that
the appointment of the petitioner was cancelled on the
ground that the experience certificate, produced by the
petitioner, of Jan Bhagidari School, Kolihadevri, Block
Basna, was not proper, as his name was not found in any of
the schools of Block Basna. Thus, the marks awarded to the
petitioner on the basis of experience certificate was
reduced. Further, the certificate of scout and guide was
also cancelled as the same was not issued by the competent 
authority. Thus, the marks awarded to the petitioner was
reduced from 65.36 to 50.86 and his appointment was 
accordingly cancelled.
</p><p id="p_7">6.   Shri Shrivastava, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent No. 5, on the other hand,  basically justifies
quashing of the select lists dated 12.10.2007 whereby 43
persons were appointed on the post of Shiksha Karmi Grade 
III and further the select list dated 06.11.2007 whereby 115
appointments were made. The counsel has not made any   
submission with regard to non-compliance of the principles
of natural justice in case of the petitioner, except that
the preliminary enquiry was made wherein all the concerned
officers, who were responsible in conduct of the
examination, were examined. But there is no whisper about
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   Shri Roy, learned counsel appearing for the
State/respondent No. 1 to 4 would adopt the submission made 
by the respondent No. 5 in oral argument as well as in their
return.
</p><p id="p_9">8.   Having heard learned counsel for the parties, perused
the pleadings and documents appended thereto, it is evident
that the enquiry committee in its report submitted to the
Chief Executive Officer, Jila Panchayat, Mahasamund, has
primarily dealt with the select list dated 12.10.2007  with
respect to selection of 43 persons and select list dated
06.11.2007 with respect to selection of 115 persons on the
post of Shiskah Karmi Grade III, which were found illegal as
the same was published firstly without having any waiting
list and secondly, certain approval as required under the
provisions of law were not taken. In case of cancellation of
appointment of the petitioner alongwith other 18 persons,
there is neither any detail discussion in the enquiry report
nor the Collector has discussed and considered anything in
respect of the petitioner in his order dated 31.12.2007. The
subsequent order of the Director, Panchayat in appeal, has
also not given any reasons and has not adverted to the
position as to why the principles of natural justice was
dispensed with in case of the petitioner. It appears that
the Officers below have been swayed by subsequent 
development in issuing select list dated 12-10-2007 and 6-11-
2007 for appointment on the post of Shiksha Karmi Grade -
III, while considering the case of the petitioner. The
petitioner has produced experience certificate (Annexure
P/7) which appears to have been counter signed by the
District Education Officer, Basna alongwith other
signatories, and a copy of. Scout Guide certificate, which
also appears to have been singed by the  Block Scout
Commissioner, Block Education Officer, Basna. 
</p><p id="p_10">9.   In reply filed by the respondent No. 5, it has not
controverted any averments made by the petitioner except
that the subsequent select list dated 12.10.2007 and
06.11.2007 was not approved by the General Administration
Committee of Janpad Panchyat which was a mandatory as    
prescribed under Chhattisgarh Panchayat Shiksha Karmis  
(Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1997.  It is
stated that the Committee has afforded opportunity to all
the officers who were involved in the conduct of examination
of appointment of Shiksha Karmi Grade III. But it is not the
case of the respondent No. 5 that any opportunity of hearing
was afforded to the petitioner.

the Supreme Court, observed as under: 
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "21.  There is a common thread that  the
                principle  of  natural  justice  is  not
                unruly  horse. The principles of natural
                justice  are  required  to  be  complied
                with,   having  regard  to   the   facts
                situation  obtained therein.  Thus,  the
                principles of natural justice may not be
                required  to be followed in  the  cases,
                where  the facts are admitted. Secondly,
                that  it  is  practically impossible  or
                highly    improbable   to   afford    an
                opportunity of hearing in the  event  of
                quashing  of  selection  on  account  of
                irregularity committed on mass scale, or
                en-masse   cancellation.   Thirdly,   no
                useful   purpose  would  be  served   by
                affording an opportunity of hearing."

<p id="p_12">  11.  Applying  the well settled principles of law  to  the

       facts of the case on hand where certain individuals have

       been taken out from a proper select list which was not

  vitiated in its entirety, and subsequently, even on enquiry

       on the ground of supply of forged documents, compliance of

       principles of natural justice is a must. It is well settled

       that the audi alteram partem is one of the basic pillars of

       natural justice which means no one should be condemned

       unheard {See : Ashok Kumar Sonkar (supra)}

</p><p id="p_13">12.  For the reasons stated hereinabove, the order dated
24.12.2008 (Annexure P/1) and the order dated 31.12.2007 
(Annexure P/2) in respect of the petitioner, are quashed.
The matter is remitted back to the respondent No. 4, i.e.
the Collector to consider and decide the case of the
petitioner afresh, if so advised, after affording an
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner to put forward his
case and thereafter, pass appropriate order in accordance
with law.
