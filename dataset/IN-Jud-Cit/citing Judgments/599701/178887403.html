      Shri Pranay Shukla, learned counsel for the petitioner.
      Shri R.S. Chabra, learned Additional Advocate General for the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    The petitioner before this Court has filed the present petition
stating that the petitioners are entitled for admission in post basic
nursing courses, which is being conducted at Government Nursing
College, Indore.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    The petitioners stated that the advertisement was issued on
11.12.2018 and it was stated in the advertisement that the female
candidates will be given preference and the male candidates will also
be permitted to participate in the process of selection. However, only
girls have been given admission in the college in question.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    The learned counsel for the petitioners argued before this court
that the reservation given by the State Government is amounting to
100% reservation to the female candidates, and therefore, the same is
violative of the constitutional right guaranteed to the petitioners
under the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    A detailed and exhaustive reply has been filed in the matter and
it has been stated on affidavit that the college in question is a girls
college and the courses are being run for girls students only.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    It has also been stated that the question of granting admission
to male students in the girls college does not arise, and therefore, the
respondents have not granted admission to the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_6">6.    This Court has carefully gone through the writ petition as well
as reply filed by the respondents and it is undisputed fact that the
college in question where the course has started is a 100% girls
college.

the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Menon

(Dr.) Vs. State of MP and others reported in 2009 (3) MPLJ 322
and para no.10 of the aforesaid judgment reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "10. It is therefore, clear that to enable women of this
     country, who for centuries were socially and economically
     handicapped to participate in the socio-economic activities
     on equal footing with men and to eliminate the
     backwardness of women, <a href="/doc/1603957/" id="a_1">Article 15(3)</a> provides that the
     State can make special provision for women. Such special
     provisions for women include reservation of seats in
     educational institutions or of posts in public employment in
     favour of women. According to Mr. Sanghi, however, no
     provision for reservation can be made of a single seat in an
     educational institution or a single post in public*
     employment in favour of women as per the law laid down in
     <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_2">M.R. Balaji v. Stattf of Mysore</a>, <a href="/doc/1461661/" id="a_3">Deepak Sibal v. Punjab

     Graduate Institute of Medical Education and <a href="/doc/200489/" id="a_4">Research},
     Chandigarh v. Faculty Association and Ors</a>. (supra). But it
     has been held in <a href="/doc/441239/" id="a_5">Toguru Sudhakar Reddy v. The
     Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> (supra) that the decision of
     the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_6">M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore</a>
     (supra), that the total reservation of seats in educational
     institutions under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_7">Article 15(4)</a> should not go beyond 50%
     was confined only reservation under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_8">Article 15(4)</a> of the
     Constitution. <a href="/doc/894181/" id="a_9">In Vijay Lakshmi v. Punjab University</a> : AIR

          Government of A.P. and Ors</a>. : 1993 Supp. (4) SCC
          439, approved the reasoning of the High Court of
          Andhra Pradesh, wherein it was held that
          reservation beyond the Constitution and that ratio
          in <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_12">M.R. Halaji v. State of Mysore</a>, 1963 Supp. (1)
          SCR 439, was only confined to the reservation
          under ArticleS 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution
          of India.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     Hence, the decisions of the Supreme Court under Articles
     15(4) and 16(4) that reservations in favour of SC, ST and
     OBC categories cannot exceed 50% or cannot be 100% do
     not apply to a special provision in favour of women under
     <a href="/doc/1603957/" id="a_13">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution"
