   Department, Government of Odisha (Opposite Party No.2) in
   relation to the amendment to the Industrial Policy Resolution
   2007 (IPR 2007) as being unconstitutional and illegal. The
   principal ground of such challenge is that the said amendment to
   the heading of paragraph-18.4 of the IPR 2007 has been made
   effective retrospectively from 1st July 2017 with a view to
   preventing Petitioner No.1 from availing the State Goods and

      Service Tax (SGST) reimbursement, as contemplated in
     paragraph-18.4 of IPR 2007.
</p>

<p id="p_3">     Background facts
</p><p id="p_4">     2. The background facts are that Petitioner No.1 is stated to be
     operating cement manufacturing units in various States in India
     including a cement manufacturing unit in Jharsuguda District in
     Odisha. According to the Petitioners, the said unit is a state-of-
     the-art cement manufacturing industrial unit which, inter alia,
     utilizes intermediate products (clinker) and waste products (fly
     ash) generated by other industrial undertakings along with
     gypsum as a raw material to manufacture high quality cement.
</p>

<p id="p_5">     3. It is stated that the cement manufacturing process undertaken
     by Petitioner No.1 is a controlled manufacturing process resulting
     in high value addition, employment generation and revenue
     augmentation. It is stated that the said manufacturing process
     requires substantial investment in high-end plant and machinery,
     monitoring and regulation through sophisticated electrical,
     mechanical and instrumentation systems by qualified technical
     personnel.

<p id="p_6">     IPR 2007
</p><p id="p_7">     4. On 2nd March 2007, the Industries Department, Government of
     Odisha published the IPR 2007 with a view to reinforcing and
     expanding the policy framework for industrial promotion and
     investment facilitation &quot;including creation of an enabling

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                            Page 2 of 36</span>
W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      environment&quot;. Paragraph 1.7 of IPR 2007 spelt out the strategy of
     the State Government, inter alia, promoting investments &quot;in new
     cement plants based on blast furnace slag and fly ash, which
     would be available in abundance due to the large number of steel
     and power plants coming up in the State&quot;.
</p>

<p id="p_8">     5. Paragraph-4 of the IPR 2007 spelt out the general policy
     framework whereby the State was to pursue a multi-pronged
     approach for industrial promotion. Efforts were to be made &quot;to
     incentivise investment in thrust and priority sectors with a view to
     maximizing the triple objectives of value addition, employment
     generation and revenue augmentation&quot;. In paragraph-4.4, certain
     &quot;thrust sectors&quot; were identified for providing &quot;tailor made
     incentive packages&quot; and &quot;additional incentive for the pioneer
     industries in these sectors&quot;. Paragraph-19 of the Annexure-I to the
     IPR 2007 spelt out what industries qualified as being in the
     &quot;thrust sector&quot;. This included agro processing, automobiles, auto
     components, textile, apparel, ancillary and downstream industries.
     Industrial units operating the said categories were required to
     meet specified minimum capital investment and employment
     generation criteria. For instance, Rs.10crores minimum capital
     investment and a direct employment generation of 100 persons
     was specified for a &quot;downstream industry&quot; in order to avail
     incentives meant for the &quot;thrust sector&quot;. Paragraph-2 of
     Annexure-I of the IPR 2007 defined &quot;downstream industry&quot; to
     mean an industrial undertaking which is engaged or proposed to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             Page 3 of 36</span>

      be engaged in value addition of the intermediate or final produce
     or waste product of one or more industrial undertakings.
</p>

<p id="p_9">     6. By a resolution dated 3rd March 2015, the definition of
     &quot;downstream      industry&quot;      was    amended          by     the    Industries
     Department prospectively to include a minimum threshold
     requirement     of    utilization     of     50%    of       intermediate/final
     produce/waste        products    of        industrial    undertakings        for
     qualification as a downstream industry.
</p>

<p id="p_10">     7. According to the Petitioners, Petitioner No.1 utilizes raw
     materials which are either intermediate products (clinker) or
     waste products (fly ash) of other industrial undertakings in the
     proportion of approximately 96% by weight, with the raw
     material gypsum constituting the remaining approximately 4% by
     weight. Thus, Petitioner No.1 qualified as a downstream industry
     even according to the amended definition.
</p>

<p id="p_11">     8. It is contended that IPR 2007 contemplated that existing
     cement manufacturing units which undertook expansion of
     installed capacity and satisfied the prescribed criteria for
     downstream &quot;thrust sector&quot; industrial units were entitled and
     eligible to avail financial incentives under IPR 2007 including
     Value Added Tax (VAT) reimbursement.
</p>

<p id="p_12">     9. Paragraph-14 of the IPR 2007 provided for the eligibility
     criteria for availing &quot;financial and other support measures&quot; which

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      stated   that   existing      industrial     units   which     take    up
     expansion/modernization/diversification will be eligible for
     specific incentives as specified.
</p>

<p id="p_13">     10. Paragraph 18.4 of IPR 2007 provided for &quot;VAT
     Reimbursement&quot;. As per paragraph 18.4 (iii), new industrial units
     of the thrust sector were eligible for reimbursement of 75% of
     VAT paid for a period of 10 years from the date of starting
     commercial      production.     The        quantum   of      such     VAT
     reimbursement which could be availed was capped at 200% of the
     fixed capital investment subject to the condition that VAT
     reimbursement shall be applicable only to the net tax paid, after
     adjustment of input tax credit against the output tax liability.
     Under paragraph 18.4 (iv) &quot;existing industrial units taking up
     expansion/ modernization/ diversification as defined in this IPR
     shall be eligible for reimbursement of VAT paid to the extent
     applicable to the industrial category as defined in sub paragraph-
     18.4 (i) to (iii) above subject to the condition that it shall be
     applicable only on increased commercial production over and
     above the existing installed capacity provided that the VAT
     reimbursement shall be applicable only to the net tax paid, after
     adjustment of input tax credit against the output tax liability.&quot;

<p id="p_14">     Facts pertaining to Petitioner No.1
</p><p id="p_15">     11. Reverting to the facts of the present case, Petitioner No.1 had
     an existing industrial unit for manufacturing Pozzolana Portland
     Cement (PPC) at Jharsuguda, Odisha with an installed capacity of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                   Page 5 of 36</span>
W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      1.00 million tons per annum (MTPA). This unit commenced its
     commercial production on 14th September, 1993.
</p>

<p id="p_16">     12. Petitioner No.1 proposed to expand its installed capacity from
     1 to 3 MTPA in 2011. It is stated that it decided to do so relying
     on the assurances and promises held out in IPR 2007 as noted
     hereinbefore. It sought permissions from the State authorities for
     the proposed expansion. On 9th September 2011, the State Level
     Single Window Clearance Authority (SLSWCA) headed by the
     Chief Secretary, Government of Odisha, granted permission to
     Petitioner No.1 for expansion of its production capacity at its
     Jharsuguda cement manufacturing unit from 1 to 3 MTPA.
</p>

<p id="p_17">     13. The Petitioners state that from 2011 onwards, Petitioner No.1
     committed significant investments, resources and manpower and
     expanded its installed capacity from 1 to 2.6 MTPA. After
     successful expansion as aforesaid by 2013, Petitioner No.1 had
     two cement production units referred as Line 1 and Line 2 cement
     plants. As already noticed, it was utilizing the raw materials as the
     intermediate products (clinker) and waste products (fly ash)
     generated by other industrial undertakings in the proportion of
     96% by weight and gypsum constituting the remaining 4%.
     Petitioner No.1 is stated to have made an investment of more than
     Rs.350 crores towards the above expansion of its installed
     capacity including a fixed capital investment of Rs.183.75 crores
     resulting in an employment generation for 126 persons. It is stated

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      that, over 500 persons are currently engaged in its Jharsuguda
     unit.
</p>

<p id="p_18">     14. Commercial production of the expanded unit commenced on
     15th October 2013 within three years from the date of the first
     fixed capital investment as required under the IPR 2007. A
     commercial production certificate issued by the Director of
     Industries on 10th December 2014 specifying the above
     commercial production date is enclosed as Annexure-5 to the
     petition.
</p>

<p id="p_19">     15. The Petitioners point out that there are 51 categories of
     industrial units listed out in the &quot;negative list&quot; (Annexure-II)
     appended to the IPR including &quot;grinding and mixing units&quot; listed
     at Sl No.51. These are not entitled to avail the financial incentives
     since they are small units with non-recurring and low capital
     investment. That downstream industrial units under the &quot;thrust
     sector&quot; would not come within the &quot;negative list&quot; was clarified at
     the 1st meeting of the Empowered Committee held on 4th
     December 2014. It was clarified that the negative list only applied
     to the small industrial units which did not involve any value
     addition and not to cement manufacturing units like Petitioner
     No.1.
</p>

<p id="p_20">     16. Reliance is also placed by the Petitioners on the observation
     of the second meeting of the Empowered Committee held on 22nd



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                              Page 7 of 36</span>
W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      August 2015 wherein, specific to the case on hand it was
     observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            &quot;The Director of Industries has clarified that the
            manufacturing of cement using clinker and fly ash/ blast
            furnace slag as raw material is an activity with high
            value addition and utilizing high value of plant and
            machinery. The negative list does not intend to debar
            such industry from availing incentives under IPR. The
            [Empowered] Committee decided to accept the
            clarification submitted by the D.I., Odisha and allowed
            to extend the benefit under IPR-2007 to such units.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     17. It is stated that a joint inspection was conducted by the
     Director of Industries and a State Level Nodal Agency IPICOL in
     2016. IPICOL issued an eligibility certificate on 3rd May 2016 in
     the prescribed Form-E under IPR 2007 in favour of Petitioner
     No.1. Thereafter, the Director of Industries (Opposite Party No.3)
     issued a certificate of verification dated 30th July 2016 certifying
     that Petitioner No.1 satisfied the criteria in relation to capital
     investment and employment generation for qualifying as a &quot;thrust
     sector&quot; industrial unit under IPR 2007. The certificate specifically
     noted that the Jharsuguda cement manufacturing unit of Petitioner
     No.1 &quot;was not included in the activities enlisted at Sl.3 of
     Annexure-II of IPR 2007&quot;. Opposite Party No.3 then on 1st
     September 2016 issued the &quot;certificate of thrust sector&quot; certifying
     that Petitioner No.1&#x27;s cement manufacturing unit fulfills the
     eligibility criteria as a thrust sector industy and &quot;.....may be
     eligible to avail incentives/ concessions as applicable to the thrust
     sector industries under the provisions of IPR 2007......&quot;.

     order on 6th June 2017 for disbursement of a sum of
     Rs.6,06,75,000/- in favour of Petitioner No.1 towards VAT
     reimbursement for the period 15th October 2013 to 31st March
     2014. It is stated that despite repeated requests, the Opposite
     Parties failed to disburse the sanctioned amount towards VAT
     reimbursement in favour of Petitioner No.1. Reference is made to
     the representations dated 27th March 2018, 15th May 2018 and
     17th May 2018 made by Petitioner No.1 to the Opposite Parties
     for this purpose.
</p>

<p id="p_24">     19. On 6th October 2018, Opposite Party No.3 issued an order
     cancelling the sanction order dated 6th June 2017 purportedly on
     the basis of decision taken at a meeting held on 5th September
     2018 under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, Odisha
     which purportedly decided that the Jharsuguda unit of Petitioner
     No.1 was &quot;......a standalone cement grinding unit and attracts Sl
     No.51 of Annexure II of the Negative List under IPR-2007.
     Accordingly, it will not be eligible for VAT reimbursement under
     IPR-2007.&quot;

<p id="p_25">     Proceedings in this Court
</p><p id="p_26">     20. The Petitioners then filed W.P.(C) No.12435 of 2019 in this
     Court questioning the aforementioned order dated 6th October,
     2018 as being arbitrary and illegal. On 23rd July 2019, this Court
     admitted the writ petition directing that the payment of tax by
     Petitioner No.1 towards VAT/SGST would be subject to the

     succeeded in the writ petition, the amount so deposited by it
     would be refunded to it along with interest.
</p>

<p id="p_27">     21. By a letter dated 22nd May 2019, the Opposite Parties rejected
     the claims of Petitioner No.1 for VAT and SGST reimbursement
     for the financial year (FY) 2017-18. Further, the Opposite Parties
     refused to accept the reimbursement claims lodged by Petitioner
     No.1 for the current FY 2019-20 compelling it to send it by
     courier. Thereafter, on 18th August 2020, a resolution was passed
     by the Opposite Parties retrospectively amending paragraph 18.4
     of IPR 2007, with effect from 1st July 2017 ostensibly to
     incorporate changes to the provisions necessitated on account of
     introduction of the Goods and Services Tax regime (GST) and
     make provisions for reimbursement of the state component of
     GST i.e. the SGST to eligible industries, instead of VAT
     reimbursement as originally envisaged.
</p>

<p id="p_28">     22. The Petitioners pointed out that while the erstwhile un-
     amended heading of paragraph 18.4 of the IPR was simply titled
     &quot;VAT reimbursement&quot;, the amended heading of paragraph 18.4
     IPR 2007 reads as under:

<p id="p_30">     Stand of the Opposite Parties
</p><p id="p_31">     24. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of Opposite Party
     Nos.1 to 4 in W.P.(C) No.12435 of 2019 where it is, inter alia,
     contended that at the High-Level Committee meeting under the
     Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, it was decided that the
     activity of Petitioner No.1 fell under the Sl. No.51 of Annexure-II
     of the negative list of IPR 2007. It is stated that Petitioner No.1
     manufactures cement using clinker, gypsum and fly ash. Initially,
     clinker and gypsum are mixed and grinded and then fly ash mixed
     in further processing stage produces the final product, i.e.,
     cement. The letter dated 18th February 2019 of Opposite Party
     No.3 is itself put forth as giving the reasons for cancellation of the
     sanction order. According to the Opposite Parties, &quot;the benefits
     are extended to the units after proper appreciation of all relevant
     factors as per the provisions laid down in IPR 2007 and
     concerned operational guidelines basing on the claim and
     eligibility of the applicant unit.&quot;

     Industry&quot; and did not fall within the scope of &quot;grinding and
     mixing unit&quot; specified at Sl. No.51 of the negative list. In reply to
     this, it is sought to be contended by the Opposite Parties that
     under paragraph-29 of the IPR 2007, the implementation of the
     policy was to be periodically reviewed by a High-Level Clearance
     Authority (HLCA) &quot;for necessary facilitation and mid-course
     correction, wherever necessary&quot;.

     2020 as Annexure-D/3. A perusal of the said minutes shows that
     the case of KCMW was specifically taken up for consideration

<p id="p_40">     28. It is stated in paragraph-2 of the additional affidavit that

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      after introduction of GST, the State Government after taking into
     consideration several factors took a conscious decision to replace
     the provisions regarding VAT and Entry Tax by way of
     amendment and there is no illegality involved in the same.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_41">     29. It was further stated that &quot;taking a large cement
     manufacturing unit as a base, it is observed that State Government
     has to pay @ Rs.51.46 crores/MMTPA tentatively towards
     reimbursement of SGST under the IPR-2007. Further, looking
     into the Cement Plants already started production and the Cement
     Manufacturing Units in pipeline, it is estimated that State
     Government has to sacrifice tentatively up to Rs.918 crores net
     SGST per annum i.e. for 17.85 MMTPA from the FY 17-18
     onwards. Looking into the financial burden on State exchequer,
     Government of Odisha has decided to stop the incentives for
     Cement Plants as a whole and there is no illegality involved in the
     same. Government has made an expenditure of Rs.134.28/- Crore,
     Rs.174.85/- Crore and Rs.165.68 Crore for the years 2017-18,
     2018-19 &amp; 2019-20 respectively towards reimbursement of VAT
     only for Cement Manufacturing Units. A conscious decision has
     been taken in respect of all the Cement Manufacturing Units of
     the State and not in respect of the Petitioner-Unit only.&quot;

</p>

<p id="p_47">     (i) Petitioner No.1 had acted upon the representations, promises
     and assurances held out in IPR 2007 including, inter alia, the
     promise of post production incentives in the form of VAT/ SGST
     reimbursement as set out in paragraph 18.4 of IPR 2007. Acting
     on the said representations, Petitioner No.1 made significant fixed
     capital investments of Rs.183.75 crores and successfully
     expanded its installed capacity from 1 MTPA to 2.6 MTPA. It
     commenced commercial production with effect from 15th October
     2013 and was issued all the certificates referred to hereinbefore. It
     was, therefore, not open to the State to deny the vested right and
     entitlement to Petitioner No.1 on a completely untenable and
     irrational basis. The impugned decisions were contrary to the
     doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation.

</p>

<p id="p_49">     (ii) Cement manufacturing industry was one of the eight core
     industries which contributed to industrial growth, employment
     generation and revenue augmentation. Exclusion of such an
     industry from availing post production incentives designed to
     promote industrial growth within the State of Odisha under IPR
     2007 was ex facie contrary to the objectives of IPR 2007.
</p>

<p id="p_50">     (iii) There was no stipulation in IPR 2007 that all raw materials
     used for manufacturing of cement must also be manufactured at
     the unit itself and cannot be procured from outside the State.
     Therefore, to categorize the unit of Petitioner No.1 as a
     &quot;standalone cement grinding unit&quot; falling in the negative list at Sl
     No.51, was misconceived. A bare perusal of the negative list
     would make it evident that industrial units specified therein
     required &quot;low capital investment&quot; and resulted in &quot;low value
     addition, lower employment generation and lesser revenue
     augmentation of the State&quot;. Therefore, the cancellation of the
     VAT reimbursement of the Petitioners was completely illegal and
     arbitrary.
</p>

<p id="p_51">     (iv) An examination of the figures of VAT reimbursement made
     by the State Government, as stated in its additional affidavit dated
     2nd December 2021, revealed that there was an admission by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                            Page 16 of 36</span>
W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      State Government that VAT reimbursement had in fact been
     granted to the cement manufacturing units similarly situated as
     that of Petitioner No.1. Relying on the decision in <a href="/doc/1324332/" id="a_7">State of U.P. v.
     Birla Corporation Limited</a> (supra), it is submitted that revenue
     loss cannot be invoked as supervening public interest to deny the
     promised incentives to industrial units which have a vested and
     accrued right and have satisfied all the prescribed criteria.
</p>

<p id="p_52">     (v) The vested right of the Petitioners cannot be taken away by
     way of a retrospective amendment that too only by amending the
     heading of paragraph 18.4 of the IPR 2007 without any changes
     to be substantive provision thereof. Petitioner No.1 was entitled to
     the post production incentives as a &#x27;thrust sector downstream
     industrial unit&#x27;. The entire manufacturing process and quality
     parameters of cement cannot be achieved by merely &quot;mixing and
     grinding of raw materials&quot;, it has to be achieved by using high
     end plant and machinery. In this context, a detailed note on the
     cement manufacturing process adopted by Petitioner No.1 has
     been placed on record.
</p>

<p id="p_53">     (vi) There was no rational basis for subjecting Petitioner No.1 to
     discriminatory    treatment     vis-à-vis   an   identical      cement
     manufacturing unit like KCMW. There was no explanation
     offered for subjecting only cement manufacturing/grinding units
     and blast furnace slag-based units for denial of SGST
     reimbursement.

     be revoked or rescinded with retrospective effect.
</p>

<p id="p_59">     Analysis and reasons
</p><p id="p_60">     37. The above submissions have been considered. At the outset, it
     must be noted that the State authorities are not denying that the
     Petitioner No.1 was in fact issued the eligibility certificate dated
     3rd May 2016 under IPR 2007 by IPICOL after a &quot;joint inspection
     of the Petitioners&#x27; Jharsuguda unit by Opposite Party No.3.&quot; There
     is no denial that subsequently there was a certificate of
     verification issued on 30th July 2016 stating that the Jharsuguda
     unit of Petitioner No.1 &quot;was not included in the activity enlisted at
     Sl No.3 of Annexure-II of IPR 2007.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                             Page 19 of 36</span>
<p id="p_61">W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
</p><p id="p_62">      38. There is also no denial that a certificate acknowledging that
     the unit of PetitonerNo.1 was in the &#x27;thrust sector&#x27; was issued on
     1st September 2016, again by Opposite Party No.3. Therefore, it is
     plain that a detailed verification was undertaken of the activity of
     Petitioner No.1 and particularly its manufacturing process. To
     now contend, as is sought to be done by the Opposite Parties in
     the reply to the rejoinder, that since Petitioner No.1 was sourcing
     clinker from the cement units at Chhattisgarh, fly ash from certain
     units in Sambalpur and gypsum was imported from Iran, all that
     Petitioner No.1&#x27;s unit was doing was to mix these at its unit for
     production of cement is completely contrary to what admittedly is
     very elaborate and sophisticated process of manufacture
     undertaken at its high-end state-of-the-art unit. All that the
     Opposite Parties have done in response to the averment regarding
     the elaborate manufacturing process using high-end technology is
     to merely state that it is &quot;incorrect and denied herewith&quot;. At no
     point in time, prior to the impugned cancellation orders, the
     Opposite Parties came to the conclusion that Petitioner No.1 unit
     was only undertaking the activity of &quot;mixing and grinding&quot;.
</p>

<p id="p_63">     39. There is merit in the contention of the Petitioners that the
     &#x27;negative list&quot; attached to the IPR 2007 was actually meant to
     cover units such as flour mills, confectionaries, brick grinding,
     book binding, etc. It was intended to identify small units for the
     purposes of assisting them to avail loans and working capital. It
     was not meant to exclude &#x27;thrust sector&#x27; units like Petitioner
     No.1. There is no denial by the Opposite Parties that Petitioner

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                            Page 20 of 36</span>
W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      No.1 was in fact recognized as a downstream thrust sector
     industrial unit. Clauses 2 and 11 of the IPR 2007 defines
     &quot;downstream industry&quot; and industrial unit as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            &quot;2. &#x27;Downstream Industry&#x27; means an Industrial
            undertaking, which is engaged or proposed to be
            engaged in value addition of the intermediate or final
            produce or waste product of one or more industrial
            undertakings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">            11. &#x27;Industrial Unit&#x27; means any industrial undertaking
            located inside the State and engaged in any
            manufacturing or servicing activity as detailed in the
            Schedule appended to this policy.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_64">     40. In terms of Clause-1 (a) of the Schedule appended to IPR
     2007, an industry listed in the 1st Schedule of the Industries
     Development and Regulation (IDR) Act, 1951 is recognized as an
     industrial unit for the purposes of IPR 2007. Manufacturing and
     production of cement (which is what is produced by Petitioner
     No.1 at its Jharsuguda Unit) is listed at Sl. No.35 of the 1st
     Schedule to the IDR Act. The Opposite Parties also do not dispute
     the fact that Petitioner No.1&#x27;s unit fulfils the &quot;triple objectives&quot; of
     the IPR 2007, viz, (i) value addition; (ii) employment generation
     and (iii) revenue augmentation.
</p>

<p id="p_65">     41. Thirdly, there is merit in the contention of the Petitioners that
     there is no justification given by the Opposite Parties as to why
     only cement manufacturing/grinding units and blast furnace slag-
     based units have been chosen for denial of SGST reimbursement
     and that too with retrospective effect, if in fact the idea was to

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
      revisit the incentive under IPR 2007 as a result of introduction of
     the GST regime. It will be recalled that the GST regime was
     introduced in the country with effect from 1st July 2017 whereas
     the retrospective amendment was made more than three years
     later on 18th August 2020 and that too only for cement
     manufacturing/grinding units and blast furnace slag-based units.
     In the absence of a convincing justification provided, a move
     directed at only a few thrust sector industries for denial of SGST
     reimbursement can only be termed irrational, arbitrary and
     discriminatory.
</p>

<p id="p_66">     42. For reasons explained hereafter, the Court is of the view that
     the Petitioners have made out a case for striking down of the
     impugned decisions of the Opposite Parties on the ground of
     promissory estoppel.
</p>

<p id="p_67">     43. The Court would first like to take up for discussion the
     decision of the Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/1233850/" id="a_14">MRF Limited v.
     Assistant Commissioner (Assessment) Sales Tax</a> (supra), which
     in the considered view of this Court is squarely applicable to the

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">          (a) MRF Ltd. (&#x27;MRF&#x27;) made investment of Rs. 80 Crores

          and verification of its manufacturing process. Having
          found MRF eligible for sales tax exemption, the State

            subject to the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel
            in cases where because of their representation the party
            claiming estoppel has changed its position and if such
            an estoppel does not fly in the face of any statutory
            prohibition, absence of power and authority of the
            promisor and is otherwise not opposed to public
            interest, and also when equity in favour of the promisee
            does not outweigh equity in favour of the promisor

            the withdrawal of the exemption during that fixed
            period cannot affect the already accrued right. Of
            course, overriding public interest would prevail over a

            and thereby deprive MRF of the benefit of exemption
            for more than 5 years out of a total period of 7 years, in
            our opinion, is highly arbitrary, unjust and unreasonable
            and deserves to be quashed. In any event, the State

      crystallized right in favour of Petitioner No.1 in terms of
     paragraph 18.4 of IPR 2007 to avail the incentives. That is why
     the sanction order dated 6th June 2017 was issued in the first
     place. No valid justification has been provided by the Opposite
     Parties for retrospectively cancelling the said sanction order and
     that too well over a year after it was issued. The reasons given for
     such cancellation, viz., that the Petitioners did not source its raw
     materials from outside is not specified as a dis-incentive or a
     disqualification under IPR 2007. As already pointed out, the unit
     of Petitioner No.1 does not fall within Sl. No.51 of the negative
     list at all. That list was for low capital investment units resulting
     in lower value addition and lesser employment generation. In the
     considered view of the Court, the decision in MRF Limited
     (supra) would squarely apply to the facts of the present case.

          rescinded by the State Government with effect from 14th
          October, 2004. On account of issuance of the 3rd

          those units which had fulfilled conditions prescribed under

          3rd Notification had a vested right and entitlement to avail

            condition that the burden is upon the Government to
            show that it acted in furtherance to public interest in
            issuing such a notification otherwise than in accordance
            with the promise and that the public interest is so
            overwhelming that it would be inequitable to hold the
            Government bound by the promise. It is well established
            that the Court would not act on mere ipse dixit of the
            Government and must insist on a highly rigorous
            standard of proof in discharge of its burden by the

            of commercial production, there is no tangible reason

            underlying notification dated 27th February, 1998 had
            ceased to exist or had become irrelevant in any manner,
            much less there are supervening circumstances qua such

            have given rise to some logistical issues for the State
            including financial implications regarding future
            revenue loss. That ground cannot be invoked as
            supervening public interest in reference to the activities
            of the industrial units who qualify the conditions
            specified in notification dated 27th February, 1998 in all
            other respects and had commenced commercial
            production of the specified product before 14th October,
            2004. Indubitably, an enforceable right had accrued to
            and crystallised in favour of such industrial units which
            could not be truncated or snapped unless the dominant
            purpose for which the notification dated 27th February,
            1998 came to be issued had ceased to exist, namely
            generation of fly ash by the thermal power stations
            situated within the State and consumption of that fly ash
            by the industrial units established within the designated
            areas of the State as per the specified quantity to become
            entitled for rebate for the duration mentioned

            future revenue loss cannot be invoked against the
            industrial units who had already established and
            commenced production after 27th February, 1998 and
            before 14th October, 2004. For, it can be safely
            presumed that the policy makers were fully conscious

            respect under the notification dated 27th February, 1998
            and have made substantial investment running into
            crores much less as being supervening public interest, as
            is being placated by the State in these proceedings. This
            is clearly an afterthought plea, which by no standards
            can stand the test of judicial scrutiny. It is well
            established that the Court is obliged to insist for a highly
            rigorous standard of proof in the discharge of the burden
            and onus upon the State to justify its action as

     fulfilled all conditions specified in the 2nd Notification dated 27th
     February, 1998 and had commenced commercial production prior
     to issuance of 3rd Notification. It was held that the 3rd
     Notification cannot be construed as having retrospective or
     retroactive effect to whittle down the accrued rights in favour of
     the Respondent units which were entitled to rebate as specified in

     years from commencement of commercial production.

          permit an unconscionable departure by one party from
          the subject-matter of an assumption which has been
          adopted by the other party as the basis of a course of
          conduct which would affect the other party if the
          assumption be not adhered to. The assumption may be
          of fact or law, present or future. And two, that the relief
          that may be given on the facts of a given case is
          flexible enough to remedy injustice wherever it is
          found. And this would include the relief of acting on
          the basis that a future assumption either as to fact or
          law will be deemed to have taken place so as to afford

            representation to the respondent and similarly situated
            industrial units under the Industrial Policy 2012. This

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
             representation gave rise to a legitimate expectation on
            their behalf, that they would be offered a 50 per cent
            rebate/deduction in electricity duty for the next five
            years. However, due to the failure to issue a notification
            within the stipulated time and by the grant of the
            exemption only prospectively, the expectation and trust
            in the State stood violated. Since the State has offered
            no justification for the delay in issuance of the
            notification, or provided reasons for it being in public
            interest, we hold that such a course of action by the
            State is arbitrary and is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_20">Article 14.&quot;</a>

<p id="p_91">     49. Turning now to the decisions relied upon by Mr. Muduli, in
     <a href="/doc/1732840/" id="a_21">Sales Tax Officer v. Shree Durga Oil Mills</a> (supra), certain
     assessment orders by the Sales Tax Officer were challenged by
     contending that the Petitioner had set up its industries of
     manufacturing groundnut oil as a small scale industry unit acting
     on the promises held out in the IPR dated 18th July 1979 by the
     Industries Department, Government of Odisha. However, the
     difference as far as the case is concerned is that there was no
     notification under Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947
     granting exemption on payment of tax on purchase or sale of
     ground nut, mustard seeds etc during the relevant period. It was
     therefore contended that in the absence of such notification the
     Petitioner could not avail the incentives. The reasons why the
     Supreme Court in that case did not extend the principle of
     promissory estoppel have been spelt out as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">           &quot;13. There are several reasons why we are unable to
           uphold the contention based on the principle of
           promissory estoppel raised by the respondents in this
           case. No particulars have been given by the respondents

W.P.(C) Nos.29253 of 2020 &amp; 12435 of 2019
            as to when the decision was taken to set up the industry,
           the date when the loan was obtained from the bank, and
           exactly when land was purchased or the plant and
           machinery were acquired for setting up of the small-
           scale industrial unit. The I.P.R. on which reliance has
           been placed by the respondent was issued on 18.7.1979.
           A provisional registration certificate in respect of the
           respondent&#x27;s industry was issued on 28.11.1979. The
           respondent has not given factual details of how in the
           short span of about four months, it set up its industry on
           the basis of the I.P.R.&quot;

<p id="p_92">     50. In the present case, however, the situation is entirely different.
     The Opposite Parties themselves have granted the eligibility
     certificate and verification certificate as noted hereinbefore. In
     fact, the orders sanctioning the VAT reimbursement have been
     passed on 6th June 2017. Therefore, there is absolutely no
     justification in denial of the benefit of SGST reimbursement to
     Petitioner No.1.

<p id="p_93">     51. Turning now to the decision in <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_22">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd.
     v. Commercial Tax Officer</a> (supra), the facts there were again
     very different. It was noted in that case that &quot;.....at the point of
     time the appellant units were set up and the commercial
     production started there was no assurance or promise, the doctrine
     of promissory estoppel had no application to the facts of the case
     at that stage&quot;. The case was remanded to the High Court for a
     fresh decision. Therefore, the said decision is also of no
     assistance to the Opposite Parties to avoid the liability.

</p><p id="p_95">      52. The Court rejects the plea of the opposite Parties that it is
     being called upon in the present case to review a policy decision.
     The Court is in fact being asked to examine the reasonableness of
     the decision of the Opposite Parties to retrospectively take away
     the benefits already extended to an existing unit under IPR 2007.
     Consequently, none of the decisions relied upon by the Opposite
     Parties in the context of judicial review of policy decisions of the
     State have any applicability to the facts of the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_96">     53. Lastly, the Court is not satisfied of the reasons given by the
     Opposite Parties for discriminating against Petitioner No.1 unit
     vis-à-vis KPCW which appears to be identically placed as
     Petitioner No.1. The HCLA at its meeting on 18th September,
     2008 noted that KCMW was &quot;a separate unit but part of
     integrated facility of OCL for manufacturing cement&quot;. In other
     words, KCMW was also a standalone unit. Further, nowhere does
     IPR 2007 state that a cement producing unit that sources raw
     materials from outside would be ineligible to receive the
     incentives.

     order dated 6th October 2018 issued by the Director of Industries
     withdrawing the earlier order dated 6th June 2017 granting
     Petitioner No.1 the exemption. The Court also sets aside the
     resolution dated 18th August 2020 retrospectively amending IPR

                  2007. It is clarified that the said amendment would have only
                 prospective effect and would not affect the entitlement of
                 Petitioner No.1 to the incentives for the period prior to the said
                 amendment.

                 Petitioners succeed in the writ petition, any payment of tax would
