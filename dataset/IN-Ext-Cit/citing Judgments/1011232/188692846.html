1994 Supp(1) SCR 807



and C.A. 3013 of 1990

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by

K. RAMASWAMY. J These five appeals raise four-pronged attack on the
Constitutionality of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and Land Tenure Abolition
Laws (Gujarat Amendment) Act 8 of 1982 (for short "the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1">Amendment Act</a>").
Though unsuccessful in the High Court of Gujarat in Special Civil
Application Nos. 1118 of 1982 and batch by judgment of the Division Bench
dated 7/8 September, 1983 and followed in Special Civil Application No.
763/82 dated September 16, 1988 the appellants had leave of this Court. A
short shift of the antecedent history of land tenures in Saurashtra region
of the State of Gujarat is necessary to focus the focal points posed for
decision, by common judgment. The appellants are suc-cessors of
Barkhalidars and Girasdars. The erstwhile Saurashtra State consisted of 220
princely states rules by sovereign Rulers in their own rights.The lands in
these appeals form present parts of Surendra Nagar and Bhavnagar districts.
In the State of Saurashtra, the Rulers entered into agreements with
Taluqadar and estate holders and also created a class of interested people
known as "Barkhalidars or Girasdars, Various parcels of lands together with
all rights in or interest over those lands were granted for cultivation on
payment of revenue etc. with a right of succession in favour of their
cadets or relations or favourites known as "Girasdars" or "Barkhalidars".
"Gharkhed", known in South India estate tenures as "Homefarm lands", means
land reserved by land holder for personal cultivatioa "Bid Land" means such
lands as has been used by the land holders for grazing his cattle or for
cutting grass for the cattle. "Land holder" means Zamindar, Jagirdar,
Girasdar, Taluqadar etc. or any person who is a holder of land or who is
interested in land and whom the Government has declared, on account of the
extent and value of the land or his interests therein, to be a landholder.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The system in vogue was that the lands that were under control of the
rulers through the agriculturists, the latter had to bring their produce to
a common place "khali" meaning thereby threshing floor. The ruler or his
agent used to take stock of the total produce harvested and set apart
towards the ruler's share according to the custom or the contract and the
remainder belong to the agriculturists. In the other system the land was
granted to the "Girasdars" or "barkhalidars", and the requirement of bring-
ing the harvest by the agriculturists to the threshing floor was dispensed
with. This anachronistic land tenure system was done away with by progres-
sive different land tenures conferring permanent ryotwari settlements on
the tiller of the soil through The Saurashtra Gharkhed Tenancy Settlement
and Agricultural Lands Ordinance, 1949 which later became the Act, the
Saurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951; the Saurashtra Barkhali Abolition Act,
1951 and the Saurashtra Estates Acquisition Act, 1952 (for short "the
Act"). Under the respective statutes the rights and liabilities of
Girasdars or Barkhalidars have been determined. The details whereof are not
relevant for the purpose of these appeals. Suffice it to state that <a href="/doc/948118/" id="a_2">Section
2(c)</a> of the Act defines "estate" to mean 'all land of whatever description
or an undivided share thereof held by a Girasdar and includes uncultivable
waste land etc. <a href="/doc/1523203/" id="a_3">Section 2(a)</a> defines land as "land of any description
whatever and includes benefits whatsoever arise out of the land and things
attached to the earth or permanently anything attached to the earth. These
defini-tions are of wide amplitude to include mines and mineral wealth
beneath surface land of whatever description. <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_4">Section 3(1)</a> abolishes
Girasdari or Barkhalidari tenures by a notification published by the
government in the Official Gazette, from time to time declaring with effect
from a specified date that all rights, title and interest of the Girasdars
or Barkhalidars shall, in respect of any estate or part of an estate
comprised in the notification, ceased and to be vested in the State and all
the incidents of the said tenures attaching to any land comprised in such
estate or part thereof shall be deemed to have been extinguished. Sub-
Section (2) thereof empowers the State Government to issue notification
from time to time in respect of an estate or part of an estate or in
respect of any area specified in the said notification. The consequences of
the abolition of Girasdars' and Barkhalidars' rights in the estate have
been provided in <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> of the Act. Under clasue (2) of s.4 relevant for
the purpose of this case, it has been provided that consequent upon the
notification issued by the govern-ment under <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_6">Section 3</a>, with effect from
the specified date, all cultivable and non-cultivable waste land, excluding
land used for building or other non-agricultural purposes........which are
comprised in the estates so notified shall, except in so far as any rights
of any person other than the Girasdar or the Barkhalidar may be established
in and over the same......and shall be deemed to be, with all rights in or
over the same or appertaining thereto, the property of the State and all
rights held by a Girasdar or a Barkhalidar in such property shall be deemed
to have been extinguished, (emphasis supplied) and it shall be lawful for
the Collector, subject to the general or special orders of the Revenue
Commissioner, to dispose of them as he deems fit, subject always to the
rights of way and or other rights of the public or of individuals legally
subsisting. Under <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_7">Section 7</a>, a Girasdar or Barkhalidar is entitled to
compensation for the extinguishment of their rights and the details thereof
are not necessary for the purpose of this case. At this juncture, it is
relevant to note that Saurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951 defines
'agriculture' by <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_8">Section 2(2)</a> which includes horticulture and the raising
of crops, fodder or garden produce and "agricultural land" means any land,
including wells, which is used for the purpose of agricul-ture and includes
sites of farm buildings appurtenant to land used for agricultural purposes
and sites of dwelling houses and wades occupied by agriculturists,
agricultural labourers or artisans and land appurtenant to such dwelling
houses. Under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_9">Section 2(15)</a> "Girasdar" means any taluqadar, bhagdar,
bhayat, cadet or mulgirasia and includes any person whom the Government
may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a Girasdar for
the purpose of this Act. In the same Act, under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_10">Section 2(13)</a> "estate"
means all land of whatever description or an undivided share thereof held
by a Girasdar and includes uncultivable waste, whether such land is used
for the purposes of agriculture or not and <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_11">Section 2</a> (18) defines "land"
which means any agricultural land, bid land or cultivable waste. <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_12">Section
2(7)</a> defines "cadet" which means a brother or a son of a Ruler to whom a
grant of land was made by such Ruler after 14th day of August, 1947, and
who is allowed to retain such grant by the Government or any heir or
successors of such person. Under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_13">Section 2(8)</a> "Code" means the Bombay Land
Revenue Code, 1879 for short "the Code" as adapted and applied to the
State. Under <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_14">Section 4</a>, all Girasdari lands are liable to payment of land
revenue. The Saurashtra Barkhali Abolition Act, 1951 defines under <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_15">Section
2(i)</a> "Bharkhalidar" which means a person who holds a tenure as Barkhalidar,
Jiwaidar, Chakariyat, Kherati, or Dharmada and includes any holder of an
estate whom the Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette,
declare to be a Barkhalidar for the purpose of this Act. <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_16">Section 2(iia)</a>
defines "estate" which includes a Jagir, inam or other grant or interest or
aggregate of interests of similar nature in land but shall not include an
occupancy, <a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_17">Section 5</a> of the Act abolishes Barkhali tenure existing as on
the date and Barkhali estate shall cease and be vested in the State free
from all encumbrances, subject to the provisions of this Act. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_18">The Act</a> gives
right to the Barkhalidar to make an application for personal cultivation
and the details etc. are not necessary for the purposes of these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_3">As seen, consequent upon the abolition of the estate under <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_19">section 3(1)</a> of
the Act by issuance of the notification and ensuring consequences under
<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_20">Section 4</a>, the Girasdar or Barkharidari tenures stood extinguished and
vested in the State. When questioned in Civil Application No. 689/65 in
T.K. Gohil and Ors. v. C.K. Dave by a decision dated 14.8.69 J.B. Mehta, J.
held that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_21">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_22">4</a> of the Act would be applicable
only to uncultivable waste lands which alone stood vested in the State and
the lands with mines and minerals could not be held to be uncultivable
waste lands and did not vest in the State. The said decision was confirmed
by the Division Bench in L.P.A, No. 73/70 dated March 15, 1971. Section 69
of the Code, which was admittedly adapted to the Saurashtra region of the
Gujarat State, states that the right of the Govern-ment to mines and
mineral products in all unalienated land is and hereby declared to be
expressly reserved provided that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to
affect any subsisting rights of any occupant of such land in respect of
such mines or mineral products. <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_23">Section 3(20)</a> defines "alienated" means
"transfer in so far as the rights of the State Government on payment of
rent or land revenue, wholly or partially to the ownership of any person.
Consequent upon this definition; the operation of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_24">Section 69</a> and the
interpretation made by the High Court, the mines and minerals in the
alienated lands stood excluded from the abolition and extinguishment of the
rights of Girasdars or Barkhalidars under <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_25">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_26">4</a> of the Act. To
obviate the interpretation and to be in conformity with the object and
purposes of the Act, initially the ordinance and later the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_27">Amendment Act</a>
came to be made which was reserved for the consideration, received the
assent of the President on February 23, 1982 came into force with
retrospective effect from May 01, 1960 - the date on which the Gujarat
State was formed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">By clause (a) of s.2 of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_28">Amendment Act</a> the word "unalienated" was
deleted from section 69 of the Code and clause (b) provides that the
proviso to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_29">Section 69</a> shall be and shall be deemed always to have been
deleted w.e.f. 1.5.1960. Under <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_30">Section 3</a> thereof, Section 69 A was brought
on statute. Sub-section (1) and sub-section (4) are relevant for the
purpose of this case which read thus : -
</p>
<p id="p_5">69.A(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any custom, usage, grant,
sanad or order or agreement, or any law for the time being in force, or in
any judgment, decree, or order of a court or of other authority, with
effect on and from the 1st May, 1960 all mines whether being worked or not
and minerals whether discovered or not and all quarries which are situate
within the limits of any land, granted or recognised under any contract,
grant or law for the time being in force or decree of a court, shall vest
"in and with all rights over the same or appurtenant thereto be the
property of the State Government and the State Government shall, subject to
the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Develop-ment) Act,
1957 have all powers necessary for the proper enjoy-ment and disposal of
such rights."
</p>
<p id="p_6">Sub-<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_31">section 4</a> says that:
</p>
<p id="p_7">11 Any occupant, whose rights fr. mines, minerals or quarries in any land,
existing misnc Jiate'y before 1st May, 1960 have vested in the State of
Goverment on that date under Sub-Section (1), shall be enrite in
comparition of ammount  of  the  equivalent to the average to the  net
anual income recived by the occupint in respect of the manged and  inieral
products  the three yenrs immediately prociecing the date of  vesting.
</p>
<p id="p_8">'It is settled law that the concept 'estate' denotes that the person
holding the estate should be in direct relationship with the State paying
land revenue except what is remitted in whole or in part or exempted etc.
There may be variation in the local equation. The other sub-sections are
not relevant for disposal of these appeals. Hence omitted.
</p>
<p id="p_9">The first contention of the appellants is that, under Entry 54, of List I
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, since Regulation of Mines and
<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_32">Minerals Development Act</a>, 1957 occupies the field of mines and minerals
covered in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_33">Section 69A</a> of the Amendment Act, it is void and is ultra vires
of the Constitution. We find no force in this contention. The State
Legislature under Entry I8 (land) and Entry 23 (Regulation of Mines and
mineral development) of part II of the State List of Seventh Schedule and
Entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule (Acquisition of Property)
under which the State Legislature claims to have made the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_34">Amendment Act</a>, we
have to see whether it is well founded.
</p>
<p id="p_10">It is settled law of interpretation that entries in the Seventh Schedule
are not powers but fields of legislation. The legislature derives its power
from <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_35">Article 246</a> and other related Articles of the Constitution. Therefore,
the power to make the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_36">Amendment Act</a> is derived not from the respective
entries but under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_37">Article 246</a> of the Constitution. The language of the
respective entries should be given the widest scope of their meaning,
fairly capable to meet the machinery of the Government settled by the
Constitu-tion. Each general word should extend to all ancillary or
subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it.
When the vires of an enactment is impugned, there is an initial presumption
of its con stitutionality and if there is any difficulty in ascertaining
the limits of the legislative power, the difficulty must be resolved, as
far as possible in favour of the legislature putting the most liberal
construction upon the legislative entry so that it may have the widest
amplitude. Burden is on the appellants to prove affirmatively of its
invalidity. It must be remembered that we are interpreting the Constitution
and when the court is called upon to interpret the Constitution, it must
not be construed in any narrow or pedantic sense and adopt
such'construction which must be beneficial to the amplitude of legislative
powers. The broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty is to
interpret the Constitution to find whether the impugned Act is relatable to
any entry in the relevant List.
</p>
<p id="p_11">In India Cement Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors., [1990] 1 SCC
12, relied on by the appellants, a bench of seven judges held that "entries
in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, are
legislative heads or fields of legislation. These demarcate the area over
which appropriate legislature can operate. It is well settled that widest
amplitude should be given to the language of these entries but some of
these entries in different lists or in the same list may overlap and
sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other. Then,
it is the duty of the court to find out its true intent and purpose and to
examine a particular legislation in its pith and substance to determine
whether it fits in one or the other of the Lists, The Lists are designed to
define and delimit the respective areas of respective competence of the
Union and the States. They neither impose any implied restriction on the
legislative power con-ferred by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_38">Article 246</a> of the Constitution, nor
prescribe any duty to exercise that legislative power in any particular
manner. Hence, the language of the Entries should be given widest scope to
find out which of the meaning is fairly capable in the set up of the
machinery of the government. Each general word should be held to extend to
all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be
comprehended in it. In interpreting an Entry, it would not be reasonable to
impart any limitation by comparing or contrasting that Entry with any other
one's in the same list.
</p>
<p id="p_12">It is in this background that one has to examine the present con-troversy.
It is seen that under Entry 18 of List II (State List) "land", that is

to say, right in or over the land....... Entry 23 (Regulation of Mines and

Mineral Development) subject to the provision of List I in respect of
regulation and development under the control of the Union Govt. So it
relates to regulation and development of mines and minerals. Entry 42 of
List III (Concurrent List) concerns Acquisition and Requisition of proper-
ty as amended by Section 26 of the Constituion (7ih <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_39">Amendment Act</a>, 1956).
These specify the field of legislation given to the Gujarat State
Legislature Subject to Entry 54 of List I (Union List). It is seen that
under Entry 18 of the State List, land, i.e. rights in or over land which
includes acquisition of the property. Entry 23 of List II which is subject
to Entry 42 of List III (Concurrent List), provides field of legislation by
the State legislature. <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_40">Article 246(3)</a> of the Constitution gives exclusive
power to make law for the State of Gujarat or any part thereof. It is seen
that Amendmni Act had received the assent of the President.
</p>
<p id="p_13">Lapd in Entry 18 is not restricted to agricultural land alone but includes
non-agricultural Sand etc. The words 'rights in' or 'over land' confer very
wide power which are not limited by rights between the land holders inter
se or the land holder or the State or the landholder or the tenant. It is
seen that restriction or extinction of existing interest in the land
includes provision for abolition and extinguishment of the rights in or
over the land. Resumption of the estate is one of the objectives of the
govern-ment and the Act seeks to serve that object. Resumption includes all
ancillary provisions, cancellation or extinguishment of any existing grant
by the ex-Rules or lease by grant with retrospective effect as was upheld
in Thakur Raghubir Singh &amp; Ors. etc. v. The State of Ajmer (now Rajasthan)
and Ors., [1959] SCR Supp. 1, 478.
</p>
<p id="p_14">In Black's Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition) at page 877, land is defined to
mean- "in the most general sense, comprehends any ground, soil or earth
whatsoever, including......rocks. "Land" may include any estate or interest
in lands, either legal or equitable, as well as easements and incorporeal
hereditaments. Technically, land signifies everything comprehending all
things of a permanent nature, and even of an unsubstantial provided they be
permanent. Ordinarily, the term is used as descriptive of the subject of
ownership and not the ownership. Land is the material of the earth,
whatever may be the ingredients of which it is composed, weather, soil,
rock, or other substance, and includes free or occupied space for an
indefinite distance upwards as well as downwards, subject to limitations
upon the use of airspace imposed, and rights in the use of airspace granted
by law.
</p>
<p id="p_15">The Law Lexicon (Reprint edn. 1987) by Ramanatha Iyer p. 701, the word
'land" in the ordinary legal sense comprehends everything of a fixed or
permanent nature and, therefore, growing trees, land includes the benefit
arise out of the land and things attached to the earth or permanently means
everything attached to the earth and also the share in or charges on, the
revenue or rent of villages or other defined portions of territory. Land
includes the bed of the sea below high water mark.....Land shall extend to
messuages, and all other hereditaments, whether corporal or incorporeal and
whether freehold or of any other tenure and to money to be paid out in the
purchase of land. Land in its widest signification would therefore include
not only the surface of the ground, cultivable, uncultivable or waste lands
but also everything on or under it. <a href="/doc/258508/" id="a_41">In Jagannath Singh v. State of U.P</a>.,
AIR (1960) SC 1563 p. 1568, this Court held that the word "land" is wide
enough to include all lands whether agricultural or non-agricultural land.
<a href="/doc/819916/" id="a_42">In State of U.P. v. Sarju Devi</a>, [1978] 1 SCF 18, this court held that the
definition of the land in <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_43">Section 3</a> (14) shows that it is not necessary for
the land to fall within its purview that it must be actually under
cultivation or occupied for purposes connected with agriculture. The
requirement is amply satisfied even if the land is either held or occupied
for the purposes connected with agriculture. The word "held" only means
possession of legal title and does not require actual connected occupation.
In State of Gujarat v. Kamla Ben Jivan Bhai, [1979] Supp. 2 SCC 440, this
Court held that actual cultivation is not necessary to constitute an estate
and the right to collect grass is a right annexed to land which was held to
be an estate and abolition of the right to pay annual amount was an
agrarian reform. <a href="/doc/919121/" id="a_44">In Sri Ram Ram Narain Medhi v. State of Bombay</a>, [1959]
Supp. 1 SCR 489, this Court held that the Code is a law relating to land
tenures. The right in relation to an estate .used in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_45">Article 31A</a> has been
noted in a very com-prehensive sense. <a href="/doc/1873661/" id="a_46">In Digvijay Singh Hamirsinhji v.
Manji Savda</a>, [1969] 1 SCR 405, this Court interpreting Section 18 of
Saurashtra Land Re-forms Act, 1951 held that the Girasdar to whom the ruler
made the grant was bound by the provisions of that Act and that he was not
entitled to have his tenant evicted except in accordance with the
provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_16">The aforestated respective Acts clearly deal with the rights of Giras-dars
or Barkhalidars of their occupation and enjoyment of the land as land-
holder in terms of the grant made by the erstwhile Rulers. <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_47">Section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_48">4</a>
of the Act abolish the estate under the Act and extinguish the right, title
and interest in the lands held by them. But by interpretation of the Act
and the Code, the alienated land with mines and minerals were held to be
outside the purview of the Act. To get over the interpretation, the order
or the decree or the judgment, of any court, applying non-obstante clause,
a magic vand to bring the law in conformity with the legislative policy,
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_49">Section 69A</a> was enacted to extinguish the right to mine or mineral or
quarry in the lands held by any person including Girasdars or Barkhalidars
and reserved them for the government under Section 69 of the Code. Omitting
the word 'alienated' from <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_50">Section 69</a>, it seeks to bring the mines, minerals
or quarries situated in any land by Girasdar or Barkhalidar etc. within the
ambit of reservation under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_51">Section 69</a> read with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_52">Section 69A(1)</a> of the Act,
Thereby it is clear that, in pith and substance, the predominent purpose of
the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_53">Amendment Act</a> is to extinguish the pre-existing rights, title and
interests in the land which includes the mines, minerals and quarries held
by Girasdars or B .rkhajidars extingushed their rights and reserved and
vested them in the State of Gujarat for public use. It would thereby tall
within Entry 18 and 23 of List II (State List) read with Entry 42 of List
III (Concurrent List).
</p>
<p id="p_17">In India Cement case, the question was whether levy of cess under Section
115 of Madras Panchayat Act on royalty is additional land revenue or
additional royalty and whether the levy is constitutionally valid. In
considering that question, a bench of seven judges, per majority, held that
<a href="/doc/1528522/" id="a_54">Section 9(3)</a> of the Mines and Mineral (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_55">Regulation) Act</a>,
1957 imposes a liability to pay royalty and prohibits the State not to
enhance more than once during a period of four year; imposition of the cess
was considered to be a tax on royalty and, therefore, it is a tax on
mineral rights. Accordingly, the cess on royalty was held to be outside the
legislative competence. It is seen that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_56">Section 69A</a> itself envisages
acquisi-tion of the right in mines or minerals or vesting thereof, subject
to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_57">Central Act</a>. Therefore, the ratio in India Cement case is
inapplicable. Equally were the cases in <a href="/doc/1714839/" id="a_58">Orissa Cement Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. State
of Orissa</a> &amp;. Ors, etc., [1991] 2 3CC 103 and <a href="/doc/1729949/" id="a_59">Federation of Minining
Association of Rajasthan v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr</a>., [1992] Supp. 2 SCC
</p><p id="p_18">239. Accord-ingly, it must be held that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_60">Amendment Act</a> in pith and
substance is predominently for abolition and extinguishment of the right in
lands com-prising of mines, minerals and quarries held by Girasdar,
Barkhudar or any person under a grant or agreement or by operation of a
decree, order or judgment of a court and vest them in the State by their
acquisition. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_61">So the Amendment Act</a> gets the protection of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_62">Art. 31A.</a> Thus it
is not ultra vires of the power of the State Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_19">The next contention is that the Code confines its operation to revenue
administration and recovery of land revenue and matters con-nrected
therewith, as applicable to the entire State. Taluqadar Abolition Act, etc.
were made applicable to the State of Saurashtra as special laws i.e. (a)
The Saurashtra Gharkhed Tenancy Settlement and Agricultural Land Ordinance,
1949; (b) The Saurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951; (c) The Saurashtra
Barkhali Abolition Act, 1951; and (d) <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_63">The Act</a>,

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_64">The Amendment Act</a> though seeks to cover mines, minerals and quarries
reserved under Section 69 of the Code from lands engrafted in Section 69(A)
of the Code, without suitably amending the relevant provisions in the
afore-stated four Acts, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_65">Section 69-A</a> does not affect the rights of the
appellants and the like. In other words, it is urged that these special
laws prevail over the Code. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_66">The Amendment Act</a>, thereby, is ultra vires and
does not affect the rights of the appellants to hold mines, minerals and
quarries situated in their holdings. The question, therefore, is whether
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_67">Amendment Act</a>, without suitable amendment to the Acts, attracts the mines,
minerals and quarries situated in the lands held by Girasdar or
Barkhalidar. It is true that the Code has been adapted to the entire State
of Gujarat including Saurashtra region. Section 69 of the Code reserved the
rights of the government in mines, minerals and quarries from un-alienated
lands. The pre-existing proviso saved subsisting mines and minerals rights
of any occupant of such land and therely saved the right to mines etc. in
alienated lands held under the grant etc. By operation of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_68">Amendment
Act</a>, by detection of the word 'unalienated' and the proviso with
retrospective effect from May 1, 1960 applying non-obstante clause. Section
69A(1) of the Code, rendered any grant ot an agreement or a judgment,
decree or order of a Court inoperative from May 1, 1960 and all mines
whether being worked or not, all minerals whether discovered or not and all
quarries situated in any land, subject to the saving, shall vest in the
State. Their regulation and development is subject to Mines and Minerals
(Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_69">Development) Act</a> of 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_20">The aforementioned respective enactments undoubtedly dealt with the
abolition and extinguishment of pre-existing right, title and interest in
the lands had under a grant etc. by Girasdari or Barkhalidari. In
particular, the Act abolished the estates, extinguished the pre-existing
rights, title and interest of landholders and conferred ryatwari settlement
on the starvation ryots, the tillers of the soil with permanent occupancy
rights. In other words, they are part of agrarian reforms and saved certain
rights of Girsdars and Barkhalidars. The amended Section 69 and 69A(1) of
the Code determined the existing rights and reserved them in favour of the
State of the rights in mines, minerals and quarries in the lands whether
alienated to unalienated whether held by Girasdar or Barkhalidar or any
other. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_70">Section 69A(1)</a>, as seen earlier, brought the lands covered under a
grant or an agreement or a judgment, decree or order of any court
interpreted in that behalf within <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_71">Section 69</a> of the Act. Thereby all mines,
minerals or quarries situated in any land, be it alienated or unalienated,
held by any person including Girasdar or Barkhildar are now governed by
Sections 69 and 69A of the Code. The contention, therefore, that without
amendment to the afore mentioned four Acts the amendment becomes
inoperative is devoid of substance. The, analogy of special law prevails
over <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_72">Amendment Act</a> and the Code, a general law, renders little assistance
to the appeallants.
</p>
<p id="p_21">The third contention that limited retrospective operation of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_73">Sections 69</a>
and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_74">69A</a> with effect from May 1, 1960 is illegal and ultra vires, lacks
force.-Formation of the State of Gujarat became effective from May 1, 1960.
<a href="/doc/1629177/" id="a_75">In Tata Iron and Steel Co. v. State of Bihar</a>, [1958] SCR 335 and <a href="/doc/1775033/" id="a_76">Rama
Krishna v. State of Bihar</a>, [1964] 1 SCR 897, this Court held that the power
to make law on an Entry in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution could
be exercised both prospectively and retrospectively unless there is an
express constitutional prohibition to make an enactment in that behalf. It
is also equally settled law that the power to make law prospectively would
include the power to make the law retrospectively. The interpretation in
Chapter VI at pp.293-94 hi the Principles of Statutory Interpretation by
Justice G.P. Singh is of no avail in the factual backdrop. It was stated
therein that every statute is prima facie prospective unless it is
expressly or by necessary implication made to have retrospective operation.
It is true that generally law intended that vested rights or imposition of
new burden cannot be deemed to have been made with retrospective effect.
Equally is the settled law that the provisions which touched the right in
existence at the passing of the statute are not to be applied
retrospectively in the absence of an express enactment or by necessary
intendment. It is equally settled law that every statute which takes away
or impairs vested rights acquired under existing taws or creates a new
obligation or imposes a new duty or burden or touches a new right in
respect of transaction already passed must normally be presumed, unless
expressed otherwise, to be intended not to have retrospective effect. In
the light of the language in s.2 of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_77">Amendment Act</a>, the express
retrospective operation given to the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_78">Amendment Act</a>, with effect from May 1,
1960 retrospectively effected vested rights of the Girasdar or Barkhalidars
created by a grant or agree-ment etc. or flown from a judgment, order or a
decree of any court and stood extinguished with effect from May 1, 1960. It
is true that a limited retrospective effect was given to the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_79">Amendment Act</a>
as the State was formed and became operative from May 1, 1960, the date on
which the State was formed. So, any grant or agreement etc. though
otherwise was valid with effect from any of the anterior date, would cease
and lose then" validity from May 1, 1960. Any other earlier date would have
rendered the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_80">Amendment Act</a> ultra vires. Only to obviate such an
interpretation, con-sistent with the date of existence of the State
legislature, i.e. the date on which the State legislature became competent
to enact the Code, the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_81">Amendment Act</a> was given retrospective operations.
Accordingly, it must be held that the retrospective operation cannot be
faulted nor would it be declared ultra vires.
</p>
<p id="p_22">The prinnacle contention is that s. 69A of the Code though was included in
the Nineth Schedule, is not a law relating to agrarian reforms and,
therefore, it does not get the protection of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_82">Article 31A.</a> it is a law
relating to acquisition of mines and minerals belonging to the appellants
and others which had come into force from December 8, 1982 and is not a law
made under <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_83">Article 39 (b)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_84">(c)</a> and does not get the protection under
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_85">Article 31C.</a> Even otherwise since it was a post Kesavananda Bharti's case.
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_86">Section 69A</a> should stand the test of basic structure of the Constitu-tion.
Though the right to property lost its protective armour as fundamental
right after Constitution's 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_87">Amendment Act</a>, 1978, it was resurrected
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_88">Article 300A</a> as constitutional right. The, law must meet the test of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution also. Since it was given
retrospective operation from May 1,1960, the compensation provided under
sub-section (4) of Section 69A of the Code is void as compensation was not
just equivalent to the property acquired or full indemnification to the
owner of the mines and minerals expropriated. It must not be arbitrary and
unjust. The quantification or principles in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_89">Section 69A(1)</a> &amp; (4) therein
are illusory offending Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_90">Section 7</a> of
the Act and other related statutes provide compensation different from the
one provided under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_91">Section 69A</a> and that it is
discriminatory and bears no reasonable relation to the object of
acquisition and that, therefore, it is unjust, unfair violating <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_92">Article 14</a>
and unfair procedure offends <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_93">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The
acquisition under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_94">Section 69A(1)</a> is in violation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_95">Article 300A</a> as it is
not for public purpose and no market value is being paid and so it is void.

that no law providing for compulsory acquisition or requisition "shall be

overruled the metal corporation's case and upheld and accepted the

v. Union of India, known as Bank Nationalisation case [1970] 3 SCR 530, per
majority this Court overruled Mangaldas and held that even after the 4th
Amendment, compensation meant "the equivalent in terms of money of the
property compulsorily acquired" according to "relevant principles which
principles must be appropriate to the determination of compensation under
par-ticular class of property sought to be acquired." The Parliament again
amended by Constitution's 25th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_110">Amendment Act</a>, 1971, wherein the word
"compensation" was substituted with the word "amount". This had become the
subject of consideration in Kesavanand Bharti v. State of Kerala, [1973]
SuppL SCR 1, known as Fundamental Rights case Full Court of 13 Judges per
majority of 7 Judges, held, after considering the validity of 25th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_111">Amendment Act</a>, that substituting the word 'amount' for 'compensation' in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_112">Article 31(2)</a> of the Constitution, the quantum of amount, if directly fixed
by law, or the principles for its quantification are matters for
legislative judgment. The principles made or laid down are general guiding
rules applicable to all persons or transactions covered thereby. In fixing
the amount the court will not sit over the general nature of the
legislative purpose, The principle may be specified in fixing the amount
which may include consideration of social justice as against the equivalent
in value of the property acquired. Consideration of social justice will
include the relevant directive principles particularly in Articles 39 (b)
and {c). These principles are to subserve the common good and to prevent
common detriment. The question of adequacy had been excluded by
Constitution 4th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_113">Amendment Act</a> obviating the necessity to provide a
standard or rule to measure adequacy with reference to fixing the amount.
The ground of adequacy of the amount as to how the amount has to be given
otherwise in cash is not amenable to judicial review. The quantum cannot be
a matter for judicial review but the principles to determine the
compensation must be relevant to the consideration and must not be
illusory. The fundamental rights are subject to reasonable restrictions and
rational discrimination and that, therefore, are amendable under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_114">Article
368</a> and they are not basic features or basic structure of the Constitution.

judgment in <a href="/doc/21266288/" id="a_119">Golak Nath v. State of Punjab</a>, [1967] SCR 177 and reiterated in
his "Right to Property and the Indian Constitution", the right to property
is an acquired right and it is the weakest right fit to be placed along
with commerce clauses. The Constitution 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_120">Amendment Act</a>, 1976 had given
primacy to law made to implement any or all directive principles and
provided protective umbrella under <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_121">Article 31C</a> and placed in Ninth Schedule

basic structure. After the deletion of the right to property omitting of
Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 of the Constitution by the Constitution 44th Amend-
ment Act, the right to property, which was hitherto a fundamental right was
dethroned from Part III and became a constitutional right under Art, 300A
resaucitating only <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_145">Art. 31(1)</a> of the Constitution as originally made.
</p>
<p id="p_28">The question, therefore, is whether right to property is a basic structure,
after Constitution 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_146">Amendment Act</a>, 1978. Indian society is
predominantly agrarian and about 3/4th of its population is living in rural
areas on agriculture and other ancillary occupations. In pre-independent
period, the land tenures were in vogue on Zamindari, Jagirdari, Taluqadari,
inamdari or settlement systems in diverse forms. The tenure and holding by
the tiller of the soil was insecure and was exploited by intermediaries. On
January 26, 1950, the Independence Day, the Congress Party affirmed in its
pledge that the inalienable right of the people is "to have freedom and to
enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life so that
they may have full opportunity of growth". In 1931 in Karachi Congress,
Resolution on Fundamental Rights envisaged that "the organiza-tion of
economic life must conform to the principles of justice" emphasising to
reform "the system of land tenure and revenue and rent"............relief
from agricultural indebtedness.......ownership or control of
land...........
</p>
<p id="p_29">The debates in the Constituent Assembly on the lines of Section 299 of the
Government of India Act, 1935 and the resultant right to acquire and, hold
to the property in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_147">Article 19(l)(f)</a> and deprivation and acquisi-tion of the
property under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_148">Article 31</a>, as fundamental rights in Part III of the
Constitution, find their habitation like in every constitution of modern
democracies. Equally the debates in the Constituent Assembly and the
unanimous animation of the founding fathers was that the tiller of the soil
should be conferred with right to hold the property directly under the
State and to abolish the estates, elimination of the intermediaries and
conferment of right, title and interest in the land in the estate on the
cultivator. There was, however, division in opinion on payment of
compensation to the deprived Zamindars etc. The Constitution assures to
every citizen social and economic justice apart from political justice,
equality of status and of opportunity and dignity of person as basic
postulates for successful working of political democracy. Establishment of
economic and social democracy and agrarian reform as its ingrained facet
was the nation's chartered mission for economic restructure of the social
order. Land Reform laws were made on its anvil to distribute surplus lands
to the landless poor etc.

Whether right to property is the basic structure was pointedly projected
for the first time assailing the imposition of ceiling on agricultural
holdings in Maharashtra Agricutural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961
as amended up to 1976 in Woman Rao's case. Chandrachud. CJ. speaking for
the unanimous Constitution Bench, that decided first Minerva Mills case
prior to Constitution 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_149">Amendment Act</a>, 1978, considered the
constitutionality of the First Constitution Amendment Act, 1951 Intro-
ducting <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_150">Article 31-A</a> and <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_151">Article 31-B</a> traced the history of land tenures,
the debates in the Constituent Assembly, need for the agrarian reforms and
stated that in our predominantly agricultural society, there is a strong
linkage between ownership of land and the person's status in the social
system. Those without land suffer not only from an economic disadvantage,
but also a concomitant social disadvantage. In the very nature of things,
it is not possible to provide land to all landless persons but that cannot
furnish an alibi for not undertaking at all a programme for the redistribu-
tion of agricultural land. Agrarian reform therefore requires, inter alia,
the reduction of the larger holdings and distribution of the excess land
accord-ing to social and economic considerations............We embarked
upon a constitutional era holding forth the promise that we will secure to
all citizens justice, social, economic and political, equality of status
and of opportunity, and, last but not the least, dignity of the individual.
Between these promises and the 1st Amendment there is a discernible nexus,
direct and immediate. Indeed, if there is one place in an agriculture-
dominated society like ours where citizens can hope to have equal justice,
it is on the strip of land which they till and love, the land which assures
to them dignity of their person by providing to them a near decent means of
livelihood........
</p>
<p id="p_30">The First Amendment has thus made the constitutional ideal of equal justice
a living truth. It is like a mirror that reflects the ideals of the
Constitution: it is not the destroyer of its basic structure. The
provisions introjnceded by it "and the 4th" Amrndment for the
extinguishment or modification of rights in lands held or let for purposes
of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, strengthen rather than
weaken the basic struc-ture of the Constitution............. It seems to us
ironical indeed that the laws providing for agricultural ceilings should be
stigmatized as destroying the guarantee of equality when their true object
and intendment was to remove inequalities in the matter of agricultural
holdings. The Constitution (First Amendment) Act and the (4th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_152">Amendment)
Act</a> do not destroy or damage the basic structure of the Constitution. This
Court in Kesavananda Bharti's case held that <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_153">Article 31-C</a> brought by
Constitution 25th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_154">Amendment Act</a>, 1971 has to be given full play as it
fulfills the basic purpose of restructuring the economic order. Each word
in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_155">Article 39</a> has a strategic role and the whole Article has a social
mission. It embraces the entire material resour-ces of the community. Its
task is to distribute such resources. Its goal is' so to undertake
distribution as best to subserve the common good. It reor-ganizes, by such
distribution, the ownership and control of material resour-ces of the
Community. Resources is a sweeping expression and covers not only cash
sources but even ability to borrow credit resources........<a href="/doc/847888/" id="a_156">In State of

interpreting <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_157">Article 39(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_158">(c) (material resources)</a> held that the
concept is wide enough to cover not only natural or physical resources but
also movable or immovable properties such as the vehicles, tools, imple-
ments and the workshops, etc. The mere fact that the resources are material
will make no differences in the concept of the word 'resources'. The word
'distribution' used hi <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_159">Article 39(b)</a> must be broadly construed so that a
court may give full and comprehensive effect to the statutory intent
contained in <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_160">Article 39(b).</a> It should not be construed in a purely literal
sense so as to mean only division of a particular kind or to particular
persons. The word 'distribution' will include various facets, aspects,
methods and terminology of a broad-based concept of distribution. It does
not merely mean that property of one should be taken over and distributed
to others like land reforms. It is only one of the modes of distribution
but not the only mode. Nationalisation of the transport as also the units,
the vehicles would be able to go to the farthest.........."as possible and
provide better and quicker and more efficacious facilities".
Nationalisation of con-tract carriages were thus upheld.

<p id="p_31">In Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co.'s case, it was held that material
resources of the community in the context of reordering the national
economy embraces all the national wealth, not merely natural resources, all
the private and public sources of meeting material needs, not merely public
possessions. Everything of value or use in the material world is material
resources and the individual being a member of the community his resources
are part of those of the community to exclude ownership of private
resources from the coils of <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_161">Article 39(b)</a> is to cipherise its very purpose
of redistribution on the socialist way. 'Material resources of the
community' means all things which are capable of producing wealth for the
community. There is no warrant for interpreting the expression in so narrow
a fashion and to confine it to public owned material resources, and exclude
private-owned material resources. The expression involves nc dichotomy. The
words must be understood in the context of the Constitu-tional goal of
establishing a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.
Nationalisation of coking units were upheld.

<p id="p_32"><a href="/doc/1298680/" id="a_162">In State of Kerala v. The Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing Co. Ltd</a>. [1974]
1 SCR 671 and 690, 691-A, another Constitution Bench had held that the
concept of agrarian reform is a complex and dynamic one promot-ing wider
interests than conventional reorganisation of the land system or
distribution of land. It is intended to realise the social function of the
land. <a href="/doc/1690233/" id="a_163">In Gujarat Pottery Works Pvt. Ltd, v. B.P, Sood</a>, [1967] 1 SCR 695
another Constitution Bench held that in the interest of the national
economy this court considering modification, held that the State shall have
full control over the minerals and metal resources of the factory including
the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospective
licences or mining lease. It was further held that they were not violative
of Arts. 14, 19 and 31. Since they are saved by the Ninth Schedule, they
are immuned by operation of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_164">Art. 31</a>,...............
</p>
<p id="p_33">It is, therefore, clear and we so hold that the material resources of
community is a wide concept and must be broadly interpreted to bring within
its sweep all resources, natural or physical moveable or immovable,
corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or intangible properties etc. Private
resources or property are part of material resources of the community. All
things that produce wealth for the community are material resources. The
word "distribution" equally must be construed broadly to include not only
allotment of resources to public use but also dispensation of largess to
the poor to provide access to equal opportunity. In other words it is a
broad based concept and it should not be confined within narrow confines.
Mines, minerals and quarries embedded in the land are material resources of
the community amenable to public use or for distribution.

<p id="p_34">Thus it is clear that right to property under Art, 300A is not a basic

the Constitution does not destroy the basic structure of the Constitution,

Even agreeing with the contention that after the Constitution Forty-fourth
Amendment Act, 1978, which had come into force from June 19, 1979, the
right to property engrafted in Chapter IV, Part 17, namely <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_174">Art. 300A</a> that
the appellants are entitled to its protection, whether <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_175">Section 69A</a> is
unconstitutional? The heading "Right to Property" with marginal note reads
thus :
</p>
<p id="p_36">"<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_176">Art. 300A :</a> Persons not to be deprived of property, save by authority of
law : - No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of

</p>
<p id="p_37">In Subodh Copal's case Patanjali Sastri, CJ, held that the word 'deprived'
in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_178">Art. 31</a> cannot be narrowly construed. No cut and dry test
can be formulated as to whether in a given case the owner is deprived of
his property within the meaning of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_179">Art. 31;</a> each case must be decided as it
arises on its own facts. Broadly speaking it may be said that an
abridgement would be so substantial as to amount to a deprivation within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_180">Art. 31</a>, if, in effect, if withheld the property from the
posession and enjoyment by him or materially reduced its value. S.R. Das,
J, as he then was, held that Clauses (1) and (2) of Art, 31 dealt with the
topic of 'eminent domain', the expressions 'taken possession of or
'acquired' according to Clause (2) have the same meaning which the word
'deprived' used in clause (1). In other words, both the clauses are con-
cerned with the deprivation of the property; taking possession of or ac-
quired, used in Clause (2) is referable to deprivation of the property in
Clause (1). Taking possession or acquisition should be in the connotation
of the acquisition or requisition of the property for public purpose.
Deprivation specifically referable to acquisition or requisition and not
for any and every kind of deprivation. <a href="/doc/1880952/" id="a_181">In Dwarka Das Srinivas of Bombay v.
Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd</a>., [1954] SCR 674, Mahajan, J., as he
then was, similarly held that the word 'deprived' in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_182">Art. 31</a>
and acquisition and taking possession in clause (2) have the same meaning
delimting the field of eminent domain, namely, compulsory acquisition of
the property and given protection to private owners against the State
action. S.R. Das, J. reiterated his view laid in Subodh Gupal's case.
Vivian Bose, J. held that the word 'taken possession of or 'acquired' in
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_183">Art. 31(2)</a> have to be read along with the word 'deprived' in clause (1).
Taking possession or acquisition amounts to deprivation within the meaning
of clause (1). No hard and fast rule can be laid down. Each case must
depend on its own facts. The word "law" used in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_184">Art. 300A</a> must be an Act of
Parliament or of State Legislature, a rule or statutory order having force
of law. The deprivation of the property shall be only by authority of law,
be it an Act of Parliament or State Legislature, but not by executive fiat
or an order. Deprivation of property is by acquisition or requisition or
taking possession of for a public purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_38">It is true as contended by Sri Javery that clause (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_185">Art. 31</a> was not
suitably incorporated in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_186">Art. 300A</a> but the obligation to pay compen-sation
to the deprived owner of his property was enjoined as an inherent incident
of acquisition under law is equally untenable for the following reasons.
Ramanatha Aiyar's 'The Law Lexicon' Reprint Edition 1987, p. 385, defined
'eminent demain' thus: "The right of the State or the sovereign to its or
his own property is absolute while that of the subject or citizen to his
property is only paramount. The citizen holds his property subject always
to the right of the soverign to take it for a public purpose. This right is
called "eminent domain". At p. 386 it was further stated that the sovereign
power vested in the State to take private property for the public use,
providing first a just compensation therefore. A superior right to apply
private property to public use. A superior right inherent in society, and
exercised by the sovereign power, or upon delegation from it, whereby the
subject matter of rights of property may be taken from the owner and
appropriated for the general welfare. The right belonging to the society or
to the sovereign, of disposing in cases of necessity, and for the public
safety, of all the wealth contained in the state is called eminent domain.
The right of every government to appropriate, otherwise than by taxation
and its police authority, private property for public use. The ultimate
right of sovereign power to appropriate not only the public property but
the private property of all citizens within the territorial sovereignty, to
public purpose. Eminent domain is in the nature of a compulsory purchase of
the property of the citizen for the purpose of applying to the public use."
In 'Black's Law Dictionary' 6th edition, at p. 523 'eminent domain' is
defined as 'the power to take private property for public use by the state,
municipalities and private persons or corporations authoritised to exercise
functions of public character. in United States the power of eminent domain
is founded in both the Federal (Fifth Amendment) and State Constitutions.
The Constitution gives the power to take for public purpose and prohibits
the exercise of the power of eminent domain without just compensation to
the owners of the property which is taken. The process of exercising the
power of eminent domain is commonly referred to as 'condemnation' or
'expropriation'.
</p>
<p id="p_39">The right of eminent domain is the right of the sovereign State, through
its regular agencies, to reasert, either temporarily or permanently, its
dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private
property without its owner's consent on account of public exigency and for
the public good. Eminent domain is the highest and most exact idea of
property remaining in the government, or in the aggregate body of the
people in their sovereign capacity. It gives the right to resume possession
of the property in the manner directed by the Constitution and the laws of
the State, whenever the public interest requires it. The term
'expropriation' is practically synonymous with the term "eminent domain".
</p>
<p id="p_40">This Court in <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_187">Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India</a>, [1950J SCR 869,
held that eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and
appropriate private property belonging to individual citizens for public
use. The limitation imposed upon acquisition or taking possession of
private property which is implied in the clause (2) of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_188">Art. 31</a> is that such
taking must be for public purpose. The other condition is that no property
can be taken, unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a
provision for payment of compensation in the mam ar as laid down in the
clause. <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_189">In State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh</a>, [1952| SCR 869, the 'eminent
domain' was held to be a right inherent in every sovereign to take and
appropriate private property belonging to individual citizens for public
use without owner's consent. The limitation imposed upon acquisition or
taking possession of private property which is implied , the clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_190">Art. 31</a> is that such taking must be for public purpose. The other condition
is that no property can be taken, unless the law which authorises such
appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the
manner laid down in the clause. Mahajan, J., as he then was, quoting from
Thayer's cases on Constitutional Law stated that "Shorn of all its
incidents, the simple definition of the power to acquire cornpulsorily or
of the term 'eminent domain' is the power of the sovereign to take property
for public use without the owner's consent. The meaning of the power in its
ir-reducible term is, (a) power to take, (b) without the owner's consent,
</p><p id="p_41">(c) for the public use. The concept of the public use has been inextricably
related to an appropriate exercise of the power and is considered essential
in any statement of its meaning. Payment of compensation, though not an
essential ingredient of the connotation of the term, is an essential
element of the valid exercise of such power."

<p id="p_42"><a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_191">In Bisambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P</a>., [19821 1 SCC 39 at p.66

recourse to the executive power of the State under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_192">Art. 162</a>, deprive a
person of his property. Such power can be exercised, only by authority of
law and not by a mere executive fiat or order. It is, therefore,
necessarily subject to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_193">Art. 300A.</a> Eminent domain, therefore, is a right
inherent in every sovereign State to expropriate private property for

it would be exercised by the authority of law and not by executive fiat or

</p>
<p id="p_43">The question then is what is the meaning of the word 'property' used in
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_195">Art. 300A</a> and whether it is amenable to eminent domain. At the cost of
repetition, we reiterate that the Constitution assures to secure to all its
citizens economic and social justice and of equality of status and of
opportunity and the dignity of the individual. <a href="/doc/560422/" id="a_196">Article 51A(h)</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_197">&amp; (j)</a> enjoins

nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.
</p>
<p id="p_44">In Woman Rao's case this court held that "there is a strong linkage between
ownership of land and person's status in social system". Private ownership
entails political and legal power. Control over property amounts to control
over people and their lives. Dominion over things is an imperium over
fellow human beings. Property, therefore, accords status. Due to its lack
man suffers from economic disadvantages and disabilities to gain social and
economic inequality leading to his servitude. Providing facilities and
opportunities to hold property furthers the basic structure of egalitarian
social order guaranteeing economic and social equality. In other words, it
removes disabilities and inequalities, accords status, social and economic
and dignity of person.
</p>
<p id="p_45">Quoting Prof. Ginsberg. Mathew J, in Kesavananda Bharati's case held that
:-
</p>
<p id="p_46">"It is necessary to distinguish at least three forms of private proper-ty :
</p><p id="p_47">(i) property in durable and non-durable consumer's good; (ii) property in
the means of production worked by their owners; and (iii) property in the
means of production not worked or directly managed by their owners,
especially the accumulation of masses of property of this kind in the hands
of a relatively narrow class. While the first two forms of property can be
justified as necessary conditions of a free and purposeful life, the third
cannot. For this type of property gives power not only over things, but
through things over persons. It is open to the charge made by socialists
again and again that any form of property which gives man power over man is
not an instrument of freedom but of servitude".
</p>
<p id="p_48">Justice K.K. Mathew in his 'Right to Property', Dr. Rajendra Prasad
Memorial Lectures (second series) delivered on December 9, 1975 [Jour-nal
of Constitutional &amp; Parliamentary Studies, Vol. 10, 1976. p.l] stated that
democracy is not a mere mechanism of choosing and running the Govt. The
egalitarian principle of democracy requires not only one man one vote but
also the equal effective right of each man to live a full human life.
Democracy must, therefore, be seen as a whole complex of relations between
individuals. An individual to live his secular life, as he may wish, would
owe duties towards society and fellow citizens. Each must have an
opportunity to prove, exert, develop and enjoy his human faculties. There-
fore, each must allow others to have equal effective access to opportunity
to develop and lead a full human life. Lack of access to opportunity to
exercise his capacities as means of producing utilities is an impediment,
as it must be described as tack of access to man's liberty. If we take
labour in its broader sense of human energy, it is property. This theory of
property assumes importance in a democratic society.
</p>
<p id="p_49">When we consider right to life to be meanigfu! deprivation of proper-ty
needs to be considered from broad constitutional spectrum. Property in a
comprehensive term is an essential guarantee to lead full life with human
dignity, for, in order that a man may be able to develop himself in a human
fashion with full blossom, he needs a certain freedom and a certain
security. The economic and social justice, equality of status and dignity
of person are assured to him only through property. Roscoe Pound has argued
that a system of individual property on the whole conduces to maintaining
and furthering of civilisation. Sir Henry Maine wrote that nobody is at
liberty to attach (amass) several property and to say at the same time he
values civilization. The history of the two cannot be disen-tangled. (See
Village Community, p.230). Granting facilities and oppor-tunites to hold
the property furthers the basic structures of egalitarian social order
guaranteeing equality and it would remove disabilities and inequalities and
accords status and dignity of person. The term 'property' in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_198">Art. 300A</a>
receives its true colour and reflectrion from the context in which State's
power of eminent domain or police power is invoked and effectuated.
</p>
<p id="p_50">Property in legal sense means an aggregate of rights which are guaranteed
and protected by law. it extends to every species of valuable right and
interest, more particularly, ownership and exclusive right to a thing, the
right to dispose of the thing in every legal way, to possess it, to use it
and to exclude every one else from interfering with it. The dominion or
indefinite right of use or disposition which one may lawfully exercise over
particular things or subjects is called property. The exclusive right of
possessing, enjoying, and disposing of a thing is property in legal
parameters. Therefore, the word 'property; connotes everything which is
subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or intangible,
visible or invisible, real or personal; everything that has an exchangeable
value or which goes to make up wealth or estate or status. Property,
therefore, within the constitutional protection, denotes group of rights
inhering citizen's relation to physical thing, as right to possess, use and
dispose of it in accordance with law. In Ramanatha Aiyar's The Law Lexicon,
Reprint Ed. 1987 at p. 1031 it is stated that the property is the most
comprehensive of all terms which can be used, inasmuch as it is indicative
and descriptive of every possible interest which the party can htive. The
term property has a most extensive signification, and, according to its
legal definition, consists in free use, enjoyment, and disposition by a
person of all his acquisitions, without any control or diminution, save
only by the laws of the land, in Dwarkadas Srinivas's case this court gave
extended meaning to the word property. Mines, minerals and quarries are
property attracting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_199">Article 300A.</a> Hidayatullah, Chief Justice, in his
"Right to Property and the Indian Constitution", Tagore Law Lectures
reiterated as to what he had laid the law in Golaknath's case that right to
property, quoting Grotius, who had treated the right as an acquired right
(ius quaesitun) and ownership (dominium) as either serving individual
interests (vulgare) or for the public good (eminens). According to him, the
acquired right had to give way to eminent domain (ex vi super-eminentis
dominiji), but there must be public interest (Public utilities) and it
possible compensation. In the social con-tract theory also the contract
included protection of property with recog-nition of the power of the ruler
to act in the public interest and emergency. Our constitutional theory
treated property rights as invoilable except through law for public good
and on payment of compensation. Our Con-stitution saw the matter in the way
of Grotius but over-looked the pos-sibility that just compensation may not
be possible.
</p>
<p id="p_51">Karl Renner in his "The Institution of Private law their Functions", 1949-
Edition by Kahn-Feund, pages 105-08 and 114-22, stated the "Proper-ty in
modern conditions has become a means of control over other people's labour
and life." Private property ownership requires reconciliation with public
interest balancing public needs against private needs. M.R. Cohen in his
essay on "Property am' Sovereignty" [13 Cornell Law Quarterly 8| stated
that right is a relation, not between an owner and a thing, but between
th-; owner and other individuals in reference to things. Therefore,
property as a right over things resolves it into component right such as
the jus utendi,for disponendi, etc. Justice Matnew opined in his right to
property that in law, control of property means control of matter, and, it
becomes control over human beings. The institution of private law imply the
total power of doing with the thing what one likes, has, in fact become an
institution of public law (power of command) and its main functions are
exercised by complementary legal institutions developed from the law of
obligations. According to Justice Mathew the law eventually takes account
of this change of function by giving property an increasing public law-
character.
</p>
<p id="p_52">According to Sir Henry Maine, in his "Ancient law, I'Bl-Edition, "ancient
law knows next to nothing of individuals." Individual is an impor-tant anil
distinct part of the 'social compact' quoting the village community in
India as an instance of an organised patriarchal socity and an as-semblage
of co-proprietors, he stated thus "the personal relations to each'/other of
the men who compose it are indistinguishably confounded with their
proprietary rights.......The village community is known to be of immense
antiquity. In whatever direction research has been pushed into Indian
history, general of local, it has always found the community in existence
at the farthest point of progress. Friedman in his "Legal Theory" stated
that in modern democracy, by the same process, which has lead to the
increasing modification of individual rights by social duties towards
neighbours and community., has everywhere has to temper freedom of property
with social responsibilities attached to property. He quoted power of
taxation, police power and the power of expropriation subject to fair
compensation are examples of public restrictions on freedom of property. He
also stated that another kind of interference touches the freedom to use
property through the growing number of social obligations attached by law,
i.e., use of industrial property or contact of employment. Justice Mathew,
therefore, drew the distinction between the individual side and the social
side of the property, The social side of the property finds illustration in
the right of eminent domain and taxation. It is not regarded as something
exceptional. It is an essential of the institution of property itself The
Social side limits the institutional side and it is not an absolute private
property itself. The two necessarily must go together so that, if one
perishes, the other must perish. In the words of Prof. Van Ihering, it
would result in "the destruction of the society". In the words of Prof.
Towney the property becomes functionless. Justice Mathew at p.12 stated
that all property might be described as government largesse given on
conditions and subject to law. At P.14 he stated that "property is an
essential guaran-tee of human dignity for, in order that a man may be able
to develop himself in a human fashion, he needs a certain freedom and a
certain security, the one and the other are assured to him only through
property. In his concluding observations at p.19 Justice Mathew had stated
that the "property is the greatest source of friction in a community,
extreme ine-quality in the distribution of property has been and will be a
cause of revolution in states. I am not sure the problem will be solved by
transferring the ownership of property in the means production to the
state. This will add economic power to political power and will render the
individual more helpless than in the capitalistic system where power and
responsibility are diffused. This does not mean that the final directing
power over economic system should not be in the hands of the community. An
individual has a right to conditions of well being and that consists in the
case of many individuals of the right as well as the duty to work. The
system should be so organized that no individual can, through possession of
property, have power over the lives of others."
</p>
<p id="p_53">Hidayatullah, C.J., in his 'Right to Property - at p.88 stated that
Socialism envisaged reform which would disturb this right and make
provision for the resources to be employed in aid of the suffering classes,
as it is contemplated as the common happiness. In this the will of the
individual was made subordinate to that of the community. The ine-qualities
of wealth were the main objects of the socialistic doctrines. It was
considered that the legitimate function of the State was to reduce this
inequality even by taking from those who had to little. This was to be a
permanent arrangement and not merely an ameliorative measure in some
calamity. This equality was to be achieve not only by public opinion and
forces but by law and the force of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_54">It is accordingly clear that in a welfare State envisioned in the directive
principles of State policy, the basic perquisites are that everyone is
entitled to minimum material well being, such as food, clothing, and decent
housing. Expanding living standard are possible with the existing or
expanding physical resources and scientific knowledge etc., and the State
has right and duty to act when private initiative fails. In a democratic
society, every individual needs legal protection for the beneficial
enjoyment of what he has discovered and appropriated; has created by his
own labour (in wider sense); and what he has acquired under the existing
social and economic order subject to law and order. Equally welfare
consists in adjusting individual interests with social interest by the aid
of law as social engineering, which would mean public restraints on
property designed to mitigate the privileges which property offers in
enjoyment of the things that life has to offer. Restraints on the power to
use the property as a delegated power of command is means as of quasi-
governmental private control over the major assets of a nation. Properly,
thereby, is subject to regulation. The directive principles enjoin the
State to reorganise the economic system by law or administrative means and
the Fundamental rights are means to that end to make right to life
meaningful, equality of opportunity and of status and dignity of person a
reality. The fundamental rights and the directive principles are the two
wheels of the chariot as an aid to make social and economic democracy a
truism. The word "property used in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_200">Article 300A</a> must be understood in the
context in which the sovereign power of eminent domain is exercised by the
State and Property expropriated. No abstract principles could be laid. Each
case must be considered in the light of its own facts and setting. The
Phrase 'deprivation of the property of a person' must equally be considered
in the fact situation of a case. Deprivation connotes different concepts.
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_201">Article 300A</a> gets attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of
private property, by necessary implication for public purpose, in
accordance with the law made by the Parliament or a State legislature, a
rule or a statutory order having force of law. It is inherent in every
sovereign State by exercising it's power of eminent domain to expropriate
private property without owner's consent. Prima facie, State would be the
judge to decide whether a purpose is a public purpose. But it is not the
sole judge. This will be subject to judicial review and it is the duty of
the Court to determine whether a particular purpose is a public purpose or
not. Public interest has always been considered to be an essential
ingredient of public purpose. But every public purpose does not fall under
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_202">Article 300A</a> nor every exercise of eminent domain an acquisition or taking
possession under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_203">Article 300A.</a> Generally speaking preservation of public
health or prevention of damage to life and property are considered to be
public purposes. Yet deprivation of property for any such purpose would not
amount to acquisition or possession taken under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_204">Article 300A.</a> It would be
by exercise of the Police power of the State. In other words, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_205">Art. 300A</a>
only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of his
property save by authority of law. There has to be no deprivation without
any sanction of law. Depriva-tion by any other mode is not acquisition or
taking possession under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_206">Article 300A.</a> In other words, if there is no law,
there is no deprivation. Acquisition of mines, minerals and quarries is
deprivation under Art 300A.
</p>
<p id="p_55">The question then is whether the owner of the property is entitled to
compensation i.e., just equivalent or indemnification to the owner of the
property expropriated. It is common knowledge that when the State exer-
cises its executive power to acquire private property, it is under the land
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_207">Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 or similar State laws. Acquisition thereunder though
is for public purpose, payment of compensation at the prevailing market
value as on the date of the relevant notification published in the Official
Gazette, is sine qua non. The State when exercises the power of eminent
domain under. Art 300A and acquires or requisitions or taken possession of
the property of a citizen to give effect to any of the directive principles
envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution, the question emerges whether the
same yardstick of payment of just equivalent or indemnification to the
owner of the property expropriated should be applicable or <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_208">Art. 300A</a> per
force bring it in operation? Since <a href="/doc/1329698/" id="a_209">Art. 30(2)</a> itself provided payment of
compensation, when property was acquired preceding 25th <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_210">Constitution
Amendment Act</a>, 1971, this Court interpreted the word "compensation" as
aforesaid, but when <a href="/doc/1329698/" id="a_211">Article 30(2)</a> itself was omitted from the Constitution,
the question arises whether payment of compensation is a sine quo non for
deprivation of property under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_212">Article 300A?.</a> In any democracy governed by
rule of law, Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Roscoe Pound, a
sociological jurist whose writings have virtually opened new vistas in the
sphere of justice, Stated that 'the justice meant not as an individual or
idea relations among men but a regime in which the adjustment of human
relations and ordering of the human conduct for peaceful existence'.
According to him, 'the means of satisfying human claims to have things and
to do things should go around, as far as possible, with least friction and
waste. In his "A Survey of Social Interests", 57th, Harvard Law Review, 1
at 39(1943), he elaborated thus : 'Looked at functionally the law is an
attempt to satisfy, to reconcile, to harmonize, to adjust these overlapping
and often conflicting claims and demands, either through securing them
directly and immediately, or through securing certain individual interests
or through delimitations or compromises of individual interests, so as to
give effect to the greatest total of interests or to the interests that
weigh more in our civilization with the least sacrifice of the scheme of
interests as a whole". In his 'theory of justice'. 1951 Edition, at page 31
he stated that "the law means to balance the competing interests of an
individual along with the social interests of the society." In his work,
"justice according to Law," he observed : "We come to an idea of maximum
satisfaction of human wants or expectations. What we have to do in social
control and so in law, is to reconcile and adjust these desires or wants or
expectations, so far as we can, so as to secure as much of the totality of
them as we can." According to him, therefore, that the claims or interests,
namely, in-dividual, physical, social or public interest should
harmoniously be recon-ciled "to the balancing the social interests through
the instrument of social control; a task assigned to public law for that
matter."
</p>
<p id="p_56">All modern constitutions of democratic character provide payment of
compensation as the condition to exercise the right of expropriation.
Commonwealth of Autralia Act, a French Civil Code (<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_213">Article 545</a>), the 5th
Amendment of the Constitution of U.S.A. and the Italian Constitution
provided principles of 'just terms' 'just indemnity', 'just compensation'
as reimbursement for the property taken, have been provided for. As pointed
in Halsburry's laws of England that "when parliament has authorized the
compulsory acquisition of land it is almost invariably provided for payment
of a money compensation to the person deprived of his interest in it."
Exception for the interest of the owner was of as much nominal value as an
owner's interest in the subsoil of the streets.
</p>
<p id="p_57">The Constitution of India, on the other hand in its historical back-ground
provided Directive Principles vis-a-vis the fundamental rights to realise
social and economic democracy for successful working of political democracy
in which the state in bound to provide to every person in the society
equality of opportunity in economic arrangements. Material resour ces and
operation of the economic system shall be so organised as to established
the egalitarian social order. Though Articles 31 and 19(l)(f) of the
Constitution accorded to "property" the status as a fundamental right,
there emerged conflict between the animation of the founding fathers and
the judicial interpretation on the word "compensation" when private
property was expropriated to subserve common good or to prevent com-mon
detriment.
</p>
<p id="p_58">The constitution history of the interpretation of the power of the
Parliament to amend the constitution under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_214">Art. 368</a> form Kameshwar Singi v.
Kesvananda Bharti to give effect to the directive principles in Part IV
vis-a-vis the right to property in Arts. 19(l)(f) and 31 as well as the
interpretation, "compensation" from Ms. Bela Banerji to Banks
Nationalisation's case do establish that the Parliament has ultimately
wrested the power to amend the Constitution, without violating its basic
features or structure. Concomitantly legislature has power to acquire the
property of private person exercising the power of eminent domain by a law
for public purpose. The law may fix an amount or which may be determined in
accordance with such principles as may be laid therein and given in such
manner as may be specified in such law. However, such law shall not be
questioned on the grounds that the amount so fixed or amount determined is
not adequate. The amount fixed must be not be illusory. The principles laid
to determine the amount must be relevant to the determina-tion of the
amount. The doctrine of illusory amount or fixation of the principles to be
arbitrary were evolved drawing support from the language originally couched
in the unamended Entry 42 of List III which stood amended by the
Constitution 7th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_215">Amendment Act</a> with the words merely "Acquisition and
Requisition of Property'. Nevertheless even thereafter this court
reiterated this same principles. Therefore, the amendment to Entry 42 of
List III has little bearing on the validity of those principles. We are
conscious that the parliament omitted <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_216">Art. 31(2)</a> altogether. However when
the Stale exercises its power of eminent domain and acquires the property
of private person or deprives him of his property for public purpose,
concomitantly fixation of the amount or its determination be must in
accordance with such principles as laid therein and the amount given in
such manner as may be specified in such a law. However judicial inter-
pretation should not be a tool to reinduct to doctrine of compensation as
concomitance to acquisition or deprivation of property under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_217">Article 300A.</a>
This would be manifest from two related relevant provisions of the Con-
stitution itself. Articles 30(1 A) and 2nd proviso to <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_218">Art. 31A</a> as
exceptions to the other type of acquisition or deprivation of the property
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_219">Article 300A.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_59">For acquisition of the property of a minority educational institution, the
measure is that the State shall ensure that "the amount fixed or determined
under such law" would not "restrict or abrogate the right guarantced" by
<a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_220">Art. 30(1).</a> This was simultaneously brought on the Con-stitution by Section
4 of the Forty-fourth Constitution Amendment Act while omitting Arts. 19(l)
</p><p id="p_60">(f) and 31 from Part III. Equally when the land of a person "within the
ceiling limit" and " in his personal cultivation" is acquired, law shall
provide "for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less then
the market value thereof", this was brought by Constitution Seventh
Amendment Act. By necessary implication the obliga-tion of the state, to
pay compensation for property acquired or indem-nification of property
deprived under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_221">Article 300A</a> or other public purpose is obviated.
</p>
<p id="p_61">The question then is whether the principles laid in Section 69A(4) of the
Code are ultra vires. <a href="/doc/693176/" id="a_222">In Bhim Singhji v. Union of India</a>, [1981] 1 SCC 166,
per majority, the Constitution Bench considered <a href="/doc/978883/" id="a_223">Section 11(6)</a> of the Urban
Land (Ceiling and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_224">Regulation) Act</a>, 1976 (33 of 1976) and fixation of amount
of Rs. 2.00 lacs as maximum limited under sub-s. (6) of the property worth
Rs. 2.00 Crores, it was held to be not illusory and the provisions is not
confiscatory, and that therefore, it does not violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_225">Art. 14</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_226">Art.
31(2)</a> of the Constitution (proceeding Constitution 44th <a href="/doc/1011232/" id="a_227">Amendment).In
Achutananda Purohit v. State of Orissa</a>, [1976] 3 SCR 919, it was held that
fixation of compensation on slab system does not violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_228">Article 14</a> and
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_229">31(2)</a> of the Constitution. In Basant Bat's case this court held that the
provision in s.44(3) of the Maharashtra Housing and Develop-ment Act that
in the absence of agreement, the amount shall be equal to 100 times the net
average monthly income actually derived from such land during the period of
five consecutive years immediately preceding the date of the publication of
the notification referred to in<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_230"> s. 41</a>, as may be determined by the Land
Acquisition Officer, was held to be not violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_231">Art. 14.</a> <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_232">Article 21</a>
was held to have no application to the determination of such amount. In
Tinsukhiya's case a Constitution Bench held that the limitation of the
amount on the basis of the written down book value of the assets was held
to be not violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_233">Art. 14</a> and such principle was held to be not
illusory nor arbitrary. The determination of the amount was held to be an
integral and inseparable part of the scheme of nationalisation which cannot
be cancelled as a distinct provision independent of the scheme. It was also
further held that the material resources of the com-munity mentioned in
<a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_234">Art. 39(b)</a> must be widely interpreted and nationalisa-tion and acquisition
is one of the methods of distribution of material resources of the
community. The economic cost of social and economic reforms is amongst the
most vexed problems of social and economic change. The need for
constitutional mandates for such legislative efforts at social and economic
change recognises otherwise unaffordable economic burden of reforms. It is
not possible to diverse the economic constitutions or components from the
scheme of nationalisation. The main cause of the scheme of the
nationalisation lies on its cost and it cannot be isolated. The
quantification, therefore, forms part of the integrated scheme and cannot
be considered in isolation.
</p>
<p id="p_62">It would thus be clear that acquisition of the property by law laid in"
furtherance of the directive principles of State policy was to distribute
the material resources of the community including acquisition and taking
pos-session of private property for public purpose. It does not require
payment of just compensation or indemnification to the owner of the
property expropriated. It is very negation of effectuating the public
purpose. Pay-ment of market value in lieu of acquired property is not sine
qua non for acquisition. Acquisition and payment of amount are part of the
scheme and they cannot be dissected. However, fixation of the amount or
specification of the principles and the manner in which the amount is to be
determined must be relevant to the fixation of amount. The amount
determined need not bear reasonable relationship. In other words, it is nut
illusory. The adequacy of the resultant amount cannot be questioned in a
court of law. However, the validity of irrelevant principles are amenable
to judicial scrutiny.
</p>
<p id="p_63">It is, therefore, clear that the appellants are not entitled to compen-
sation or just equivalent of property they are deprived of or
indemnification of the property expropriated i.e., mines, whether worked or
not, minerals whether discovered or not or quarries deprived by law made
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_235">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution. The principles under Section 69A(4)
of the Code are relevant. The resultant amount is not illusory. Thereby
they are not void. We further hold that after the Constitution forty fourth
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_236">Amendment Act</a> has come into force, the right to property in Arts. 19 (l)(f)
and 31 had its obliteration from Chapter III. Fundamental Rights. Its
abridgement and curtailment docs not retrieve its lost position, nor gets
restituted with renewed vigour claiming compensation under the grab
'deprivation of property' in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_237">Art. 300A</a>, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_238">The Amendment Act</a> neither receives
wrath of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_239">Art. 13(2</a>), nor does s.69A become ultra vires of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_240">Art. 300A.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_64">The further contention that money value of the rupee from three years
preceding May 1, 1960 till date, has considerable been eroded and that,
therefore, the fixation on the principle of net annual income of three
years preceding the date of vesting, namely 1st May, 1960 is arbitrary and
amount so determined is illusory is also devoid of substance. In
Achutanantida's case, it was contended that compensation money should be so
calculated that the purchasing power of the amount of compensation to be
paid on the date of the actual payment will not be less than its purchasing
power on the date of vesting. Repelling the contention this court held that
on the date of vesting which was well over two decades ago, the purchasing
powers of rupee was much higher than its present value. It is more of less
the world phenomenon that the erosion in value of unit of currency has been
taking place. But this inevitable devaluation due to inflationary trends
does not affect the quantum of compensation prescribed by the statute for
the purpose of allowing compensation in rupee long ago is the same as the
rupee of today, although for the purpose of market and cost of living, the
housewives' answer may be different. Law is sometimes blind. Therefore, the
loss of rupee value is not relevant consideration to adjudge the principle
laid by the statute. Giving acceptance to the conten-tion renders every
statute ultra vires by the nature of the litigation that the time lag
inevitably intervenes an rupee value, during the interregnum gets eroded
and every Act thereby because, on its account, unworkable. In normal
acquisition, the principle of depletion of rupee value has repeatedly been
held to be not relevant to determine market value. The contention,
therefore, is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_65">It is next contended that the act and the related provisions provided
different modes of compensation than the one provided in sub-s.(4) of
Section 69A of the Code and that, therefore, it is discriminatory,
violating <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_241">Art. 14</a> and unfair procedure offending <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_242">Art. 21.</a> We find no
substance in this contention. It is true that different Acts, provide
different principles to determine the amount payable to the deprived owner.
The principle of average of three years net annual income received from
production of the mines and minerals preceding the date of the vesting is a
relevant and germane principle to fix the amount payable to the owner
Comparative evaluation of different principles evolved by each statute may
appear to be different and prime facie to be discriminatory from each
other, but com-parative analogy would not furnish satisfactory test to
declare a national principle determined by the statute to be
discriminatory. It is seen that the principle bears just relation to the
object of determining the amount or compensation payable to the owner and
the principle of average of three years net annual income is a reasonable
classification having relation to the object of modification of the
existing rights and extinguishment thereof. Section 69A(4) of the Code is,
therefore, valid. So it is unassailable under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_243">Art. 14.</a> The principle of
unfairness of the procedure attracting <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_244">Art. 21</a> does not apply to the
acquisition or deprivation of property under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_245">Article 300A</a> giving effect to
the directive principles, are not concerned in these appeals of the effect
of mining and mineral lease or leases granted by the appel-lants to third
parties, since that question was neither canvassed in the High Court, nor
any factual foundation laid before us. We declined to go into that
question. For well over twelve years the appellants worked the mines etc.
by obtaining stay of operation of law and had appropriated the mines or
minerals or quarries from the respective lands.
</p>
<p id="p_66">The appeals are accordingly dismissed with quantified costs at Rs. 1,00,000
in each set. Compensation or amount payable under Section 69A(4) of the
Code may be worked out and the costs be set off in working out the amount
and the balance, if any, be recovered from the appellants. This ex&amp;rcise
should be done within three months from the date of the receipt of the
judgment. Working the mines etc. should be stopped forthwith by either the
appellant, their lessees, or any body in the feigned camouflaged or
coloured shoes. The State should take immediate action is this behali.
