:JUDGMENT   
</pre>
<p id="p_1">M.SATHYANARAYANAN,J.       
</p>
<p id="p_2">        The appellant is the writ petitioner in W.P(MD)No.1480 of 2007. The
appellant/writ petitioner made a challenge to the land acquisition
proceedings under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_1">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,
[hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'] published in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette, dated 28.12.2005 and the notification issued by the second
respondent, published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, dated 22.02.2006 
and the consequential declaration issued by the first respondent under
<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_2">Section 6</a> of the Act in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, dated 30.08.2006
as well as the notification issued by the third respondent in his proceedings
dated 18.01.2007 published in Madurai District Gazette Extraordinary dated
20.01.2007. The said writ petition, after contest, came to be dismissed on
10.07.2007 and challenging the legality of the same, the present writ appeal
is filed by the appellant/writ petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        2. The Secretary of the appellant/writ petitioner - society has sworn
to the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition and it is averred as
follows:
</p><p id="p_4">        2.1. Indira Gandhi College for Women Committee is a registered society
under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act bearing Registration No.19 of
1985 and the said society has been constituted to cater the educational needs
of poor people residing in and around Thirunagar area of Madurai District and
accordingly, the appellant/writ petitioner ? society is running ?Indira
Gandhi Memorial Matriculation Higher Secondary School?. 
</p><p id="p_5">        2.2. The fifth respondent, all of a sudden, sent a communication dated
16.06.2005 calling upon him to appear before the fourth respondent in his
office on 17.06.2005 at 03.00 p.m., to have a meeting on converting the
school building of the appellant/writ petitioner ? society situated at
Thirunagar, Thirupparankundram Village, Madurai District, as a Memorial for
late.Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, wherein he lived and breathed his last.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        2.3. The members of the appellant/writ petitioner ? society appeared
before the fourth respondent and explained to him and also pointed out that
in the event of a portion of the land in which the school is functioning is
acquired for the purpose of converting the same as a Memorial, the same would
jeopardise the activities of the school and also intimated about the function
of the school committee.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        2.4. The second respondent, in the meanwhile, issued a paper
publication in the Tamil vernacular, viz., Dhina Thanthi and Dhina Boomi,
dated 24.12.2004, publishing a notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_3">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act,
wherein it was notified that the land of the appellant/writ petitioner ?
society admeasuring to an extent of 5,035 sq. ft. in S.No.114/1A2 situated at
Thiruparankundram village, Madurai South Taluk, Madurai District, is needed
for a public purpose to establish ?Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar Memorial 
Building?.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        2.5. It is further stated in the said notification that in view of the
urgency, the Governor of Tamil Nadu had directed to acquire the said land by
invoking the urgency provisions under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_4">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act and further,
it was ordered that the procedure under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_5">Section 5-A</a> of the Act by invoking
<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_6">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act has also been dispensed with considering the urgency
of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        2.6. The first respondent has also published a notification in Tamil
Nadu Government Gazette dated 28.12.2005 wherein it is once again reiterated
the acquisition of the said land under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_7">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act. The first
respondent, in the further notification dated 28.12.2005, the Governor of
Tamil Nadu in exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/917475/" id="a_8">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act,
had authorised the fourth respondent to exercise the powers conferred under
<a href="/doc/917475/" id="a_9">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act and in view of the urgency, the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_10">Section
5-A</a> of the Act shall not be applicable to the present case and it is also
followed by a corrigendum issued in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette dated 
22.02.2006 and thereby, <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_11">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act was inserted instead of
<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_12">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_10">        2.7. A declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_13">Section 6</a> of the Act was also published in the
Tamil vernacular daily, viz., Dinamalar, on 08.09.2006 referring to
G.O.Ms.No.173, dated 21.08.2006, declaring that the above mentioned land is
to be acquired for the purpose of public, namely, for establishing Pasumpon
Muthuramalinga Thevar Memorial and yet another notification was published in
the Madurai District Gazette on 20.01.2007, wherein, a direction was issued
by the third respondent under <a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_14">Section 7</a> of the Act to acquire the above
mentioned land for construction of the said Memorial, for which, the fourth
respondent was appointed to perform the functions of the Collector under the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        2.8. The fourth respondent has issued a notification under <a href="/doc/499767/" id="a_15">Sections
9(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_16">10</a> in Form VII of the Act, dated 22.12.2006 and the appellant/writ
petitioner ? society was directed to appear before the fourth respondent on
09.01.2007 for an enquiry for fixing of the compensation and accordingly, the
office bearers appeared before the fourth respondent and gave a
representation dated 08.01.2007 submitting their objections for continuing
with the land acquisition proceedings. However, a notifications under
<a href="/doc/499767/" id="a_17">Sections 9(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_18">10</a> of the Act were issued on 01.02.2007 for appearance
before the fourth respondent for enquiry on 19.02.2007 to decide upon the
quantum of compensation and once again, the Committee members appeared and     
submitted their objections as to the said acquisition. The appellant/writ
petitioner ? society took a stand that at any stretch of imagination, the
construction of the Memorial for a particular individual cannot be termed as
a public purpose and that apart, the provisions of the Act cannot invoked to
acquire the land or a building which is already used for a public purpose by
the appellant/writ petitioner ? society to run an educational institution and
that the notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_19">Section 4(1)</a> and the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_20">Section 6</a>
of the Act failed to reflect any public purpose for which the land of the
appellant/writ petitioner ? society is sought to be required.
</p>        
<p id="p_12">        2.9. The appellant/writ petitioner ? society also pointed out that
Section 34 of the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act,
1973, also imposes a restriction on alienation of property of a private
school and under <a href="/doc/975955/" id="a_21">Section 31(1)(a)</a> of the said Act, no property of a private
school shall except with a previous permission in writing of the competent
authority, be transferred by way of sale, exchange, mortgage, charge, pledge,
lease, gift or in any other manner whatsoever and as such, the land
acquisition proceedings are illegal.
</p>

<p id="p_13">        2.10. The appellant/writ petitioner ? society also took a stand that in
the notification published under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_22">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act, nowhere it is
stated that the powers under <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_23">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act were invoked; whereas
it merely states that <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_24">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act was invoked for acquisition of
the land of the appellant/writ petitioner ? society and even in the
corrigendum, <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_25">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act was inserted instead of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_26">Section 4(1)</a> of
the Act at two places in the original notification, dated 28.12.2005 and as
such, <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_27">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act was not invoked specifically and therefore,
hearing of objections contemplated under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_28">Section 5-A</a> of the Act cannot be
dispensed with.
</p>        
<p id="p_14">        2.11. It is further averred by the appellant/writ petitioner ? society
that invocation of <a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_29">Section 7</a> of the Act by the third respondent empowering
the fourth respondent to acquire the land is illegal and also without
jurisdiction and that apart, even before obtaining appropriate orders from
the competent authority, the fourth respondent started proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_30">Section 9</a> of the Act as early as on 22.12.2006 and hence, the proceedings for
taking possession of the land under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_31">Section 9</a> of the Act is illegal.
Therefore, the appellant/writ petitioner ? society prayed for quashment of
the entire land acquisition proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        3. The writ petition was entertained and notices were ordered.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        4. The fourth respondent has filed the counter affidavit and took a
stand that the Secretary of the appellant/writ petitioner ? school was
informed about the intention of the Government to convert the land as a
living monument for a person who has devoted his life for freedom struggle
and the Memorial would be ornamental rather than impediment and all the
statutory requirements have been complied with. The representation submitted
by the appellant/writ petitioner ? society opposing the acquisition of land
was also examined in detail and has to be rejected for the reason that the
acquisition was for a public purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        5. Insofar as the legal plea raised by the appellant/writ petitioner ?
society that the fourth respondent took a stand that <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_32">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act
permits the Collector, though no award was passed on expiration of 15 days
from the publication of notification under <a href="/doc/1015358/" id="a_33">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act, permits
taking possession of any land needed for public purpose and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_34">Section 17(4)</a> of
the Act permits dispensation of notice under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_35">Section 5-A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        6. In paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit, it is averred by the
fourth respondent that ?As the aura that surrounds the name Pasumpon 
Muthuramalinga Thevar is clear evidence of the overwhelming popularity of
this great personality and of the few from these parts, who adorned the
portals of fame by his unflinching drive, dint of honesty, sincerity and hard
work and his tireless strivings towards achievement of independence from the
foreign oppression immortalised him and gained him untold glory, fame and he
is the household name for several lakhs of people who not only adore him, but
also he is held aloft on a high pedestal equating him with the innumerable
deities which adorn every street corner in the famous city of Pandiyas. His
clarion call echoes in the minds of more than 30 to 35 percent of people
drawn from these difference sects predominantly having domicile over the
southern Tamil Nadu. Hence the decision announced by the Chief Minister on
the floor of the Assembly drew lot of cheers from the public and as such, no
individual shall be allowed to question the decision of the Government in
acquiring the piece of land for public purpose since mere mention is
sufficient to attract the wrath of innumerable people.?
</p>
<p id="p_19">        7. The fourth respondent also pointed out that out of the total extent
of 19,618 sq. ft., of lands, only an extent of 5,035 sq. ft., of lands are
required for the Memorial and the remaining space and the land proposed to be
given to the appellant/writ petitioner ? school are sufficient to run a
Higher Secondary School in a sub-urban like Thirunagar.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        8. It is also the stand of the fourth respondent that permission of the
competent authority as contemplated under Section 31 of the Tamil Nadu
Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973, is not required since as
eminent domain, the Government grants them absolute right to take any land
for public purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        9. Pendency of the writ petition, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar Trust,
represented by its Managing Director, P.Valai Thevar, came to be impleaded as
the sixth respondent, vide order of this Court dated 09.06.2007 passed in
M.P(MD)No.2 of 2007 in W.P(MD)No.1480 of 2007.   
</p>
<p id="p_22">        10. The first respondent has also filed the counter affidavit in tune
with the stand of the fourth respondent and reiterated the stand that the
Government as eminent domain, formed the subjective satisfaction to acquire
the land for a public purpose by invoking the urgency provisions and it
cannot be challenged in the writ petition.
</p>

<p id="p_23">        11. The Trust also took a stand that Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar has 
lived and breathed his last in plot No.A-5, which forms part of the school
premises and it is considered as a temple by the followers, admirers and
daily thousands of people visited that place at Thirunagar to have dharsan.
The sixth respondent ? Trust as well as the persons having similar interest
are making representations to the Government to convert the place as a
Memorial for the great man and the Government took a fair stand to convert
the said place as a Memorial and as such, there will not be any inconvenience
to the school if a piece of land and a superstructure therein is converted as
a Memorial for Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar.  
</p>
<p id="p_24">        12. The appellant/writ petitioner ? society filed an additional
affidavit dated 21.06.2007 and pointed out that as per <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_36">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_37">A) of the
Act</a>, the Collector in respect of the land not exceeding 40 acres in extent
the value of which does not exceed Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Lakhs 
only); the Commissioner of Land Administration in respect of land not
exceeding 75 acres in extent the value of which exceeds Rs.25,00,000/-
(Rupees Twenty Five Lakhs only) but does not exceed Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees  
Fifty Lakhs only) and the Government, in other cases, is competent to acquire
the land, whereas by virtue of the impugned notification only 5,035 sq. ft.,
of land is ought to be acquired and as such, the impugned notification under
<a href="/doc/1163472/" id="a_38">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act is illegal and without jurisdiction as it is in
violation of the <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_39">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_40">A) of the Act</a>. The appellant/writ petitioner ?
society also raised an additional ground that the mandatory requirement of
<a href="/doc/939046/" id="a_41">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act has not been properly complied with and on that
ground also, the declaration issued under <a href="/doc/939046/" id="a_42">Section 6</a> is to be declared as
illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_25">        13. The learned Single Judge on considering the materials, recorded a
finding that it is not open to the appellant/writ petitioner ? society to
question the public purpose because the State being convinced that there is a
public demand and hence, they having a duty imposed on them, wanted to  
establish a Memorial in remembrance of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar. The   
learned Judge has also taken note of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_43">Article 51-A(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_44">(b)</a> of the
Constitution of India and also highlighted the historical facts in
justification of establishing a Memorial in memory of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga
Thevar. The learned Judge, from paragraphs 7 to 11 of the impugned order, had
spoken about the glory of late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and observed  
that he was taken ill and was under constant treatment and he breathed his
last on 29.10.1963 in the place known as Thirunagar Bungalow where he was 
staying and the learned Judge, in paragraph 15, observed that ?When the State
invokes the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_45">Land Acquisition Act</a> publishes the notification
under <a href="/doc/71471946/" id="a_46">Section 4(1)</a> of the Central Act and declares the public purpose, unless
the purpose is held to be not public purpose, it is not open to the persons
like the petitioner to oppose such a move and try to argue that the memorial
could be located elsewhere.?
</p>        
<p id="p_26">        14. The learned Judge also dealt with the submission made on behalf of
the appellant/writ petitioner as to the invocation of the State enactment of
1956 and held that the question of repugnancy between two legislations does
not arise. The learned Judge also dealt with the point urged with regard to
non-quoting of <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_47">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act and held that ?mere non-quoting of
the relevant provisions or misquoting of the relevant section does not
invalidate the Government Order and so long as such power of the Government
exists in terms of exercising power under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_48">Section 17(4)</a> and the said power is
exercised in terms of the circumstances justifying the exercising of the
power, the petitioner cannot find any fault with the same.?
</p>        
<p id="p_27">        15. The learned Judge has also taken into consideration the decision in
General Manager, Southern Railway, Madras v. Chintadripet Boys Higher 
Secondary School and others reported in AIR 1995 Madras 150, wherein the 
acquisition of land for the construction of railway line under Mass Rapid
Transport System came to be justified for a public purpose and also the
learned Judge took note of an yet another decision in Dharam Pal Goel (D) by
<a href="/doc/82531271/" id="a_49">LRs., v. State of Haryana and others</a> reported in (1997) 4 Supreme Court Cases
186, which dealt with the acquisition for formation of buffer road to
facilitate plantation of the trees to contain pollution caused by the
vehicular traffic and found that the said acquisition is justified and it is
not for the school to contend that in the event of acquisition of land, they
may not be in a position to run the school and also took note of the fact
that every year Thevar Jayanthi is celebrated by the school management and
declares holiday and the public are allowed to come and pay homage and 
respect to the portrait of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and further held
that if any Memorial is established, it will add prestige to the school and
it will have a new identity in that locality. The learned Judge citing the
said reasons, dismissed the said writ petition, vide impugned order dated
10.07.2007 and challenging the legality of the same, the present appeal is
filed.
</p>        
<p id="p_28">        16. The appellant/writ petitioner ? society, pendency of the appeal,
filed M.P(MD)No.1 of 2007 and this Court, vide order dated 01.08.2007, has
directed the District Collector, Madurai District; representative of the
appellant/writ petitioner ? society and representative of the sixth
respondent ? Trust to examine the feasibility of locating the appellant/writ
petitioner ? school in an extent of 2.12 acres in S.No.428 at
Thiruparankundram Village, Madurai Taluk and accordingly, the said exercise
was carried out by the District Collector, Madurai District.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        17. When the appeal was listed on 28.02.2018 for hearing, the District
Collector, Madurai District, filed a report dated 20.02.2018 and took a stand
that despite meetings held on 14.02.2018 and 19.02.2018, the appellant/writ
petitioner ? society as well as the sixth respondent ? Trust did not come
forward for amicable settlement.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        18. The learned Counsel for the appellant/writ petitioner ? society
made the following submissions:
</p><p id="p_31">        18.1. Admittedly, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar breathed his last on 
29.10.1963 in a building which now forms part of a school and even as per the
stand of the sixth respondent ? Trust, for the past 40 years, representations
were repeatedly submitted to convert the said building as a Memorial and it
was taken note of by the Government and took a conscious decision to acquire
the said piece of land with superstructure for conversion as a Memorial for
late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and as such, there is no necessity or 
reasons have been made out to invoke the urgency provisions and thereby,
dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_50">Section 5-A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_32">        18.2. The Government did not invoke <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_51">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act and even
in the corrigendum, insertions of <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_52">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act alone was made and
as such, the urgency provision ought not to have been removed. In the event
of acquisition of a portion of the land along with superstructure, the
mandatory requirement for acquisition of a minimum extent of land in which a
private school is functioning, as contemplated under the Tamil Nadu
Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, has to be necessarily followed
and in that event, the school cannot function.
</p>        
<p id="p_33">        18.3. The school caters the need of students hailing from poor and
downtrodden communities and in the event of acquisition of land and
conversion of the superstructure exist on the land as a Memorial, the school
has to look for alternative place and despite extending maximum co-operation
to find out and locate the school, on account of the attitude exhibited by
the sixth respondent ? Trust, it could not be fructified. Before issuing the
impugned notification, the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private
Schools (Regulation) Act, especially, <a href="/doc/1379589/" id="a_53">Section 34</a>, which imposes restriction
on alienation of a school property, have not been taken note of by the
authorities concerned and in any event, the first respondent ought to have
consulted or obtained the views of the school Committee before venturing into
the acquisition proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_34">        18.4. The provisions of <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_54">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_55">A) of the Act</a> have not been
complied with, for the reason that since the impugned notification speaks
about the acquisition of 5,035 sq. ft., of land, the District Collector,
Madurai District, ought to have issued the notification and not the
Government. The representation dated 08.01.2007 submitted by the 
appellant/writ petitioner ? society has not been considered at all and the
official respondents went by the public sentiments, especially, with regard
to law and order problem and as such, the entire land acquisition proceedings
are vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_35">        19. The learned Counsel for the appellant/writ petitioner ? society in
support of his submissions, has placed reliance upon the decisions in (i) <a href="/doc/705558/" id="a_56">Om
Prakash v. State of U.P</a> reported in (1998) 6 Supreme Court Cases 1; (ii)
<a href="/doc/1273595/" id="a_57">Anand Singh v. State of U.P</a> reported in (2010) 11 Supreme Court Cases 242;

Cases 721. 
</p><p id="p_36">        20. Per contra, Mr.A.K.Baskarapandian, learned Special Government 
Pleader appearing for the official respondents would contend that it is not
in serious dispute that late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar has contributed
very much towards freedom struggle and the long standing requisition for
conversion of a building where he breathed his last as a Memorial has been
fulfilled and taking note of the public demand and sentiments, a conscious
decision has been taken by the Government to acquire the land with a piece of
superstructure for conversion as a Memorial and as such, it cannot be faulted
with.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        21. It is the further submission of the learned Special Government
Pleader appearing for the official respondents that the learned Judge has
properly appreciated the factual aspects and legal position and rightly
reached the conclusion that the power of eminent domain by the Government 
cannot be questioned by the appellant/writ petitioner ? society and in the
absence of any perversity, the well-considered order passed by the learned
Judge cannot be interfered with.
</p>        
<p id="p_38">        22. It is the further submission of the learned Special Government
Pleader appearing for the official respondents that after entertaining of the
writ appeal, very many efforts have been taken by the District Collector,
Madurai District, to find out an alternative land for shifting the school and
on account of the attitude exhibited by the school, the efforts could not be
fructified and would further add that the functioning of the school will not
be interfered with or hindered in any manner in the event of location of the
Memorial. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">        23. Mr.T.K.Gopalan, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of
Mr.S.Vellaichamy, learned Counsel for the sixth respondent ? Trust has stated
about the selfless acts of late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and would 
contend that apart from Balagangadhara Tilakar, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga  
Thevar was incarcerated for over a decade opposing British reign and also
donated his properties for the benefit of poor and downtrodden communities
and still worshipped as a God by the people belonging to three sects and the
Government rightly took a decision to establish a Memorial and since it is
purely for a public purpose and that the need is also very urgent, the land
acquisition proceedings cannot be faulted with and prays for the dismissal of
this writ appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        24. This Court paid it's anxious consideration and best attention to
the rival submissions and also perused the materials placed before it.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        25. The following issues arise for consideration in this writ appeal:
</p><p id="p_42">        (i) Whether wrong quoting of provision, i.e., <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_59">Section 17(1)</a> instead of
<a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_60">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act, vitiates the land acquisition proceedings?
</p><p id="p_43">        (ii) Whether the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the
Government instead of the District Collector, under <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_61">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_62">A) of the
Act</a>, is sustainable?
</p><p id="p_44">        (iii) Whether the invocation of urgency provisions by the first
respondent and thereby, dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_63">Section 5-A</a> of the
Act, is sustainable?
</p><p id="p_45">        (iv) To what relief, the appellant/writ petitioner ? society is
entitled to?
</p>
<p id="p_46">Issue No.(i):
</p><p id="p_47">        26. The learned Judge in paragraph No.22 of the impugned order dealt
with the issue and found that in G.O.Ms.No.229, Information and Tourism
Department (Memorial), dated 01.12.2005, has expressed the intention to
dispense with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_64">Section 5-A</a> of the Act and recorded a finding
that mere non-quoting of the relevant provisions or misquoting of the
relevant section does not invalidate the Government Order and that so long as
such power of the Government exists in terms of exercising power under
<a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_65">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act and the said power is exercised in terms of the
circumstances justifying the exercising of the power, it cannot be found
fault with and also placed reliance upon the judgment in <a href="/doc/1435728/" id="a_66">Director General of
Police, A.P v. K.Ratnagiri</a> reported in 1990 (3) Supreme Court Cases 60,
wherein it is held that ?a wrong wording in the order does not take away the
power if it is otherwise available.?
</p>        
<p id="p_48">        27. This Court in the later portion of the order deals with the issue
relating to invocation of urgency provisions by the Government and insofar as
this issue is concerned, this Court is of the considered view that mere
quoting of wrong provision does not validate the entire land acquisition
proceedings. The materials placed before this Court would indicate that the
Government wanted to invoke the urgency provisions by dispensing with <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_67">Section
5-A</a> of the Act for the purpose of acquiring a piece of land with
superstructure for setting up a Memorial for late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga
Thevar. No doubt, in the corrigendum also, there was an insertion inserting
<a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_68">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act and not <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_69">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. However, the same
would not invalidate the land acquisition proceedings and therefore,
sustained the findings recorded by the learned Judge. Therefore, Issue No.(i)
is answered in negative against the appellant/writ petitioner ? society.
Issue No.(ii):
</p><p id="p_49">        28. No doubt, as per <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_70">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_71">A) of the Act</a>, the District Collector
ought to have initiated the land acquisition proceedings and ultimately, the
Government took a call.
</p>
<p id="p_50">        29. It is to be pointed out at this juncture that <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_72">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_73">A) of the
Act</a> is in the nature of delegation and once the power is delegated, the
delegatee of such a power is not denuded of it's plenary powers and the said
aspect has been rightly noted by the learned Judge in paragraph 21 of the
impugned order and as such, the land acquisition proceedings impugned is not
vitiated on account of non-following of <a href="/doc/244871/" id="a_74">Section 4</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_75">A) of the Act</a>. Therefore,
Issue No.(ii) is answered in negative against the appellant/writ petitioner ?
society.
</p>
<p id="p_51">Issue Nos.(iii) and (iv):
</p><p id="p_52">        30. A perusal of the impugned order passed in the writ petition, which
is the subject matter of challenge in this writ appeal would clearly reveal
that the learned Judge before going into the merits of the matter, took a
decision to dismiss the writ petition and insofar as the greatness of late
Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, has collected materials from his own sources,  
i.e., (1) Unions in Conflict by Eamon Murphy (1981), Australian National
University Publication; and (2) Mudisuda Mannar Pasumpon Muthuramalinga   
Thevar by A.R.Perumal (2006) [Kumaran Publication] and the same is indicated
in paragraph 12 of the impugned order.
</p>        
<p id="p_53">        31. It is not in doubt that Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar was a great
freedom fighter and was incarcerated for over a decade in opposing the
British reign and breathed his last on 29.10.1963 in a superstructure which
also forms part of the school. Therefore, the primordial issue now arises for
consideration, is whether the need for establishment/conversion of the said
place as a Memorial, is very urgent and as a consequence, the enquiry under
<a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_76">Section 5-A</a> of the Act should have been dispensed with?

</p><p id="p_56">        33. It is relevant to extract hereunder paragraph 11 of the counter
affidavit filed by the fourth respondent in the writ petition:
</p><p id="p_57">        ?11. ... His clarion call echoes in the minds of more than 30 to 35
percent of people drawn from three difference sects predominantly having
domicile over the southern Tamilnadu. ...
</p><p id="p_58">        ... no individual shall be allowed question the decision of the
Government in acquiring this piece of land for public purpose since more
mention is sufficient to attract the wrath of innumerable people. ...?
[emphasis supplied]

</p><p id="p_59">        34. The counter affidavit of the fourth respondent states that the
clarion call of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar echoes in the minds of more 
than 30 to 35 percent of people drawn from three difference sects
predominantly having domicile over the southern Tamilnadu. The said averment
implies that a particular sect in which, later Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar
belonged, evinced great interest in establishing the Memorial. In later
portion of the paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit, it is averred that ?...
since mere mention is sufficient to attract the wrath of innumerable people.?
If both the words read together, it appears that in order to satisfy the need
of the people belonging to a particular sect and apprehending law and order
problem from them, a decision has been taken by the Government to invoke the
urgency provision and thereby, dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_84">Section 5-A</a>
of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_60">        35. The Government is of the people, for the people and by the people
and on account of taking such a stand, it is made to appear that the
Government is yielding to the pressure of the people belonging to a
particular sect and also apprehends law and order problem.
</p>
<p id="p_61">        36. It is also to be noted at this juncture that the appellant/writ
petitioner ? society submitted a detailed representation dated 08.01.2007 to
the fourth respondent pointing out that in memory of the Prime Minister late
Indira Gandhi, the land admeasuring to an extent of 45 cents along with
superstructure bearing Door No.A-5 wherein late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga  
Thevar breathed his last, was purchased and at present, it is having classes
from Kindergarten to 12th Standard. 42 class rooms have been constructed and
72 teachers imparted education to 1,372 students and it is having a pass
percentage of 94% to 97.4% in S.S.L.C (10th Standard) and H.S.C. (12th
Standard) respectively.
</p><p id="p_62">        37. The appellant/writ petitioner ? school in the said representation
also pointed out that they have purchased the said land along with
superstructure 28 years after the demise of late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga 
Thevar and each and every year, celebrated ?Thevar Jayanthi? in a grand
manner and also declared a holiday on that day and permitted the public to
pay their respect to him. It was also pointed out to the fourth respondent
that the school is located in 19,618 sq. ft., and if 5,035 sq. ft., of land
is acquired, as per Rules, they may not be in a position to run the school
and also pointed out that late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar lived in the
superstructure bearing Door No.A-5 for a few months and if he would have been
alive, he would have supported the running of the school and not the
construction of a Memorial and hence, prays for dropping of the land
acquisition.
</p>
<p id="p_63">        38. In paragraph 7 of the counter affidavit of the first respondent,
the said official took a stand that the said representation was examined in
detail and the same has to be rejected as the acquisition was for a public
purpose and in the award enquiry, the appellant/writ petitioner ? society had
not participated and thus, the award came to be passed.
</p>

<p id="p_64">        39. In the considered opinion of this Court, the said representation
ought to have been considered by the first respondent in a proper perspective
for the purpose of taking a decision to invoke the urgency provisions, but
unfortunately the concerned authority has failed to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_65">        40. The stand taken by the sixth respondent ? Trust would also disclose
that they are repeatedly making representation and requested the Government
to set up a Memorial for nearly 40 years and at last, the Government took a
decision in the form of announcement in the floor of the Assembly to set up a
Memorial. 
</p>
<p id="p_66">        41. Pendency of the writ appeal, in terms of the order passed by the
Government, the District Collector, Madurai District, namely, the third
respondent herein, convened a joint meeting and in his report, dated
20.02.2018, pointed out that in the said meetings, no amicable solution has
been arrived at.
</p>
<p id="p_67">        42. Let this Court survey various decisions rendered by this Court as
well as the Honourable Supreme Court as to the need and requirement for
invoking the urgency provisions and thereby, dispensing with the pre-
acquisition enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_68">        43. <a href="/doc/30335151/" id="a_85">In Nandeshwar Prasad v. State of U.P</a> reported in 1964 (3) SCR 425,
the Honourable Supreme Court held that ?it would be sufficient if the records
borne out such satisfaction for invocation of the urgency provisions?.
However, in the case on hand, all the records have not been produced and the
counter affidavit filed by the respondents 1 and 4 based on records, also did
not disclose the need for invoking the urgency provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_69">        44. <a href="/doc/768110/" id="a_86">In Babu Ram v. State of Haryana</a> reported in (2009) 10 Supreme Court
Cases 115, the acquisition proceedings was initiated under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_87">Land
Acquisition Act</a>, 1894, for construction of sewage treatment plant, but
invoking the urgency provisions under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_88">Section 17(4)</a> of the said Act and it
was put to challenge. The Honourable Supreme Court after placing reliance
upon the earlier decision in <a href="/doc/1704181/" id="a_89">Union of India v. Krishnan Lal Arneja</a> reported
in (2004) 8 Supreme Court Cases 453, found that the invocation of the urgency
provisions was not justified and granted opportunity to the appellants to
file their objections under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_90">Section 5-A</a> of the Act. It is relevant to extract
hereunder paragraph 16 of the said decision relied on by the Honourable
Supreme Court in  <a href="/doc/1704181/" id="a_91">Union of India v. Krishnan Lal Arneja</a> (cited supra):
</p><p id="p_70">        ?16. <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_92">Section 17</a> confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under
which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_93">Section 5A</a> of
the Act in exceptional case of urgency. Such powers cannot be lightly
resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the Government to take
immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose.
A public purpose, however, laudable it may be, by itself is not sufficient to
take aid of <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_94">Section 17</a> to use this extraordinary power as use of such power
deprives a land owner of his right in relation to immovable property to file
objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the
inquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_95">Section 5A</a> of the Act. The Authority must have subjective
satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_96">Section 17</a> keeping
in mind the nature of the public purpose, real urgency that the situation
demands and the time factor i.e. whether taking possession of the property
can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received
from the land owners and the inquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_97">Section 5A</a> of the Act could be
completed. In other words, if power under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_98">Section 17</a> is not exercised, the
very purpose for which the land is being acquired urgently would be
frustrated or defeated. Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose
does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise 
unexpectedly, exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such
as due to earthquake, flood or some specific time-bound project where the
delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous. A citizen's
property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real
and genuine urgency, it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party
of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due
consideration of the acquiring authority. While applying the urgency clause,
the State should indeed act with due care and responsibility. Invoking
urgency clause cannot be a substitute or support for the laxity, lethargy or
lack of care on the part of the State Administration.?
</p>
<p id="p_71">        45. <a href="/doc/1273595/" id="a_99">In Anand Singh v. State of U.P</a>. reported in 2010 (7) SCALE 353 :
(2010) 11 Supreme Court Cases 242, the legality of invocation of emergency
provisions for establishment of a residential colony by the Gorakhpur
Development Authority came up for consideration and in paragraph 30 of the
judgment, it is observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_72">        ?... The exceptional and extraordinary power of doing away with an
enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_100">Section 5A</a> in a case where possession of the land is required
urgently or in unforeseen emergency is provided in <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_101">Section 17</a> of the Act.
Such power is not a routine power and save circumstances warranting immediate 
possession it should not be lightly invoked. The guideline is in built in
<a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_102">Section 17</a> itself for exercise of the exceptional power in dispensing with
enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_103">Section 5A</a>.  Exceptional the power, the more circumspect the
government must be in its exercise. The government obviously, therefore, has
to apply its mind before it dispenses with enquiry under Section5A on the
aspect whether the urgency is of such a nature that justifies elimination of
summary enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_104">Section 5A</a>.?  
</p><p id="p_73">In the very same paragraph, it is observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_74">        ?Upon challenge being made to the use of power under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_105">Section 17</a>, the
government must produce appropriate material before the court that the
opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_106">Section 5A</a> has been formed by
the government after due application of mind on the material placed before
it.  It is true that power conferred upon the government  under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_107">Section 17</a> is
administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight, but in a case where
the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on considerations not
germane to the purpose, the judicial review of such administrative decision
may become necessary.  As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can    
be invoked are specified in <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_108">Section 17(2)</a> but circumstances necessitating
invocation of urgency under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_109">Section 17(1)</a> are not stated in the provision
itself.?
</p>
<p id="p_75">        46. <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_110">In Dev Sharan v. State of U.P</a>., reported in 2011 (3) SCALE 369,

declaration, came up for consideration and in paragraph 18, it is observed as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_76">        ?Therefore, the concept of public purpose on this broad horizon must
also be read into the provisions of emergency power under <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_114">Section 17</a> with the
consequential dispensation of right of hearing under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_115">Section 5A</a> of the said
Act. The Courts must examine these questions very carefully when little
Indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the
instance of the State.  If public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering
common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition the Courts, 
before sanctioning an acquisition, must in exercise of its power of judicial
review, focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice.
While examining these questions of public importance, the Courts, especially
the Higher Courts, cannot afford to act as mere umpires.?
In the said decision, it was found that the invocation of emergency
provisions was not justified.

Government can acquire the private property for public purpose, it must be
remembered that compulsory taking of one's property is a serious matter. If
the property belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of the society or
people suffering from other handicaps, then the Court is not only entitled
but is duty bound to scrutinize the LA  action/decision of the State with
greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in view the fact that the
land owner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of
his livelihood and/or shelter.

may be does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency provisions because
the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property
without being heard. Only in a case of real urgency, the State can invoke the
urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing the land
owner or other interested persons.

before excluding the application of <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_131">Section 5-A</a>, the authority concerned must
be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in

</p><p id="p_84">        (vi) The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is
subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of power
under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_133">Section 17(1)</a> and the same can be challenged on the ground that
the  purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a
public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala

which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be
heard in support of his objection. The use of word "may" in sub-section (4)

2012 (4) SCALE 101, the acquisition of land by Delhi Development Authority to
meet the shortage of housing accommodation in the city of Delhi, by invoking
the urgency provision, came up for consideration and it is relevant to
extract hereunder paragraphs 18 and 19:
</p><p id="p_89">        ?18. If the government seeks to invoke its power of urgency, it has to
first form the opinion that the land for the stated public purpose is
urgently needed. Such opinion has to be founded on the need for immediate
possession of the land for carrying out the purpose for which land is sought
to be compulsorily acquired. The use of power of urgency under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_146">Section
17(1)</a> and (4) of the Act ipso facto does not result in elimination of enquiry
under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_147">Section 5A</a> and, therefore, if the government intends to eliminate
enquiry, then it has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such
nature that necessitates elimination of such enquiry. The satisfaction of the
government on twin aspects viz; (i) need for immediate possession of the land
for carrying out the stated purpose and (ii) urgency is such that
necessitates dispensation of enquiry is a must and permits no departure for a
valid exercise of power under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_148">Section 17(1)</a> and (4). (para 18)
</p><p id="p_90">        19. Adverting now to the Notification dated October 27, 1999, the
statement made therein is to the effect "the Lt. Governor, Delhi is satisfied
also that provisions of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_149">Section 17</a> of the said Act are
applicable to this land and is further pleased under sub-section (4) of the
said Section to direct that all the provisions of <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_150">Section 5A</a> shall not
apply". For what has been stated just above in immediately preceding
paragraph, the exercise of power by the Lt. Governor, Delhi under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_151">Section
17(1)</a> and (4) has to be held bad in law. Moreover, except the above statement
in the Notification, there is no other material available on record which
indicates that there has been application of mind by the Lt. Governor, Delhi
on the aspect that urgency was of such nature that necessitated dispensation
of enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_152">Section 5A</a> of the Act. The respondents have miserably failed
to show that the stated purpose 'Rohini Residential Scheme' could not have
brooked the delay of few months and the conclusion of the enquiry

</p>
<p id="p_100">        54. In the considered opinion of this Court, there is a delay on the
part of the first respondent to invoke the urgency provisions for the
acquisition of a portion of land belonging to the appellant/writ petitioner ?
society for setting up a Memorial for late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar.
</p>
<p id="p_101">        55. Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar was living in the premises bearing 
Door No.A-5 which now forms part of the school premises and breathed his last
on 29.10.1963 and even according to the sixth respondent ? Trust, which is
espousing the said cause, representations and requisitions in this regard
have been repeatedly made for over 40 years.
</p>
<p id="p_102">        56. It is also not in dispute that the said portion of the
superstructure is kept in tact by the appellant/writ petitioner ? society,
which purchased the land as early as in 1991 and every year, on the date of
birth of late Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, a grand function is held and
the school is also declared a holiday on that day.
</p>
<p id="p_103">        57. It is also to be pointed out at this juncture that it is also the
specific stand of the appellant/writ petitioner ? society that in the event
of acquisition of a portion of land, the school may not be in a position to
function properly and effectively for the reason that the extent required for
running the school would get reduced and thereby, it violates the provisions
of the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973. It was
also the stand of the appellant/writ petitioner ? society that Section 34 of
the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973, imposed a 
restriction on alienation of property of the school and as per <a href="/doc/977188/" id="a_177">Section
31(1)(a)</a> of the said Act, no property of a private school shall except with a
previous permission in writing of the competent authority, be transferred by
way of sale, exchange, mortgage, charge, pledge, lease, gift or in any other
manner whatsoever. The respondents did not produce enough materials before 
this Court as to the compliance of the said provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_104">        58. It is also to be remembered at this juncture that the school is
having classes from Kindergarten to 12th Standard and even in the year 2007,
1,372 students were studying and it caters to the needs of poor and
downtrodden wards of people living in Thirunagar area.
</p>
<p id="p_105">        59. There is also a delay of nearly eight months between Gazette
notification dated 28.12.2005 and declaration under <a href="/doc/939046/" id="a_178">Section 6</a> of the Act,
dated 30.08.2006. Even for the sake of argument that the invocation of the
urgency provisions is justified, the Memorial is not going to come overnight
or within short time.
</p>
<p id="p_106">        60. As per 86th Amendment made to the Constitution of India, in the
form of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_179">Article 21-A</a> which came to effect on 01.04.2012, the Right of
Education to the children studying from 6th Standard to 12th Standard, is
declared as a fundamental right and it is also the specific case of the
appellant/writ petitioner ? society that classes 1 to 5 are located in the
superstructure on the land which is the subject matter of acquisition and
that the room in which Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar breathed his last, is
kept in tact and as already pointed out, every year, on the date of birth,
the school itself celebrates and permitted the public to pay homage and
respect to the great leader and for that purpose also, used to declare a
holiday.
</p><p id="p_107">        61. No doubt, as per the directions of this Court, the District
Collector, Madurai District, made very many endeavours to find out an
alternative land for the purpose of shifting the entire school and however,
it did not fructify.
</p>
<p id="p_108">        62. It is very pertinent to note at this juncture that in the birth
place of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, namely, Pasumpon, a Memorial already    
came into being and every year, on the birth day of the great leader,
Government of Tamil Nadu itself is organising a function in a grand manner,
wherein the leaders of political parties pay their respects.
</p>
<p id="p_109">        63. This Court, after full and proper application of mind to the entire
materials, is of the considered view that there is no justification for
invoking the urgency provisions under <a href="/doc/17633757/" id="a_180">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_181">Section 17(4)</a>
of the Act and thereby, dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/96765688/" id="a_182">Section 5-A</a> of the
Act. Even otherwise, the room/superstructure in which, the great leader
breathed his last, is kept in tact and every year, on the date of birth, the
school itself is declaring a holiday and organising a function, where the
people are allowed to pay their respect and that apart, a Memorial is already
there in the birth place of the said great leader and every year, on his date
of birth, the Government of Tamil Nadu is organising a function in a grand
manner. 
</p>        
<p id="p_110">        64. The right to elementary education is also declared as a fundamental
right under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_183">Article 21-A</a> of the Constitution of India by means of 86th
Amendment which came into effect on 01.04.2012 and in the light of the
specific stand taken by the appellant/writ petitioner ? society that classes
1 to 5 are housed in the superstructure on the land which is the subject
matter of acquisition and in the event of acquisition, the said
superstructures have necessarily to be demolished and it has also to be
shifted elsewhere.
</p>
<p id="p_111">        65. No doubt, the acquisition of the said land also contravenes Section
31(1)(a) of the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973
and as such, the acquisition proceedings are liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_112">        66. In the light of the findings rendered above, the appellant/writ
petitioner ? society is entitled to succeed in this writ appeal and Issue
Nos.(iii) and (iv) are answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_113">        67. In the result, this writ appal is allowed and the impugned order
dated 10.07.2007 passed in W.P(MD)No.1480 of 2007 is set aside and  
consequently, the notification issued by the first respondent in Notification
No.II(2)/IT/938/2005 under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_184">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,
published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, dated 28.12.2005 and the 
notification issued by the second respondent published in the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette dated 22.02.2006 and the consequential declaration issued 
by the first respondent under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_185">Section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, in
Notification No.II(2)/ITM/453(b)/2006 published in the Tamil Nadu Government
