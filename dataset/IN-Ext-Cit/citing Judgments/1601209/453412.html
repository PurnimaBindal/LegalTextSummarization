</p><p id="p_2">1.		All
these appeals are preferred from the judgment dated 25.6.2007 of
learned  Special Judge (POTA) at Ahmedabad in Special POTA Case No.10
of 2003. Out of  total 19 persons accused in the criminal case, 4
have been absconding and trial of 3 accused persons had been
separated upon the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_1">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a>,
2002 ("POTA",  for short) being  questioned in another
forum.  The remaining 12 accused persons who were tried have been

and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment ranging from 5 years
to life with varying amounts of fine.  With the record of case
running into more than 10,000 pages, learned Special Judge has
delivered an elaborate judgment running into 751 pages.  During the
course of trial,  prosecution examined 122 witnesses and produced and
proved 209 documents, besides 252 other documents which were

2.		Broad
</pre><p id="p_4">contours of the case are that, on 11.3.2003, one Shri Jagdish Tiwari,
Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader of Ahmedabad, was fired at around
9.15 p.m. at his medical shop. His complaint was registered at
Bapunagar Police Station as FIR I-C.R.No.101 of 2003 for the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_4">sections 307</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> of IPC  and <a href="/doc/381226/" id="a_6">section 25</a> (1) (a) (b)
of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_7">Arms Act</a>. In another incident, Shri Haren Pandya, Ex-Home
Minister of the Government of Gujarat, was shot at and found in his
car near Law Garden, Ahmedabad in the early hours of 26.3.2003.
Pursuant thereto, FIR bearing I-C.R.No.272 of 2003 was registered at
Ellisbridge Police Station on the same day and initial investigation 
for two days remained with that police station. With the consent
accorded by the Government of Gujarat vide Notification dated
26.3.2003 and with the consent of the Government of India vide
Cabinet Secretary's Notification dated 28.3.2003, the case was
transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and then the
case was re-registered  by CBI on 28.3.2003. The investigating
officer came to Ahmedabad by flight and started the investigation on
the same date. Then the earlier case of attempt on the life of Shri
Jagdish Tiwari  was also transferred to  CBI  by Notification dated
28.4.2003 of the State Government and Notification dated 29.5.2003 of
the Central Government. Thereafter, these two separate cases
registered by the local police stations were treated as part of the
same conspiracy to strike terror amongst a section of people and one
chargesheet was filed for the criminal case which came to be
registered as Special POTA Case No.10 of 2003. As a larger conspiracy
to strike terror was alleged, provisions of POTA were invoked in the
first case on 11.6.2003  and in the second case of murder of Shri
Pandya on 2.6.2003. The cases were made over to Special Court on
8.9.2003. The Court framed charges (Ex.57) on 11.12.2003 against 15
accused persons for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_8">sections 120-B</a>,
<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_9">302</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_10">307</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_11">201</a> read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_12">section 120-B</a> of IPC, <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_13">sections 25</a> (1-B)(a)
and 27(1) and <a href="/doc/1601096/" id="a_14">section 5</a> of the Arms Act and under <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_15">section 3</a> (1), 3
(2), 3 (3), 3 (4) and 4 of the POTA. The accused persons pleaded not
guilty. The charges under POTA were required to be dropped against
A-15, A-16 and  A-17 at the instance of the Central POTA Review
Committee and further proceeding against them had to be stayed
pursuant to an order of the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.1113
of 2005 in the case of Mohmad Hussain Abdul Rehman Shaikh v. Union of
India.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">3.		After
noting the prosecution case and submissions of learned counsel
appearing on both sides, the trial Court identified the following
issues for its determination:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">"(1)	Whether
the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt  hatching of
conspiracy of killing Hindu leader by the accused alongwith the
absconding accused in the aftermath of Godhra riots to strike terror
in a section of people, viz. Hindus and thereby committed offence
under <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_16">section 3</a> (1) of POTA and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_17">section 120-B</a> of IPC?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">(2)	Whether
the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that an attempt to the
life of Shri Jagdish Tiwari by the accused on dt.11.3.2003 at Tilak
Medical Store, Bapunagar, Ahmedabad was in pursuance of the said
criminal conspiracy with an intention to kill him so as to strike
terror and thus committed an 	offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_18">section 307</a> read with
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_19">section 120-B</a> of IPC and/or under <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_20">section 3</a> (3) of POTA?
</p> 


<p id="p_8">(3)	Whether
the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that in pursuance of
the said criminal conspiracy, A-1 Asgar Ali  committed culpable
homicide amounting to murder of Shri Haren Pandya on dt.26.3.2003 at
Law Garden, Ahmedabad for he being the political leader of  Hindus
and thereby they all committed offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_21">section 302</a> read with
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_22">section 120-B</a> of IPC and/or offence under <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_23">section 3</a> (1) read with
<a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_24">section 3</a> (3) of POTA?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">(4)	Whether
the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused
carried, possessed and used the arms and ammunitions for committing
the aforementioned acts in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy and
thereby committed offences under the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_25">Arms Act</a>?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(5)	Whether
the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt the possession of
unauthorized arms in the notified area and thereby committed the
offence under <a href="/doc/1888373/" id="a_26">section 4</a> of POTA?"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">4.		After
elaborate analysis and discussion of the evidence, it is concluded in
the impugned judgment that prosecution succeeded in proving the
attack with fire arm on Shri Jagdish Tiwari (PW 39) on 11.3.2003 and
in identifying A-1 and A-3 as the persons who, pretending to be
customers, had opened fire at him.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">4.1		As
for the second case of murder of Shri Pandya, the trial Court,
relying upon corroboration by Shri Snehal (CW.1) Ex. 876, believed
the version of sole eye witness, namely, Anilram Yadram Patel (PW 55)
Ex.386; and after elaborate examination of other evidence, opinion of
experts, discovery and recovery of weapons, mobile phone records,
internet communication excerpts, confessions and deposition of the
investigating officer (I.O.),  came to the conclusion that the
offences as aforesaid were committed by the accused persons. The
conclusions of the trial Court are recorded in the following terms:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">	"32.	From
the entire discussion held hereinabove, this 	evidence can be summed
up briefly as follows:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">1.	To
avenge the atrocities perpetrated on the Muslims in the aftermath of
the Godhra incident where hundreds of them lost their lives,
livelihood as well as valuables, religious leaders of Muslim
community used the aroused feelings of youth of this community to
retaliate against the Hindus.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_15">2.	The
incident of burning of coach in Sabarmati Express at Godhra Railway
Station on dt.27.02.2002 resulted into large scale rioting in the
State and an atmosphere of vertical divide between the two
communities could be witnessed. Simultaneously, blasts in AMTS buses
in the routes where dominantly Hindus travelled gave rise to the
feeling of emboldening. As that conspiracy got over with the
commission of the blast and tried separately, the same is not dealt
with in this decision. This had happened with the blessings of
absconding accused Mufti Sufiyan, a cleric at Lal Masjid and his
close associates, some of whom were the straunch (Sic) followers of
this cleric. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_16">3.	It
was since perceived that this fundamentalist movement for avenging
atrocities and creating terror would necessitate proper training in
arms and ammunitions as well as in other fields, the same had been
planned by instigating and persuading the youth from Gujarat and
Hyderabad which had been masterminded by Mufti Sufiyan (A-13)  with
the defamed criminal Rasulkhan Party (A-18)  who made Hyderabad his
base and later on chose to go away to the neighbouring country,
Pakistan. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_17">4.	It
had been repeatedly inculcated into the minds of those who were
imparted the training that the target was to avenge the atrocities on
Muslims in Gujarat and they needed to be in touch with those at
Pakistan and there (Sic) targets were Hindu leaders, some of the
police officers and organizations and structure of economic
importance.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18">5.	A
noted criminal of Hyderabad Asgar Ali (A-1) after his training at
Pakistan was assigned the task of traveling to Gujarat for this very
purpose who remained in constant touch with those who chose to plan
the minutest details in respect of the said criminal conspiracy.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">6.	This
man (A-1) when brought to Ahmedabad, he was shifted to different
places of hideouts, ostensibly on the ground of discomfort and other
issues possibly to see that his identity would not get disclosed
anywhere.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20">7.	All
those who have been charged and against whom the proof has come
before the Court have not necessarily participated
at each stage of hatching the conspiracy and thereafter, executing
the same but different roles had been
assigned to each of them and those who were the kingpins were Mufti
Sufiyan, Rasulkhan Party and Sohailkhan who all have succeeded in
absconding to the neighbouring country and the red-corner notices
issued against each of them coupled with the non-bailable warrants
remain unexecuted till the date. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_21">8.	Others
who lent a major support to the execution of the said conspiracy were
Mulla Kaleem @ Karimi and Anas Machiswala whose strong fundamentalist
beliefs  of Islam drove them to execute the said task with meticulous
exactitudness (Sic).
</p> 
	 


	

 


<p id="p_22">9.	the
leaders of VHP and BJP were named as targets with an intention to
create terror amongst a section of Hindu people who would naturally
become apprehensive on elimination of their leaders one by one. None
of the accused had any personal vengeance towards either of these
victims and they were motivated by ill intentions of spreading terror
in a particular section of society.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_23">10.	It
was virtually kept secret from many of the co-accused even as to from
where this target was being decided, but the same aspect was being
disclosed to some of them by Sohailkhan, who acted in connivance with
Mufti Sufiyan.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_24">11.	The
logistic support had been extended all along by most of these
persons, firstly when Shri Jagdish Tiwari (PW.39) was the target and
thereafter, when the name of Shri Haren Pandya was disclosed and each
conspirator/ co-accused performed his assigned role with amazing
perfection.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_25">12.	Meticulous
and elaborate planning in pursuance of the said conspiracy gets
reflected clearly in chronological stages which can be broadly
summarized in carrying out the reccee (reconnaissance) of the
targets, collection of the arms and ammunitions,  introduction of
assailants with the victims in clandestine manner, providing
assailants with two wheelers, ensuring that they were stolen
vehicles,  changing the number plates of the said vehicles, providing
mobile phones to the accused for remaining in touch with one another
and frequent change of SIM cards, for safeguard of the assailants,
use of three BSNL SIM cards during the commission of murder only,
care taken of changing cloths worn at the time of incident,
collecting weapons and ammunitions back on completion of the task and
their careful hiding, leaving the stolen vehicles at public places
and joining "Jammat" on hearing arrest of some of the
co-accused and entries in fake names at guest houses, hotels and
Muslim Musafirkhana and arrest of many other accused while attempting
to leave in suspicious condition which voluminously and collectively
prove complicity and intention of the accused. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_26">13.	Employment
of scientific tools during investigation to prove handwritings of
accused at hotel and guest house registers through the handwriting
experts, opinion of ballistic expert in matching of crime bullets and
test fired bullets as well as matching of firearm with the bullets
recovered from the body of the injured and the deceased, report of
CFSL and FSL by the biological and Serological Department,
testimonies of CFSL Experts and record maintained by them are strong
corroborative evidences proved by the prosecution. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_27">	It is
sad to conclude that to push the frontiers of 'Jihad' in the country
pretended victimhood has been made a convenient cover to unleash
manufactured rage, with the aim of pointing the criminals as
victims."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_28">5.		It
may be pertinent to note at this stage that there was also registered
a POTA case against some of the accused for bomb blasts  on
29.05.2002 in AMTS (local public transport) buses, which was known as
"tiffin bomb case",  and which was tried as POTA Case
No.7 and 8 of 2003 in which A-6, A-7, A-8, A-9 and A-12 were
acquitted by the POTA Court and no acquittal appeals were filed by
the State; whereas A-4 and A-5 were convicted in that case and their
conviction was not only upheld but this Court had enhanced in appeal
the sentence of imprisonment from ten years to life.  Other POTA
cases for conspiracy without any overt act  were also registered  and
tried as POTA Cases No. 12 of 2003, 2 of 2004 and 2 of 2005  in which
 A-4 to A-12 herein were again convicted. Investigation  in all these
cases really and effectively progressed only after A-6, A-7, A-8  and
A-9 were arrested on 3.4.2003 from a public place on a secret
information. During custodial interrogation of A-6, A-7, A-8 and A-9
after their arrest on 3.4.2003 and recoveries and discoveries being
made at their instance, confessions of all the 12 accused persons
were recorded under <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_27">section 32</a> of POTA between 4.6.2003 to 24.6.2003.
These dates are material insofar as, as noted earlier, POTA was
applied in the case of murder of Shri Pandya on 2.6.2003 and in the
case of attempt on life of Shri Jagdish Tiwari on 21.6.2003. The
confessions were subsequently retracted by all the appellants herein.
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_29">6.		By
now, out of the 12 appellants, A-3 and A-12 have already undergone
their sentence and A-2, convicted only for the offence under <a href="/doc/1292982/" id="a_28">section
3(3)</a> of POTA, has been released on bail by order of the Supreme Court
after undergoing nearly 5 years of imprisonment. A-4 and A-5
sentenced to life imprisonment are also undergoing life imprisonment
upon conviction in the tiffin bomb case. The remaining accused
persons viz. A-1, A-6, A-7, A-8, A-9, A-10 and A-11 are undergoing
life imprisonment pursuant to the present case only , since nearly 8
years, without any parol or furlough, with restraint orders of the
State Government under <a href="/doc/1540813/" id="a_29">section 268</a> of Cr.P.C. Under such
circumstances, it was submitted by learned counsel, on behalf of the
appellants that, without prejudice to their contentions, if the
appeals were partly allowed on merits so as to set aside conviction
for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_30">section 302</a> of IPC and the sentences were
reduced accordingly, the appellants would not and do not insist upon
acquittals or decision on merits regarding convictions for the other
offences. Learned counsel for the respondents have expressed no
objection to acceptance of that submission made on behalf of the
appellants, with the assertion that the impugned judgment was
required to be confirmed in toto. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_30">7.		The
impugned judgment has been assailed by learned counsel for the
appellants, mainly on the following grounds:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_31">(a)	that
the conclusions drawn by the trial Court in the impugned judgment are
perverse, irrational and illegal;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_32">(b)	that
the investigation has been skewed, blinkered and so inept as to
amount to dereliction of duty on the part of the investigating
agency;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_33">(c)	that
material witnesses have not been allowed to depose before the Court
and real facts of the case have not been brought before the Court;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_34">(d)	that
the theory of conspiracy to commit serious offences with a view to
striking terror has been based only on confessions which were
illegally recorded and subsequently retracted; 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_35">(e)	that
the sole eye witness, PW.55, in Shri Haren Pandya murder case could
not have been relied upon in view of inherent contradictions in his
deposition and its inconsistency with the ballistic and medical
evidence; 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_36">(f)	that
the fire arm injuries indicated by post-mortem
report on the body of Shri Haren Pandya could not have been inflicted
by firing five shots from the small opening of glass of the closed
door of Maruti car in which body of the deceased was found; 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_37">8.		Relevant
and important evidence on record, to the extent it is necessary for
appreciating the rival arguments, may now be examined. The sole eye
witness in the second case of murder of Shri Haren Pandya,  applies
his thumb impression for signature and he is described in the
impugned judgment as "rustic". He, namely, Anil Y.Patel,
aged 39, was examined as PW.55 at Ex.386. He, inter alia,
deposed that he was doing his business
from a handcart near Law
Garden and to save it from being taken away by the Municipal
Corporation, he kept his cart (larry) in the compound of "Chitty
Bang"  owned by Nanubhai (CW.1) and slept with it on the night
of 25.3.2003. When he woke up in the morning of 26.3.2003 and washed
his face, he came to the gate of Chitty Bang  and found one
Kanaiyalal, who was attending his  few customers for selling snack. 
After his customers left, Kanaiyalal came face to face with the
witness who remained inside the gate. At that time, the witness saw a
white Maruti car coming from Gajjar Hall Square on his left and it
was parked where the witness used to keep his cart. He deposed that
that car belonged to the deceased and he was alone inside. While the
deceased was rolling up the glass of window of his car, a boyish
person came from the same direction and fired 4 or 5 shots from the
gap which was still open while the deceased was rolling up the glass.
He deposed  that Shri Pandya fell on his back and his legs went up.
He shouted "what are you doing" and "Kanaiya flee,
Kanaiya flee". Thereupon, Kanaiyalal fled with his larry and
the assailant fled back towards Gajjar Hall  Square. One Ramesh, who
used to clean the area with his broom, came running to the witness to
ask what had happened. According to the witness, the assailant might
be aged between 25 and 30 and his height might be around  5ft. 6
inches,  his face was neither dark nor fair and he was dishevelled 
while his hair were combed on both sides with a pleat  in the middle.
He was lean,  having a  long moustache  and deep-set eyes. His cheeks
were curving inside  and his chin and neck were long. He was wearing
a coffee-colour shirt and upper part of his body was seen by the
witness. Then the witness sat in the compound of Chitty Bang for half
an hour and then went towards the other gate
 of Thakorbhai Desai Hall which opened towards Gajjar Hall Square.
There one Shukla Chacha was sitting in his rikshaw. The witness told
him that Shri Haren Pandya has been killed and asked him to call
police to whom he can talk or he may be accompanied to a police post.
But  Shukla Chacha replied that he had seen the house of Nanubhai
(CW.1) and they were going there. Then they went to CW.1's house and
he told Nanubhai that Shri Haren Pandya was killed by 4 or 5 shots at
the place where he was keeping his larry. Nanubhai asked them to take
tea which was ready and told them that he would be reaching Law
Garden. When the witness returned to Law Garden, police had already
arrived  as also many other people. Then Shri Haren Pandya was
shifted to V.S.Hospital by carrying him in a jeep. At around 2.00 -
2.30  in the afternoon some policemen from Ellisbridge Police Station
and someone in plain dress had come to ask questions. On the third
day from the incident, he was brought by CBI officers to Law Garden
and he had shown where he was standing and where the Maruti car was
parked. A map was prepared on that basis and the witness had put his
thumb impression thereon. After about one-and-half months thereof, he
was called for identification parade and he had caught A-1, after
taking a round around him.

<p id="p_38">8.1		During
his cross-examination, PW.55, inter alia,
deposed that there were two cars already parked when he was talking
to Kanaiyalal and one of them was Shri Haren Pandya's car. He deposed
that when he had returned to Law Garden on that day, he had seen the
body of Shri Haren Pandya being taken away in the police jeep in a
reclining position. He categorically deposed that when he had come to
the gate and was talking to Kanaiya in the morning,  no car had come
and one or two cars were
already parked there. He had stated before the CBI that he had asked
Shukla Chacha to call Nanubhai as he wanted to tell him that Shri
Haren Pandya was shot. He confirmed that Shri Pandya had bent over on
the front seat itself. He deposed that he had seen the front
windscreen of the  car  of Shri Pandya  as it had come in front of
him and had not seen the glasses of the sides. He conceded that a
police post was there just behind Law Garden, but he did not go there
as he was scared. Nanubhai also  did not propose to go to the police
station with him.  When contradicted with his statement before  CBI 
about the legs of Shri Haren Pandya going up upon being shot, he
deposed that  knees of Shri Pandya had come up. When asked whether he
could see the knees below the steering wheel, he replied that he
could see his clothes after he fell. He deposed by himself that he
and his brother alternatively stayed at home and at the Chitty Bang
near their larry. He admitted that in the premises of Thakorebhai
Desai Hall in which Chitty Bang was situated, there was a regular
watchman and though he used to keep the keys of Chitty Bang, he was
not paid any wages  and he did not know the address of its owner
Nanubhai (CW.1). In reply to the specific question as to whether the
car of the deceased  came for parking in front of him, he replied
that the car was parked at about 20 to 30 degrees from where he was
standing and the car had not come near the gate of Chitty Bang.  He
conceded that after returning to Law Garden, he was at Chitty Bang in
the afternoon  between 1.00 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.and police was also
there, but when the police was questioning him at 2.30 p.m., the
Maruti car was not at its place.  He deposed that he could clearly
see the face of Shri Haren Pandya from the windscreen and then, when
asked about bleeding from his neck,
he stated that he had not seen the face of Shri Pandya at all and had
seen only the  portion of his chest and  knees. When confronted with
the photograph of the car, showing opening of the glass, he confirmed
that glass was in the same state of being nearly closed and
categorically stated that the assailant fired at Shri Pandya from
outside the car.  He deposed that he never went to the driver's side
of the car and only saw Shri Pandya from the front windscreen and
went away to the cross-road after having seen that Shri Pandya was
wearing white kurta with red lining in it. He also stated that he had
not seen kurta of the deceased becoming red with blood. He also
categorically deposed that he had seen that Shri Pandya had died and
he had told the same thing to Shukla Chacha. He was also categorical
in deposing that he had walked away from the spot after witnessing
the scene of offience and chosen to sit on the other side of the
compound. He stated that Shri Haren Pandya had a heavy body and
height of about 6 ft. He stated to have seen the face of the
assailant as he was standing at the  gate which is above the ground
level by one-and-half feet.  He stated that he had known Shri Pandya
and had joined a rally which had marched to his house about 8-10
years ago. He denied that the CBI and the police had shown him any
sketch of the assailant made on the basis of his description given by
him. He further stated that after 4-5 days of the incident, he had
gone away to his village in U.P. and returned after about 20 days. He
denied the suggestions to the effect that he had not seen the offence
at all and he was evasive in his replies when questioned in the
cross-examination about identification of A-1 at the time of test
identification parade.  It was noted by the Court recording the
deposition that the witness had taken about 3-4 minutes in the court
in identifying A-1. He categorically denied that Nanubhai had made
any phone calls while he had gone to his place and conceded that
Nanubhai had come to Chitty Bang  at 02.30 p.m. He denied that
Nanubhai was asked to  provide a witness, but he conceded that on the
date of the incident, he had not stayed over for the night and kept
his larry closed for next 3-4 days.  He also conceded that police had
afterwards called Kanaiya and his employer by sending a car and he
had also called the sweeper who had come running to him immediately
after the incident.  He deposed that he could not read even figures
and he could not tell the time by looking at a watch. He conceded
that the larry stationed at  Law Garden was the source of his
livelihood and maintenance of his family.  He also conceded that he
continued to do his business by keeping his larry at the same spot,
but he denied that he was under threat of removal of his larry if he
did not depose according to the instructions of police. He stated
that his larry was taken away at least twice afterwards and if the
police or officers of Municipal Corporation were to remove or take
away the larries from that area, they would not spare anyone. 
Remarkably, the time of the offence was revealed by the witness only
in reply to a leading question in his cross-examination by saying
that it was true that he had stated that Shri Pandya's car had
arrived at around 7.30 a.m.   And there was nothing in his deposition
to suggest that Shukla Chacha even asked or that he told him how the
offence was committed. Nor is it deposed that the witness went near
the car to peep into the car to identify the occupant or check
whether he was still alive.

<p id="p_39">9.		Some
corroboration to the above sole eye-witness is sought from the
witness called by the Court as CW.1 (Ex.876), who
is Snehal @ Nanubhai Edenwala, running the business of children's
amusement park called  "Chitty Bang" in the compound of
Thakorbhai Desai Hall. According to his deposition, both his security
guards were on leave on 26.3.2003. Anil (PW.55) was keeping his
larries at his place since 4 years and slept thereat. Anil and Yogesh
Shukla had visited his home between 9.15 to 9.30 a.m. on 26.3.2003
and Anil had told him that somebody had killed Shri Haren Pandya in
his car by firing bullets at him. Then he made a call to his friend
Shri Mukesh Dave who happened to be an office-bearer of All Gujarat
Transport Association and also a friend of Shri Haren Pandya. Then he
called one  Shri Hiten Vasant who was also a common friend.  Then
Anil and Shukla had taken tea prepared by his wife and after 30-45
minutes of stay, Anil and Shukla had left. Thereafter he received a
call from the police department at 2.00 p.m. whereupon he went to his
place of business. He deposed that he found Police Inspector shri
Shaikh as well as many other policemen in plain dress and uniform.
According to him, Police Inspector Shri Shaikh did not record his
statement then, but CBI had recorded his statement at his office
after 4 days. He, however, also deposed that one person in plain
clothes had recorded his statement, but had not taken his signature
thereon. In his cross-examination, CW.1 admitted that he was B.Com,
LL.B and running the amusement park worth about 30 lakh rupees; and
because a few friends whom he had called were more resourceful, he
had not himself informed the police about the incident.  He could not
recollect before the Court that in his statement before the CBI, he
had stated that  Anil had told him that when he was sitting on the
bench, he had also seen one man running away.

<p id="p_40">9.1		Pursuant
to the above deposition, towards the fag-end of the trial, learned
Advocate for A-4 to A-9 and A-12 had made an application dated
8.2.2007 (Ex.878) praying to call for the statement of CW.1 allegedly
recorded on 26.3.2003. And, that application was rejected by the
order below it with the observation as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_41">"As
rightly pointed out in the application moved today by the Ld.
Advocate for the defence, the Court Witness No.1 Snehal did mention
the recordance of his statement on the date of incident by an officer
whom he believed was from Crime Branch because of his plain clothes.
However, the Court shall also have to look at the evidence of the
prosecution and even in principle agreeing to the submissions of Ld.
Advocate  for the defence that utterances of the I.O. cannot be taken
as decisive in the matter as the probative value of the entire
evidence shall have to be regarded by the Court at the time of
finally concluding all these points raised before the Court, but at
the same time with specific questioning also, when there is specific
denial on the part of both the I.Os, PW.101 and PW.120 that no such
statement having been recorded by any officer of theirs and Crime
Branch not being involved in investigating into the matter, the Court
is of the opinion that the request to institute an inquiry on the
point is not warranted and on cumulative reading of the evidence, if
the Court comes to the conclusion of requirement of drawing of
adverse inference due to deliberate attempt on the part of the
prosecuting agency suppressing any material coming before the
Court, the same can be held at an appropriate juncture, but with
specific denial on the part of the senior and experienced officers of
police and CBI also coming on record, the powers u/s.166 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31">Cr.P.C</a>.
need not be caused to be exercised and
hence, this application deserves to be rejected."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_42">		It
may be noted in the above context that PW.101 (Ex.607), Shri Yusuf
Shaikh, Police Inspector, had categorically deposed beforehand on
28.7.2006 that he had recorded statement of Nanubhai (CW.1) on
26.3.2003. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_43">9.2		CW.2
(Ex.880), Javed Siraj, DSP, CBI, deposed  that it was on 30.3.2003
that Snehal's  statement was recorded by him between  1.00 to 2.00
p.m.  Investigating Officer Shri Gupta had particularly asked him to
record  statement of CW.1. He was not given any material or statement
of CW.1 recorded previously and he was told by Shri Gupta that since
his shop was near the place of incident, he should go and talk to
him. He admitted that Nanubhai had told him in his statement that
"Anil ne bataya Haren Pandya ko goli lagi hai aur woh
car mei ulta hoke pade hai".
</p><p id="p_44">According to PW.4 (Ex.159), panchnama (Ex.160)  of the car was made
at 2.30 p.m. on 26.3.2003 and a mobile phone in vibration and working
mode alongwith a key-chain with two keys were found below the seat
adjoining the driving seat of the Maruti car. It was also measured
and noted that the distance between  front-wheel of the car and 
steel railing of the compound of Thakorbhai Desai Hall  was 7 ft. 10
inches.  The crime scene visit report of the Mobile Forensic Science
Laboratory (Ex.774), inter alia,
stated that 7 officers of F.S.L., including a photographer, reached
the scene of offence  at 13.20 on 26.3.2003 and had thoroughly
examined the crime scene.  On
examination of the car,  reddish brown stains were observed on the
co-driver seat of the car. Preliminary chemical tests of that reddish
brown stain revealed the presence of blood.
The scratch marks and impact marks on the car were examined
thoroughly. Reddish brown stains were also observed on the key of
that car which was found on the floor of the car near the co-driver
seat. Primary chemical test of that reddish brown stain revealed the
presence of blood. The inner and outer sides of that car were
chemically tested at few places for the presence of residues of fired
ammunition; but presence of residues of fired ammunition could not be
detected. Bullet, cartridges, cartridge cases, fired ammunition, fire
arms or their parts were not found in the car or near the surrounding
open place.

<p id="p_45">9.3		Radheshyam
 (PW.85), Ex.509,  Police Constable, was patrolling in Navrangpura
Police Station  area with Police Inspector Shri R.B.Chauhan on
26.3.2003. Upon receiving a message from the control-room to go to
Law Garden as something had happened there,  they reached the spot
and found that  there were 5-7 persons near the Maruti car of Shri
Pandya and a person was lying in the car. When 5-6 policemen dragged
out the deceased, he recognized him as Shri Harenbhai Pandya. They
rushed him to V.S.Hospital in the vehicle used by them for
patrolling. He deposed that glass of the driver's side window of the
Maruti car was open to the extent of 8 inches. Then he deposed that
it was open by about 4 inches and then confirmed that it was as open
as appearing in the photograph of the car (Mark 101/D/193/3). He had
found the body in the car in such position that the head and the
shoulder had slided on to the seat adjacent to the driver's seat; and
 the legs were slightly pulled up from the knees. Upon being asked
about bleeding from the body, he deposed that there was blood on the
neck which had trickled from right to left. He further stated that
while transferring the body from the car to their jeep, he had not
received any blood spot on his hands or clothes; and Shri Pandya was
made to sit on the front seat of the jeep, but nowhere had any blood
dropped from the body. He also deposed that till Shri Pandya was
placed in the stretcher at the hospital, there were sports shoes  on
his legs. He confirmed that the car was in the same position as shown
in the aforesaid photograph and its glasses having sunfilm, one could
not look inside.

<p id="p_122">11.		Dr.Pratik
R.Patel, Professor and Head, Forensic Medicine Department,
V.S.Hospital (Ex.176), inter alia, deposed that, out of six
entry wounds on the body of Shri Pandya,  five bullets were there;
one bullet might have gone out of the body or there might be re-entry
of the bullet. He admitted that he had not mentioned the estimated
time of death in the P.M.Note, but in his statement given to CBI, he
had mentioned that 5 to 6 hours prior to performance of post-mortem
, the death might have occurred.  He opined that: "...if
hand is reflexly kept in front of face or neck region on right side 
that back of hand if facing the opposite side of the victim, bullet
may re-enter from the external injury No.1 of column No.17".
 He also opined that: "It cannot be said whether it was
re-entry or the first entry".  In reply to the question:
"What would be the parameter to judge whether external
injury No.1 is in fact an original entry or re-entry?  he
admitted that blackening was seen on skin surrounding injury No.1,
which was on the neck. He admitted that shape of injury No.6 was not
mentioned.  Referring to X-ray plates, he opined that due to poor
quality of X-ray, it would be difficult for him to say as to which
plate shows injury No.1 in it.  Referring to X-ray No.8, he admitted
that he could not see any fracture in the wrist. Referring to injury
No.6, he admitted that the lacerated wound was going obliquely
downward, and it meant that it was going from near the elbow towards
the wrist.  He, however, insisted that injury No.5 was communicating
with external injury No.6. As for injury No.1, he opined that:
"....the weapon could be on front, right and above of the
external injury. It should be three dimensional as right side at
upper level above the external injury No.1 and in front of the
external injury No.1.  Upper left pointing downward track is
mentioned which is going downward to the left and back as the track
of the injury has been shown to be going downward, backward and to
the left."   The following questions and answers were
crucial:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_123">"160
 Q	What is your view with regard to the injury No.7 ?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_124">          A	In
this case, track of the bullet was directed upward, slightly right
and backward. It depends on the position of a person, whether
standing, sitting or inclining. In this, weapon should be on front,
slightly left at the level below the scrotum. 
</p>
 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">164  </span>
<p id="p_125">Q	With regard to the Injury No.7, irrespective of the position of the
victim, sitting or standing, the assailant will have to be in front
left and beneath?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_126">          A	Yes."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_127">		The
above part of the deposition of an expert in Forensic Medicine was
put to  critical examination by learned counsel for the appellants to
submit that injury No.1 could not have been caused by re-entry of a
bullet and injury No.5 and 6 could not have communicated with each
other. It was also submitted that injury No.7 was not only improbable
but impossible to be caused if the victim was sitting in the driving
seat of the car and the assailant was firing from outside through the
slight opening of glass of the window of the car. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_128">11.1
	Dr.M.Narayan Reddy, Professor and Head of the Department of
Forensic Medicine, Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad, was examined
as DW.6 (Ex.848). He was  M.D.in Forensic Medicine and doing his LL.M
 at the time of deposing.  According to his opinion, with the help of
the  given photograph, the opening of the window on driver's side 
was  coming roughly to 3 inches, i.e. 7.5 cms and 2 inches  on the
front border. Keeping that in view, he tried to find out whether the
injuries on the deceased were feasible in the given situation. He
opined that injury No.1 and 2 were possible.  Injury No.3 and 4 were
at a lower level, 5 cms below the nipple on the skin, whereas the
entry wound inside the chest wall  were at the 4th space
corresponding to the nipple area. So, those injuries went upward to
enter into the chest area and then they  crossed to the left side of
the chest behind the heart and fell in the chest cavity.  So, in his
opinion, injury No.3 and 4  were not possible in the situation.
Injury No.7 was possible only when the barrel of the gun muzzle was
directing to the lower border of the scrotum and the back bone was in
one direction,  then only it was possible because it was lodged near
the right shoulder blade behind the 4th and 5th
ribs. So, the barrel of the gun, lower border of the scrotum and the
back bone had to be in one line to cause that injury.  It was
possible in  two situations, viz.  (i)  if the victim stood at a
higher plane, the assailant stood below him and fired in the upward
direction  directing towards the scrotum; or (ii) if the victim lay
down on his back on a cot or a table with his legs apart and
assailant standing on the left leg side had fired.  He clearly
deposed that injury No.7 was not possible in any other position.  He
also opined that injury No.5 had no exit wound.  Without fracturing
the base of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpel bone and
carpel bone  of the wrist joint, lower ends of the forearm bones, it
cannot communicate with injury No.6. So, the bullet which had caused
injury No.5 must be available at the scene of offence. Injury No.6 is
on the front of the right forearm directed above, downwards and right
to left. It was suspected  that the holes in the sleeve of the shirt
had blackening, hence it could be a separate bullet wound, which
bullet must have been present at the scene of offence, according to
his opinion. He stated that a computerized picture of  the closed
window was taken and enlarged marks of the glass frame came to about
12 cms and the opening was slightly less than 2 cms.  So, it was less
than 1/6th of the total width of the closed frame. When
actual width of Maruti 800  glass was measured, it was 44 cms, 1/6th
of which coming to a little more than 7 cms.  He further opined that
through that opening of the glass,  only the barrel of a gun could
enter. He did not agree that injury No.6 was an exit wound. He was
specifically asked questions in cross-examination, as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_129">"56.
</p><p id="p_130">   Q	Do you agree that when an injured involuntarily fell, the left
side leg came up and the left leg was raised more than the right leg
and bullet hit left testis, passed from left to right and on the back
side?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_131">            A	No.
</p><p id="p_132">I do not agree. In my opinion, it would completely hide the scrotum
in between the thighs."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_133">		Upon
a question being lastly put to him by the Court, he replied:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_134">"67.
</p><p id="p_135">    	On being inquired as to the injury No.7 is possible inside the
car, I would say that if a person inside the front seat of the car
lies on his back or has fallen down on his
back, if the buttock comes near to the
right edge of the driver's seat and legs apart, then it is possible.
So the door must be open and legs must come out and thighs must
project out then only it is possible to straight way strike the
scrotum."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_136">12.		During
the course of trial, learned Special Judge (POTA) appears to have
called the Maruti car (Article No.15 - belonging to the
deceased) in the premises of the City Civil and Sessions Court and
carried out its inspection in the presence of prosecution and
defence. As no memorandum of the aforesaid inspection was prepared
and it was so divulged before the appellants on 07.2.2007, learned
Advocate for A.4 - A.9 and A.12 made an application (Ex.877) on
08.2.2007 praying to eschew all record of that inspection and the
arguments  based thereon. It was, inter alia,  contended in
the application that matters of medical evidence had to be put to the
relevant witness while he is in the witness box and the Court cannot
explore possibilities not put to them;  that the doctor conducting
the post-mortem had categorically stated that he had not even
noted the tracks of injury Nos.5 and 6; that no text had been put to
DW-6 on any of the facts to contradict him;  that until PW.8 had come
into witness-box, there was no material brought forth by the
prosecution with regard to  the position of body; that inspection of
the car unaccompanied by written memorandum was unacceptable and
hence the inspection done on 25.1.2007 and any arguments based
thereon could not be taken on record.  Learned Special Judge (POTA)
rejected that application with the observations, inter alia,
as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_137">".....As
per the case of the prosecution, the murder of Mr.Haren Pandya,
Ex-Home Minister, Gujarat took place allegedly inside Mruti Car
parked at Law Garden opposite Thakorbhai Desai Hall. Different
witnesses of the prosecution have spoken of different openings of the
window glass of the impugned vehicle from where, according to the
prosecution, firing had taken place with the firearm resulting into
death  of the victim.  The evidence of defence witnesses also have
been led so as to deal with the evidence of prosecution, oral as well
as documentary, which includes the photographs submitted alongwith
the papers of chargesheet".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_138">"For
appreciating the submissions of both the sides and the ones being
made by Ld.Advocate Mr.Gupta more effectively, the Court deemed it
necessary to inspect this Maruti Car seized by the prosecution being
the case property No.15 (muddamal) and on giving sufficient notice to
both the sides for the said inspection of Maruti 800 Car, in presence
of Ld. Sp.P.Ps. and the Ld. Advocates for defence as well as CBI
officers, the Court had inspected on 25.01.2007 the said motor car in
the Court compound of City Civil Court and both the sides had
assisted the Court to understand their respective stands. Although
Ld. Advocate Ms.Nitya Ramakrishnan had completed their final
submissions on every point, in view of this inspection, the Court had
deemed it just to avail an opportunity to both the sides to further
address the Court on this inspection, if they chose to so to do it
and Ld. Advocate Mr.Verma and LA Mr.Vatsa, LA assisting Ld.
Sr.Advocate Ms.Nitya Ramakrishnan to argue on the subject after
consulting her and they accordingly made a request to adjourn the
matter for her submissions and Ld. Sp.P.P. had made his submissions
in respect of the same". 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_139">"	Over
and above other detailed submissions, Ld. Sp.P.P. has submitted that
<a href="/doc/386019/" id="a_32">Section 310</a> of Cr.P.C. would not apply in the instant case as it is
not the local place of occurrence for this car being the case
property No.15 and therefore, no question arises of recordance of
memorandum....".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_140">"	......It
needs to be noted down that in stricto senso,  this was not a spot
inspection that the Court had undertaken where
the Court is duty bound to record a memorandum of relevant fact
observed at such spot inspection without unnecessary delay under the
law, but it was an inspection of case property seized during
investigation (muddamal article) inside which the alleged offence has
taken place and therefore, even if not going by the letter but by
spirit of <a href="/doc/386019/" id="a_33">Section 310</a> of Cr.P.C., if it is construed to be article
vital for appreciating submissions of both sides on evidence that has
come on record, what all the Court had to note down was that it had
inspected the vehicle to understand different possibilities put forth
before it and its feasibility and the Court  had noted down the fact
of this inspection in the Rojkam of dt. 25.01.2007, which is held by
the Apex Court as a mirror of the Court functioning on criminal
side........"

12.2		Shri
 Ashok Raj Arora (PW.75), Ex.440, Senior Scientific Officer
(Ballistics) to the Government of India, had deposed that three holes
on the front side and three holes on the right sleeve near the cuff
were observed on kurta and one hole was observed on pant with
corresponding hole on underwear; and all could have been caused by
passage of .32 bullets fired from close range and gun shot residue
was detected on the margins of all the holes. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_145">12.3		The
father of the deceased had made an application (Ex.855) dated
15.12.2006 making the grievance that Mr.Nilesh Bhatt, P.A.to the
deceased was not called before the Court to unearth the truth.  The
application, inter alia, stated: "It is a matter of
surprising shock that CBI officers could not search out my son's
wallet and  important diary he used to carry with him &amp; the shoes
he used to wear are missing. ....." That application was
rejected by a detailed order, after hearing learned counsel, with the
observations, inter alia, as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_146">"......His
examination u/s. 311 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_34">Cr.P.C</a> also may not serve any purpose as 
allegations or averments need the basis of facts for the court of law
to act  upon at any stage.......
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_147">"Two
of the defence experts have voiced a different possibility with
regard to the injuries found on the person of deceased supporting the
defence theory and statement of P.A. to late Shri Haren Pandya
directed to be brought on the record at the instance of defence does
not lead anywhere on the issue  however, evidence shall have to be
appreciated as a whole at an appropriate stage but  for the present,
nothing is with the Court to invoke  powers u/s. 319  or u/s. 173 (8)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35">
of  Code</a> of Criminal Procedure". 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_148">		An
earlier application of the father of the deceased (Exh.856)
dt.21.11.2006  insisting upon inclusion of his name in the list of
witnesses was also rejected by order dated 27.11.2006 on the ground
that third party had no locus standi in a criminal trial.  And
yet another application (Exh.898) dtd.26.3.2007 annexing a press
report printed in Asian Age dtd.27.3.2003 was also rejected. It was
argued for the appellants, on the basis of the above record, that the
investigating agency had not followed the clues offered in the press
report and had not investigated on any alternative theory which could
have solved the mystery of murder of Mr.Haren Pandya.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_149">12.4		It
may be pertinent to make a passing reference to confessional
statement of A-1 at this stage, even as the probative value of
confessional statements is discussed in detail hereafter. In his
confessional statement (Exh.253),  which was subsequently retracted,
A-1 is supposed to have stated, inter alia, that  when
Mr.Haren Pandya had opened the bottle for drinking water, after
parking the car, he approached the car and fired five bullets on him
from the window of which glass was slightly open.  Then, while
returning as a pillion rider to  Yunus (A-6), he asked Yunus as to
how many bullets were fired by him and Yunus replied  that he had
fired four bullets. Then he told him that he had fired five bullets
and not four; and from near a bridge on his way he had informed
Sohail (A-14) on his mobile phone that the job was done. In the
confession of Yunus (A-6 - Ex.233), it was, inter alia, 
confirmed that on their way, after his having heard firing of four or
five bullets, A-1 had asked him as to how many bullets he had fired;
he had told him that he thought four bullets were fired, whereupon
A-1 had told him that he thought that he had fired five bullets. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_150">12.5		The
prosecution found corroboration to the above self-incriminating
evidence from the call record of mobile phones supposed to have been
held by the main accused persons and there is evidence that a call
was recorded at 7:33 a.m. on 26.3.2003 at the tower catering to the
area of 3 sq. kms. which included Law Garden area. That call was from
the mobile phone  supposed to have been held by A-1 on that date to
A-14; and such other previous and subsequent communication among the
accused persons has been presented as evidence of co-ordination and
conspiracy.
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_151">12.6		The
dress worn at the time of his death by Shri Pandya, being Muddamal
Article No.19, was examined by this Court during the course of
arguments and in presence of learned counsel on both sides. It was
undisputably found that there were 3 holes on the right hand sleeve
above the cuff in the kurta of Shri Pandya and it had white and light
or faded brown vertical stripes. There were wide and large smudges of
blood on the left shoulder  and right sleeve indicating profuse
bleeding and bloodstains on the back of the kurta. And the bottom
part of left leg of the pajama (pants) had a large bloodstain
indicating bleeding from injury No.7.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_152">13.		Dealing
with the above evidence, learned special Judge (POTA) observed that
it was simply not possible not to accept the version of   solitary
eye witness, as  "His testimony, when scrutinized thoroughly
and critically with dispassionate judicial scrutiny   at a touchstone
of all the possibilities suggested by the defence,  it is still found
to have passed the test of being truthful, dependable and more than
convincing."  In the opinion of the Court, CW.1
corroborated in a major way the deposition of PW.55. Although some
contradictions were found in his deposition, in the opinion of the
Court, he had sufficiently and satisfactorily answered the questions
put to him at the request of the defence.  As for the choice of the
prosecution not to examine wife of Shri Haren Pandya, Kanaiyalal and
Yogesh Shukla, the Court observed: "
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_153">"  ..........It
is not feasible to endorse the submission of defence that by not
allowing these witnesses to come before the Court, the
prosecution has failed in its duty in bringing the truth before the
Court as it is absolutely the choice of the prosecution whether it
chooses to adduce the evidence of a particular fact through
one witness or more than one as <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_36">Section 134</a> of Evidence Act
makes it abundantly clear that no particular number of witnesses
shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact....."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_154">		The
Court further observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_155">"	.....It,
of course, apparently looks strange that in the area of Law Garden
where many morning walkers come daily and where at a little distance
away the school and college with morning hours are also situated on
the main road which is the road going to Paldi on one side and
Mithakhali on the side, for the incident of morning at 7.30 a.m., not
before 10.30 a.m. the police could  come to know about the
occurrence. This fact is also so much harped upon and twisted by the
defence so as to argue that Shri Haren Pandya was killed elsewhere
and his body was brought at law Garden and that is the reason why his
dead body had skipped the notice of people and it was PW.55 who
noticed him (his body) at around 9.30 a.m".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_156">"	This
defence on close probe holds no ground at all. It must be firmly held
in terms that this theory has no basis as the prosecution has
succeeded in discharging its burden of proving
that the incident has taken place at Law Garden and nowhere else.
Even otherwise, it is a matter of common sense that if a person with
the stature of Shri Haren Pandya is to be killed by any person away
from the public place, the assailant or killer certainly would not be
so unintelligent or duffer so as to bring his body to the Law Garden
in his own car, which would be otherwise familiar to the people in
that area particularly when the fact of
his going for a morning walk at Law Garden was known to many so as to
create evidence against himself.  It is hopelessly absurd to suggest
such a theory. If the killing has taken
place in secrecy, the body would be thrown
or hidden at an obscure place somewhere away from public eyes and
would not be brought in the mid of the town. The only valid purpose
for examination of Smt.Jagruti Pandya could have served was to have
averted such absurd theory to come before the Court for dealing with
the same. Furthermore, the pattern of injury on the person of Shri
Pandya  is a classical example of closed place murder which of course
shall be discussed at an appropriate stage...."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_157">		Discussing
the evidence further, the Court observed: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_158">"	.....The
Court must also remember the fact that the glasses of back seats of
Maruti Car were rolled up and that of co-driver's seat was only 2
inches down and a considerable part of driver's seat glasses was
rolled up which are all dark glasses. Even on the window shield, the
whole strip (Patto) is of dark glass. Considering the situation of
the vehicle, which was having its front towards the wall of
Thakorebhai Desai Hall, if somebody was lying on the seat, it would
not be possible for the passers by to notice anything unusual nor
would it make feasible for anybody to see this lying position of the
person.		........Again with the parking of vehicles being very common
around Law Garden by the morning walkers, it is not at all strange
for anyone not to peep inside the vehicle without there being any
trace of unusual thing outside the vehicle and in absence of any
intimation of such occurrence.  ............The Court simply cannot
disregard and/or discard their testimonies  only because it is
difficult to digest the fact that in a gross incident like the
present one, the police was not immediately contacted by the eye
witness.    ............On appreciating evidence with the strictest
yardstick, the Court is of the opinion that the deposition of both
these witnesses need be held to be truthful, dependable and cogent 
and the same cannot be permitted to be attacked as concocted,
unpalatable and contrary to other evidence of prosecution. 
	.........Moreover, it was only at the time of hearing of final
submissions that the Court has chosen to examine CW.1  who had been
dropped by the prosecution and whose statement had been recorded soon
after the incident in question by the prosecuting agency.  He not
only corroborated the version of PW.55, but threw light on many other
aspects making the deposition of PW.55 more comprehensive."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_159">13.1		Referring
to the deposition of Radheshyam (PW.85), the Court observed:
</p> 

<p id="p_160">"...........He
is specific that opening of glass on driver's side was about 7.5 to 8
inches almost of the measurement of a palm.  He of course, on
verifying the photograph (Mark-D/101-193/3) (Exh.617)  for the window
glass on driver's side, ratified that position of window.  
	........The door when was opened from towards the driver side, he
found head and shoulder of Shri Haren Pandya lying on the co-driver's
seat and his legs were little up from the knee. 	........Deposition
of this witness would be vital as he has detailed the manner in which
the body was found inside the vehicle and removed from the car. He
also is firm on the point that sports shoes were on till removed to
V.S.Hospital on stretcher. And, as they are not found by
Investigating Officer thereafter, this gave rise to a serious
contention that this is done for suppressing some vital facts,
although, it appears to be an attractive contention at a first blush,
it does not hold ground  in fact. This surely cannot be a deliberate
act of Investigating Officer who himself was keen to unreveal  (Sic)
the mystery of murder  and in a huge crowd at hospital, if shoes get
lost, it cannot be attributed to Investigating officer by imputing
ill intention......"
</p> 


<p id="p_161">13.2		Referring
to PW.4,  a panch witness to the scene of offence panchnama, it is
noted in the impugned judgment that the Panch had identified muddamal
article No.16, i.e.  mobile phone and other articles.  Incoming,
outgoing and missed calls were not noted down when the mobile phone
was seized. There was no blood found on the driver's seat, but on the
co-driver's seat he found blood and at no other place blood could be
found.  The scene of offence was preserved by Police Inspector Shri
Chauhan and within three hours of Shri  Haren Pandya's  removal to
the hospital, panchnama was drawn.
</p> 
	 



 


<p id="p_162">13.3		The
deposition of DW.6  was dealt with by the Court with the following
observations:
</p> 

<p id="p_163">".......He
was unable to give any instance in 50 cases where he appeared as
defence witness and having given any adverse opinion disfavouring the
accused.	.......Believing  that PW.55, PW.85 and PW.101 have ratified
the photograph shown to them, but the same cannot be equated with the
written document, the contents of which would be unequivocal inasmuch
as it is a matter of interpretation of photograph and the same cannot
be falling under <a href="/doc/1039145/" id="a_37">Section 94</a> of Evidence Act. On the contrary, opening
from the photograph is required to be interpreted and since it is a
matter of visual assessment, the same shall depend on capacity of
interpretation of an individual. None of these witnesses has
challenged on their individual assessment with specific suggestion of
this opening of window being only 3 inches and not 6 to 8 inches as
deposed by each of them and there is a scope of oral depositions and
the said scope cannot be excluded either on mere ratification of
photograph or on the commentaries relied upon of Phipson or on the
basis of provisions of <a href="/doc/1039145/" id="a_38">Section 94</a> of the Evidence Act." 
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_164">13.4		Referring
to deposition of PW.20, the Court observed:
</p> 


<p id="p_165">"CMO
Dr.Kuldeep Joshi (PW.20), Ex.224, deposed about the injury on neck 
and pulse was not palpable and blood pressure was not recordable at
11.00 a.m.  He saw injury on the right side of base of neck and
clothes of the patient were blood stained, though blood was not
flowing  from any part of the body. He had started cardiopulmonary
resuscitation  and continued the same for nearly an hour and at 12
noon, in concurrence and advice of experts,  Mr.Haren Pandya was
declared dead. Recording of body temperature necessary to assess the
time of death was not done, but the doctor replied that things which
were more important had to be given priority than certain basic
things. Though the estimated time of occurrence of death was not
mentioned in the P.M.Report, it was deposed by Dr.P.R.Patel (Ex.176) 
to be approximately 5-6 hours prior to the post-mortem.  Photograph
and videograph  was not done of the post-mortem examination  as there
was no such practice".
</p> 


	
<p id="p_166">	It is noted in the impugned judgment that: "Had there been
photography and videography of the clothes and injuries as well as of
the process of post-mortem, that would have saved  lot of time of the
Court as that would have precluded giving rise to many issues which
are required to be answered only because of non-availability of
either photographs or viedograph."  
</p>
 


 
 


 


<p id="p_167">13.5		Dealing
with the arguments of the defence based on seven bullet-wounds and
recovery of only five bullets, absence of blood-stains in the car,
perpendicular strike of the bullets and the scrotum wound with the
bullet travelling upwards, the Court quoted, after referring to many
judgments, the words of the I.O. (PW.120) that: ".....What
must have happened as it appears is that after hitting by first four
injuries, Mr.Haren Pandya would have had involuntarily fallen on the
seat adjacent to the driver's seat.  When fallen on the left side,
his legs automatically would come up and the moment his leg had come
up, left leg must have come up more than the right and in this
imbalance between the right leg and left leg, the bullet has hit the
left testis first, which is passing left to right and goes on the
back side. When a man falls, his whole body for a moment would go up
and because of gravitation, it would come down and that is the way,
it can be explained and he was, therefore, satisfied that the
P.M.Report is consistent with other evidence."  As for
injury No.7, the Court observed: "....With the direction
taken by the bullet, even if the right lower limb comes up slightly
because of the jerk of falling body on the opposite side, then also,
scrotal area would become exposed towards the window and it is
possible that the bullet may enter the lower part of the left scrotum
area.  The entry point of the bullet is significant, the direction of
the bullet inside the body is not something which can follow the set
formula as it can strike bone or any thick tissue and can change the
direction any number of times."
</p> 


<p id="p_168">		Differing
from the opinion of Dr.Reddy (DW.6), the Court observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_169">	"......There
is no scientific basis which Dr.Reddy could point out for stating
that the injury could be possible only in two positions and not in
any third position. He may be an expert in the field, the Court
cannot be oblivious that his opinion is
bound to be loapsided keeping in view the interest of one side only.
His leg little apart and involuntary fall is the position seen by
PW.55 who had seen his legs coming up when he saw him from the
distance of 7-8  feet from inside the railing between Pepsi and
Vadilal Ice-cream Parlour on his way of Shuklachacha before leaving
for Mr.Snehal Adenwala's residence and this corroborates this
finding....."
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_170">13.6		As
for the alleged impossibility of injury No.5 communicating with
injury No.6, the Court observed that it was quite possible that the
bullet can pass between 2nd and 3rd metacarpal
shafts without damaging the same and can go downward through muscle
of palm carpel tunnel and exit through the lower 3rd of
forearm without damaging the bones. The Court relied upon inverted
edge of injury No.5 and  everted edges of injury No.6 and opinion of
PW.8 that they were communicating with each other. The Court rested
its discussion on the issue with the following observations:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_171">"Even
otherwise, there appears to be a meticulous checking of the car as
can be seen from the evidence of witnesses, panchnama drawn and since
all the glasses were rolled up to a large extent and all the doors
being closed, there was no possibility of bullet going anywhere
except the car itself. If it had fallen down, the investigating
officer could not have missed the same....."	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_172">13.7		As
for the absence of bloodstains, the Court again relied upon opinion
of the investigating officer Dr.Gupta, who had done his MBBS  before
joining the police force, that with all the tracks of bullets being
above to downward and due to gravity, blood would go down. Bullet
would have tendency to create track alongwith and create vacuum
suction effect which would suck blood inside instead of oozing the
same out and therefore, according  to him, these tracks of blood
being from above to downward, the blood did not come out profusely.
The Court concluded that the clothes could act as bandage and 
clothes also have tendency to obstruct the blood. The nature of
injuries suggested that there was impossibility of pool of blood
coming out.  Again relying upon opinion of PW.8 that "......in
case of internal hemorrhage, there would not be much blood at the
spot and out of seven bullets, six were internal wounds of the
firearm where minimum or less blood is possible outside",
the Court concluded that: "....it
was wrong to suggest that there was complete absence of blood inside
the car so as to doubt the very occurrence inside the vehicle".
  The Court went on to observe: "......The
clothes soaked with blood which acted as bandage and the fact remains
that the injuries No.1 and 2 had stopped pumping and functioning of
the heart although all the shots have been fired consecutively within
no time. The scrotum even if is rich in supply of blood, these being
the veins, the blood may not reach there because of stopping of heart
earlier in point of time.  All these are found to be sufficient
explanation alongwith deposition of PW.8 and that of PW.120 on the
issue and therefore, it can be held that the contention raised by the
defence is not in consonance with the record proved by the
prosecution........... "Substantive evidence of PW.55 and PW.85
shall have to be remembered at this stage as PW.55 when peeped into
the vehicle from the wind shield of the car from between the gap of
Vadilal Parlour and Pepsi parlour, he saw blood on the neck as well
as on the clothes of the deceased. Likewise, PW.85 also saw the blood
going right to left on the neck as if it had stopped sometime
before."  "......There are many questions asked to
Dr.Pratik Patel (PW.8) in his cross-examination and he did not find
any such sign of scuffling on the clothes of the deceased. It is also
very unusual for the assailant in the planned murder to give a
shot at scrotum. It is only in the case of some rivalry on account of
sexual offence that this is possible. Again, it is incredible to
believe that the person who would have been killed elsewhere would be
brought to the Law Garden as discussed hereinbefore so as to attract
the notice of people in the area, particularly when, according to the
defence, usually there are many morning walkers visiting Law Garden.
"
</p> 


		
 


<p id="p_173">		Dealing
with the aspect of the injuries listed in the post-mortem 
note  to be circular and of uniform width suggesting that the bullets
had struck the body perpendicularly, the Court concluded that it was
not necessary that every shot described as circular would have struck
the body perpendicularly. However, it found it to be necessary to
mention that had photograph been taken, that would have clearly
reflected the angle and other vital details. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_174">13.8		As
for the issues raised about blackening of the clothes and distance of
the weapon, based on the opinion of DW-6, the Court observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_175">".....He
also said that firing is within the range of powder grain and the
Court is in agreement with the say of PW.8 who is an official witness
and whose evidence need to carry much weightage than that of DW.6 who
had no occasion to see the dead body nor any articles connected with
the crime nor even the vehicle and there is an element of unfairness
in the manner in which he came to give the deposition by projecting
it as an official visit, although technically it can be said so, in
fact, story told is a twisted truth.  The witness who had not
bothered to intimate his own authority of the defence having
approached him and his having never seen the dead body or other
articles, should not carry any weightage as his evidence would go in
the realm of hypothesis. His expertise in this field even if is
accepted, his deposition is solely based on theory which cannot be
equated with the expert having seen the body and worked on the same."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_176">13.9		Discussing
injury No.1, 2, 3 and 4, the Court observed: 
</p>
 


<p id="p_177">"As
far as injuries No.1 and 2 are concerned, it is sufficiently
explained by PW.8 as to why there is no corresponding hole on the
kurta. It could have missed the kurta, if it is not the place where
it should have for being a little above clavicle. According to the
defence witness, injuries No.1 and 2 are easily possible which are
both directed downward, left laterally and to backward and to
posterior respectively. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_178">"A
dispute is raised with regard to the injuries No.3 and 4 that there
are at a lower level, 5 cms. below the nipple on the skin whereas,
the entry wounds inside the chest wall are at the 4th
space corresponding to the nipple area and so these injuries go
upward to enter into the chest area and then they cross to the left
side of the chest behind the heart and fallen in the chest cavity.
The post-mortem report describes the track of these injuries backward
laterally and slightly downward. If a victim is sitting straight
without moving, all the injuries should be going downward into the
chest, but here as the victim started falling on the left side after
the injuries No.1 and 2,  injuries No.3 and 4 have gone upward into
the chest and this on the contrary explains and tallies with the
explanation of Dr.Reddy (DW.6) as the track would have to be upward
to enter into the chest area.  Since the victim was falling down on
the left side on being hit by the bullets and the assailant as per
the proof that has come on record was standing on the right
side and slightly in front with the barrel pointed straight or
little downward, at that point of time injuries No.3 and 4 in the
manner described in the post-mortem note would be very much possible.
This on the contrary would prove the prosecution's case of injury in
a close space car. "
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_179">		The
Court opined that:  ".....All
injuries were so caused on the right side and are so close to each
other going gradually down and it is quite possible that if the hand
was raised to protect himself, the bullet entered through injury No.5
and exited through injury No.6 and the very same bullet re-entered
into his body.  PW.8 was specific about the re-entry being the
external injury No.1.  The material produced by Ld.Sp.P.P. shows that
the blackening is also possible in the re-entry but PW.8 has not been
sure whether blackening at injury No.1 was on account of GSR or dried
blood as no chemical test of skin had been carried out and therefore,
blackening surrounding injury No.1 may not be as a result of GSR. "
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_180">13.10		As
for the expert opinion of DW.6 that opening of the window was roughly
3 inches and 2 inches on the front side border from which the butt
portion of the weapon could not have entered inside the car, the
Court relied upon PW.85 (Mr.Radhe Shyam)  and PW.101 (Mr.Shaikh)  to
note that opening of the window glass of the car was of "palm
length", which was 6 to 10  inches. However,  believing it for
a moment that opening of the window was 3  to 3-1/2  inches, the butt
could certainly go inside and the person having lean and thin frame,
his hand could also go inside and it was not found difficult that the
entire hand with the weapon could go inside, according to the
impugned judgment.
</p> 


 


 


	
 


<p id="p_181">The
Court concluded that:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_182">"......Considering
the pattern of injuries on the person of the deceased, there appears
to be a gradual fall and all the injuries are on the side which is
reflective of a peculiar nature of injuries having happened to the
man who was stuck in a close space of a car and was unable to do
anything when attacked. With the blackening on the clothes as well as
on the wounds on the person of the deceased, range as per the defence
expert also could be from 6 inches to 12 inches for the blackening to
appear and the manner in which the deceased was found inside the car
where shoulder was in between the two seats and the head slightly in
the front resting on the seat of co-driver close to the gap between
the two seats and right leg was little above the left leg which was
above the floor, the distance when the shots were given could not
have been more than 1 ft. from the window of the vehicle. It is a
clear version emerging from the eye witness that the man had shot him
standing right near the door of driver's seat hardly leaving any
chance for the driver to come out or resist and thus, the less
opening even is acceptable, that would not in any manner affect the
prosecution's case."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_183">"......It is
standard Scot &amp; Webley .32 bore weapon weighing 3 tons (sic) made
in England with copper jacketed bullet.  With the opening of 4 to
3-1/2 inches also, it is not difficult for the entire hand to go
inside the said opening  and with the opening of 6 inches and for
that matter even 8 inches, it is extremely easy for the assailant to
shoot at any part of the body even at the point blank range, but with
3 to 3-1/2 inches also sharp shooter having a training and thin body
frame can easily shoot not only from keeping just barrel inside, but
also by taking his hand inside and firing of these five shots would
not take more than 5 to 7 seconds." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_184">".......Again,
for absence of GSR inside the car,the Court must remember that at the
time of taking out the body of Shri Pandya, many persons were
involved, it is difficult to uphold the say of defence, with other
voluminous evidence and circumstances under which sample for GSR was
drawn, absence thereof can brush aside all other positive evidence".
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_185">"......Again
on absence of water bottle inside the car, it is not the version of
PW.55, an eye witness, but that of Asgar Ali and for whatever reason
he had stated that fact, Court shall have to look at version of PW.55
of assailant having left no time for the victim as he had fired no
sooner did he arrive to park his vehicle at his usual place before
his morning walk. Other details of that time given  by A-1 tallies
with this testimony as recce was already done and before Mr.Pandya
arrived at the place, A-1 was at Law Garden  with A-6 and he had only
a few seconds to complete his task as the moment he would have
stepped out of the car, this firing would have attracted the crowd
immediately and going by earlier day's experience  (of dt. 25.03.2003
as to be discussed later in this judgment) he would not have wanted
to take that chance of missing this target."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_186">"......And,
suffice to conclude that all these contentions are the result of
absence of videography and photography of the post-mortem as that
provided an open field for other experts to rush to the cause of
defence and though none of these has in any manner weakened the case
of prosecution, but unfortunately it provided for vociferous 
propaganda to seek favour for the accused in extra legal ways as well
and while concluding this aspect, the Court is not "branching
off into its own resources on the point diverging from the same"
but, as required by the Apex Court, it is basing its conclusion on
evidence and while so doing, it has no business to disregard the
science and basic scientific principles".
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_187">13.11	As
for the anomalies in matching of bullets and use of the weapon, the
Court observed:	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_188">"......In
the aspect of deformation of tip where Post Mortem Note describes
only two of the bullet tips having been deformed BC2 &amp; BC4 and
the work-sheet of PW.75 points out tip deformed of only BC2, the rest
are having the base deformed, a major issue is raised on this aspect
by the defence.  On a detailed discussion, it has also been argued
that PW.75 did not find the firing pin damaged on dt.05.05.2003 when
he first examined the weapon. The shape of firing pin is a class
characteristics and this man could not explain convincingly the
reason for his having examined the same once again and for
examination of the damaged firing pin, no report of matching could
ever be given and with PW.75 stating that he found dissimilarity in
firing pin marks as between test and the crime cartridge cases,
drawing diagram (Exh.453), he could not have written that they were
similar.  In absence of the firing pin, if the same is tampered and
since the area is very small, according to the defence, it is bound
to render identification possible. Breech face mark, if available and
sufficient, can lead to identification. From the detailed answers
given by PW.75, it has been urged to this Court that the man can
hardly be termed as an expert and therefore, his evidence should be
discarded completely." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_189">"Dr.Jitendrakumar
Sinha (DW.8), a Ph.D in Forensic Medicine and claims to have examined
more than 5000 firearm cases ........Although, he agreed that in 95%
of the cases, firing pin marks alone permit identification of the
firearm, but in the event of any tampering of firing pin, the expert
would examine breech face mark  which shall have to be compared with
the test fired cartridges to conform the opinion that the cartridges
are fired from  the said firearm.  He also agreed to the suggestion
that breech face alone is sufficient to conform the opinion, if after
firing test cartridges there are found to be repetitive breech face
marks."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_190">".....More
often than not, the experts are not even called as witnesses as their
opinions are admissible u/s.293 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39">Cr.P.C</a>. whereas, the defence
witnesses who have charged the professional fees are bound to have
personal interests in seeing that the opinion given on charging the
professional fees is upheld and helps the case of their clients. It
is a human tendency to curry favour and to side with the person who
has engaged him professionally and had invited him to speak on the
subject as an expert particularly to controvert the version set out
by  prosecution witnesses....."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_191">"......It
undoubtedly proved the fact that all the five bullets of .32 bore
sent to the CFSL had been recovered from the body of the deceased and
the death of Shri Haren Pandya was on account of firearm injuries as
these injuries led to hemorrhage. If PW.8 - Dr.Pratik Ravjibhai
Patel had  described the same made of white metal and as per the
ballistic expert, these bullets cannot be said to be of white metal,
a limited knowledge on the part of PW.8 - Dr.Pratik Patel or other
doctors performing post-mortem on ballistics cannot fail to prove the
fact of these bullets had been recovered from the body of the
deceased during post-mortem."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_192">13.12		Mr.Ashok
Raj Arora (PW.75) having faltered in his opinion as ballistic expert,
the Court observed:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_193">"Certain
basic principles of ballistics shall have to be proved through the
ballistic expert. It is a fact that the person who has been examined
by the prosecution to be an expert in the field of the ballistics was
found to be having the basic flow (sic) in language and therefore,
communicating his reasonings to the Court and giving valid and
scientific reasons for every test that has been conducted was found
virtually difficult by him. It is also further found that the man had
faltered on many issues which are otherwise said to be basic to the
field of ballistics. These shortcomings resulted into a very detailed
cross-examination  of this witness and various question-marks have
been paused from these answers, essentially on this count. He may
have been working in the field of ballistics for past 20 years and
must have examined various articles in thousands of cases, what is
essential for a scientific expert is to clearly communicate the
procedures followed and the scientific basis on which his reasonings
are based for arriving at conclusion for which again, the
communication skill is equally important.  It is also essential that
the basis on which these tests are carried out and the fundamental
principles of ballistics must be placed before the Court with
conceptual clarity. Apart from his having subjective satisfaction of
the result and conclusions, the expert must have adequate material
and requisite expertise with him to substantiate his reasonings
before the Court of Law."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_194">"With
this, evidence of PW.75 needs to be adverted to further. It is a fact
that in the instant case when the expert first examined the revolver
(Exh.16) he did not realize the fact that the firing pin of the said
weapon was tampered. When once again called after the cartridge cases
discovered at the instance of accused Maniyari (A-17) were sent for
the laboratory testing, the witness realized the need for the said
weapon and when sent once again, he has opined the same to have been
tampered." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_195">"......Even
brushing aside entire evidence on ballistics as mentioned
hereinabove, the Court is of the firm opinion that following Supreme
Court's verdict [in case of Mastram  (supra)] will not even require
the said firearm to be sent to the ballistic expert as PW.8 is
specific about these injuries caused by the bullets having resulted
into the death of a person and that itself would be sufficient as per
this decision. And again, the version of the eye witness (PW.55) is
not such which fundamentally cannot agree to the fundamentals of
Forensic Medicine and therefore, it would not be possible to accept
the say of the defence that as the two are completely contrary, the
version of eye witness should be discarded by the Court. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_196">	Providing
a strong and also missing links at many places to this chain of
events are the confessional statements of accused which are
permissible to be recorded as POTA is applied." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_197">14.		In
view of the aforesaid evidence on record, the  conclusions drawn by
the trial Court were challenged as perverse, irrational and illegal
and since the trial Court has, in the impugned judgment, found
support from confessions of the accused persons, their admissibility,
reliability and probative value will have to be examined before
re-appreciating the evidence as a whole for arriving at the final
conclusion as to culpability of the accused persons, as far as murder
of Mr.Haren Pandya is concerned.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_198">14.1		However,
as far as the evidence referred to and discussed hereinabove is
concerned, it is difficult to endorse the conclusions drawn by the
trial Court, for the following reasons:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_199">(a)	The
sole eye witness (PW.55) has contradicted himself in his own
cross-examination by changing his version in material particulars.
Firstly, he deposed that he saw Shri Pandya's car drive upto its
parking place and that the assailant walked upto  the car and shot
him. Then, in cross-examination, he said that some cars were already
present when he was talking to Kanaiya and one of those cars was the
car of Mr.Pandya. He confirmed that position by again saying that no
car had come when he was talking to Kanaiya.  After moving away from
the car, he just sat for half-an-hour and then straightway told 
Shukla Chacha that Shri Pandya had been killed. He deposed that he
had seen the assailant and stated his features and height, whereas he
had not seen the face of Shri Pandya inside the car. While his
stand-point was admittedly 20 to 30 degrees from the car of Shri
Pandya, and the distance was approximately 16 to 18 feet by all
accounts, he could not have seen anything inside the car from the
tinted glasses on the left side of the car, but he deposed that he
saw from the front windscreen  that Shri Pandya was wearing white
kurta with red lining in it. He also categorically deposed that he
had seen that Shri Pandya had died. Thus, without ever claiming to
have even peeped through the opening of the glass on the driver side
of the car or having stood in front of the front windscreen, he
sought to describe the killing of the victim with such precision as
if the victim had collapsed on his left side in front of him. Not
only that he had admittedly not seen the face of Shri Pandya, even
his presence at the gate at sharp 7:30 a.m., as claimed by him, was
doubtful, and  his subsequent behaviour of neither running away nor
calling anyone nor going nearer the car was unnatural behaviour of an
eye witness. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_200">(b)	After
sitting for half-an-hour on the other side of the Hall, in a state of
shock, he stated to have straightway informed Shukla Chacha to call
Nanubhai and Shukla Chacha himself also did not care to go near the
car to see if Shri Pandya was there. Again, Shukla Chacha taking him
to the place of Nanubhai, which was within 3 kms, could not have
taken more than half-an-hour despite traffic, traffic signals or
traffic police. That would have made his entry at Nanubhai's place at
around 9.00 a.m. By such calculation of time, if PW.55 met CW.1 at
9.30 a.m., the time of offence will have to be around 8.30 a.m. and
not  7.30 a.m. as claimed by PW.55 and accepted by the prosecution.
Even after taking tea and staying at Nanubhai's place for 45 minutes,
he would have returned to the place of offence by 10:30 a.m., but he
claimed to have returned at 11.00 a.m. when the police was removing
Shri Pandya to hospital. However, again his claim of having seen Shri
Pandya being taken away to the hospital in a reclining position is
contradicted by specific evidence of PW.85 (Exh.509),  who was
categorical about Shri Pandya having been carried in sitting position
on the front seat of the jeep. While CW.1 sought to corroborate the
testimony of PW.55, the initial statement of CW.1 recorded on the
same day was not produced. Even his statement recorded later by CW.2
(Exh.880) revealed that PW.55 had told him that when he (PW.55) was
sitting on the bench, he had seen one man running away. Such oral
testimony of PW.55 and identification by him of A-1 with apparent
hesitation could not inspire such confidence as to draw a firm
conclusion about the veracity of his version. Coupled with omission
to examine the other witnesses, namely Kanaiya and Ramesh, the 
sweeper, who were deposed to be  in the immediate vicinity  at the
time of the incident and complete absence of investigation into
availability of other witnesses such as regular morning walkers,
created a cloud of doubt around the manner and timing of firing at
Mr.Pandya. It was, in that context, vehemently and rightly argued for
the appellants, without any satisfactory explanation from the
prosecution, that all the persons who had seen Mr.Pandya immediately
before and after his laying in the car were kept away from the
witness box to protect the fragile testimony of PW.55 and to ensure
that the timing of the incident emerging from statement of PW.55,
recorded by CBI after three days, remained intact  at 7.30 a.m. to
tally with the timing of the call supposed to have been made by A-1
from Law Garden area at 7.33 a.m. It may be noted here that the
prosecution and the impugned judgment has heavily relied upon the
mobile phone record of the phone supposed to have been held by A-1 on
25th and 26th of March 2003 to conclude that
none of the few alleged active participants in the offence having
residence in the Law Garden area, it was strong incriminating
circumstance corroborating with other evidence; although the mobile
phone attributed to A-1 had disappeared from muddamal and the mobile
phones attributed to A-6, A-7, A-8 and A-9 did not show their
location and had no significant activity on 25th and 26th
of March, 2003.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_201">(c)	Remarkably,
all the prosecution witnesses concerned  had to confirm that opening
of the glass on driver's side of Mr.Pandya's car was just as it
appeared in the photograph (Exh.617). The opening of glass having
been scientifically measured to be hardly 3 inches and PW.55 having
confirmed that Mr.Pandya was fired upon from outside the car, the
version of the sole eye witness was practically improbablised  by 
medical evidence and FSL reports which clearly indicated that at
least injury No.7 was impossible to be caused from the height and
angle of the weapon attributed to the assailant while the victim
would be seated in the driver's seat or even while he was sliding
onto the adjoining seat, within seconds of the first fatal shot. The
order in which the shots were fired is not indicated by any evidence
or opinion on record, and hence could only be a matter of surmise.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_202">(d)	Even
as PW.55 claimed to have at least seen the clothes of Shri Pandya,
his description of the colour of stripes of kurta turned out to be
incorrect. While his first narrative of the incident was before
Nanubhai (CW.1), he appeared to have failed to mention time of the
killing, description of the assailant or presence of Kanaiya and
Ramesh, the sweeper, at the place of the incident. Unfortunately,
CW.1's first statement made on 26.3.2003 which could have thrown some
light on what information he had received from PW.55, was not brought
on record by the prosecution. Even as the I.O. had  deposed (PW.120
Exh.728) that a sketch (Exh.620) of the assailant was prepared with
the help of PW.55, he denied any knowledge of such sketch and that
sketch was found and held by the trial Court to be  not at all
matching with the face and features of A-1. While the statement of
PW.55 was stated by him to have been recorded at 2.00 p.m., the I.O.
(Exh.101) deposed  that it was recorded around 6.00 p.m.; which means
that PW.55 remained at the spot till late evening as  a person
interested in assisting the investigation. However, the mobile
forensic team did not take notice of his presence or take his help.
The initial rough map of the site (Exh.615) drawn by PW.101 at 2.00
p.m. has  no reference to the eye witness. That belied PW.101's claim
that around 2.00 p.m. he had enquired  whether anyone had seen
anything and had chanced upon PW.55 as an eye witness.   On the one
hand P.I. Shri Shaikh (PW..101)  was supposed to be investigating at
2.00 p.m. on 26.3.2003 at the scene of offence and, on the other
hand, the same officer was present at the post-mortem at 2.15
p.m. Another map prepared by CBI on 29.3.2003  (Exh.387) was stated
by PW.120 to have been drawn by pencil and signatures and thumb
impressions of supposed eye witnesses were taken on it. Then, it was
stated to have been finalized by a sketch pen; and in the note below
that map, name of A-1 was mentioned and then scored off to show the
place of the assailant with the date of 26.3.2003,  although the 
identity of the assailant was not known to anyone till early April,
2003.  The I.O. of CBI   Dr.Gupta (PW.120) however, deposed that the
note below the map was added 'at the time of charge'. He also clearly
admitted that in the statement before him PW.55 had not stated that
he had seen the boy coming and firing and cried "Bhago Bhago"
or that a boyish person had come from the same direction  as the car
of Shri Pandya had come and he had fired four or five shots while
Shri Pandya was rolling up the glass. He also deposed that he did not
record statements of any of the persons who had reached the scene of
offence on 26.3.2003 even before the complainant. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_203">		All
these factors put into serious doubt the veracity of the version of
PW.55  and therefore, he could hardly be relied upon as a reliable 
eye witness to the incident of firing upon Shri Pandya. Even the
investigating agencies do not seem to have initially treated him as
an eye witness. His remaining available for the initial 4 to 5 days
without running his business and then going away to his native place
far away for nearly a month further strengthens the  doubt about the
investigating agency having put him to the use of an eye witness to
the exclusion of other  possible witnesses who could have thrown some
light on the timing of Shri Pandya's movement on 26.3.2003, place and
manner  and motive of killing him and on the  position of his body in
the car; and better explained the gun-shot wounds.  It may be
pertinent to note here that exact time of firing upon Shri Pandya was
crucial for the prosecution to link A-1 with the incident by virtue
of the call supposed to have been made by him from Law Garden area at
7:33 a.m. and any evidence indicating arrival of Shri Pandya's car at
only 15 minutes before or after 7:30 a.m. of 26.3.2003 would have
completely overturned the case of the prosecution.  PW.1 who stated
to have made many calls to Shri Pandya in the morning of 26.3.2003
was not examined for timing of his calls and the FIR lodged by him
(Exh.167) mentioned the time of offence to be 10.30 a.m., time of
lodging the FIR to be 11.30 a.m., and it was stated therein that Shri
Pandya had died during treatment at the hospital, while the doctors
at the hospital had declared him dead at 12.00 noon.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_204">15.		The
number of bullet injuries as recorded in the post-mortem
report, three holes on the right-hand sleeve of kurta of Shri Pandya
and description of injury No.5 and 6 clearly indicated that injury
No.5 and 6 could not have been communicating in absence of  track
having been  mentioned in the post-mortem report.   There were
no fractures and there was no track in the palm or wrist, but there
was separate blackening at the wrist and corresponding blackening on
the kurta's sleeve. In fact, the examining doctor (PW.19) had made a
sketch showing a horizontal injury on the wrist which would rule out
the possibility of injury No.6 being an exit wound. Again, the same
bullet which caused injury No.5 between the junction of index and
middle fingers, even if communicated with injury No.6 on front of
forearm, could hardly have re-entered the body to cause injury No.1
at lower part of front neck with the track passing through  opical
right of right lung and pleura  in lateral aspect of left chest wall
muscles. Such downward track of injury No.1, if it were a re-entry
wound after the bullet having exited from the forearm, would have
required a unique position of right hand for which there would be no
space in closed setting of a small car. That would lead to the
inference that injury No.1, 5 and 6 were caused by different bullets
of which two were never traced. Not only that, firing of two more
bullets,  total seven bullets, would require another weapon, and
arguably  another assailant, and it would falsify the whole case of
the prosecution that only five bullets were fired as indicated by all
the supporting evidence.  The careful and meticulous mention of only
five gunshots throughout the relevant evidence for the prosecution
and even in the retracted confessions of A-1 and A-6 made the whole
prosecution case a possibly well-orchestrated concoction  of a story
away from the whole truth of the matter. The  discussion of  ocular,
ballistic and medical evidence and the ham-handed rejection of the
expert's opinion as discussed in para 13 hereinabove, only
strengthened the argument for the appellants that the conclusions
drawn  by the trial Court were perverse and illogical.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_205">16.		The
mystery of the murder is deepened by the facts, borne out from the
record, that no blood was found in Shri Pandya's car except a
negligible spot on the seat near the driver's seat even as his
clothes bore tell-tale signs of profuse bleeding from injuries on the
neck and forearm; and mobile phone and keys lying on the floor of the
car below that seat had stains of blood.  No proper map of the scene
of  offence was  made, position of the eye-witnesses was not
ascertained and shown (Exh.615) and assessment of visibility from the
position of the sole eye-witness at around 7.30 a.m. was not made. 
After recovering within hours the mobile phone  of Mr.Pandya from the
scene of offence, no effort was made to investigate into recent
calling from and to that phone even to find out the time since
Mr.Pandya had ceased to answer or open SMS messages. On the contrary,
I.O.Mr.Gupta  (PW.120, Exh.728)  admitted that when he received the
mobile phone (<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_40">Article 16</a>) from Ellisbridge Police Station, it was not
in a sealed condition, and as he did not find "any
significant" calls, he did not even prepare a memo of such
calls.  No finger-prints were stated to have been lifted either from
the car or from the weapon recovered afterwards. The shoes worn by
Mr.Pandya on the fateful day could have provided some clue as to
whether he had already walked in the garden. They were mysteriously
missing from the hospital and it could not be known whether it had
bloodstains on them.  Although Mufti Sufian and Sohailkhan
(absconding accused, who are not parties herein) were all through the
investigation found or projected as masterminds or kingpins and
co-ordinators who  inspired, financed and supervised alleged 
terrorist acts,  were not arrested and the trail of their mobile
phones went cold immediately before the other accused were arrested
from a public place pursuant to some secret information. Towards the
end of investigation, red-corner notices and warrants under <a href="/doc/1437597/" id="a_41">section
70</a> of Cr.P.C. were issued  and it was stated before the Court that
they were suspected to have sneaked into Pakistan. On the other hand,
as for the appellants herein, no evidence with regard to anyone of
them going to Pakistan via Bangladesh or Dubai was unearthed in spite
of some indication in their emails that they were in touch with
someone outside India and clear admission of taking training in
Pakistan in some of the confessional statements supposed to have been
made by them. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_206">17.		Since
the prosecution has heavily relied upon confession of the appellants
as substantive evidence providing the missing links in the
prosecution case and as conclusive evidence of hatching and execution
of criminal conspiracy within the larger conspiracy to strike terror,
it would be necessary to deal with that part of evidence;
particularly where it relates to the offence of murder. It has to be
noted at the outset that confessions were recorded under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_42">Section 32</a>  of POTA after it being applied on
02.06.2003 in the case of murder of Shri Pandya. Before the
confessions were recorded all the accused persons, except A-9 and
A-11, were already in prolonged custody of the police for nearly two
months or more.  The time taken in taking down the statements and
number of pages of hand-written confessions of each accused, recorded
by the same officer, may be tabulated as under:

17.1		The
</pre><p id="p_208">Superintendent of Police (CBI)  (PW.21 - Exh.226) who recorded all
the statements in Hindi, inter alia, deposed  that he had
strictly instructed the guard not to allow any person from CBI or
otherwise to meet or talk to the accused during reflection time. He
had physically inspected the body of the accused  for any mark of
physical violence and satisfied himself about voluntariness and then
recorded the confessional statements of each accused in the same
language as spoken by him and obtained his signatures on each page of
the statement after reading it over to him; and put each confessional
statement in sealed envelope  and directed the CBI officer to further
comply with the provisions of law. From the time the accused were
produced before him till the time of their production before Judicial
Magistrate, they were kept at CBI office at Gandhinagar but during
reflection time they were not kept in lock-up, even as  a guard was
kept outside the place where the accused were kept during reflection
period. And, none was allowed to talk or meet the accused during
reflection time and there was no question of accused having any legal
advise during that period.   He deposed that as and when he got time
to record the confessional statement, he had called the accused. He
asserted that none else entered or exited and there was no
interruption of any kind during recording of the confessions. When
asked about difference in duration of recording of each statement
with reference to pages thereof, he replied  that recording depended
upon speed of narration, speed of reducing it into writing, time of
day or night during which it was recorded and such other factors. He
denied that back to back recording of statements indicated
pre-fabrication of record or of confessional statements. He could not
remember any accused to have asked for even a glass of water during
recording of statement in the month of June and asserted that not
asking for glass of water had nothing to do with genuinely free and
voluntary atmosphere. He admitted that Hindi was never his medium 
during education. He admitted that his basic educational
qualification was Commerce Graduate and Cost Accountant, and he had
never recorded any confessional statements under TADA. He denied that
the confessional statements were not recorded on a mechanical device
as they were not voluntary. The following question, note of the Court
and answer of the witness need to be reproduced:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_209">"Q:	Are
you aware as to how in Hindi language the word "Abhiyukt"
can be written?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_210">Note: At
this juncture, the Court has pointed out to the LA for the defence
that time and again this word has appeared in the confessional
statement of the accused which has been exhibited and yet, since he
has insisted on asking this question, the witness has been asked to
reply the same. 
</p>
 


	
 


<p id="p_211">A:	In
the word "Abhiyukt" the words "a", "bh",
"u", "k" &amp; "t"  of Hindi
language will be used".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_212">17.2		Contents
of the confessional statements generally are narration of minute
details of meetings of the accused persons and talks of taking
revenge for the atrocities committed on Muslims during riots of the
year 2002 and expression in clear and similar terms of the object of
killing some Hindu leaders for spreading terror among Hindus.
Ramarkably, A-4, A-5, A-6, A-8 and A-12 have also narrated the
details of the tiffin bomb case although that was not the charge
pursuant to which they were being interrogated. And A-6, A-8 and A-12
have in fact been acquitted in that case. As for selection of Shri
Pandya for killing, it is stated to be the absconding accused A-14
(Sohel) who dropped his name and a few of the accused reiterated that
as Shri Pandya had played an active part during riots and in
demolishing a masjid at Paldi he was a fit target for taking revenge
and striking terror.  A-9 was specific in his statement (Exh.232)
that on 25.3.2003 he had gone to Law Garden with A-1 and Shri Pandya 
had  come there around 7.30 a.m. When A-1 aproached him near parking
area, Shri Pandya had come out and A-1  dropped the idea of killing
him as people in the garden were watching him.  On 26.3.2003, he
reached near H.A.College and saw Yunus (A-6) on a black motorcycle
near Thakorebhai Hall and saw A-1 standing at the corner. At around
7.30 a.m., he saw the car and Shri Pandya  as glass of the car was
half-open. He specifically stated that A-1 fired on Shri Pandya four
or five bullets from revolver held by him and at that time half of
the glass on the driver-side was open. A-1 has stated in his
statement (Exh.253), inter alia, that as  Rasulkhan (A-18) (an
 absconding accused) wanted to strike terror in Gujarat he was being
sent to Gujarat for that purpose.  He thought that after staging a
big event he may be called to Pakistan forever and then he could live
in peace, away from the cases pending against him. After describing
in detail  the attempt on the life of Shri Tiwari and the places of
his stay  in Ahmedabad, he stated that on 25.3.2003 he gave up the
idea of firing at Shri Pandya. On 26.3.2003, he went to the house of
A-14 in coffee-colour shirt and upon a sign from Yunus, collected a
loaded revolver from the toilet of Jaliwali Masjid and went to Law
Garden as pillion rider to Yunus (A-6). As Shri Pandya opened a
bottle for drinking water after parking his car, he fired five
bullets from the opening of the glass. Then he went to Yunus and
boarded his motorcycle. On his way he asked Yunus how many bullets
were fired by him and when Yunus told four, he told him, not four but
five bullets were fired. He stayed at Royal Apartment  for three days
thereafter and then, after staying at somebody's shop, he was given a
bicycle to go to Kanodar village. He went there and on the next
evening he was brought back to Ahmedabad in a Maruti car by A-13. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_213">17.3		Important
parts of the above statements, related to the murder of Shri Pandya,
without mention of any particular time, were inconsistent with the
deposition of the eye-witness insofar as the accused concerned stated
that the glass of the window of Shri Pandya's car was already
half-open and he was shot when he was opening a water-bottle which
was nowhere mentioned or found during investigation. Kanodar village
was stated to be about 140 kms. away  from Ahmedabad and it was
practically impossible to reach there on a bicycle in 12 to 18 hours.
Moreover, the dialogue regarding number of bullets fired by him is so
apparently artificial and unnatural that it appears to have been
calculated to buttress the prosecution case in its most controversial
aspect.  The confessions simply did not mention or explain the
gunshot wound on the scrotum of Shri Pandya. The confessions were of
course retracted at an early opportunity before the POTA Court,
orally and in writing (Exh. 9 to 17), though not before learned
Magistrate during confirmation proceeding.  There was no material
whatsoever to substantiate that Shri Pandya had, in fact or in
perception of the victims of riots, played a leading role in the
riots or caused in any way demolition of any masjid. Therfore, the
object and intent of taking revenge and striking terror through his
murder was provided with no basis except the dialogues narrated in
the confessional statements.
</p> 
	 


	

 


<p id="p_214">17.4		Learned
counsel Mr.B.M.Gupta, appearing for A-1, A-2 and A-3, pointed out
that the SP, CBI (PW.21 - Exh.226)  had clearly admitted in his
Answer No.113 that the confessional statements of A-1, A-2 and A-3 
were recorded in the case of attack on Shri Jagdish Tiwari and not in
Shri Haren Pandya  murder case.  I.O. Shri Gupta (PW.120 -
Exh.728)  had also admitted in his cross-examination that no
confessional statement of A-1, A-2 and A-3 was taken while they were
in his custody pursuant to the case of murder of Shri Haren Pandya.
It was also pointed out by learned counsel Mr.Gupta that, as admitted
by I.O. (PW.120 - Exh.728), in all the applications made for
police custody of the accused after 01.6.2003 and application of
POTA, he had never filed any affidavit stating reasons for the
request for police custody, which amounted to violation of mandatory
provisions of Sec.49 (2) of POTA.  In fact, the remand report
(Exh.754) dated 12.6.2003 for A-1, A-2 and A-3  clearly mentioned
only the case of attempt of murder on Shri Jagdish Tiwari and
conspiracy.  But thereafter, their confessions were recorded in which
admissions of  involvement in the case of murder of Shri Haren Pandya
were obtained, according to the submission.  It was also submitted
that the accused persons were nowhere shown to have been told or 
advised that they would be free of police custody after recording 
and confirmation of their confessional statements; and hence, under
the fear of further police custody, the accused persons who were
already in police custody for inordinately long period could not be
expected to make any complaint before learned Judicial Magistrate. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_215">17.5		In
the impugned judgment, it is recorded that S.P., CBI had no reason to
fabricate any confessional statement and had not only done all that
was required under the law  but also safeguarded the interest of the
accused. Although he had "not explicitly asked the accused
of their right to meet the lawyers, but that cannot take away the
truthfulness of the confessional statement".  The Court
relied upon <a href="/doc/406616/" id="a_43">State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Chhaganlal
Raghani</a> to hold that the Apex Court  had not found any
requirement of opening by the Magistrate of the sealed envelope
containing confession and to read out the same to the accused, and as
the sealed envelopes were sent directly to the POTA Court, no
prejudice was caused. The subsequent retraction and complaints by
some of the accused about torture, threats and forcible extraction of
confessions were brushed aside by the Court as after-thought or under
legal advice.  Accordingly, the confessional statement of A-1 was
found by the Court to have been given voluntarily and it was further
found to be truthful as there was "sufficient general
corroboration available to the same."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_216">18.		Even
as the narration of events in the confessional statements of each
accused with minute details of names, addresses, ten-digit phone
numbers and dates read with the deposition of the recording officer
(PW.21 Exh.226) do not inspire sufficient  confidence about
voluntariness and veracity of the statements, the issue of their
admissibility and reliability was taken more on the legal plain. And,
the most elaborate recent judgment in the Parliament attack case [
<a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_44">State  (NCT of Delhi) v.  Navjot
Sandhu</a> etc. - (2005) 11 SCC 600 ]  was
discussed  at the bar. Relevant observations made by the Apex Court
therein may be extracted hereunder before considering the evidentiary
value of the confessional statements:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_217">"22.	In
Usmanbhai's case  [(1988) 2 SCC 271] it was said;
</p> 


<p id="p_218">"Before
dealing with the contentions advanced, it is well to remember that
the legislation is limited in its scope and effect. <a href="/doc/1778/" id="a_45">The Act</a> is an
extreme measure to be resorted to when the police cannot tackle the
situation under the ordinary penal law. The intendment is to provide
special machinery to combat the growing menace of terrorism in
different parts of the country. Since, however, the Act is a drastic
measure, it should not ordinarily be resorted to unless the
Government's law enforcing machinery fails."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_219">"27.	......While
<a href="/doc/813952/" id="a_46">Sections 17</a> to <a href="/doc/1589428/" id="a_47">23</a> deal with admissions, the law as to confessions is
embodied in <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_48">Sections 24</a> to <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_49">30</a> of the Evidence Act. <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_50">Section 25</a> bars
proof of a confession made to a police officer. <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_51">Section 26</a> goes a
step further and prohibits proof of confession made by any person
while he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it be made in
the immediate presence of a Magistrate. <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_52">Section 24</a> lays down the
obvious rule that a confession made under any inducement, threat or
promise becomes irrelevant in a criminal proceeding. Such inducement,
threat or promise need not be proved to the hilt. If it appears to
the court that the making of the confession was caused by any
inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority,
the confession is liable to be excluded from evidence. The expression
'appears' connotes that the Court need not go
to the extent of holding that the threat etc. has in fact been
proved. If the facts and circumstances emerging from the evidence
adduced make it reasonably probable that the confession could be the
result of threat, inducement or pressure, the court will refrain from
acting on such confession, even if it be a confession made to a
Magistrate or a person other than a police officer".	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_220">"29.	Confessions
are considered highly reliable because no rational person would make
admission against his interest unless prompted by his conscience to
tell the truth. "Deliberate and voluntary confessions of guilt,
if clearly proved are among the most effectual proofs in law".
(vide Taylor's Treatise on the Law of Evidence Vol. I). However,
before acting upon a confession the court must be satisfied that it
was freely and voluntarily made. A confession by hope or promise of
advantage, reward or immunity or by force or by fear induced by
violence or threats of violence cannot constitute evidence
against the maker of confession. The confession should have been made
with full knowledge of the nature and consequences of the confession.
If any reasonable doubt is entertained by the court that these
ingredients are not satisfied, the court should eschew the confession
from consideration. So also the authority recording the confession -
be it a Magistrate or some other statutory functionary at the
pre-trial stage, must address himself to the issue whether the
accused has come forward to make the confession in an atmosphere free
from fear, duress or hope of some advantage or reward induced by the
persons in authority. Recognizing the stark reality of the accused
being enveloped in a state of fear and
panic, anxiety and despair while in police custody, the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_53">Indian
Evidence Act</a> has excluded the admissibility of a confession made to
the police officer".	
</p> 


<p id="p_221">"32.	As
to what should be the legal approach of the Court called upon to
convict a person primarily in the light of the confession or a
retracted confession has been succinctly summarized in <a href="/doc/341085/" id="a_54">Bharat v.
State of U.P</a>. (1971 (3) SCC 950). Hidayatullah, C.J., speaking for a
three-Judge Bench observed thus :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_222">"7.	Confessions
can be acted upon if the court is satisfied that they are voluntary
and that they are true. The voluntary nature of the confession
depends upon whether there was any threat, inducement or promise and
its truth is judged in the context of the entire prosecution case.
 The confession must fit into the proved facts and not run counter
to them. When the voluntary character of the confession and its
truth are accepted, it is safe to rely on it. Indeed a confession, if
it is voluntary and true and not made under any inducement or threat
or promise, is the most patent piece of evidence against the maker.
Retracted confession, however, stands on a slightly different
footing. As the Privy Council once stated, in India it is the rule to
find a confession and to find it retracted later. A court may take
into account the retracted confession, but it must look for the
reasons for the making of the confession as well as for its
retraction, and must weigh the two to determine whether the
retraction affects the voluntary nature of the confession or not. If
the court is satisfied that it was retracted because of an
after-thought or advice, the retraction may not weigh with the court
if the general facts proved in the case and the tenor of the
confession as made and the circumstances of its making and withdrawal
warrant its user. All the same, the courts do not act upon the
retracted confession without finding assurance from some other
sources as to the guilt of the accused. Therefore, it can be stated
that a true confession made voluntarily may be acted upon with slight
evidence to corroborate it, but a retracted confession requires the
general assurance that the retraction was an after-thought and that
the earlier statement was true.....". 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_223">"34.	Dealing
with retracted confession, a four-Judge Bench of this Court speaking
through Subba Rao, J, in Pyare Lal v. State of Assam (AIR 1957 SC
</p><p id="p_224">216), clarified the legal position thus :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_225">"A
retracted confession may form the legal basis of a conviction if the
court is satisfied that it was true and was voluntarily made. But it
has been held that a court shall not base a conviction on such a
confession without corroboration. It is not a rule of law, but is
only rule of prudence. It cannot even be laid down as an inflexible
rule of practice or prudence that under no circumstances such a
conviction can be made without corroboration, for a court may, in a
particular case, be convinced of the absolute truth of a confession
and prepared to act upon it without corroboration; but it may be laid
down as a general rule of practice that it is unsafe to rely upon a
confession, much less on a retracted confession, unless the court is
satisfied that the retracted confession is true and voluntarily made
and has been corroborated in material particulars."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_226">"36.	Then
we have the case of <a href="/doc/677948/" id="a_55">Shankaria v. State of Rajasthan</a> (1978 (3) SCC
</p><p id="p_227">435) decided by a three-Judge Bench. Sarkaria, J, noted the twin
tests to be applied to evaluate a confession: (1) whether the
confession was perfectly voluntary and (2) if so, whether it is true
and trustworthy. The learned Judge pointed out that if the first test
is not satisfied the question of applying the second test does not
arise....."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_228">"37.	.....	.....	.....
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_229">"18.	Having
thus reached a finding as to the voluntary nature of a confession,
the truth of the confession should then be tested by the court. The
fact that the confession has been made voluntarily, free from threat
and inducement, can be regarded as presumptive evidence of its truth.
Still, there may be circumstances to indicate that the confession
cannot be true wholly or partly in which case it loses much of its
evidentiary value".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_230">"19.	In
order to be assured of the truth of confession, this Court, in a
series of decisions, has evolved a rule of prudence that the court
should look to corroboration from other evidence. However, there need
not be corroboration in respect of each and every material
particular."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_231">"39.	The
crucial expression used in <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_56">Section 30</a> is "the Court may  take
into consideration such confession" (emphasis supplied).
These words imply that the confession of a co- accused cannot be
elevated to the status of substantive evidence which can form the
basis of conviction of the co-accused. The import of this expression
was succinctly explained by the Privy Council in <a href="/doc/299175/" id="a_57">Bhuboni Sahu v. King</a>
(AIR 1949 PC 257) in the following words:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_232">"The
Court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no
doubt, makes its evidence on which the Court may act; but the section
does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there
must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the
consideration of all the facts proved in the case;  it can be put
into the scale and weighed with the other evidence".        
</p>     

 


				    
<p id="p_233">      (emphasis supplied)
 


 


 


"40.	After
referring to these decisions, a Constitution Bench of this Court in
Haricharan Kurmi v. State of Bihar (1964 (6) SCR 623) further
clarified the legal position thus :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_234">	"..........In
dealing with a case against an accused person, the Court cannot start
with the confession of co-accused person; it must begin with other
evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its
opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence,
then it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive
assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about
to reach on the said other evidence."
</p> 


						  
<p id="p_235">        (emphasis supplied)
 


 


 


"45.	Reference
is to be made to a recent decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/625911/" id="a_58">Jameel Ahmed and
Anr. v. State of Rajasthan</a> [2003 (9) SCC 673], a case arising under
TADA. After a survey of the earlier cases on the subject, this Court
observed: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_236">"(i)	If
the confessional statement is properly recorded satisfying the
mandatory provisions of Section 15 of TADA Act and the rules made
thereunder and if the same is found by the Court as having been made
voluntarily and truthfully then the said confession is sufficient to
base conviction of the maker of the confession." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_237">	This
proposition is unexceptionable. The next proposition, however,
presents some difficulty. The learned Judges added: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_238">"(ii)	Whether
such confession requires corroboration or not, is a matter for the
Court considering such confession on facts of each case......" 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_239">"47.	While
we agree with the proposition that the nature of corroboration
required both in regard to the use of confession against the maker
and the co- accused is general in nature, our remarks made earlier in
relation to the confession against the maker would equally apply to
proposition No. (iii) in so far as it permits the Court in an
appropriate case to base the conviction on the confession of the
co-accused without even general corroboration. We would only add that
we do not visualize any such appropriate case for the simple reason
that the assurance of the truth of confession is inextricably mixed
up with the process of seeking corroboration from the rest of the
prosecution evidence. We have expressed our dissent to this limited
extent. In the normal course, a reference to the larger Bench on this
issue would be proper. But there is no need in this case to apply or
not to apply the legal position clarified in proposition No. (iii)
for the simple reason that the trial court as well as the High Court
did look for corroboration from the circumstantial evidence relating
to various facts narrated in the confessional statement. Perhaps, the
view expressed by us would only pave the way for a fresh look by a
larger Bench, should the occasion arise in future."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_240">"49.	.....Our
attention has been drawn to the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59">Cr.P.C</a>. and POTA
providing for a joint trial in which the accused could be tried not
only for the offences under POTA but also for the offences under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_60">IPC</a>.
We find no difficulty in accepting the proposition that there could
be a joint trial and the expression "the trial of such person"
may encompass a trial in which the accused who made the confession is
tried jointly with the other accused. From that, does it follow that
the confession made by one accused is equally admissible against
others, in the absence of specific words? The answer, in our view,
should be in the negative. On a plain reading of <a href="/doc/1135830/" id="a_61">Section 32(1)</a>, the
confession made by an accused before a police officer shall be
admissible against the maker of the confession in the course of his
trial. It may be a joint trial along with some other accused; but, we
cannot stretch the language of the section so as to bring the
confession of the co- accused within the fold of admissibility......"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_241">"55.	The
quality of a nation's civilization can be largely measured by the
methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal law, as said by
the eminent American jurist Schaefer. We may recall as well the apt
remarks of Krishna Iyer, J. in <a href="/doc/1938988/" id="a_62">Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani</a> [(1978)
2 SCC 424] (para 29) :
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_242">	"The
first obligation of the criminal justice system is to secure justice
by seeking and substantiating truth through proof. Of course, the
means must be as good as the ends and the dignity of the individual
and the freedom of the human person cannot be sacrificed by resort to
improper means, however worthy the ends. Therefore, 'third degree'
has to be outlawed and indeed has been. We have to draw up clear
lines between the whirlpool and the rock where the safety of society
and the worth of the human person may co-exist in peace."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_243">"59	........
</p><p id="p_244">In this scenario, we have serious doubts whether it would be safe to
concede the power of recording confessions to the police officers to
be used in evidence against the accused making the confession and the
co-accused".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_245">"157.	The
lofty purpose behind the mandate that the maker of confession shall
be sent to judicial custody by the CJM before whom he is produced is
to provide an atmosphere in which he would feel free to make a
complaint against the police, if he so wishes. The feeling that he
will be free from the shackles of police custody after production in
the Court will minimize, if not remove, the fear psychosis by which
he may be gripped.  The various safeguards enshrined in <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_63">Section 32</a>

<p id="p_249">	"The

telescoped by making it prudent for the police to permit the advocate

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_252">"164.	In
our considered view, the violation of procedural safeguards under
<a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_72">Section 52</a> does not stand on the same footing as the violation of the
requirements of sub-sections (2) to (5) of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_73">Section 32</a>. As already
observed, sub-sections (2) to (5) of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_74">Section 32</a> have an integral and
inseparable connection with the confession recorded under <a href="/doc/1135830/" id="a_75">Section
32(1)</a>. They are designed to be checks against involuntary confessions
and to provide an immediate remedy to the person making the
confession to air his grievance before a judicial authority.  These
safeguards are, so to say, woven into the fabric of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_76">Section 32</a> itself
and their observance is so vital that the breach thereof will
normally result in eschewing the confession from consideration,
subject to what we have said about the judicial custody. The
prescriptions under <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_77">Section 52</a>, especially those affording an
opportunity to have the presence of the legal practitioner, are no
doubt supplemental safeguards as they will promote the guarantee
against self-incrimination even at the stage of interrogation; but
these requirements laid down in <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_78">Section 52</a> cannot be projected into
<a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_79">Section 32</a> so as to read all of them as constituting a code of
safeguards of the same magnitude. To hold that the violation of each
one of the safeguards envisaged by <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_80">Section 52</a> would lead to automatic
invalidation of confession would not be in consonance with the
inherent nature and scheme of the respective provisions. However, we
would like to make it clear that  the denial of the safeguards
under sub-sections (2) to (4) of <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_81">Section 52</a> will be one of the
relevant factors that would weigh with the Court to act upon or
discard the confession. To this extent they play a role vis-a-vis
the confessions recorded under <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_82">Section 32</a>, but they are not as
clinching as the provisions contained in sub-sections (2) to (5) of
<a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_83">Section 32</a>."

"180.	The
more important violation of the procedural safeguards lies in the
breach of sub-section (2) read with sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_84">Section 52</a>. It
is an undisputed fact that the appellants were not apprised of the
right to consult a legal practitioner either at the time they were
initially arrested or after the POTA was brought into picture. We may
recall that the POTA offences were added on 19th December and as a
consequence thereof, investigation was taken up by PW80- an Asst.
Commissioner of Police, who is competent to investigate the POTA
offences. But, he failed to inform the persons under arrest of their
right to consult a legal practitioner, nor did he afford any facility
to them to contact the legal practitioner. The opportunity of meeting
a legal practitioner during the course of interrogation within closed
doors of police station will not arise unless a person in custody is
informed of his right and a reasonable facility of establishing
contact with a lawyer is offered to him....."

<p id="p_254">"181.	
</p><p id="p_255">The importance of the provision to afford the assistance of counsel
even at the stage of custodial interrogation need not be gainsaid.
The requirement is in keeping with the Miranda ruling and the
philosophy underlying Articles 21, 20(3) and 22(1). This right cannot
be allowed to be circumvented by subtle ingenuities or innovative
police strategies. The access to a lawyer at the stage of
interrogation serves as a sort of counterweight to the intimidating
atmosphere that surrounds the detenu and gives him certain amount of
guidance as to his rights and the obligations of the police......"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_256">"182.	....
</p><p id="p_257">It cannot be said that the violation of these obligations under
sub-sections (2) and (4) have no relation and impact on the
confession.  It is too much to expect that a person in custody in
connection with POTA offences is supposed to know the fasciculus of
the provisions of POTA regarding the confessions and the procedural
safeguards available to him. The presumption should be otherwise.
The lawyer's presence and advice, apart from providing psychological
support to the arrestee, would help him understand the implications
of making a confessional statement before the Police Officer and also
enable him to become aware of other rights such as the right to
remain in judicial custody after being produced before the
Magistrate. The very fact that he will not be under the fetters of
police custody after he is produced before the CJM pursuant to
<a href="/doc/1798678/" id="a_85">Section 32(4)</a> would make him feel free to represent to the CJM about
the police conduct or the treatment meted out to him.  The haunting
fear of again landing himself into police custody soon after
appearance before the CJM, would be an inhibiting factor against
speaking anything adverse to the police. That is the reason why
the judicial custody provision has been introduced in sub-section (5)
of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_86">Section 32</a>. The same objective seems to be at the back of
sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_87">Section 164</a> of Cr.P.C., though the situation
contemplated therein is somewhat different."

item of evidence on which the prosecution places heavy reliance."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_259">"243.	As
far as the first contention of Mr. Gopal Subramanium is concerned, we
have already rejected his argument that on the principle of 'theory
of agency', the conspirators will be liable for the substantive
offences committed pursuant to the conspiracy. When once the
application of the theory of agency is negatived, there is no scope
to hold that the appellant, in spite of not having done any act or
thing by using the weapons and substances set out in sub-
section(1)(a), he, as a conspirator, can be brought within the sweep
and ambit of sub-sections (1) and (2). The wording of clause (a) of
<a href="/doc/188392346/" id="a_88">Section 3(1)</a> is clear that it applies to those who do any acts or

other explosive substances or firearms, etc."), the definition
of a terrorist act need not be restricted to a physical act of using

procuring explosives and chemicals and "participating in the
preparation of explosives would be action amounting to doing of a
thing using explosives", cannot be supported on any principle of

reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_99">section 32</a> of POTA indicate the
mandatory and all important safeguards for making a confessional
statement before a police officer admissible in the trial for an
offence under that Act. The mandatory requirement contained in
<a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_100">section 32</a> (3) of POTA is that confessions shall be recorded in an
atmosphere free from threat and sub-section (5) mandates that the
Chief Judicial Magistrate, before whom the person has to be produced
within 48 hours, has to send the person to judicial custody. As
elaborately discussed and held in the Parliament
attack case (supra),  the confession has to fit into
the proved facts and not run counter to them and various safeguards
enshrined in Sec.32 are meant to be strictly observed as they relate
to personal liberty of an individual.  Their observance is so vital
that the breach thereof will normally result in eschewing the
confession from consideration. It is also observed that it is too
much to expect that a person in custody in connection with POTA
offences is supposed to know the  fasciculus of the provisions
of POTA regarding the confessions and the procedural safeguards
available to him. The presumption should be otherwise. The lawyer's
presence and advice, apart from providing psychological support to
the arrestee, would help him understand the implications of making a
confessional statement before the Police Officer and also enable him
to become aware of other rights such as the right to remain in
judicial custody after being produced before the Magistrate.  The
haunting fear of again landing himself into police custody soon after
appearance before the CJM, would be an inhibiting factor against
speaking anything adverse to the police. In the instant case,
admitted absence of legal aid during the period of prolonged
confinement while the confessions were being recorded and presumption
of ignorance about the prospect of being released after production
before Chief Judicial Magistrate tend to make the subsequent
retraction genuine and reduce  probative value of the confessional
statements, some of the important parts of the confessional
statements, getting no corroboration from any other evidence and
certain incriminating parts being not even investigated made
consideration of the confessional statements more difficult. It is
also relevant to note  that the confessional statements were recorded
by the SP, CBI (PW.21 - Exh.226) at odd hours and it had taken
different duration ranging from 15 minutes to 12 hours and 50
minutes,  without any interruption  and without any accused person
demanding even a glass of water as deposed by PW.21. Even  the tone
and tenor of the language of confessional  statements were also cited
 by learned counsel for the appellants as the evidence of statements
having been dictated or prepared by someone else because the accused
persons hailing from Hyderabad and Ahmedabad could not be using the
same words  and diction for the same expression.

<p id="p_277">19.		Learned
counsel Mr.Y.N.Ravani, appearing for CBI, and learned Sp. P.P.
Mr.J.M.Panchal, addressed elaborate arguments  with written notes to
defend the impugned judgment. It was submitted that the sole eye
witness (PW.55) was  a truthful, trustworthy and uninterested witness
whose testimony could not be disregarded on account of his being
rustic in his deposition or  in view of the medical and ballistic
evidence. It was submitted that his presence at the spot on 26.3.2003
was quite natural and he had deposed about the event of firing  and
features of the assailant with clarity and certainty. He had also
immediately narrated the incident to Shuklachacha  and CW.1. He had
also identified A-1 during test identification parade as well as
before the trial Court. He had also demonstrated before the Court,
the position of the deceased inside the car, and his deposition
corroborated injuries No.1, 2, 3 and 4 of which track was going
downward and right to left. It was argued that injury No.7 which had
a track going upward and left to right was also explained by the
witness by deposing that the legs of the deceased had come up while
being shot. They relied upon judgment of the Apex Court in State
of Himachal Pradesh v. Mastram [AIR 2004 SC 5056] to
submit that in case of conflict between ocular version and medical
evidence, the ocular evidence of the eye witness has to be preferred.
Similar view is expressed by the Apex Court in  
<a href="/doc/1411713/" id="a_101">Sunil Dattatraya Vaskar v. State of Mahatrashtra</a>  [AIR 2009 SC 210].
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_278">19.1		As
for the ballistic evidence, it was submitted for the respondent that
custody of bullets was proved from the stage of recovery by the
doctor till their receipt by the expert. Thus, the bullets were found
by the ballistic expert to be matching with the revolver recovered at
the instance of A-1 (Exh.444) and blood present on the bullets
recovered from the body of the deceased and blood present on his
clothes was of the same group (Ex.458). The post-mortem doctor
had also identified the bullets in the Court as the same which were
recovered during post-mortem (Exh.176). On the one hand, the
ballistic expert (PW.75) had opined that the bullets were fired from
single standard weapon having 7/7 land and  groove with right hand
side twist,  it was further opined  that the crime bullets were fired
from the revolver sent by CBI, as per the work-sheet (Exh.452). It
was only when third opinion was sought after recovery of four empty
cartridge cases that the expert asked for the revolver and he found
tampering in the shape of firing pin impression on the percussion
cap.  He had not checked the firing pin on the earlier occasion as he
was not required to opine on crime cartridge cases. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_279">19.2		As
for recovery and discovery of the weapons, A-1 had disclosed the fact
of concealment of  the revolver used in killing of Shri Haren Pandya
in the flat at Shahpur before PW.110 (Exh.656); and discovery of
revolver and pistol from the flat under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_102">section 27</a> of the Evidence
Act in presence of PW.13 (Panchnama Ex.196) had connected A-1 to the
crime. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_280">19.3		It
was further submitted that the appellants were in possession of
mobile phones and were in constant touch with each other before,
during and after commission of the crime through their mobile or
land-line phones, as  depicted in the call detail records, in order
to execute the conspiracy. As mobile phone No.9825491421 was used by
A-1, his location at 7.33 a.m. on 26.3.2003 in the area  near Law
Garden  and A-14 providing three new BSNL SIMs to A-7, A-8 and A-9 on
25.3.2003 and their location  on 25.3.2003 and 26.3.2003 near Law
Garden were strong corroborative evidence of the presence of some of
the accused in the Law Garden area. The printouts of email sent by
A-1, A-2 and A-18 revealed that they were operating in furtherance of
a common object as also presence of some of them in Udaipur and
Ahmedabad;  even as the text of email messages did not reveal any
specific plan of committing any particular crime. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_281">19.4		The
evidence regarding A.10 purchasing a motorcycle from PW.54 and giving
it to A-1 in the first week of February 2003 and thereafter handing
over of that bike to PW.45 while fleeing from Ahmedabad on 4.4.2003
and thereafter PW.45 parking the same in the parking of Kalupur
Railway Station, proved the provision of logistical support for
commission of crime pursuant to a common object and conspiracy. It
has also come in evidence that fake number plates were prepared by
A-7 and A-8  from PW.52 and  were used after commission of crime. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_282">19.5		It
was submitted that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that A-1 had
reached Udaipur on 31.12.2002 and returned to Hyderabad due to
paucity of fund; and again he had returned to Udaipur on 20.01.2003.
On 25/26.01.2003, he was brought to Ahmedabad by A-11, A-14 and PW.49
and his stay at various places in Ahmedabad was proved by cogent
evidence. Thereafter he had left for Mumbai on 07.4.2003, which
showed his attempt to escape after commission of the crime. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_283">19.6		Learned
counsel relied upon the following judgments of the Apex Court  and
two unreported  Division Bench judgments of this Court, in support of
the submission  that the confessions of the appellants were required
to be relied upon in aid of the corroborative pieces of substantive
evidence. It was vehemently argued that high ranking officers of an
independent investigating agency like CBI had no reason and could not
be presumed to have manipulated or pressurized the accused to make
confessional statements which were recorded and confirmed in
compliance with all the statutory requirements.  It was emphasized
that the appellants had not retracted the confessional statements at
the first available opportunity when they were produced with their
statements in sealed cover before learned Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate. Retraction of the confessions after more than one month
was rightly regarded as an after-thought on legal advice. The
appellants had given different reasons for retraction when they
retracted them orally, in writing and during recording of their
statements under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_103">section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. It was also pointed out that
the appellants were represented by lawyers at the time of their
production in Court for police custody remand. It was submitted that
A-1, a native of Andhra Pradesh, had no legitimate  business or
reason to be in Ahmedabad except for executing the conspiracy. The
evidence of A-1, A-4, A-5 and A-12, absconding from Ahmedabad  after
commission of the crime, indicated their guilty mind. It was also
submitted that the Central POTA Review Committee had come to the
conclusion that provisions of POTA were duly attracted against the
appellants. Thus, there was overwhelming material in the form of
oral, documentary, circumstantial and scientific evidence against
each of the appellants so as to uphold their conviction and sentence,
according to the submission. 
</p>
 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">20</span>
<p id="p_284">		Learned counsel for the respondent relied upon judgment of the
Apex Court in <a href="/doc/39506072/" id="a_104">Devender Pal Singh v. State of NCT
of Delhi</a> [(2002) 5 SCC 234] for the proposition that 
confessional statement of the accused can be relied upon for the
purpose of conviction and no further corroboration is necessary, if
it relates to the accused himself.  However, as a matter of prudence
the court may look for  some corroboration if confession is to be
used against a co-accused though  that will be again within the
sphere of appraisal of evidence. A mere statement that requisite
procedures and safeguards were not observed or that statement was
recorded under duress of coercion, is really of no consequence. Such
a stand can be taken in every case by the accused after having given
the confessional statement.  It could not be shown as to why the
officials would falsely implicate the accused. There is a statutory
presumption under <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_105">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act that judicial and
official acts have been regularly performed.  The presumption that a
person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a police officer as
of other persons, and it is not a judicial approach to distrust and
suspect him without good grounds therefor.  Merely because the report
was sent directly to the Designated Court, it does not become a
suspicious circumstance. Rather, it adds to the authenticity of the
document. The purpose of the confessional statement being sent to the
court by producing the accused for confirmation of the statement is
to ensure that interpolation or manipulation is ruled out at a later
date.  Whenever an accused challenges that his confessional statement
is not voluntary, the initial burden is on the prosecution for it has
to prove that all requirements under section 15 of the TADA Act and
Rule 15 of the Rules have been complied with. Once this is done, the
prosecution discharges its burden and then it is for the accused to
show and satisfy the court that the confessional statement was not
made voluntarily.  No proof can be expected in all cases as to how
the mind of the accused worked in a particular situation.  If the
facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a confession
appeared to cast a doubt on the voluntariness of the confession, the
court may refuse to act upon the confession, even if it is admissible
in evidence. The question whether a confession is voluntary or not is
always a question of fact.

of Maharashtra v. Bharat Chaganlal Raghani</a> [AIR 2002 SC 409]
was relied upon for the proposition that Rule 15 of the TADA Rules
does not oblige the Magistrate either to open the envelope containing
the confessional statement recorded by the police officer or to
satisfy himself regarding the voluntary nature of the confession. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_286">20.2		<a href="/doc/1337792/" id="a_107">Abdul
Vahab Abdul Majid Shaikh v. State of Gujarat</a> etc. [(2007) 9 SCC 293]
 was relied upon to point out that the appellants therein had no case
that the procedure in recording confessional statement was in any way
violated. Merely because the confession was retracted, it may not be
presumed that the same was not voluntary. On consideration of
confessional statement, which was amply corroborated by other items
of evidence, the Court had no hesitation in accepting the same as
truthful and voluntary.

for the following observations:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_288">"51.
</p><p id="p_289">If the confessions of the appellants are scrutinized in the light of
the above enumerated factors, it becomes clear that the allegations
made by them regarding coercion, threat, torture, etc. after more
than one year of recording of confessions
are after-thought and products of ingenuity of their advocates. The
statements made by them under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_109">Section 313</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_110">Cr.P.C</a>. were also the
result of after thought because no tangible reason has been put
forward by the defense as to why the
appellant Nos.A-4 to A-8 did not retract from their confessions
when they were produced before the Magistrate at Ahmedabad and
thereafter despite the fact that they had access to legal assistance
in more than one way. Therefore, we hold that the trial Court did not
commit any error by relying upon the confessions of appellant Nos.A-4
to A-8 and A-10 and we do not find any valid ground to discard the
confessions of appellant Nos.A-4 to A-8 and A-10.

[(2010) 9 SCC 312], a case under TADA, Moulvi Farooq
was found in a pool of blood after three identified persons had gone
inside his room and sound of firing was heard and then the three
assailants had fled. After reference to several judgments on
confessions, the Apex Court observed: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_291">"64.	All
these cases suggest that the only test which the court has to apply
is whether the confession was voluntary and free of coercion, threat
or inducement and whether sufficient caution is taken by the police
officer who recorded the confession. Once the confession pases that
test, it can become the basis of the conviction. We are completely
convinced that the confession in this case was free from all the
aforementioned defects and was voluntary."

passage:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_293">"59.	In
light of the above the failure on the part of the investigating
officer in sending the bloodstained clothes to the FSL and the empty
cartridges to the ballistic expert would not be sufficient to reject
the version given by the eye-witnesses. That is especially so when a
reference to the ballistic expert would not have had much relevance
since the weapon from which the bullets were fired had not been
recovered from the accused and was not, therefore, available for
comparison by the expert."

cannot be said to be the last word on what he deposes or meant for

injuries to all the persons, including the deceased, were held to be
on account of firing from a height, it was held that the High Court

No.2 on the body of the deceased was not explained. According to the
doctor, the injury could not have been caused if the injured had not
raised his arm while walking. The High Court was of the view that
prosecution witnesses who were accompanying the deceased at the
relevant time had never stated that the deceased had at any point of
time raised his arm while walking or on being  challenged by the

<p id="p_300">"8.......
</p><p id="p_301">It is but quite natural that the deceased when
challenged would have reacted by raising his hands either in defence
or in accepting the challenge and in the process he would
have sustained injury No.2, as described. The reaction of the
deceased in raising his hands, in such circumstances, would be in
tune and in consonance with the natural human behaviour in ordinary
circumstances. There is not set of rule that one must react in a
particular way. The natural reaction of man is unpredictable. Every
one reacts in his own way. Such natural
human behaviour is difficult to be proved by credible evidence. It
has to be appreciated in the context of given facts and circumstances
of each case."

duly proved are admissible evidence irrespective of whether that
party making them appeared in the witness box or not and whether that
party when appearing as witness was confronted with those statements
in case it made a statement contrary to those admissions.

<p id="p_307">"39.	Thus,
the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction between

effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater
evidentiary value vis-a-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence
makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor
in the process of the evaluation of evidence. However, where the
medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all
possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence
may be disbelieved. "

<p id="p_309">"10.
</p><p id="p_310">   These injuries could not be caused in the manner and from the
place where assailants were alleged to be present at the time of
firing the gun shots, and the same are inconsistent with the
testimony of the eye witnesses and the site plan. We do not think it
necessary to discuss it in detail as the trial court has discussed
this question at length and we agree with those findings. According
to the testimony of Rajendra Singh and Chhotey Bhaiya PWs, when the
deceased got gun shot injuries, he was at a higher level at the well
whereas the assailants fired the shots from Bari, which was at lower
level by one foot from the road and the well was higher than the road
by two or two and a half feet. In this view if shots were fired from
Bari, at the deceased who was drinking water in a sitting posture,
the injuries in all likelihood would have been from lower part to
upper part but Dr. Jain deposed that direction of the injuries caused
by bullets was from upper part to lower part and the bullet was
antero-posteriorly. In the opinion of the doctor, the person who
caused injuries to the deceased was at higher level than the
deceased. This is wholly inconsistent with the testimony of
eye-witnesses. Though medical expert's opinion is not always final
and binding, but in the instant case it corroborates other
circumstances which indicate that the eyewitnesses had not seen the
actual occurrence."

cards. In criminal trials it is of prime importance for the accused
to know as to what the exact prosecution case is. If the pivot of the

Ram Narain v. State of Punjab</a> [AIR 1975 SC 1727],
it is held:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_322">"14.	Where
the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is totally
inconsistent with the medical evidence or the evidence of the
ballistic expert, this is a most fundamental defect in the
prosecution case and unless reasonably explained it is sufficient to
discredit the entire case. .......It is obvious that where the direct
evidence is not supported by the expert evidence, then the evidence
is wanting in the most material part of the prosecution case and it
would be difficult to convict the accused on the basis of such
evidence. While appreciating the evidence of the witnesses, the High
Court does not appear to have considered this important aspect, but
readily accepted the prosecution case without noticing that the
evidence of the eye witnesses in the Court was a belated attempt to
improve their testimony and bring the same in line with the Doctor's
evidence with a view to support an incorrect case."

<p id="p_323">22.		As
discussed earlier in para 14 and 15, the material evidence on record
could not support the conclusions drawn in the impugned judgment as
far as killing of Mr.Haren Pandya by A-1 was concerned. In the facts
of the present case, the medical and ballistic evidence could, by no
stretch, square with the ocular evidence which is found to be very
weak and fragile. In fact, by the inherent contradictions and
improbabilities contained in the version presented by the so-called
sole  eye-witness, his very status and presence as an eye-witness to
the incident of firing upon Mr.Haren Pandya have to be seriously
doubted.  And the medical and ballistic evidence having made the
ocular version utterly improbable and injury No.7 having completely
ruled out the possibility of firing upon Mr.Haren Pandya from the
small opening of the window of his car, the ocular evidence has to be
discarded as untrustworthy and unbelievable. It is unfortunate that
the investigating officer has hazarded his own guess in respect of
injury No.7  and it is accepted and adapted in the impugned judgment,
preferring it over the expert's opinion to the contrary. Similar is
the case with injury No.5, 6 and 1 wherein the total number of
bullets fired by the assailant is believed and accepted to be
restricted to five only
because there was no possibility of any bullet going anywhere except
the car itself and such additional bullets could not have escaped the
meticulous checking of the car.  The circumstances enumerated in para
16 herein further strengthen reasonable doubt about the proof of
firing upon Shri Haren Pandya  by A-1 in the manner in which the
prosecution has projected its case. No support could be lent  to the
weak and doubtful substantive evidence by the confessional statement
of A-1  insofar as reliability of that piece of evidence is shaken
both by its lack of veracity and voluntariness.  The prosecution case
is further weakened, as far as the murder of Shri Haren Pandya is
concerned, by the fact that the bullets recovered from his body  may
or may not be the same bullets which were examined by the ballistic
expert in view of the discrepancies found in their  description  by
the post-mortem doctor
and the ballistic expert. The opinion of the ballistic expert (PW.75)
has been already discredited and practically discarded  in the
impugned judgment (See para 13.12). Assuming that the confessional
statements of the accused persons have any evidentiary value,  it is
found to be unsafe to rely upon them as far as the facts stated
therein are not corroborated by other independent evidence. Under
such circumstances, one set of weak and doubtful evidence of the sole
eye-witness and the ballistic expert could not find corroboration and
support from other weaker pieces of evidence in the form of
confessional statements. In fact, the investigation clearly appears
to have been so botched up and misdirected that the confessional
statements recorded during police remand, before any police officer,
could not be safely relied for convicting any of the appellants for
commission of, abetment or conspiracy to commit, murder. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_324">23.		In
view of the concession made for the appellants, as recorded in para 6
herein, and in view of the voluminous record and number of
controversies about each piece of important evidence, it was found to
be unnecessary to deal with and discuss each and every argument
addressed by learned counsel on both sides. However, it is clarified
that we are unable to endorse the general conclusions drawn in para
32 of the impugned judgment, as reproduced in para-4 herein. It may
be pertinent to note here that A-6, A-7, A-8 and A-9, only after
whose arrest in April 2003 various POTA cases  sprang up, were
acquitted in the first tiffin bomb case and no appeal was filed from
their acquittal. What clearly stands out from the record of the
present case is that the investigation in the case of murder of Shri
Haren Pandya has all throughout been botched up and blinkered and has
left a lot to be desired.  The investigating officers concerned ought
to be held accountable for their inaptitude  resulting into
injustice, huge harassment of many persons concerned and enormous
waste of public resources and public time of the Courts.

<p id="p_325">24.		For
the reasons stated hereinabove, the charge for the offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_127">section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code is held to have not been
proved beyond reasonable doubt and hence the conviction for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_128">section 120-B</a> read with <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_129">section 302</a> of the
IPC and the charge for the offence under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_130">section 3</a>[1], punishable
under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_131">section 3</a>[2][a] of the POTA could not survive in respect of any
of the appellants and upon being acquitted of those charges, the
orders of sentence based on those charges are set aside and to that
extent, the appeals are partly allowed. In view of the concession
recorded in para 6 herein, the continuous incarceration of the
appellants concerned for more than 8 years,  all the appellants
except A.1 having no criminal background and having regard to the age
and role attributed to the other appellants, the following orders and
directions are issued:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_326">[A]	In
Criminal Appeal No. 986 of 2007, the conviction of the appellant -
Mohd. Asgarali  S/o. Mohd. Wajirbhai [original accused No. 1] for the

confirmed and maintained. The sentence awarded to him by the trial
Court in impugned judgment and order dated 25th June, 2007
for these offences is also maintained and upheld. Since he is not
separately sentenced for the offence punishable u/s.3[2][b] of POTA
by the trial Court, he shall also undergo R.I. for seven years and
pay fine of Rs.7,000/- and in default of payment of fine, he shall
undergo R.I. for eight months. All the sentences of imprisonment
shall run concurrently and he shall be entitled to the benefit of
set-off.

Maintaining the order of fine awarded by the trial Court, the
sentence of RI for 7 years is modified and reduced to the period
already undergone by him in jail. Since his sentence came to be
suspended and he was released on bail pending this appeal by the
order of Hon'ble the Apex Court, he shall not be required to
surrender to jail, provided  he has already paid the  fine awarded by
the trial Court. He shall be permitted to pay the amount of fine
within 15 days, if it is not already paid.

awarded to him, the appeal does not survive for any consequential
order.
