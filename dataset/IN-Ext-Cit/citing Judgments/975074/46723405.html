JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">[1.0]		Present
Second Appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(hereinafter referred to as "CPC") has been preferred by
the appellant herein - original defendants to quash and set
aside the impugned judgment and decree dated 26.12.1984 passed by the
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Navsari in Regular Civil Suit
No.127 of 1971 by which the learned trial Court decreed the said suit
in favour of the plaintiff and passed the decree for possession and
held that the plaintiffs to recover from the defendants peaceful
possession of the suit agricultural lands as well as the impugned
judgment and order passed by the learned Appellate Court -
learned District Judge, Valsad @ Navsari in Regular Civil Appeal
No.31 of 1985 by which the learned Appellate Court has dismissed the
said Appeal confirming the judgment and decree passed by the learned
trial Court. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">[2.0]		That
the original plaintiff instituted the Regular Civil Suit No.127 of
1971 in the Court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Navsari
against the appellants herein - original defendants for
recovery of the possession of the suit lands/ agricultural lands and
for damages.  It was the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that the
lands were being cultivated by the plaintiffs and there forefathers
as koshias since last three
generations.  It was also the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that
though the suit land did not belong to any private person or trust,
it was got registered under the Bombay Public Trust and behind
the back of the plaintiffs and without their knowledge.  It was also
the case on behalf of the plaintiffs that they have also got their
huts on the suit lands and residing in those huts.  It was the case
on behalf of the plaintiffs that they were also paying the land
revenue of the suit lands upto 1966.  It was also the case on behalf
of the plaintiffs that defendants forcibly took away the possession
of the suit land from the plaintiffs in the year 1966 which was
absolutely illegal and unauthorized.  It was the case on behalf of
the plaintiffs that in case they are considered to be the tenant of
the suit land in view of their cultivating the same since the time of
their forefathers, they have become the owners of the suit lands
under the law as well as by adverse possession.  Therefore, the
plaintiffs instituted the suit for aforesaid relief of possession. 
They have also prayed for damages/mesne profit of Rs.1000/- for use
and occupation of suit land for last three years.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">[2.1]		That
the suit was resisted by the defendants by filing written statement
at Exh.10 denying the allegations in the plaint.  It was also denied
that the plaintiffs were the tenants of the suit land and that they
have become the owners of the suit land under the Tenancy Act or by
adverse possession as alleged.  That the learned trial Court framed
following issues at Exh.12.  
</p>
 

 


 
	  


<p id="p_4">	Do
	plaintiffs prove that Ex. Baroda Government gave suit lands to them
	since last 3 generation for deriving their income, for rendering
	service to the said Government by way of filing in the cattle
	through at village Kolasna with water?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_5">	Do
	they prove that they have become owners of suit lands on abolition
	of service income?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_6">	Do
	they further prove that they have become owners of the suit land on
	the tiller's day under the provisions of Bombay Tenancy and
	Agricultural Lands Act?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_7">	Do
	they further prove that the defendants took forcibly possession of
	suit lands from them in 1966?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_8">	Do
	they prove that they are entitled to the income of the suit lands?
	If so, what amount?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_9">	Is
	the suit filed within time?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_10">	Is
	the present suit barred on account of the provisions of Bombay
	Revenue Jurisdiction Act?
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_11">	Is
	the present suit barred on account of the provisions of Bombay
	Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, insofar as it claims to recover
	possession of the suit lands? 
</p>	

 

 


 

<p id="p_12">[2.2]		It
appears that in view of Section 85 of Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural
Lands Act (hereinafter referred to as "Bombay Tenancy Act"),
issue whether the plaintiffs have become the owners of the suit land
on the tiller's day under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act was
referred to the Mamlatdar, Navsari Taluka for his decision under
Section 85A of the Bombay Tenancy Act and till then the learned trial
Court stayed the suit till final decision of tenancy authorities
under Section 85A of the said Act.  It appears that thereafter the
Mamlatdar &amp; ALT, Navsari held against the plaintiffs that the
plaintiffs are not the deemed purchasers under Section 32 of the
Bombay Tenancy Act.  However, it appears that against the order
passed by the Mamlatdar &amp; ALT, Navsari under Section 74 of the
Bombay Tenancy Act, plaintiffs preferred Tenancy Appeal Nos.59/1975
and 152/1975 before the Deputy Collector, Navsari and the Deputy
Collector by judgment and order dated 26.08.1975 allowed the said
appeals quashing and setting aside the orders passed by the Mamlatdar
&amp; ALT, Navsari by declaring that the plaintiffs have become the
owners of the suit lands on the tillers day under Section 32 of the
Bombay Tenancy Act and the Civil Court may be informed accordingly. 
It appears from the order passed by the Deputy Collector, Navsari in
aforesaid Tenancy Appeals that the Deputy Collector gave specific
findings that plaintiffs remained on the land till 1965 when they
were evicted forcibly.  It appears that the order passed by the
Deputy Collector, Navsari dated 26.08.1975 passed in aforesaid
Tenancy Appeal Nos.59/1975 and 152/1975 came to be confirmed by this
Court by judgment and order dated 07.03.1983 in Special Civil
Application No.1658/1977.  Therefore, the order passed by the Deputy
Collector declaring the plaintiffs to be the owners of the suit land
on tillers day under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act came to be
confirmed by the High Court.  Thereafter, the said decision was send
to the Civil Court and thereafter, the learned trial Court by
impugned judgment and decree has decreed the suit directing the
defendants to hand over the possession of the suit agricultural lands
to the plaintiffs.  Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the
judgment and decree dated 26.12.1984 passed by the learned Civil
Judge (Senior Division), Navsari in Regular Civil Suit No.127 of 1971
decreeing the suit for possession, the defendants preferred Regular
Civil Appeal No.31 of 1985 before the learned District Court, Valsad,
at Navsari and by impugned judgment and order dated 10.10.1986, the
Appellate Court has dismissed the said Appeal confirming the judgment
and decree passed by the learned trial Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13">[2.3]		Feeling
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order
passed by both the Courts below in decreeing the suit for possession
and directing the defendants to hand over the peaceful and vacant
possession of the agricultural lands to the plaintiffs, the
appellants herein - original defendants have preferred the
present Second Appeal under Section 100 of the CPC.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_14">[2.4]		While
admitting the present Second Appeal, the learned Single Judge has
framed the following substantial question of law to be considered in
the present Second Appeal. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_15">Having
regard to the provisions of section 32(1B) and section 68(c) and
Section 70(n) read with <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_1">section 85</a> of the B.T. &amp; A.L. Act, 1948,
whether Civil Court has jurisdiction to take measures for putting the
tenant into possession of the agricultural lands and/or whether where
a tenant who has been dispossessed as stated in <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_2">Section 32(1B)</a> of the
said Act, whether Civil Court has jurisdiction to hold an inquiry and
to direct that such land shall be restored to the tenant?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">[3.0]		Shri
Dhirendra Mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants - original defendants has made only one submission
that despite the fact that Mamlatdar &amp; ALT who is the competent
authority under the Bombay Tenancy Act declared the original
plaintiffs has tenant/deemed tenant/owner under Section 32 of the
Bombay Tenancy Act, still for recovery of the possession, the
plaintiffs have to approach the authority under the Bombay Tenancy
Act only as provided under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_3">Section 32(1B)</a> and Section 70(n) of the
Bombay Tenancy Act and therefore, in view of bar under Section 85 of
the Bombay Tenancy Act, the
Civil Court would not have any jurisdiction to pass the decree of
possession and directing the defendants to hand over the possession
of the suit agricultural lands to the plaintiffs.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">[3.1]		In
support of his above submissions, Shri Mehta, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the appellants has heavily relied upon Section
32(1B) of the Bombay Tenancy Act and has further submitted that where
a tenant who was in possession of the land on the pointed day and who
has been dispossessed by the landlord at any time before the specific
date otherwise than in the manner provided in <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_4">Section 29</a> or any other
provision of the said Act, in that case, the Mamlatdar shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in the said <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_5">Section 29</a> or any
other provision of the  Bombay Tenancy Act either suo
motu or on an
application of the tenant made within the prescribed period hold the
inquiry and direct that such land or as the case may be, part thereof
shall be taken from the possession of the landlord or as the case may
be, in succession in interest, and shall be restored to the tenant. 
Therefore, it is submitted that it is the duty of the Mamlatdar to
restore the possession to
such a tenant who has been dispossessed by the landlord and
therefore, the plaintiffs were required to approach the Mamlatdar &amp;
ALT for restoration of the possession as provided under Section
32(1B) of the Bombay Tenancy Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18">[3.3]		Shri
Mehta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants -
original defendants has also relied upon Section 70(n) of the Bombay
Tenancy Act by submitting that a duty is cast upon the Mamlatdar as
provided under Section 70(n) of the Bombay Tenancy Act to take
measures for putting the tenant or landlord or the agricultural
labourer or artisan into the possession of the land and therefore
also, considering bar under Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the
Civil Court shall not have any jurisdiction to pass an order to
restore the possession to the plaintiffs as tenants/who are declared
to be the owners of the land under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy
Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">[3.4]		In
support of his above submissions, Shri Mehta, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the appellants has heavily relied upon the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/975074/" id="a_6">Parmar
Kanaksinh Bhagwansinh (Dead) By LRs vs. Makwana Shanabhai Bhikhabhai
&amp; Anr</a>. reported in 1995(2)
GLR 1409 (Head-Note B, Para 16).
</p> 


<p id="p_20">	Making
above submissions and relying upon above decision, it is requested to
allow the present Second Appeal quashing and setting aside the
impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court
decreeing the suit for possession filed by the plaintiffs.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_21">[4.0]		Present
Second Appeal is opposed by Shri Motiramani, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the respondents - original plaintiffs. 
It is submitted that at the relevant time when the plaintiff
instituted the suit, there
was no provision under Section 32(1B) of the Bombay Tenancy Act.  It
is submitted that in any case and even otherwise the plaintiff
instituted the suit for recovery of the possession on the ground that
they are the owners of the agricultural lands and in the alternative
they prayed that as they were cultivating the agricultural lands upto
1965 and they were dispossessed forcibly, they have become the
tenants/owners under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act and
considering bar under Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the
learned Civil Court referred
the issue with respect to tenancy to Mamlatdar &amp; ALT and the
order passed by the revenue authority declaring the plaintiffs as
tenants/owners under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act came to be
confirmed by the High Court and the reference was accordingly
answered to the learned Civil Court and therefore, when it was found
that the plaintiffs were dispossessed forcibly and that they were
held to be the owners under section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act by
revenue authorities under the Bombay Tenancy Act, no illegality has
been committed by the learned Civil Court decreeing the suit for
possession and directing the defendants to hand over the peaceful and
vacant possession to the plaintiffs.  It is submitted that as such
provision of Section 32(1B) of the Bombay Tenancy Act which has been
inserted subsequently confers additional right upon the tenant who
was found to be in possession and cultivating the same on a
particular date to declare that he is the deemed purchaser / tenant
and for restoration of possession.  It is submitted that the bar
under Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act would be applicable with
respect to any dispute of tenancy which are required to be determined
by the tenancy authorities.  It is submitted that once the same is
answered by the tenancy authority in favour of the tenant, there
would not be any bar of the Civil Court to grant the relief of
possession.  It is submitted that at the most it can be said that the
powers of the Mamlatdar to restore the possession
would be over and above the powers of the Civil Court.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_22">[4.1]		Now,
so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Parmar Kanaksinh Bhagwansinh (Dead) By
LRs (Supra) by the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants is concerned, it is submitted that as such the aforesaid
decision would not be applicable to the facts of present case.  It is
submitted that on the contrary the same supports the case of the
plaintiffs that once the issue is answered by the tenancy
authorities, on a reference made by the Civil Court, thereafter the
Civil Court has to proceed further with the suit accordingly.  
</p>
 


<p id="p_23">	Making
above submissions, it is requested to dismiss the present Second
Appeal. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_24">[5.0]		Heard
learned advocates appearing for respective parties at length.  At the
outset it is required to be noted that the plaintiffs instituted the
suit before the Civil Court for the decree of possession submitting
that they are the owners of the suit agricultural lands in question
and that their forefathers were cultivating the same since many years
and that they cultivated upto 1965 and they were dispossessed by the
landlord forcibly.  It appears that in the alternative the plaintiffs
also submitted that as they were cultivating the agricultural lands
upto 1965 and they were dispossessed forcibly as such they have
become the tenants/owners under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act.
As the dispute whether the plaintiffs have become the tenants/deemed
tenants/owners under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act could not
have been decided by the Civil Court considering the bar under
Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act and the said issue was required
to be referred to the Mamlatdar &amp; ALT / Tenancy Act under Section
85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the said issue whether the plaintiffs
have become the owners of the suit land on the tiller's day under
Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act came to be referred to the
Mamlatdar &amp; ALT, Navsari.  It appears that Mamlatdar &amp; ALT
held against the plaintiffs, however, in appeals the Deputy Collector
held that the plaintiffs were cultivating the suit land in question
upto 1965 and that they were dispossessed forcibly by the landlord
without following procedure as required under the Tenancy Act and
consequently declared the plaintiffs as owners of the suit
agricultural land under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy
Act.  That the said order passed by the Deputy Collector came to be
confirmed by this Court in Special Civil Application No.1658/1977. 
That thereafter the Civil Court was answered the reference
accordingly.  Having found that the plaintiffs have become the owners
under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act and that they were
dispossessed by the landlord forcibly, the learned trial Court passed
a decree for possession in favour of the plaintiffs and directed the
defendants to hand over the peaceful and vacant possession to the
plaintiffs.  It is the case on behalf of the defendants that as the
Mamlatdar &amp; ALT is conferred with the power to restore the
possession to the tenants who have been dispossessed forcibly, in
exercise of powers under Section 32(1B) of the Bombay Tenancy Act
and/or it is the duty of the Mamlatdar to restore the possession to
the tenant / owners as provided under Section 70(n) of the Bombay
Tenancy Act, in view of Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, the
Civil Court would not have any jurisdiction to pass the decree for
possession and/or to restore the possession to the
plaintiffs/tenants/owners.  The aforesaid seems to be attractive but
has no substance.  On fair reading of Section 85 of the Bombay
Tenancy Act, it appears to the Court that a substantive dispute with
respect to the tenancy rights of the tenant and/or other rights are
to be adjudicated and decided by the tenancy authorities only and the
Civil Court would not have any jurisdiction and such an issue is
required to be referred to tenancy authorities / Mamlatdar under
Section 85 of the Bombay Tenancy Act. Once such an issue is answered
by the revenue authorities, thereafter the Civil Court is required to
proceed further with the suit.  Considering Section 85 of the Bombay
Tenancy Act, it appears that Civil Court has no jurisdiction to
decide the issue which the tenancy authorities are required to decide
under the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Act and if any such issue
arises, the Civil Court is required to stay the proceedings of the
suit and refer the said issue to the competent authority
under the Bombay Tenancy Act and thereafter on the basis of the
decision of the tenancy authority, the Civil Court is required to
proceed further with the suit accordingly.  Once the issue is
answered by the tenancy authorities and it is held that the
plaintiffs are the tenants/owners under Section 32 of the Bombay
Tenancy Act, thereafter the Civil Court is required to proceed
further with the suit and can pass an order to restore the possession
for which there will not be any bar under Section 85 of the Bombay
Tenancy Act.  It may be that under the Act, the Mamlatdar might have
been conferred with the duty to restore the possession to the tenant
but that does not mean that a Civil Court has no jurisdiction to pass
a decree for possession once it is held by the competent tenancy
authorities that the plaintiffs are the tenants/owners under the
provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Act and that they were dispossessed
forcibly and for restoration of the possession, the plaintiffs are
not required to again approach the tenancy authorities alone for
restoration of the possession.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_25">[5.1]		Now,
so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Parmar Kanaksinh Bhagwansinh (Dead) By
LRs (Supra) by the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
appellants - original defendants in support of his submissions
that Civil Court would not have any jurisdiction to pass an order to
restore the possession to the plaintiffs is concerned, considering
the aforesaid decision it appears to the Court that the said decision
would not be of any assistance and/or helpful and/or applicable to
the facts of the present case.  Even in the said decision, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has specifically held that if any suit
instituted in Civil Court involves the question of tenancy, the same
being required to be decided or dealt with by the authority competent
under the Bombay Tenancy Act, the Civil Court has to stay the suit
and refer the issue to Mamlatdar and after receiving
the decision thereon to dispose of the suit in accordance with such
decision, even section 85A of the Bombay Tenancy Act also provides
that if any suit involves any issues which are required to be
settled, decided or dealt with by any authority competent to settle,
decide or dealt with such an issue under the Bombay Tenancy Act, the
Civil Court shall stay the suit and refer such an issue to such
competent authorities for determination and on receipt of such
reference from the Civil Court, the competent authority shall deal
with and decide such issues in accordance with the provisions of the
Bombay Tenancy Act and shall communicate the decision to the Civil
Court and such Court there upon to dispose of the suit in accordance
with the procedure applicable thereto.  Thus, even considering the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Parmar
Kanaksinh Bhagwansinh (Dead) By LRs (Supra) as well as considering
Section 85A of the Bombay Tenancy Act, after the decision is
communicated by the competent authority under the Bombay Tenancy Act
and in the meantime the Civil suit is stayed, thereafter the Civil
Court is required to dispose of the suit on such decision and in
accordance with the procedure applicable thereto.  Under the
circumstances, it is held that once the issue with respect to the
tenancy/owner under Section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy Act came to be
answered in favour of the plaintiffs by the competent authority under
the Tenancy Act and the same has been communicated to the Civil Court
thereafter, the Civil Court is required to proceed further with the
suit and can pass an order to restore the possession to the
plaintiffs on the basis of the decision of the competent authority
under the Bombay Tenancy Act and for which bar under Section 85 of
the Bombay Tenancy Act would not be applicable.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">[5.1]		Under
the circumstances and considering the aforesaid facts and
circumstances, no illegality has been committed by the Courts below
in passing the decree of possession in favour of the plaintiffs and
directing the defendants to hand over the peaceful and vacant
possession of the agricultural suit land to the plaintiffs.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_27">[6.0]		In
view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present Second
Appeal fails and the same deserves to be dismissed and is,
accordingly, dismissed.  No costs.
