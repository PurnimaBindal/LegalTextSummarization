                      took it down in December. However, this resulted in Legal Notices being
                      sent by the defendants No. 2 &amp; 3 claiming that the Trade Mark            had
                      been registered by the defendant No.1, who had authorized the defendants
                      No.2 &amp; 3 to produce hair trimmers, hair clippers and hair dryers with the
                      said Trade Mark and therefore, the vending restored on their platform. In

                      Trade Mark was made in 2012 i.e., subsequent to the user by the plaintiff.
                      It was emphasized that the promotional expenses for            incurred by
                      the plaintiff in 2010-11 was Rs.15.13 crores and which had steadily
                      increased to Rs.131.78 crores in 2014-15. In 2012, the year in which the
                      application was filed by the defendant No.1 for registration of its Trade
                      Mark, the expenses incurred by the plaintiff was Rs.65.99 crores and
                      which further increased to Rs.103.96 crores in 2013. The total sales of the
                      plaintiff‟s goods under the Trade Mark            in the year 2010 in India
                      was about USD 86.3 million and in 2012, it was 212.6 million, which
                      rose to USD 288.8 million in 2015. Thus, even at the time when the
                      defendant No.1 sought to register its Trade Mark, the plaintiff was well-
                      established internationally and also             was a &quot;well-known&quot; and
                      reputed Trade Mark in India. It had also been ranked as one of the
                      world‟s most valuable brands by the Forbes Magazine and was ranked by
                      Interbrand Magazine as the 98th most valuable brand in the world, with a
                      brand valuation of USD 3.60 Billion.

                      4 were different from those of the plaintiff. In any case, the plaintiff was
                      entitled to be protected against passing off. Strength was drawn from the
                      provisions of Section 29(2) and (4) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 (for

                      that the goods were connected in the course of trade as both the electrical
                      and electronic appliances were usually sold in the same shop and there
                      was similarity in the Trade Marks, which clearly disclosed infringement,
                      while also resulting in passing off. Thus, registration by itself would not
                      give any rights to the defendants No.1 to 4 to use the Trade Mark of the
                      plaintiff unfairly, solely with the intention to get the benefit of the
                      goodwill of the plaintiff.

                      submitted that the products of the plaintiff and the defendants were very
                      different, while the registration of the Trade Mark of the plaintiff was in
                      Class 9 that of the defendant No.1 was in Class 8. The plaintiff
                      manufactured computer and computing products whereas, the defendant
                      No.1 was manufacturing only hair grooming products. It was submitted
                      that there was no substitutability of the products even if they were to be
                      sold in the same stores, as the customers would clearly differentiate
                      between the products. There was nothing confusing in the product lines.

                       was further submitted that in any case, these provisions of the T.M. Act
                      were attracted only when the alleged infringer was himself having no
                      registered Trade Mark whereas, in the present case, the defendant No.1
                      was the registered proprietor of the mark           . Under Section 31 of the
                      T.M. Act, registration was prima facie evidence of validity and even
                      under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_20">Section 28</a>, the defendant No.1 had a right to use the Trade Mark
                      even if it resembled the plaintiff‟s Trade Mark. It was further submitted
                      that in order to determine the conflicting claims of the plaintiff and the
                      defendant No.1, <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_21">Section 28(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_22">Section 30(2)(e)</a> and Section 124 of the
                      T.M. Act have to be read together, which required the plaintiff to
                      discharge a higher burden even at the interim stage to establish &quot;equities&quot;
                      in its favour. The rights protected under Section 28 of the T.M. Act was
                      subject to all other provisions of the Act and therefore, the rights that
                      vested in defendant No.1 would act as a limitation on the plaintiff‟s
                      rights.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                      18.       It was submitted that for the last six years, the plaintiff had taken
                      no steps to question the validity of the Trade Mark of the defendant No.1
                      and had chosen to file the challenge in the form of a Cancellation Petition
                      just prior to the filing of the suit. Since that matter was still pending, as
                      on date, both, the plaintiff as well as defendant No.1, had registered Trade
                      Marks in their favour and therefore, against each other, even in respect of
                      identical or similar marks or products, they were at par.

                      that the registration itself was invalid and that there was an infringement,
                      but the plaintiff had failed to point out prima facie that the Trade Mark
                      registered in the name of the defendant No.1 was invalid. Therefore too,
                      no interim directions ought to be issued against the defendants No.1 to 4.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                      20.    It was the further submission of the learned counsel for the
                      defendants No.1 to 4 that it is not the case of the plaintiff that it was
                      producing hair trimmers or hair clippers. Under Section 34 the T.M. Act,
                      it would be the defendants No.1 to 4 who would be considered as &quot;prior
                      user&quot; in respect of these products in Class 8. Since the Trade Mark of the
                      plaintiff was registered in respect of Class 9, the registration could not
                      have been refused. Therefore, the defendant No.1 could not be prevented
                      from using his registered Trade Mark.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                      21.    Learned counsel submitted that Section 29(1) of the T.M. Act was
                      not attracted as the goods were not comparable, allied or cognate. <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_23">Section
                      29(2)</a> (a) (b) and (c) refers to three different situations, which were also
                      not applicable here since the goods were neither similar nor identical,
                      though there may be identity and similarity in the Trade Mark. Therefore,
                      the presumption available under Section 29(3) of the T.M. Act was not
                      available in the present case. As regards Section 29(4) of the T.M. Act,
                      the learned counsel submitted that the clauses were to be read
                      conjunctively i.e., that the goods are dissimilar, that the plaintiff‟s Trade
                      Mark had &quot;reputation&quot; and that the defendant was using the same
                      „without due cause‟. According to him, the plaintiff had not established
                      any &quot;reputation&quot; in India. Moreover, since the defendant No.1 was the

                       registered proprietor of his Trade Mark, his use of the same could not be
                      described as „without due cause‟. Thus, since the conjunctive
                      requirements of Section 29(4) of the T.M. Act have not been met, no case
                      under Section 29(4) of the T.M. Act was also made out.
</p>
<p id="p_44">                      22.    Learned counsel stressed on the difference between the words,
                      &quot;reputation&quot;, &quot;goodwill&quot; and &quot;well-known&quot;, since they were all
                      specifically defined. It was submitted that under Section 29(4) of the
                      T.M. Act, the plaintiff has to establish not mere &quot;reputation&quot;, but &quot;well-
                      known reputation&quot; in India, which was certainly a higher standard. Under
                      Section 11(2) of the T.M. Act, only when an existing Trade Mark was
                      &quot;well-known&quot; that registration would be refused. Had the plaintiff‟s
                      Trade Mark been so &quot;well-known&quot;, it would have been natural for the
                      Trade Mark Registry to have refused the registration of the defendant
                      No.1. But, since it was allowed, a prima facie conclusion would have
                      been reached by the Registrar that the plaintiff‟s Trade Mark was not so
                      &quot;well-known&quot; and there was no &quot;distinctiveness&quot; or &quot;reputation&quot; of the

<p id="p_45">                      23.    Since the plaintiff was required to prove the &quot;well-known
                      reputation&quot; and &quot;distinctiveness&quot;, a trial was essential and there was no
                      reason to grant any interim relief without such proof and on a
                      presumption. Further, as an application was required under Rule 124 of
                      the Trade Marks Rules, 2017, on the basis of which the Registrar would
                      determine whether a mark was &quot;well-known&quot; or not under <a href="/doc/1797427/" id="a_24">Section 11(6)</a>,
                      this again was a matter of trial. It was also argued, relying on the

                      Court] that there was consistency of thought that although <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_25">Section 29(4)</a>
                      uses the word &quot;reputation&quot;, it actually meant &quot;well-known&quot; Trade Mark,
                      and the two words connote different things.

<p id="p_46">                      24.    With regard to the judgments relied upon by the plaintiff to seek
                      interim relief, learned counsel for the defendants No.1 to 4 submitted that
                      in these cases, except Bloomberg (supra), none of the defendants had a
                      registered Trade Mark in their names whereas, in the present case, the
                      defendant No.1 had a registered Trade Mark and that too, in a different
                      class. Further reliance has been placed on <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_26">Nandhini Deluxe v. Karnataka
                      Coop. Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a>., (2018) 9 SCC 183 to submit that
                      even if the name was the same, if the products were different and could
                      be easily differentiated, there would be no confusion arising and no
                      injunction could be granted. It was submitted that since all other
                      judgments relied upon by the plaintiff preceded the judgment in
                      Nandhini Deluxe (supra), therefore, this Court ought to follow the
                      judgment of the Supreme Court in Nandhini Deluxe (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_47">                      25.    The decision in Bloomberg (supra) was distinguished on the
                      ground that the plaintiff here, by inaction had allowed the defendant No.1
                      to operate for seven long years whereas, in Bloomberg (supra),
                      immediate action was taken to restrain the mala fide use of the Plaintiff&#x27;s
                      registered trade mark „BLOOMBERG‟.

                      (1997) 4 SCC 201 to submit that when the registered proprietor was not
                      using the Trade Mark for products other than cigarettes, it could not
                      prevent others from using the said Trade Mark of &quot;Charminar&quot;,
                      particularly after a lapse of almost 20 years. On the same basis, it was
                      submitted that the defendant No.1 also had vested rights since the
                      plaintiff had not used       or       for grooming products and raised no
                      objection for the use of the same in sale of grooming products by the
                      defendants No.1 to 4. Thus, in short, the learned counsel submitted that
                      no case for infringement was made out.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                      27.    Turning to the question of passing off, once again it was submitted
                      that it was a question of trial as the plaintiff would have to establish that
                      its registered Trade Mark was &quot;well-known&quot;. Having allowed the
                      defendant No.1 to continue its manufacturing and sale of grooming
                      products under the Trade Mark          , the equities were in favour of the
                      defendant No.1. The absence of interim orders would cause no loss to the
                      plaintiff inasmuch as they were not producing goods in Class 9 and the
                      defendants No.1 to 4 were not producing any goods in Class 8. There is
                      no possibility of confusion. The plaintiff had no &quot;goodwill&quot; in respect of
                      grooming products and the plaintiff having had no sales whatsoever in
                      hair trimmers and grooming products could not claim to have built any
                      &quot;goodwill&quot; in that area. The plaintiff had to also show that the name
                      was synonymous to its goods. Thus, there was no pleading to establish
                      passing off. Finally, the learned counsel submitted that the defendants
                      would give an assurance that they would not be producing any goods in

<p id="p_50">                      28.    In rejoinder, Mr. Hemant Singh, learned counsel for the plaintiff,
                      submitted that the plaintiff has in fact established a prima facie case of
                      passing off and was clearly entitled for injunction. The plaintiff was
                      required to establish &quot;goodwill&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; in respect of its Trade
                      Mark and not in respect of the goods that were traded under that Trade
                      Mark and therefore, it was immaterial whether the goods were different.
                      The brand was important only as a &quot;source identifier&quot; and as an assurance
                      to quality. Therefore, irrespective of the identity of the goods produced,
                      in respect of which the Trade Mark was sought, if the plaintiff was able
                      show that the defendant No.1 was using similar or identical marks to sell
                      its products, it was sufficient for establishing passing off. Reliance has
                      been placed on the judgment in T.V. Venugopal (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_51">                      29.    It was urged that on the basis of the volume of sales and
                      expenditure on advertisement, etc., the plaintiff had also established the
                      &quot;goodwill&quot; acquired by their Trade Mark even in 2012, though the
                      defendant No.1 had started to use the Trade Mark only in 2014. The
                      defendants No.1 to 4, on the other hand, had not discharged their onus of
                      showing the volume of sales since 2014. Since the sales seem to be
                      negligible, even as reflected by the small number of invoices relied upon
                      by the defendants No.1 to 4, it did not catch the eye of the plaintiff and
                      therefore, there is no delay in approaching the court.

                      advertised by the defendants No.1 to 4 are hair trimmers, straighteners,
                      clippers, and to say that       stood for high-tech clippers, was reflective
                      of dishonest adoption of the &quot;well-known&quot; brand of the plaintiff. There
                      has been also no explanation why the defendants had hyperlinked their
                      website with that of the plaintiff, except to mislead the prospective
                      purchasers to believe that the products originated from the plaintiff. As
                      regards the registration of the defendants‟ Trade Mark, it was ex facie
                      invalid under <a href="/doc/1557843/" id="a_27">Section 11(3)</a>. It was argued that till registration existed, the
                      provisions of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_28">Section 29(4)</a> may not be attracted, but read with provisions
                      of <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_29">Section 28(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/1557843/" id="a_30">11(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_31">124(5)</a> at the interim stage, the plaintiff could
                      claim protection. Finally, it was submitted that since this was not a case
                      of honest concurrent use, the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra) was not
                      applicable here. The judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the
                      defendants have also been distinguished.

                      was submitted that since more companies manufactured multiple
                      products, such as, in this case, i.e. computing products and grooming
                      products, there was likelihood of confusion that the plaintiff was also
                      producing not only mobile handsets, etc., but also hair-trimmers, etc..
                      These are sold in the same shops and e-commerce platforms and
                      unsuspecting customers may draw an incorrect conclusion of origin.
                      There was every likelihood of confusion even though the products were
                      different. Thus, both for infringement as well as passing off, the plaintiff

<p id="p_54">                      32.    The learned counsel further submitted that since the defendant
                      No.1 has neither filed the written statement nor reply, a decree may be
                      passed under Order VIII Rule 10 CPC against the defendant No.1. It was
                      submitted that in the facts of the present suit, before the suit is stayed,
                      injunction under Section 124(5) of the T.M. Act ought to be granted.

</p><p id="p_56">                      33.    It is to be noted, at the outset, that in the present matter, before the
                      filing of the suit, an application for rectification/cancellation has already
                      been filed by the plaintiff on 16th March, 2020, which is pending. Under
                      Section 124(1)(i) of the T.M. Act, the present suit has to be stayed
                      pending final disposal of such rectification/cancellation proceedings.
                      However, as pointed out by learned counsel for the plaintiff and rightly
                      conceded to by the learned counsel for the defendants No.1 to 4, under
                      Section 124(5) of the T.M. Act, the court is not precluded from making
                      any interlocutory order, including any order granting an injunction
                      directing accounts to be kept, appointing a Receiver or attaching property,
                      during the period of the stay of the suit. Therefore, this Court will now
                      proceed to consider whether the plaintiff has disclosed a case for an
                      interlocutory order, namely, an injunction against the defendants

                      However, that does not fall within the ken of the civil courts which must
                      await the decision of the IPAB (now the High Court IP Division) in the
                      rectification proceedings. This is clear from the provisions of Section 124
                      of the T.M. Act. A Full Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/69071842/" id="a_32">Data Infosys Ltd. v.

                             Trademarks Act does not control the choice of a litigant to

                             situation, if such plea exists, before the filing of the suit, the
                             Court has to stay the suit to await the decision of the IPAB.
                             In the second situation, if there is no application for
                             rectification before the IPAB when the suit is filed and a
                             party to the infringement suit, wishes to challenge it after the
                             filing of the suit, it may do so, but the court has to assesses
                             the tenability of the invalidity plea-if it finds it prima facie
                             tenable, then and then alone, would it stay the suit to enable
                             the party to approach the IPAB within a time period. If the
                             party does not avail of this, or approaches the IPAB after
                             the period given, the court would proceed with the suit; the
                             plea of invalidity is deemed abandoned in the infringement
                             suit.

<p id="p_59">                             3. The appeal is, accordingly remitted for consideration of
                             the merits by the concerned roster Division Bench on
                             11.02.2016, subject to the orders of Hon&#x27;ble the Chief

                      needs to consider whether any interim order is required to be passed
                      under Section 124(5) of the T.M.Act. The point to be noted is that in the
                      present case, both Trade Marks have been registered. This is unlike in the
                      several of the cases cited by both sides, where a registered proprietor was
                      seeking relief against the defendants, who were yet to obtain registration
                      or had applied for the same or invovled situations where, having once
                      been granted, the registration was cancelled at the time the suit was filed.

                       placed by the learned counsel for the defendants, the Supreme Court
                      underlined that it was not considering infringement but only rectification.
                      In some of the cases while there was similarity of the Trade Marks, the
                      nature of the goods were different and in others they were of the same
                      kind, such as medicines. Ultimately, every case is to be decided on its
                      own facts, though the tests laid down by the courts in the cases relied
                      upon by both sides would no doubt be invaluable for deciding the
                      questions as to whether there would be deception or confusion or an
                      attempt at passing off or infringement of registered Trade Marks. In the
                      present case, since both the Trade Marks are registered, all the facts
                      would have to be considered holistically to determine whether or not the
                      plaintiff is entitled to interim protection.

<p id="p_61">                      36.    Before considering the cited case law, it may be useful to refer to
                      the provisions of law. The rights conferred under Section 28 of the T.M.
                      Act to the registered proprietor of a Trade Mark upon its registration,
                      namely, the exclusive right to use it in relation to the goods and services
                      in respect of which the Trade Mark is registered, is limited where there
                      are two or more such registered proprietors, as they cannot claim
                      exclusive use against each other, but have those rights against other
                      persons. Concurrent registration of the same or similar Trade Mark by
                      two or more persons is not per se barred under the Act. When a challenge
                      is raised to the registration, ordinarily till the Register is rectified and
                      such registration is cancelled, both the proprietors would be entitled to
                      claim a right to its use.

                      raised by learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff has

<p id="p_64">                      39.    But again, this Section is applicable only against a defendant, who
                      does not have proprietorship in a registered Trade Mark. Would that
                      mean that the court when faced with a situation as prevailing in the
                      present case, would be helpless and would it also mean that the plaintiff
                      could seek only protection against passing off. This Court is of the
                      opinion that since <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_43">Section 124</a> deals with a situation where the validity of
                      the registration of the trade mark is being questioned and <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_44">Section 124(5)</a>
                      empowers the court to pass interim injunction orders, it is only logical
                      that even when there are two registered Trade Marks involved and the
                      plaintiff seeks protection against the user of a similar or identical trade
                      mark, which has been registered in the defendant‟s name, the court can
                      consider not just the question of passing off, but also of infringement
                      since Section 124 of the T.M. Act is in relation to a trade mark and not to
                      mere passing off. That is why, where no rectification application has been
                      filed, the civil court can determine the tenability of the plea of invalid
                      registration. In other words, the court can consider the existence of a
                      prima facie case on the same basis, to decide whether or not to grant
                      interim orders of injunction, etc..

<p id="p_65">                      40.    Thus, as a corollary, while determining the question of the
                      existence of a &quot;prima facie case&quot; or &quot;irreparable loss&quot; or &quot;balance of
                      convenience&quot;, the court could seek some assistance from those provisions

<p id="p_70">                      43.    It was submitted that „HTC‟ stood for „High Tech Computers‟
                      manufactured and sold by the plaintiff since 2006, and over a period of
                      time, when these became &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;well-known&quot; amongst the
                      consumers, the company‟s corporate name itself was changed to „HTC‟,
                      being the initial alphabets of „High Tech Computers‟. The name „HTC‟
                      itself has thus gained immense recognition and popularity and indicates
                      the origin of the products of the plaintiff. In contrast, is the lame
                      explanation offered on behalf of the defendants that their HTC stood for
                      High Tech Trimmers and Clippers, and that they have started use only in
                      2013, and are thus &quot;subsequent user&quot;. As rightly pointed out by the
                      learned counsel for the plaintiff, these alphabets do not adequately stand
                      for the products of the defendants, as it would then be &quot;HTTC&quot;. It is
                      clear, whereas the plaintiff has a logical explanation for using random
                      alphabets in their Trade Mark, which, in course of time, has acquired a
                      distinctiveness leading to even a change in the corporate name, the
                      defendants have none. The only inference that can be drawn is that the
                      defendants sought to sail with the plaintiff‟s &quot;to gain unfair advantage&quot;,
                      and such adoption by the defendants of the plaintiff‟s Trade Mark is

                      became an indicator of the origin of the goods of the plaintiff, being
                      directly relatable to their corporate name. In other words, the quality of
                      the goods led to the reputation of the trade mark HTC, which thus became
                      an indicator of the origin of the goods. The action of the defendants, on
                      the other hand, has no valid explanation and under no circumstance, can
                      be taken as indicative of the origin of the products of the defendants. In
                      fact, their action is not in accordance with the honest practices in
                      industrial or commercial matters and rather is an act clearly to take unfair
                      advantage of the repute of the plaintiff‟s trade mark. No benefit can be
                      claimed under Section 30(2)(e) of the T.M. Act, as the use permitted
                      thereunder is governed by <a href="/doc/1863142/" id="a_55">Section 30(1)</a> (a)&amp;(b) of the T.M. Act, which

                       the defendants actually desired to dishonestly ride on the reputation of the
                      plaintiff by using an identical Trade Mark. It is also to be noted that while
                      the defendant No.1 is the proprietor of the trade mark               , in the
                      advertisement as well as in the products of the defendants, it is the „       ‟
                      mark that was used, which is clearly a copy of the registered Trade Mark
                      of the plaintiff. To now offer to use only its registered Trade Mark, is
                      insufficient to exonerate this dishonesty of the defendants. By providing a
                      link to the plaintiff‟s site from that of the defendants, their intent to blur
                      the source and origin of the goods is established. Thus, no protection
                      under Section 30 of the T.M. Act is available to the defendants for use of
                      their registered Trade Mark.

<p id="p_73">                      46.    In fact the lame explanation offered for the adoption of the random
                      alphabets „HTC‟ and the copying of the exact trade mark of the plaintiff,
                      namely,        /     , prima facie discloses dishonest use and bad faith,
                      writ large in the use and adoption of these Trade Marks by the

                      not only infringement, but passing off was also not made out, this

                       ground to injunct the use of a similar Trade Mark by the defendant.
                      Though it is true that &quot;Philips &amp; Co.&quot; produces both products i.e.,
                      computer products as well as grooming products, that fact situation
                      cannot exclude the application of that decision to the facts of the present
                      case, since it is common to find companies producing and marketing a
                      large number of disparate products under a single registered Trade Mark.
                      For a consumer of average intelligence and observation, it may not be
                      difficult to believe that the hair grooming products of the defendants with
                      the Trade Mark        and link to the website of the plaintiff, were actually
                      being produced and marketed by the plaintiff. This being an act of
                      deception and creation of confusion, is against even public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_75">                      48.    Returning to the provisions of the T.M. Act, it is more than clear
                      that were it a question before the Registrar of Trade Marks, the
                      defendants would have not succeeded in getting that trade mark registered
                      as apart from the identical nature of the trade marks, its adoption has been
                      dishonest, against commercial practice and with an intent to cause
                      confusion in the public that the products are originating from the same
                      company. But since that is a question that would be appropriately
                      considered in the rectification proceedings, suffice it to note that the
                      prima facie existence of the factors that would negate the rights of the
                      defendants would establish a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff for
                      an injunction even in respect of a registered trade mark, as in the present
                      case. Though, an argument was advanced by the learned counsel for the
                      defendants that under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_58">Section 29(4)</a>, the registered trade mark had to have
                      a &quot;well-known&quot; reputation in India, this Court finds no reason to read into

                       <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_59">Section 29(4)</a>, the need to have the plaintiff establish prima facie, that its
                      registered Trade Mark is &quot;well-known&quot; as defined by Section 2(z)(g) of
                      the T.M. Act, before protection is extended on the ground of the

                      similar or an identical trade mark for their goods.
</p>
<p id="p_76">                      49.    In fact, in <a href="/doc/599732/" id="a_60">Ashok Leyland Limited v. Blue Hills Logistics Pvt. Ltd.
                      &amp; Anr</a>., 2011 (46) PTC 535 (Mad.), an exhaustive discussion has been
                      made of what would constitute reputation as required under Section 29(4)
                      of the T.M. Act. It was concluded, after referring to various judgments,
                      including of the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court, that
                      &quot;goodwill&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; cannot be held to be directly proportionate to
                      the turnover or the net profits earned in business. &quot;Turnover&quot; is only an
                      indication of success and may be one of the several factors that may
                      reveal &quot;goodwill&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot;. The court was of the view that
                      &quot;<a href="/doc/722547/" id="a_61">Section 24(4)(c)</a> does not expect the registered trade mark of the
                      plaintiff to have become a well-known Trade Mark within the meaning of
                      <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_62">Section 2(1)(z)(g)</a>&quot; and as what was only required was that the registered
                      Trade Mark had acquired a &quot;reputation in India&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_77">                      50.    Thus, the argument of the learned counsel for the defendants that
                      since the plaintiff has not sold one hair trimmer of clipper in India, having
                      not produced one, they did not have a reputation in India which could be
                      protected under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_63">Section 29(4)</a> or against passing off, is without
                      foundation. This argument of the learned counsel for the defendants was
                      countered by learned counsel for the plaintiff by submitting that
                      reputation can be a spill-over and even if the products were not available

                      the existing reputation built up by the plaintiff for its computer products

                              It can even be a spill over in India of the international

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                              (b) It is not necessary for the Plaintiff to actually show the

                              able to establish that it enjoys a spill over reputation in
                              India. In other words, the reputation of a product may
                              precede its introduction and may exist without trade of the

                                trademark, I also find the element of balance of
                                convenience to be satisfied in the present case. The
                                registration of the mark of the plaintiff is over 90 years
                                prior to the claimed commencement of the use by the
                                defendant. Even if the defendant, at the time of
                                commencing the use, did not know of the inherent risk in
                                adopting the well-known trade mark, the defendant, at
                                least, immediately on applying for registration and on
                                opposition being filed by the plaintiff became aware of
                                the perils in such use. Thus, use by the defendant of the
                                mark is for short time only and use during the period of
                                opposition is of no avail. The mark has got no relation to
                                the jewellery being marketed by the defendants. Unless
                                the defendant is deriving any advantage of the
                                goodwill/brand value of the plaintiff and which it is not
                                entitled to, it ought not to make any difference in the
                                business of the defendants if the said jewellery is sold
                                under a mark other than ROLEX.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_86">                      54.    The situation is the same in the present case. The unfair and
                      dishonest use of the identical trade mark by the defendants for their
                      products clearly riding on the reputation of the plaintiff with clear intent
                      to take unfair advantage of the reputation, cannot, but lead to, a
                      detrimental effect on the distinctive character of the trade mark of the

                      and subsequently, itself becoming the corporate name of the plaintiff
                      company.

<p id="p_87">                      55.    Learned counsel for the defendant No.1 submitted that there were
                      no averments in the plaint regarding passing off and that in any case
                      &quot;goodwill&quot; had not been established, but the fact remains that from the
                      sales figures of the plaintiff‟s goods in India in 2010 of about USD 86.3
                      million, which rose to USD 288.8 million in 2015, it is established that
                      the plaintiff‟s Trade Mark is &quot;well-known&quot; and there is &quot;goodwill&quot; in
                      respect of its goods. Considering the fact, as noticed above, that the same
                      company may produce different products that are seemingly unconnected
                      and dissimilar and not cognate, it is possible for a common consumer to
                      believe that the products of the defendants were originating from the
                      plaintiff and thus, though the &quot;goodwill&quot; is qua the specific products of
                      the plaintiff, would still be available to enhance the sale of the
                      defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_88">                      56.    Therefore, the plaintiff has disclosed a prima facie case not only
                      for infringement of the Trade Mark (drawing assistance from the
                      parameters provided under Section 29(4) of the T.M. Act), but also for
                      passing off. The damage caused to the plaintiff would be irreparable as
                      the continued use of the registered Trade Mark of the defendant No.1
                      would ultimately result in dilution of the Trade Mark and that too, on
                      account of „dishonest use‟. The &quot;balance of convenience&quot; lies in favour of
                      the plaintiff inasmuch as the products of the defendants have been
                      launched only lately and the invoices show that these products have been
