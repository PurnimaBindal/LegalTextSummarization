</pre><p id="p_1">1.     Plaintiff Varun Gems filed the suit for permanent injunction
restraining the infringement of trade mark, passing off, unfair trade dealing,
rendition of accounts of profits, damages etc. against two defendants namely
Precious Jewels and Ravi Rakyan.            The suit along with the interim
application was listed before Court on June 01, 2012. Summons in the suit
were issued and in the interim application, a detailed order was passed
against the defendants by issuance of an ex parte ad-interim injunction
whereby they were restrained from using the name RAKYAN and/or any
other deceptively similar trade mark to the plaintiff‟s trade mark.             Upon
service, the defendants on August 1, 2012 filed the written statement, reply
to the injunction application along with three applications, being
I.A.No.14054/2012 under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and

 Order XXXIX, Rule 4 CPC, I.A.No.14055/2012 under Order VII, Rule 11
CPC and I.A.No.14056/2012 under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_2">Section 124</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
1999. Notice of these applications was issued for August 30, 2012. Time
was granted to file the replies to the fresh applications filed by the
defendants. The matter was also heard by the learned Single Judge from
time to time. When the matter was listed on November 30, 2012, it was
renotified for March 5, 2013. Aggrieved with the said order as well as ex-
parte ad-interim order granted on June 1, 2012, the defendants have filed the
present appeal, inter alia, on the ground that they are suffering tremendous
loss because of continuation of interim order passed against them which
otherwise is not sustainable. The prayer in the appeal is made to set aside
the     impugned      ex-parte   order    dated     June   1,   2012   passed      in
I.A.No.11250/2012 under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 &amp; 2 CPC.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The appeal was listed before us on December 19, 2012 along with the
interim application. Dasti notice was issued for service of the plaintiff who
appeared before us on December 21, 2012. Learned counsel for both the
parties made a statement that instead of hearing of the present appeal, the
pending       interim     applications,     being      I.A.No.11250/2012          and
I.A.No.14054/2012, be heard by this Bench and order be passed on those
applications.

       Jaipur and opened "RAKYAN JEWELLERS" in partnership with his
       uncles. The said shop mainly catered to foreign tourists and was
       restricted to Jaipur only. In 1970 Surendra Kumar Rakyan separated
       from this partnership with his uncles and started a new business under
       the name "SURENDRA RAKYAN" at Hotel Ashok, Jaipur and
       "DEEPAK BROTHERS" also at Jaipur.           The shop "SURENDRA
       RAKYAN" closed down after few years. He also retired from his

       KUMAR &amp; CO." took a shop (L-79) in Hotel Hyatt Regency, New
       Delhi, on licence, however, started the shop there in 1983 by changing
       its name to "SITAL DASS SONS". In the year 1984, the said firm
       obtained a license of another shop at L-81, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New

        RAKYAN‟ on March 27, 2012.              The present suit was filed on
       May 30, 2012 by the plaintiff.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">The case of the Defendants
</p><p id="p_12">4.     The main case of the defendants in the written statement, reply and
application under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 CPC is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       a. The defendants are prior continuous user of the trade mark
           RAKYAN which is a surname of the defendant No.2.                    The
           defendants are using the said name since 1986 in the jewellery
           business dealing in stones, gold, silver jewelries, bullions,
           diamonds, gold jewelries, gem jewelries, imitation jewelries etc.
       b. The trade mark/trade name RAKYAN is a surname and the same is
           therefore protectable under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_3">Sections 34</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_4">35</a> of the Act. The suit
           filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable.
       c. The registration of the plaintiff is bad under various provisions of
           the Trade Mark Act, 1999. The defendants are therefore entitled to
           use the trade mark/trade name NEEA &amp; RAVI RAKYAN.
       d. The trade mark registration obtained by the plaintiff is liable to be
           rectified as the defendant has already filed the rectification under
           <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_5">Section 57</a> read with <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_6">Section 125</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999
           which is pending for consideration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       e. The defendants also averred that the plaintiff is guilty of
           concealment of material fact pertaining to the prior use of the trade
           mark RAKYAN by the defendants as in January 1986 when
           defendant No.2 son of Rajendra Rakyan, started his business in
           partnership with his mother Trishla Rakyan with trade name/trade
           mark „RAKYAN GEMS‟ at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New
           Delhi, Jitendra Rakyan, managing partner of the plaintiff who had

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 5 of 34</span>
            full knowledge about the said business, even signed the partnership
           deed dated July 14, 1998 as an attesting witness.
       f. The other defence raised by the defendants is that the suit filed by
           the unregistered firm is not maintainable under <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_7">Section 69(2)</a> of the
           Partnership Act, 1932 which spells out the effect of non-
           registration.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">The case of the Plaintiff
</p><p id="p_14">5.     Mark RAKYAN is not a common family name.                The plaintiff is
holding the registration of the trade mark RAKYAN‟S FINE JEWELLERY
bearing No.1338163 in Class 14 as of February 2, 2005 claiming user since
September 2000. The mark RAKYAN is an essential and integral part of the
plaintiff‟s registration. The plaintiff is also holding copyright registration
bearing No.A-74467/2005. The plaintiff has participated in various
exhibitions, national or international, from the year 2001. Plaintiff is also
carrying on its main business from M-31, M Block Market, Greater Kailash-
I.
</p><p id="p_15">6.     It was alleged by the plaintiff against the defendants that subsequent
to the closure of the defendants‟ shop at Square One Mall, the defendants
rented a new shop at M-32 in September, 2011 i.e. right next to the
plaintiff‟s premises at M-31. Being a family member, the defendant No.2
was requested not to use the name RAKYAN in relation to the similar
business as the same would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of
customers. According to the plaintiff, the defendants agreed to the said
request and started business at M-32, Greater Kailash-I, under the name of
DIAMEZ in the first week of December 2011. However, during the national
strike of jewellers in the last week of March 2012, the defendants
intentionally and fraudulently and in a clandestine manner changed the name


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 6 of 34</span>
 of the shop from DIAMEZ to NEENA &amp; RAVI RAKYAN and also put
similar boards on the side elevation, on both sides in the veranda and on the
top of show windows facing the street. The said act of the defendants
amounts to cause confusion and deception and also to encash the goodwill
and reputation generated by the plaintiff. Since the shop of the defendants is
located right to the next door of the plaintiff and they are dealing in the
identical business of jewellery, therefore, the defendants are passing off their
business as that of plaintiff under the common law and also infringing the
trade mark RAKYAN which is essential part of registered trade mark of the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_16">7.     Mr.Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the plaintiff, has made his submission that as far as the use of the name
RAKYAN GEMS at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New Delhi, is concerned,
there was no commercial user of the said name. There is no continuous prior
user as alleged by the defendants. The said shop mainly exporting goods
under the name RAKYAN GEMS after obtaining the sales tax numbers in
few countries including Japan. But there was no commercial user in the
market in any manner as the said shop was only restricted to Hotel Hyatt
Regency. The plaintiff still has no objection if the said business is carried on
by the defendants at the same place in the same manner till the final decision
of the suit.    It is also disputed by him that his client has signed the
partnership deed dated July, 14, 1986. His argument is that the defendants
be not allowed to use RAKYAN at the adjoining shop otherwise the entire
business of the plaintiff would be disturbed because of confusion and
deception without any fault of the plaintiff.      He states that in case the
defendants want to use the trade name NEENA AND RAVI RAKYAN as a
trade mark or trade name, the plaintiff has no objection if the same be used


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 7 of 34</span>
 for the time being in different areas in their other shops. But, if it is allowed
to use the same in the adjoining shop, there would be confusion and
deception, thus, the plaintiff cannot allow the defendants to use the same.
</p><p id="p_17">8.       Mr.Jitender Sethi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
defendants mainly made his submission as per the defences raised in the
written statement. He also relied upon the following decisions in support of
said defences:

defendants     be allowed to change the name from NEENA AND RAVI

reproduce the scanned copy of the photograph of the display boards of the
parties which has been filed along with the present suit:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                              Page 8 of 34</span>
<p id="p_20"> 11.    The undisputed fact is that the names and surnames are registerable
and protectable under the Trade Marks Law. <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_15">Section 2(m)</a> i.e. definition of
the mark includes name, if a trade mark is used in relation to goods and
services for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the
course of trade between same person having the right as proprietor to use the
mark under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_16">Section 2(zb)</a> of the definition of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_17">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999.
</p><p id="p_21">12.    Exclusive rights are conferred to the proprietor to use of the trade
mark in relation to the goods and services in respect of which the trade mark
is registered under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_18">Section 28</a> of the Act. A registered trade mark is
infringed by a person, who is not a registered proprietor, if he uses a mark
which is      identical with deceptively   similar in   relation to goods and
services under <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_19">Section 29(1)</a> of the Act. Under sub-section (2) it is also an
infringement if the mark used by a party is likely to cause confusion on the
part of the public or which is likely to have an association with the registered
trade mark.
</p><p id="p_22">13.    Registration is to be taken as prima facie evidence of validity under
<a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_20">Section 31</a> of the Act and under the common law remedy of passing off
which is provided under sub-section 2 of Section 27 the right of action

 against any person for passing off goods or services as the goods of another
person, is available.
</p><p id="p_23">14.    Vested rights under the Act are provided under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_21">Section 34</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_22">35</a>
whereby the party who gets the registration cannot interfere with or
restrain the use by any person who is using the identical with or nearly
resembling the registered trade mark incase he uses the mark prior to the
date of registration or the user claimed, the date which is the earlier or
with any bona fide use by a person of his own name or that of his place of
name of business or of the name or any bona fide description of the
character and quality of his goods and services.
</p><p id="p_24">15.    In the present case, the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trade
mark RAKYAN‟S FINE JEWELLERY as of February 14, 2005.                              The
registration granted in favour of the plaintiff is an old registration after the
expiry of seven years within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_23">Section 32</a> of the Act.
Prior Use claimed by the defendant
</p><p id="p_25">16.    The claim of prior user no doubt is one of the defence and vested right
of the defendant in a case of infringement of trade mark. If it is established
by a party who raises this plea by producing cogent and clear evidence of
prior user before the Court then despite of registration the proprietor of a
registered trade mark owner cannot        interfere with or restrain the use by
any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it. But the
standard of proof of continuous use by a party is much rigorous as the
proprietor of the registered trade mark is entitled to exclusive use of the
registered trade mark therefore the defendant has to produce the cogent,
clear and continuous user in commercial sense by way of evidence before
Court to defeat the rights of the plaintiff. Unless the defendant, prima facie
produces such evidence of prior user, the benefit of prior user cannot be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                                Page 10 of 34</span>
 granted. Occasionally, prior use of the trade mark as a defence in an action
for infringement would not defeat the exclusive and statutory rights of the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_26">17.    The case of the defendants is that the defendants are using the trade
name and trade mark RAKYAN since 1986 at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency,
New Delhi. Mr.Jitender Sethi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
defendants, has argued that the plaintiff was aware about the use of the said
trade name/trade mark of RAKYAN GEMS at Hotel Hyatt Regency from
the year 1986 itself. Even Jitender Rakyan, who is the managing partner of
the plaintiff, has signed the partnership deed dated July 14, 1986 as an
attesting witness. He referred to various documents in order to establish that
the defendants are the prior user of the name RAKYAN i.e. Certificate of
Registration for a Dealer dated October 13, 1986, Certificate of Registration
of Central Sales Tax dated October 13, 1986, Invoice No.RG-2/94-95 dated
November 16, 1994, Assessment orders for the years 1987-1988, 1989-1990,
1990-1991, 1994-1995, the form of registration with The Gem &amp; Jewellery
Export Promotion Council and the Vouchers of Sale issued by Rakyan Gems
at page 163 to 181 of Part III of suit file.
</p><p id="p_27">18.    In the light of the principle of continuous prior use and after having
gone through the documents referred to by Mr.Sethi, we are of the view that
there is no continuous prior use by the defendant prior to September 2000 as
claimed by the plaintiff. As far as obtaining the certificate of Delhi sales tax
and central sales tax are concerned, no doubt the same were granted in the
name of RAKYAN GEMS in the year 1986 as a dealer at the address of
Shop No.L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi.
Invoice referred to by Mr.Sethi dated November, 16, 1994 shows a personal
carriage by Mr.Ravi Rakyan or RAKYAN GEMS from New Delhi to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 11 of 34</span>
 Tokyo, Japan.         As far as the vouchers of sales referred to by Mr.Sethi
available from page 163 to 181 are concerned, most of the same are not
readable and in some of them dates are not mentioned. The names of the
purchasers are missing. The complete addresses of the purchasers are also
not mentioned on the vouchers. All the vouchers of sales are from the place
at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi.                   The
invoices no doubt are available on record from the year 2004 onward,
subsequent to the user of the plaintiff, these are also from place of Hotel
Hyatt Regency.
</p><p id="p_28">       We have also gone through the assessment orders filed by the
defendants which are prior to the period of user claimed by the plaintiff i.e.
2000 and in all the assessment orders very meager total sale is mentioned
and it was mentioned in the assessment orders that the party has not carried
on business by selling of the impugned goods for example in the year 1987-
1988, the total income is shown as `45,630/-. Prima facie, it shows that
there is no commercial use by the defendants of the business of RAKYAN
GEMS prior to September 2000, i.e. the date of user claimed by the plaintiff.
The valid invoices which are available filed by the defendants are from the
year 2004 but the same are also from the shop No.L-79, Hotel Hyatt
Regency.
</p><p id="p_29">19.       In considering whether a mark has become distinctive by user, the
area, length and extent of user are important factors to be taken into account.
The "extent" of user must be sufficiently large, although universal user or
knowledge throughout the country is not required in order to establish
distinctiveness for the purposes of the Act. Where the user is confined to
certain towns or areas far too limited in extent, such user cannot be accepted
in law.

<p id="p_30"> 20.    In the famous case of the Court of Appeal 1982 FSR 73, Imperial
Group Ltd. Vs. Philip Morris &amp; Co. Ltd., Court has clearly observed that a
bonafide use should be "ordinary and genuine", "perfectly genuine",
"substantial in amount", a real commercial use on a substantial scale", and
not some fictitious or colourable use but a real or genuine use. The same
judgment was also dealt and upheld in 1997 (2) Arb. LR 76, Bimalji
Govindji, Shah Trading as Acme Industries. Vs. Pannalal Chandulal, in
para 13.
</p><p id="p_31">21.    The words „genuine use‟ have further been explained in Kerly‟s Law
of Trade Marks and Trade Names - 14th Edition - at page 289 as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">              "It follows that „genuine use‟ of the mark entails use of
              the mark in the market for the goods or services protected
              by that mark and not just internal use by the undertaking
              concerned". "Finally, when assessing whether there has
              been genuine use of the trade mark, regard must be had
              to all the facts and circumstances relevant to establishing
              whether the commercial exploitation of the mark is real".</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">       In 2009 (41) PTC 362, the Hon‟ble Division Bench of this Court has
observed that the standard of proof of continuous prior use by the defendant
required in an infringement action and in a rectification proceeding is
different. The standard required to defeat an infringement action is much
more strenuous and rigorous. While considering defence under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_24">Section 34</a>
of the Act, the Hon‟ble Division Bench further observed that the owner of
the registered trade mark     is in exceptional position and is entitled to
exclusive use of the registered trade mark unless the defendant is able to
show his continuous use prior to the plaintiff‟s user and not occasionally.
The entire scope of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_25">Section 34</a> has been dealt with by this Court in this
particular case and the plaintiff herein relies upon the same.
</p>
<p id="p_33">22.    Under these circumstances, we are of the view that the defendants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                              Page 13 of 34</span>
 have not been able to establish to show continuous and prior user of the
mark on commercial sense since the year 1986 as alleged. They have also
failed to show concurrent user of the mark. There is not a single sale or
advertisement shown by the defendants under the name RAKYAN GEMS
during the period of prior user claimed by the defendants. The documentary
evidence placed by the defendants does not prima facie satisfy the
requirement of user claimed by defendants. It appears to us from the said
document that the defendants were exporting jewellery by carriage or very
small sale was made from the said shop but as far as cogent and clear
evidence is concerned, the said documents do not satisfy the provisions of
vested rights.
</p>
<p id="p_34">SURNAME

</p><p id="p_35">23.    The second submission of the learned counsel for the defendants is
that the RAKYAN is a surname of the defendant No.2 and other families
who are having their respective shops in various areas are also using the
name RAKYAN then why the defendants be not permitted to use the name
RAKYAN in relation to the business in question. He further states that it is
totally immaterial in case the defendant No.2 was earlier using the name
RAKYAN GEMS from Hotel Hyatt Regency and was exporting the goods
from the said shop and now they cannot use the same from the adjoining
shop of the plaintiff. According to him, in case the plaintiff has no objection
to the use of the name RAKYAN in the place other than Greater Kailash-I,
then he should not have any objection if the same is used in the present shop
being a surname which is protectable under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_26">Section 35</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_36">24.    Let us examine the argument of the learned counsel for the defendants
as to whether the defendants have right of using the personal name or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                            Page 14 of 34</span>
 surname under the provision of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_27">Section 35</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_28">Section 35</a> reads as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">               "<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_29">Section 35</a> - Nothing in this Act shall entitle the
               proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark
               to interfere with any bonafide use by a person of his own
               name or that of his place of business, or of the name, or
               of the name of the place of business, or any of his
               predecessors in business, or the sue by any person of any
               bonafide description of the character or quality of his
               goods or services."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">Bonafide Use

         "Bonafide use" normally means the honest use by the person of his
own name without any intention to deceive anybody or without any intention
to make use of the goodwill which has been acquired by another trader as
per (1957) RPC 459 at 463, Baume vs. Moore, approved by CA (1958) RPC
226 at 235; (1958) RPC 323 at 334, Adrema v Adrema,; (1959) RPC 47 at
49, 186, 273, Ballantine v Ballantyne; (1964) RPC 356 at 359, 360, Steiner
v Willy Steiner. The mere fact that a trader is using his own name which too
closely resembles a registered trade mark of which he is aware does not
prevent the user from being "bonafide" provided that the trader honestly
thought that no confusion would arise, and if he had no intention of
wrongfully diverting business to himself by using the name ((1957) RPC
226 at 235, Baume v Moore).

<p id="p_38">         The following observations in 2004(29) PTC 435 (Del.), Dr. Reddy's

             rejected for the reason that the trade mark "Dr. Reddy" in

            trade reputation and goodwill in the community dealing
            with drugs and pharmaceutical not only in India but abroad
            also. This trade mark is now distinctively associated with
            the plaintiff's company. Its long and continuous user by the
            plaintiff is prima facie established. The use of trade
            name/mark "Reddy" by the defendant is capable of causing
            confusion and deception resulting in injury to the goodwill
            and reputation of the plaintiff company. No other "Reddy"
            has a right to start a rival business by using the same trade
            name on the plea that it is his surname. This would
            encourage deception. If such a plea is allowed, rivals in
            trade would be encouraged to associate in their business
            ventures persons having similar surnames wind ants was
            held to be an act of passing off the goods and it was
            observed that the use of such family name as a trade mark
            was not permissible. The plea of the defendants that the
            surname of the partners of its firm could be used to carry
            on trade in their own name was rejected. It was held that
            prima facie the defendants were intentionally and
            dishonestly trying to pass off their goods by use of name
            "Bajaj" and as such the plaintiff had made out a case for
            grant of injunction.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            19.     Section 35 of the TMM Act is also of ho help to
            the defendant as the use of name "Reddy" on
            pharmaceutical preparations by the defendant is not shown
            to be bona fide. The drugs and pharmaceutical preparations
            being manufactured by the plaintiff may be having
            different names but that does not disentitle the plaintiff to
            claim protection in regard to its trade mark "Dr. Reddy"
            which has earned substantial trade reputation and goodwill.
            This trade mark has acquired a distinctive reputation. Use
            of an identical or deceptively similar trade mark may
            mislead the customers on account of similarity. "Dr.
            Reddy" and "Reddy" are similar trademarks phonetically
            and are capable of creating confusion. There is identity of

             goods, identity of trade mark and identity of consumers.
            The defendant is not at all an honest and concurrent user of
            the trade mark "Reddy" and it is apparent on record that it
            has started using the trade mark "Reddy" on its
            pharmaceutical preparations in bad faith knowing fully
            well that the plaintiff company has enormous trade
            reputation and goodwill in the trade mark "Dr. Reddy"
            which is completely associated with plaintiff and has
            acquired a secondary meaning in business circles."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">25.    It is a question of fact to be decided on the evidence, whether it is
proved that a name or mark has acquired a secondary meaning so that it
denotes or has come to mean goods made by a particular person and not
goods made by any other person, even though such other person may have
the same name. If it is proved on behalf of a claimant that a name or mark
has acquired such a secondary meaning, then it is a question for the Court
whether a defendant, whatever may be his intention, is so describing his
goods that there is a likelihood that a substantial section of the purchasing
public will be misled into believing that his goods are the goods of the
claimant." (per Lord Morris, Parker-Knoll v Knoll International (1962) RPC
265 at 279).
</p><p id="p_40">26.    In case, we read <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_30">Section 35</a> of the Act carefully, the words bonafide
governs the entire provision of the Act. In the present case, on the face of it,
the defendants have intentionally and deliberately used the name RAKYAN
by placing the sign boards at the shop which is right next door to the shop of
the plaintiff. Thus, one cannot say that bonafide rights of the defendants
exist with regard to the surname RAKYAN. The use of the said name
RAKYAN by the defendants at the adjoining shop would definitely
tantamount to confusion and deception as apparently there is a resemblance
while comparing the two photographs produced by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_41">27.    There is a lack of bonafide on the part of the defendants as the

 defendants are using the name NEENA AND RAVI RAKYAN as a trade
mark/trading style and not by way of bonafide description.          Thus, the
defendants are not entitled to the benefit of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_31">Section 35</a>. The submission of
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants has no force that there
is no confusion and deception if the defendants may be allowed to use the

</p><p id="p_42">28.    Apparently, the RAKYAN is not a common surname.                    Even
otherwise, in various cases the common surnames have been protected from

              respect of the goods covered by the registered trade
              mark. The rival marks are to be compared as a whole.
              Where two rival marks are identical, it is not necessary

              Essential Features

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">              19. The courts have propounded the doctrine of
              prominent and essential feature of the trade mark for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 21 of 34</span>
               purposes of adjudication of the disputes relating to
              infringement of trade mark. While deciding the question
              of infringement, the court has to see the prominent or the
              dominant feature of the trade mark. Even the learned
              single judge agrees to this proposition when the learned
              judge quotes McCarthy on Trade Marks that all
              composite marks are to be compared as whole. However,
              it is dependent on case to case to basis as a matter of jury
              question as to what can be the possible broad and
              essential feature of the trade mark in question.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">              20. It is settled law that where the defendant‟s mark
              contains the essential feature of the plaintiff‟s mark
              combined with other matter, the correct approach for the
              court is to identify an essential feature depending
              particularly "on the court‟s own judgment and burden of
              the evidence that is placed before the Court". In order to
              come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively
              similar to another, the broad and essential features of the
              two are to be considered. They should not be placed side
              by side to find out if there are differences, rather overall
              similarity has to be judged. While judging the question
              as to whether the defendant has infringed the trade mark
              or not, the court has to consider the overall impression of
              the mark in the minds of general public and not by
              merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">              21. The ascertainment of an essential feature is not to
              be by ocular test alone but if a word forming part of the
              mark has come in trade to be used to identify the goods
              of the owner of the trade mark, it is an infringement of
              the mark itself to use that word as the mark or part of the
              mark of another trader for which confusion is likely to
              result. The likelihood of confusion or deception in such
              cases is not disproved by placing the two marks side by
              side and demonstrating how small is the chance of error
              in any customer who places his order for goods with both
              the marks clearly before him, for orders are not placed, or
              are often not placed, under such conditions. It is more
              useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not an
              accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are

              words "Vick‟s VapoRub" as the essential feature,
              registered in Jamaica, and the defendants used a similar
              label with the words "Karsote Vapour Rub" as the
              essential feature, and it was shown that the expression
              "VapoRub" had become distinctive of the plaintiff‟s

              already registered and whose proprietor is offering
              opposition to the registration of the former trade mark.
              What is important is to find out what is the distinguishing
              or essential feature of the trade mark already registered
              and what is the main feature or the main idea underlying
              that trade mark, and if it is found that the trade mark
              whose registration is sought contains the same
              distinguishing or essential feature or conveys the same
              idea, then ordinarily the Registrar would be right if he
              came to the conclusion that the trade mark should not be

              who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary

              association he would form by looking at the trade mark,

              the goods which he would be purchasing. It is impossible
              to accept that a man looking at a trade mark would take
              in every single feature of the trade mark. The question
              would be, what would he normally retain in his mind
              after looking at the trade mark? What would be the
              salient feature of the trade mark which in future would

Passing Off

the mark RAKYAN as part of their trading name as well as the trade mark in
the shop at M-32, Greater Kailash-I, and they are also dealing with the
identical goods. Test of passing is discussed in the case of (2002) 3 SCC 65,
Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah And Another, by the Apex Court
while considering a plea of grant of ad interim injunction. It was held that in
no uncertain terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services
under a trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by the
Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or services in
the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to the business of one
who has the property in that name. It was also held that honesty and fair play
are and ought to be the basic policy in the world of business and when a
person adopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to someone
else, it results in confusion, has the propensity of diverting the customers
and clients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in injury. It was
held that the principles which apply to trade mark are applicable to trade
name also.

Plaintiffs goods. The defendants established that use of the name 'Baume'
was an honest use by them of the makers' own name. After considering the
evidence, it was held that even though no action can be laid for infringement
of the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark, the use constituted a passing off
which should be restrained by injunction because there was real probability
that the watches marked „Baume and Mercier, Geneva‟ would be regarded
as being the same or in some way associated with the plaintiffs‟ goods and
no man is entitled even by the honest use of his own name so to describe or
mark his goods as in fact to represent that they were the goods of another
person.

</p><p id="p_55">35.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff has conceded before us that the
plaintiff has no objection if the defendants may use the similar type of
business as they were using at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New Delhi, in the
said area coupled with the fact that the plaintiff‟s entire case is at para 22
and 23 of the plaint wherein the plaintiff has alleged that after closure of
defendants‟ shop at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New Delhi, they rented a
new shop at M-32, M Block, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi in September,
2011 i.e. right next to the plaintiff‟s premises located at M-31, Greater
Kailash-I and started their business from the month of March, 2012. The
suit was filed in the month of May, 2012. It is a suit for infringement of
trade mark also. The delay of two months is immaterial when Court is
dealing with exclusive and statutory rights.
</p><p id="p_56">36.    We agree with the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the question of
concealment of fact does not arise in the present case as the defendants have
admitted in the written statement that they have rented a new shop at M-32,
M Block, Greater Kailash-I.

<p id="p_57"> Rectification
</p><p id="p_58">37.    With regard to rectification filed by the defendants to the registration
granted in favour of the plaintiff is concerned, it is settled law that unless the
mark is rectified, no person is entitled to infringe the same. Therefore, in
case the defendants have any merit in the rectification, the same will be
decided as per its own merit. The said argument of the defendants is also
rejected.
</p><p id="p_59">38.    Though it is not argued, the defence is raised by the defendants that
the suit is not maintainable on the ground that the plaintiff firm is not
registered under <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_55">Section 69(2)</a> of the Partnership Act, 1932.               The said
defence raised in the written statement by the defendants is contrary to the
law. See :

            under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/797638/" id="a_57">section 69</a> of the Partnership Act a
            suit to enforce a right arising from a contract against a third
            party is barred unless the firm is registered. The application
            of sub-section (2) does not extend to the enforcement of
            rights not arising from contract. The present suit of the
            plaintiffs against the defendants does not arise out of any
            contract between the parties and as such <a href="/doc/1138326/" id="a_58">section 69(2)</a> of the
            Partnership Act is not applicable. The objection of the

<p id="p_60">39.    As mentioned earlier, during the course of the hearing, the defendants
have given the proposal to use the name RAKYAN. Scanned copies of the
proposed names suggested by the defendants are reproduced below:
</p>



<p id="p_61">40.    In support of submission, Mr.Sethi, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the defendants, has strongly relied upon two decisions i.e. <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_62">Goenka
Institute vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/1261289/" id="a_63">Star Bazaar Pvt. Ltd. vs.
Trent Ltd</a>. (supra) of the Division Bench rendered by this Court.
</p><p id="p_62">41.    In the case of Goenka Institute (supra), Hon‟ble Division Bench, after
considering the rival submissions of the parties and evidence produced
before them, has arrived at a conclusion that the plaintiff‟s trade mark
Goenka was registered in 2003 whereas the defendants have been carrying
on its institution with the word Goenka per se from the year 2000. Therefore,
mere registration will be of no avail to the plaintiff. Secondly, it was held by
the Hon‟ble Division Bench that the Goenka is a common surname which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 31 of 34</span>
 cannot easily achieve distinctiveness. Thirdly, it was also observed by the
Division Bench that the student studying in a school in Sikar District of
Rajasthan would not be led into believing that they are studying or applying
for any school which is the same as the plaintiffs‟ school in Delhi. For the
aforesaid three reasons, the judgment is clearly distinguishable on all three
counts. There is no priority of user by the defendants, RAKYAN is not
common surname; it is rare surname and likelihood of confusion in the
present case is apparent as the defendants are trying to use the name
RAKYAN at the adjoining shop of the plaintiff which already exists and has
achieved goodwill and reputation under the name RAKYAN.
</p><p id="p_63">42.    With regard to Star Bazaar Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the facts of the said case
are also different. In the said case, the plaintiff was incorporated on or about
March 12, 2003 and commenced business thereafter in Kailash Colony
Market, New Delhi by opening a retail departmental store under the name
and style of „Star Bazaar‟. The defendant started using the name „Star
Bazaar‟ therefore, the suit for passing off was filed. The Hon‟ble Division
Bench on certain terms and conditions allowed the defendant to use the
name „Star Bazaar‟ in Delhi as the defendant was willing to add word „A
Tata Enterprise‟ in order to avoid any confusion and deception.                 The
defendant was allowed to use Star Bazaar by adding the word „A Tata
Enterprise‟ because of the reason given in para 6 of the judgment that the
defendant was earlier carrying on business under the name and style of „Star
India Bazaar‟ and had departmental stores in Ahmadabad and Mumbai and
was planning to open a similar store in Bengaluru and Delhi. „Star India
Bazaar‟ was being used by the defendant since 2004 prior to the plaintiff
therefore, the defendant was allowed to use the word „Star Bazaar‟ with such
condition. However, the facts in the present case are distinct. In the present


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                             Page 32 of 34</span>
 case, the defendants want to use the name RAKYAN in the shop which is
adjoining shop to the plaintiff. Therefore, the facts are materially different
coupled with the fact that the plaintiff has already stated that the plaintiff has
no objection if the defendants may use their business in the similar fashion
as they were using at L-79, Hotel Hyatt Regency, New Delhi, and in case the
defendants want to use the name Ravi Rakyan and Neena and Ravi Rakyan
as a trade mark or trade name, the plaintiff has no objection if the same may
be used for the time being in different areas. Therefore, the benefits of these
two judgments cannot be derived by the defendants. The other decisions
referred by the defendants are also not applicable as the facts and
circumstances in the present case are materially different.
</p><p id="p_64">43.    No doubt, law recognizes the right of bonafide use as of his common
name provided that the user is in no way fraudulent but the same is used
with honesty. With regard to using of his own full name, the defendant must
act honestly and he must not be causing confusion and deception. In case, it
happens and there is already another trader in the market of that name with
having goodwill and reputation then he may not be entitled to do his
business even under his own name.
</p><p id="p_65">44.    It is settled law that if the use by the defendant of its own name would
likely to deceive, then there would be no defence to the passing off action,
no matter how honest and bonafide user was [See AIR 1988 Bombay 167
(1)(DB), Bajaj Electricals Ltd. Bombay v. Metals and Allied Products,
Bombay and Anr.].
</p><p id="p_66">45.    Considering the overall facts and circumstances, we are of the view
that the defendants are not entitled to use the name RAKYAN in relation to
similar business in any manner whatsoever on the signboard as well as
advertisement material. However, the defendants are not precluded to use


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">FAO(OS) No.609/2012                                               Page 33 of 34</span>
 the name NEENA AND RAVI RAKYAN in their invoices, account books,
stationery and packing materials but the defendants shall use the same as
expression only "A Unit of Neena and Ravi Rakyan" being a bonafide
description but not as a trade mark and trade name.     The defendants would
be entitled to use the expression „A Unit of Neena and Ravi Rakyan‟ or as a
trade mark and trade name in their other shops which are run by the
defendants in different area for which the plaintiff has no objection. I.A.
No.11250/2012 and I.A. No.14054/2012 as also the appeal are disposed of
accordingly.
</p><p id="p_67">46.    It is made clear that the findings arrived by us are only our prima facie
view and on the basis of material placed before us and argument addressed
by the parties which shall have no bearing when the matter would be finally
considered on merit after the trial.
</p><p id="p_68">47.    No costs.
