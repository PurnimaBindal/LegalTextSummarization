</p><p id="p_4">                     2.      Appellant No. 1, having its registered office in Thailand, is
                     stated to be carrying on a well established business as manufacturer,
                     marketer, exporter and/or dealer of cosmetics and hair care products
                     under the trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27; for the past several years. Products of
                     Appellant No. 1 are sold in Asian countries viz. Thailand, Singapore,
                     Malaysia, India, etc. Appellant No. 2 is engaged in importing, selling,
                     marketing and/or distributing various cosmetics and hair care
                     products, manufactured by Appellant No. 1 for many years.
</p><p id="p_5">                     3.      It is averred by Appellant No. 1 that Ms. A. Ngun
                     Luechaputiporn, a Thai National is the first and original proprietor of
                     the trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27;, which is used in relation to cosmetics and
                     hair care products and is registered in India in Class 03. As a
                     registered proprietor, she granted a licence to Appellant No. 1,
                     authorising it to use the trademark in relation to cosmetics and hair
                     care products.
</p><p id="p_6">                     4.      On 29.08.2006, Appellant No. 1 sent the first consignment of
                     the products bearing the mark &#x27;BERINA&#x27; HAIR SPA to Appellant
                     No.2, for sale in India. The products were advertised in March, 2011
                     in a magazine wherein advertisement of Respondents&#x27; product was
                     also published and despite this knowledge, no action was taken for
                     over three years by the Respondents.
</p><p id="p_7">                     5.      In November, 2014 Respondents filed a suit for permanent
                     injunction against the Appellants alleging infringement of trademark,
                     passing off, etc. On 20.11.2014, the learned Trial Court passed an ex-
                     parte order of injunction, restraining the Appellants from using
                     &#x27;BERINA HAIR SPA&#x27;. Vide impugned order dated 30.03.2016, the
                     application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC, 1908 was

                     Trial Court.

</p><p id="p_9">                     6.      Appellants have laid a siege to the order of the learned Trial
                     Court in the present appeal on the following grounds:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          A. Trial Court has erred in observing that counsel for the
                             Appellants had referred to certain judgments during the course
                             of the arguments but no such judgments were filed on record.
                             The observation is contrary to the record of the Trial Court
                             inasmuch as the judgments were filed along with the written
                             submissions and the certified copy obtained by the Appellants
                             would evidence that the written submissions run into 38 pages
                             followed by judgements which were 11 in number, running into
                             219 pages. Appellants have filed certified copies of the
                             judgments to substantiate their stand. The erroneous observation
                             is also a pointer to the fact that the Trial Court has rendered the
                             impugned findings without looking into the judgments filed by
                             the Appellants and consequently the propositions of law
                             enunciated therein which has caused grave prejudice to the
                             Appellants&#x27; case.</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">                          B. Appellant No. 1 manufactures, markets, exports and is a dealer
                             of cosmetics and hair care products under the trademark

                             is registered in her name in India in Class 03. She has granted a

                             trademark in relation to cosmetics and hair care products and

                             straightener cream, hair spa, heat protector, hair setting
                             shampoo, conditioner, etc. The expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is used
                             merely as a descriptive phrase and not as a trademark and thus
                             no action for infringement qua the said mark can lie against the
                             Appellants.
</p><p id="p_11">                         C. The expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is generic and commonly
                             understood and used by consumers as a treatment for hair and
                             denotes the kind, quality, nature and intended purpose of the
                             goods of the Appellants. In trade usage, running across the
                             entire spectrum of goods/services, trademarks of many entities
                             are usually succeeded by generic words HAIR SPA, HAIR
                             COLOUR, etc. The word &#x27;HAIR&#x27; in its plain dictionary
                             meaning is &#x27;any of the numerous fine, usually cylindrical,
                             keratinous filaments growing from the skin of humans and
                             animals&#x27;. Similarly, the dictionary meaning of the word &#x27;SPA&#x27;
                             is &#x27;mineral spring or a luxurious resort or hotel&#x27;. Therefore,
                             when put together the words &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; only refer to a
                             treatment and/or conditioning and/or nourishment of damaged
                             hair and various articles in newspapers, magazines and websites
                             fortify this position. Hence, use of the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;
                             bonafidely by the Appellants to indicate hair-treatment, under
                             the trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27;, cannot amount to infringement.
                         D. Respondents have deliberately concealed that the expression
                             &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is public juris and that there are several
                             manufacturers or marketers in the cosmetics and hair care
                             industry, apart from many hair salons, beauty parlours and spas
                             who use the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; in descriptive sense, to
                             connote/denote the nature, kind and intended purpose of the
                             product sold thereunder. One of the documents placed on record

                             with the Respondents&#x27; products and thus they are not oblivious
                             of the common usage of this expression. In fact, perusal of
                             Respondents&#x27; documents at pages 48, 53, 76 and 83 in the List

                             services offered at hair salons and beauty parlours for treatment
                             of hair. Besides the above, there are several entities which are

</pre><p id="p_12">                         E. Since the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is common to trade and
                             public juris, no person can carve out a monopoly over the same.
                             It is apparent that the suit, in relation to which the present
                             appeal arises, was filed by the Respondents out of business
                             rivalry and jealously, with the sole intent of stopping the
                             Appellants business by hindering a bonafide use of the
                             expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_13">                         F. Trial Court has erroneously observed that Appellants have
                             copied and appropriated the expression HAIR SPA, including
                             the styling, colour combination, etc. thereof, with a view to
                             usurp the goodwill of the Respondents and amounts to
                             infringement, since &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is the registered trademark of
                             the Respondents, with usage dating back to the year 2002.
                             There is no similarity in styling, colour combination or the trade
                             dress of two labels. Respondents&#x27; trademark and trade name is
                             &quot;L&#x27;OREAL&quot; and Appellants&#x27; trademark is &#x27;BERINA&#x27;. On a
                             mere visual comparison, it is obvious that the Appellants&#x27;
                             products are sold in a different trade dress with a wholly
                             different colour combination of &#x27;grey&#x27; and &#x27;peach&#x27;, while
                             Respondents&#x27; products are sold in bottles bearing a trade dress
                             with a colour combination of blue and white and even the
                             stylized manner of writing the words &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is not
                             similar. &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is used as a descriptor of the product and
                             in conjunction with the trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27;, which obviates
                             any intent of the Appellants to infringe the trademark of the
                             Respondents viz. &quot;L&#x27;OREAL&quot;.

                             Registrar for rectification of the trademark. Court has also
                             recorded the response of the Respondents that where
                             rectification application is filed after filing of the suit by the
                             Plaintiffs, Defendants are under obligation to seek prima facie
                             satisfaction of the Civil Court on invalidity of the registration
                             and since no such permission has been obtained by showing a
                             prima facie case, the same cannot be gone into. Having so
                             recorded the rival contentions, Trial Court has simply extracted
                             provisions of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_1">Section 124</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999

                             given no finding on this aspect. It is trite that a Court, while
                             deciding an interlocutory application for injunction, can
                             examine the validity of Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark registration, where
                             Defendant raises a plea that Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark, whose
                             infringement is alleged, is generic, common to trade and cannot
                             be monopolised and give a prima facie finding thereon.
                         H. Trial Court has committed a gross error in holding that
                             Respondents are owners of the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; and the
                             trademark     &#x27;BERINA     HAIR     SPA&#x27;    is   deceptively     and
                             confusingly similar to the said trademark, overlooking glaring
                             facts that: (a) &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; cannot be monopolised; (b) &#x27;HAIR
                             SPA&#x27; is not used by the Appellants as a trademark; (c) &#x27;HAIR
                             SPA&#x27; is used in juxtaposition with the registered trademark
                             &#x27;BERINA&#x27;, which is enough to obviate any confusion between
                             the rival goods; and (d) &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is not a coined word and at
                             best is a combination of two English words, which are

                             infringement of a trademark, which is a descriptive word, then,

                             considering the factors viz: usage of the expression HAIR SPA
                             by the Appellants is not in the sense of a trademark but merely
                             as a descriptor; trade dress, lay out, colour combination, etc., are
                             different and Respondents&#x27; trademark is generic and common to
                             trade. Trial Court has thus erred in conforming the injunction
                             order. Balance of convenience also lies in favour of the
                             Appellants. Appellant No. 1 sent the first consignment of its
                             products bearing the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; to Appellant No.

                             was filed between 2007 to 2013. The case is, therefore, squarely

                             Trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is an arbitrary and coined trademark in
                             relation to the goods for which it is used and is, therefore,
                             entitled to a high degree of protection. The registration dates

                             trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; are original &#x27;artistic works&#x27; under

</p><p id="p_18">                         C. Appellants have maliciously adopted and are using the word

                             which &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is an essential feature, in relation to hair

                             impugned trademark. The rival trademarks are phonetically,

                             Respondents. Appellants have not been able to explain how
                             they have adopted the impugned trademark HAIR SPA, which
                             has trappings of an invented/arbitrary word and is inherently
                             distinctive.
</p><p id="p_19">                         D. Appellants have themselves claimed trademark rights in the
                             impugned trademark &#x27;BERINA HAIR SPA&#x27; and therefore, it
                             does not lie in their mouth to allege that the trademark &#x27;HAIR
                             SPA&#x27; is generic, non-distinctive or common to trade. The
                             dishonesty is apparent from the fact that the Appellants use the
                             mark &#x27;BERINA&#x27; in a small font while &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is
                             prominently placed on the product. Appellants have admitted in
                             the preliminary objections of the written statement that &#x27;HAIR
                             SPA&#x27; is &#x27;suggestive&#x27; of the product in relation to which it is
                             used and thus even assuming that &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is suggestive, it
                             is a strong trademark, entitled to protection, without proof of
                             user.
</p><p id="p_20">                         E. Appellants have filed voluminous record before the Trial Court
                             in an endeavour to establish that &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; does not have a
                             dictionary meaning and is common to trade. Perusal of the
                             documents, which are also filed in this Court, would reflect that
                             none of the documents show any actual or commercial user of
                             the trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; by any party and even assuming
                             there is any use, the same is subsequent to that of the
                             Respondents. It is also a settled law that the registered
                             proprietor is not expected to sue every infringer unless and until
                             the business of the third-party substantially affects the business
                             of the registered proprietor. It is a misconceived contention of
                             the Appellants that under no circumstances generic trademarks
                             can be protected. Various trademarks such as JCB, SURF,

                             2022 SCC OnLine SC 61, for various propositions, which shall
                             be adverted to in the later part of the judgment.
                          G. The impugned order passed by the Trial Court suffers from no
                             infirmity in law. It is a well-reasoned order and injunction has
                             been granted on sound legal principles viz: (a) Respondents are
                             registered proprietors of the trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;; (b) Mark
                             is used in a distinctive style and colour combination; (c) user
                             dates back to the year 2002; (d) rival mark of the Appellants is
                             deceptively similar, with similar colour combination, style, font,
                             etc.; and (e) a person with average intelligence and imperfect
                             recollection is likely to be confused, more particularly, when the
                             trade dress is not different to an ordinary customer who relies
                             on his memory and at the most can only recall the overall get up
                             and prominent features. It is a settled principle of law that
                             Appellate Court should not interfere in the impugned order only
                             because it has different view, unless the order is arbitrary,
                             perverse or contrary to the settled principles of law. The appeal
                             be dismissed being devoid of merits.

                     rival parties on merits, it is important and relevant to deal with the first
                     contention raised by the Appellants that the Trial Court has
                     erroneously observed that no judgments had been filed on record by
                     the Appellants, contrary to the record of the Trial Court, which
                     evidences that written submissions running into 38 pages with
                     judgments running into 219 pages were on record before the Trial
                     Court, when the application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC,

                     Appellants that the judgments were in fact filed along with the written
                     submissions. Learned counsel for the Appellants is also right in his
                     submission that the order dated 31.03.2015 passed by the Trial Court
                     records that the parties were granted 15 minutes each to address
                     further arguments and explain their written submissions, which were
                     on record. The matter was fixed on several dates and it was never
                     pointed out that the judgments were not on record. This argument of
                     the Appellants assumes significance not only on account of the fact
                     that the impugned order suffers from an error apparent on the record
                     but also for the reason that this also goes to show that the Trial Court
                     has passed the impugned order, oblivious of the judgments before it,
                     resulting in consequential and grave prejudice to the case of the
                     Appellants, as according to the Appellants some of the judgments
                     relied upon squarely cover their stand in law.

                     and an arbitrary mark, entitled to high degree of protection. Use of the
                     registered mark by the Appellants as a trademark, amounts to
                     infringement and passing off and the Trial Court rightly confirmed the
                     injunction. The registered trademark of the Appellants, as per the case
                     set out by them, is &#x27;BERINA&#x27; and the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is only
                     used as a descriptor of the nature of product in question, which they
                     sell under their registered trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27;. Validity of
                     registration of Appellants&#x27; mark HAIR SPA is questioned on the
                     ground that it is descriptive.
</p><p id="p_27">                     13.     The first question that arises in the present appeal is whether the
                     Respondents have an exclusive right to use the trademark &#x27;HAIR
                     SPA&#x27; and seek protection from infringement by the Appellants, who
                     are allegedly using an identical/deceptively similar trademark.
                     Appellants           have   questioned   the   validity   of   registration    of
                     Respondents&#x27; registered trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; on the ground that
                     the mark is generic, descriptive and common to trade and thus the
                     question is whether at this interlocutory stage, Court can go behind the
                     registration and the defence raised by the Appellants under <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_28">Sections
                     30(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_29">35</a> of the Act. The only other and connected issue is the
                     claim of the Respondents with respect to passing off.

                     application for injunction, is concerned, this very question came up

                     the question as to whether at the interlocutory stage it could go behind
                     the registration of Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark and examine the defences

                     the stand of the Plaintiffs that Court is required to accept prima facie
                     validity of the registered trademark under <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_31">Section 31(1)</a> of the Act,
                     without more, at that stage. Learned Single Judge held that if this
                     proposition of law enunciated by the Plaintiffs was accepted, it would
                     render the provisions of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_32">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_33">35</a> and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_34">124</a> of the Act
                     meaningless. I may refer to the observations of the Court, which are as
                     follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                             &quot;10.1       I have heard the learned Counsel on both sides as well as
                             considered the documents placed on record. Given the background
                             the first issue which arises for consideration in this case is that : in
                             view of the fact that, the plaintiffs have obtained registration of the
                             mark/expression &#x27;Rehydrate Replenish Refuel&#x27;, could the Court
                             firstly, go behind the registration at an interlocutory stage and
                             secondly, examine the defence of the defendant in respect of the
                             impugned mark used by it. It is submitted by the learned Counsel for
                             the plaintiffs that the Court was required to accept prima facie, the
                             validity of the registered mark/expression without more, at this stage
                             and, grant the injunction sought for given the similarity of marks, the
                             goods produced and also the similarity in profile of the consumers to
                             which both, the plaintiffs and the defendants catered.
                             10.2 I tend to disagree with the aforestated proposition of law
                             enunciated by the learned Counsel for plaintiffs. The reason being :
                             if it was so, it would render the provisions of Sections 30, 35 and 124
                             of the T.M. Act, 1999 quite meaningless. Since I had the occasion to
                             deal with somewhat similar issue in the Marico&#x27;s case, prolixity may
                             well be avoided if I were to extract my observations in the said case:

                     <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_49">Sections 30(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_50">35</a> of the Act, inasmuch as the subject mark
                     only describes the product, namely, the sports drink. Relevant
                     passages from the Division Bench, which are relevant to the present
                     case, are as follows:-

                             to be rejected because:-

<p id="p_34">                     16.     I may also usefully allude to the judgment of a Division Bench
                     of this Court in Marico Limited (supra), which in this Court&#x27;s view
                     squarely covers most of the issues arising in the present appeal. It
                     would be apposite to first refer to para 7 of the judgment, wherein the
                     issues arising for adjudication in the said case are encapsulated. For
                     ready reference, para 7 is extracted hereunder:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                             &quot;7.     Two basic issues arise for decision in the present appeal
                             along with incidental and related issues. The first issue is on the
                             aspect of infringement i.e. whether the appellants registration gives
                             it exclusive right to use the subject trade marks &quot;LOSORB&quot; and
                             &quot;LO-SORB&quot; and consequently whether an action for infringement is
                             maintainable if a person such as the respondent uses a trade mark
                             which is deceptively similar or nearly identical or identical to the
                             registered trade marks. Included in this first issue is the aspect of
                             whether registration only confers prima facie validity and thereby
                             does not prevent the Court from denying the injunction in spite of
                             registration. Further, assuming that registration is final would the
                             appellant be entitled to the reliefs of injunction with regard to its
                             claims of infringement once the respondent lays out a valid defence
                             under the applicable provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_55">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999
                             (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;) which inter alia, include
                             <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_56">Section 30(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_57">Section 35</a> thereof i.e. the use of the words by
                             the respondent, which words are claimed by the appellant as its
                             trade marks are statutorily permissible as the use is only in a
                             descriptive manner. The second issue is the issue with regard to
                             claim of the appellant pertaining to passing off and the issue is
                             whether the respondent&#x27;s user of the expression &quot;LOW ABOSORB
                             TECHNOLOGY&quot; in relation to its edible oil product amounts to
                             passing off the goods of the appellant which uses the unregistered
                             trade mark &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot;. We also would like to state that on
                             quite a few aspects of &quot;passing of&quot; and &quot;infringement&quot; there will be
                             commonality of the ratios and thus dovetailing on these common
                             aspects.&quot;

                     injunction against the Respondent/Defendant from using the
                     expression &#x27;LOW ABSORB&#x27;, alleged to be deceptively similar to the
                     registered       trademarks   &#x27;LOSORB&#x27;        and    &#x27;LO-SORB&#x27;        of     the
                     Appellant/Plaintiff and thus infringing. Relying on the decision of the
                     Division Bench of this Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (Supra),
                     Court held that the Appellant, in the facts of the case, can have no
                     exclusive ownership rights on the trademark &#x27;LOW ABSORB&#x27;. The
                     expression &#x27;LOW ABSORB&#x27; is quite clearly a common descriptive
                     expression/adjective and not a coined word and at best can be a
                     combination of two popular English words, which are descriptive of
                     the nature of the product. The Court also observed that it is high time
                     that those persons who are first of the blocks in using a trademark
                     which is a purely descriptive expression pertaining to the subject
                     product ought to be discouraged from appropriating the expression
                     and this view is in accordance with the spirit of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_58">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_59">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_60">35</a>
                     of the Act. Significantly, the Court also noted that these observations
                     were made mindful of the Proviso to <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_61">Section 9</a> of the Act as per which
                     on account of distinctiveness, the absolute bar against registration is
                     removed and observed that the Court was for the present stressing on
                     the intendment of the main part of the Section, which is to prevent
                     descriptive terms from being registered as trademarks, as also the fact
                     that the Act itself contains provisions for cancellation of registered
                     trademarks, including <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_62">Section 57</a> thereof. Court also noted that this
                     position was confirmed by provisions of <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_63">Section 31(1)</a> which states
                     that registration is only prima facie evidence of validity of
                     registration. Relevant paras are as follow:-

                             expression/adjective. The expression &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; is not a
                             coined word and at best it is a combination of two popular English
                             words which are descriptive of the nature of the product as held by
                             the Division Bench in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (supra) case that such
                             adoption naturally entails the risk that others in the field would also
                             be entitled to use such phrases. Low Absorb is not an unusual syntax
                             and the same can almost be said to be a meaningful part sentence or
                             phrase in itself. The expression &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; surely and
                             immediately conveys the meaning of the expression that something
                             which absorbs less, and when used with respect to edible oil, it is
                             descriptive in that it refers to less oil being absorbed or low oil being
                             absorbed. Similar to the expression &quot;Sugar Free&quot; being not an
                             unusual juxtaposition of two English words the expression &quot;LOW
                             ABSORB&quot; equally is not an unusual juxtaposition of words in that
                             the same can take away the descriptive nature of the expression. The
                             expression &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; is used in the functional sense for the
                             character of the product viz. edible oil. With respect to the
                             unregistered trade mark &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; we are of the firm
                             opinion that in essence the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; only
                             describes the characteristic of the product edible oil and
                             ordinarily/normally incapable of being distinctive.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                             11.      The aforesaid observations are made by us mindful of the
                             proviso of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_64">Section 9</a> as per which on account of distinctiveness, the
                             absolute bar against registration is removed, but, we are for the
                             present stressing on the intendment of the main part of the section
                             and which is to basically prevent descriptive terms from being
                             registered as trade marks. The proviso no doubt does state that such
                             marks can be registered as a trade marks, however, the Act itself
                             also contains provisions for cancellation of registered trade marks
                             including <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_65">Section 57</a> whereby registration obtained is cancelled
                             being violative of the applicable provisions of the Act. Our belief is
                             further confirmed by the provision of <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_66">Section 31(1)</a> which clearly
                             states that registration is only prima facie evidence of the validity of
                             registration. It is only when cancellation proceedings achieve
                             finality of the same being finally dismissed can it be said that a mark
                             for which ordinarily there is an absolute ground for refusal of
                             registration that it has acquired a distinctive character i.e. a
                             secondary meaning or is a well known trade mark. <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_67">Section 124</a> of the
                             Act is also relevant in this regard. Sub Section 5 of Section 124
                             clearly provides that in spite of registration, the Court before which
                             an action is filed seeking protection of the trade mark is not
                             precluded from making any interlocutory order it thinks fit in spite of
                             the registration and also the fact that the suit may have to be stayed
                             till decision of the rectification/cancellation proceedings before the
                             Registrar/Appellate Board filed in terms of <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_68">Section 57</a> of the Act.
                             This aspect of <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_69">Section 124(5)</a> and related aspects are dealt in details
                             in the following portions of this judgment. The facts of the present
                             case are not such that a cancellation proceeding has been dismissed
                             and that which dismissal has obtained finality and it cannot be said
                             that the validity of registration has been finally tested.&quot;

                             to be valid, can it then be said that the appellant is entitled to grant
                             of injunction for preventing the defendant from using the expression
                             &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; in its packing under which the
                             edible oil is sold and whether such use amounts to infringement of
                             the registered trade marks of the appellant. We note the fact that the
                             respondent was obviously not justified in using the expression &quot;TM&quot;
                             after the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; and the
                             respondent has now rightly removed the expression &quot;TM&quot; after the
                             expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot;. An argument was
                             however raised that the respondent had in fact used the expression
                             &quot;TM&quot; after the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; at one
                             point of time and that such mala fides entitles the appellant to an
                             injunction in the facts and circumstances of the present case,
                             although, the plaintiff&#x27;s registration itself may not be valid and the
                             defendant may have valid defences in terms of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_76">Section 30(2)(a)</a> and
                             <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_77">Section 35</a> of the Act. This aspect is also considered by us
                             hereinafter.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                             36.     It has been contended on behalf of the respondent that
                             respondent is selling its edible oil in a package which clearly shows
                             its trade mark as &quot;Sundrop&quot;. The respondent states that it is not
                             using the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; as a trade
                             mark and the same is only being used as a descriptive expression,
                             and as a part of a sentence, with respect to the product in question,
                             namely, edible oil. The appellant, however, counters to say that the
                             expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; is being used as a
                             trade mark. We have already referred to the fact that the trade mark
                             &quot;Sundrop&quot; is used by the respondent in a very prominent manner in
                             its packaging by the respondent and that undoubtedly is the trade
                             mark of the respondent. The defendant is using the expression &quot;LOW
                             ABSORB&quot; not independently but only as a part of a sentence which
                             reads on the packaging as &quot;WITH LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot;.</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">                             37.     Our conclusion is that we have in fact totally failed to
                             appreciate the argument as raised on behalf of the appellant. Surely,
                             when rights are claimed over a word mark as a trade mark and
                             which word mark is in fact a mere tweak of a descriptive word
                             indicative of the kind, quality, intended purpose or other
                             characteristics of the goods, it is not open to urge that although the
                             respondent is using the descriptive word mark in fact only as a part
                             of sentence as a description (and even assuming for the sake of
                             argument only the descriptive word mark in itself) alongwith another
                             independent trade mark, yet the use of descriptive words are to be

                             respondent is in fact shown to be using the disputed word(s) only
                             with a descriptive intendment, yet, such use should be taken not in a
                             descriptive manner but as a trade mark. If we permit such an
                             argument to prevail then what will happen is that what cannot be
                             directly done will be indirectly done i.e., whereas the appellant is not
                             entitled to succeed in the infringement action because the use by the
                             respondent is in furtherance of its statutory rights of the user of the
                             words which are descriptive of the kind, quality, intended purpose or
                             characteristic of the goods, yet, merely because the appellant states
                             that the respondent is using the same as a trade mark, the same
                             should be taken as infringement of the trade mark of the appellant.
                             Not only the plaintiff has no exclusive rights whatsoever to the trade
                             marks because they are such which fall within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_78">Section
                             30(2)(a)</a>, the respondent/defendant is always fully justified and

                             so chooses and pleases to do. If there are no rights of the plaintiff to
                             exclusive user of the trade mark then where does arise the question
                             of disentitlement of a defendant to use the trade mark of the
                             appellant inasmuch as any person who adopts a descriptive word
                             mark does so at its own peril in that any other person will also be
                             fully entitled to use the same in view of a specific statutory rights

                             further stronger because of the use along with the simultaneous use

                             30(2)(a)</a> clearly applies in entitling the respondent to use the
                             expression &quot;WITH LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; because that is
                             only a descriptive use by normal English words in the English
                             language indicative of the kind, quality, intended purpose of
                             characteristic of the goods. There is no use of the expression &quot;bona

                             because the subject matters of the two sections i.e. <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_84">Section 32(a)</a> and
                             <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_85">Section 35</a> are though common on certain limited aspects, however
                             the two Sections do in fact operate in separate fields. Also looking at
                             the issue in another way, &quot;bona fide&quot; aspect can in a way be said to
                             be very much included in <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_86">Section 30(2)(a)</a> because the use of words
                             which indicate their relation to the goods for the kind, quality,
                             intended purpose or other characteristics, etc. of the goods, is
                             clearly only a bona fide user of the same and which &quot;bona fideness&quot;
                             does not have to be additionally proved. In fact, there is ordinarily
                             not only no lack of bona fides in using the normal descriptive word,
                             and on the contrary there is in fact mala fides of a plaintiff in
                             adopting otherwise a descriptive word mark and for which adaption
                             there is ordinarily an absolute ground for refusal of registration of

                             the respondent is also prominently using its own trade mark
                             &quot;Sundrop&quot;, an aspect we have repeatedly referred to otherwise in
                             this judgment. Merely because the respondent used &quot;TM&quot; earlier
                             after the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; is not such as
                             to wipe out statutory rights/defences of the respondent.

                             which is in fact a descriptive word, then, if a defendant is using his
                             own word mark as a trade mark prominently in addition to the
                             descriptive word mark which the plaintiff claims to be his trade
                             mark, nothing further is required to show the bona fides of the
                             defendant against whom infringement of a registered trade mark is
                             alleged. In the facts of the present case, we have already adverted to
                             in detail the prominent use by the respondent of its independent
                             trade mark &quot;Sundrop&quot;, and, the fact that the expression &quot;LOW
                             ABSORB&quot; is being used only as part of the sentence which reads

                     Bench in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), on which reliance was
                     placed in the case of Marico Limited (supra). The Appellant therein
                     was aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Single Judge refusing
                     injunction restraining the Respondents from using in any manner and
                     particularly in relation to their products frozen desserts and choc
                     minis, the expression &#x27;SUGAR FREE&#x27;, in which the Appellant
                     claimed and asserted trademark rights. Prime contention of the
                     Appellant was that the trademark &#x27;SUGAR FREE&#x27; was a coined word
                     and not descriptive but merely suggestive. As an alternate argument, it
                     was also urged that the work &#x27;SUGAR FREE&#x27; had become distinctive
                     of the sugar substitute and acquired a secondary meaning. Contention
                     of the Respondent was that the combination of the words &#x27;SUGAR&#x27;
                     and &#x27;FREE&#x27; is common and used extensively in a wide variety of
                     contexts to indicate a category of food. The mark being generic in
                     nature and common to trade was unable to identify the source of the
                     product, because of its very nature and use. After a detailed
                     deliberation, the Division Bench held as follows:-

                             &quot;9.     We are unable to hold that the appellant&#x27;s trade mark &#x27;Sugar
                             Free&#x27; is a coined word; at best it is a combination of two popular
                             English words. The mere fact that the appellant&#x27;s product cannot be
                             directly consumed or eaten and merely is an additive does not
                             detract from the descriptive nature of the trade mark. Once a
                             common phrase in the English language which directly describes the
                             product is adopted by a business enterprise, such adoption naturally
                             entails the risk that others in the field would also be entitled to use
                             such phrases provided no attempt is made to ride on the bandwagon
                             of the appellant&#x27;s indubitably market leading product &#x27;Sugar
                             Free&#x27;. In this connection, merely because the attributes of &#x27;sugar
                             free&#x27; can be described by other phrases cannot detract from the
                             common usage of the phrase &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27; as denoting products
                             which do not contain sugar and any trader which adopts such mark
                             in the market place, does so with the clear knowledge of the
                             possibility of other traders also using the said mark. That is
                             precisely the reason for the denial of protection to such marks by
                             refusing registration as envisaged by <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_87">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_88">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_89">35</a> of the

</p><p id="p_42">                             Thus, it is clear that the mark or indication which serves to designate
                             the quality of the goods of the appellant, which indeed the phrase
                             &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27; does, would be an absolute ground for refusal of
                             registration of a mark unless it has acquired a distinctive
                             character. The expression can at best be said distinctive qua the
                             artificial sweetener of the appellant and mere starting of the
                             marketing of the drink &#x27;sugar free D&#x27;lite&#x27; cannot give the appellant
                             the right to claim distinctiveness in the expression &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27; in
                             relation to all the food products.

</p><p id="p_44">                             14.      In consonance with the above view we are also not in a
                             position to agree with the appellant that the word Sugar Free&#x27; has
                             become so distinctive of the sugar substitute and has acquired such a

                             to any other food product except the appellant&#x27;s sugar substituted
                             product labelled Sugar Free&#x27;. There cannot be any doubt that the
                             word sugar free is not inherently distinctive and is clearly
                             descriptive in nature. In fact, the word Sugar Free in essence clearly
                             only describes the characteristics of the appellant&#x27;s product and
                             therefore, cannot afford it the protection sought in the plaint by
                             restraining the respondent from using the phrase sugar free&#x27;. Sugar
                             Free&#x27;, prima facie has not attained any distinctiveness, as alleged by
                             the appellant outside the field of sugar substitute artificial
                             sweeteners and the appellant would not be entitled to exclusively

                             particularly in the descriptive sense. A mere descriptive usage of the
                             expression Sugar Free&#x27; by the respondent may thus blunt the edge of

<p id="p_45">                     20.     In this context, I may also refer to the judgment of the Full
                     Bench of the Bombay High Court in Lupin Ltd. (supra), wherein it is
                     observed that while a registered proprietor of a trademark would
                     ordinarily be entitled to a finding of the Civil Court in its favour that
                     the trademark registered in its name is prima facie valid, the
                     jurisdiction of this Court is not barred for considering the plea of the
                     Defendant, at the interlocutory stage, that the registration in Plaintiff&#x27;s
                     favour is so apparently invalid that Court should not grant injunction
                     in favour of the Plaintiff albeit a very heavy burden lies on the
                     Defendant to rebut the strong presumption in favour of the Plaintiff at
                     that stage. In the present case, it is an undisputed position that a
                     rectification petition has been preferred by the Appellants, which is
                     pending. Appellant No. 2 in its written statement has taken a plea of
                     invalidity of Respondents&#x27; registration and has also stated that
                     appropriate steps to seek rectification would be taken in accordance
                     with law. It is also stated in the written statement that the words
                     &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; are generic and common to trade and Plaintiffs can claim
                     no monopoly over the same.

                     aforesaid judgments, in my prima facie opinion, the trademark &#x27;HAIR
                     SPA&#x27; is descriptive and the expression is commonly used in the trade
                     for products which are used for treatment and nourishment of hair.
                     &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is not a coined word and is merely a combination of two
                     popular English words HAIR and SPA juxtaposed or placed side by
                     side. Applying the principles explicated in Marico Limited (supra)
                     and Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), the expression HAIR SPA,

                     descriptive expression, is incapable of being distinctive. The function
                     of a trademark as defined under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_90">Section 2(zb)</a> of the Act is to
                     distinguish the goods or services of one person from the others, i.e. it
                     acts as a source identifier/indicator. From the plethora of material
                     placed on record by the Appellant, it appears prima facie that HAIR
                     SPA is a very commonly used expression and connotes and describes
                     hair treatment and falls short of serving as a source identifier of the
                     Respondents. The word &#x27;HAIR&#x27; in its plain dictionary meaning is &#x27;any
                     of the numerous fine, usually cylindrical, keratinous filaments
                     growing from the skin of humans and animals&#x27;. Similarly, the
                     dictionary meaning of the word &#x27;SPA&#x27; is &#x27;mineral spring or a
                     luxurious resort or hotel&#x27;. Thus, the expression denotes nothing more
                     than description of the product used for hair treatment/nourishment.
</p><p id="p_47">                     22.     Appellants have placed on record: (a) screenshots from the e-
                     commerce website Indiamart showing beauty salons, offering hair spa
                     services and describing the method as well as advantages of the
                     treatment; (b) articles from newspapers explaining/describing the
                     advantages and methodology of hair spa treatment; (c) copies of
                     service catalogues of various saloons/beauty parlours showing use of
                     the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;; (d) photographs of products of various
                     Companies, such as TRESEMME using the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;;
                     and (e) magazines showing use of expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; by several
                     entities in relation to cosmetics and hair products. The examples are
                     endless and fortify the position taken by the Appellants that not only
                     the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is generic and descriptive but also
                     common to trade and necessarily describes the nature, characteristics
                     and attributes of the product. Therefore, following observations of

                     though subtly had also sought to contend that the manner in which the
                     mark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is used by the Appellants, displaying the same
                     prominently in a larger font as compared to its registered trademark
                     &#x27;BERINA&#x27; establishes that the usage is in the sense of a trademark.
                     This contention also deserves to be rejected for various reasons.
                     Firstly, as held above, hair spa is a term of common usage to denote a
                     hair treatment and the Appellants are using &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; only for this
                     singular purpose. The expression by itself is not acting as a source
                     identifier linking the product to the Appellant and thus it is not right to
                     contend that Appellants are using HAIR SPA as a trademark. One
                     cannot lose sight of the fact that Appellants have always used their
                     trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27; in conjunction with the expression &#x27;HAIR
                     SPA&#x27;, which obviates any intention to use the same as the trademark
                     or to copy the registered trademark of the Respondents. The

                     observations of the Division Bench in Marico (supra) that persons
                     who are first of the blocks using a trademark which is purely
                     descriptive, ought to be discouraged from appropriating a descriptive
                     expression and monopolizing the trademarks, is very apt in the present
                     case. It was observed by the Court that where rights are claimed over a
                     word mark as a trademark which mark is in fact a tweak of a
                     descriptive word indicative of kind, quality, characteristics etc. it is
                     not open to urge that even though the opposite party is using the
                     descriptive word along with an independent trademark, yet the use of
                     the descriptive word be injuncted. If this argument is allowed to stand
                     then what cannot be done directly will be done indirectly. If there are
                     no rights of a Plaintiff to exclusive user of a trademark, then where
                     does arise the question of disentitlement of the Defendant to use the
                     said trademark inasmuch as any person who adopts a descriptive word
                     mark does so at his own peril.
</p><p id="p_50">                     25.       It was contended on behalf of the Respondents that even
                     descriptive words are registrable as trademarks and some examples
                     were also cited. As a proposition of law, this cannot be doubted, but
                     the argument will not aid the Respondents. It has been repeatedly held
                     by Courts that the question of a mark having acquired a secondary
                     meaning is a matter of trial. The issue of &#x27;distinctiveness&#x27; of a mark
                     came up before the Division Bench in Marico Limited (supra) and
                     conscious of the Proviso to <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_91">Section 9</a> of the Act, the Court examined
                     the meaning ascribed to the expression &#x27;distinctive&#x27;. Relevant para is
                     as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                             &quot;15. The word &#x27;distinctive&#x27; is not directly defined in the Act.
                             However meaning of distinctive is indicated in the definitions of
                             &#x27;trade mark&#x27; [<a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_92">Section 2(zb)</a>] and &#x27;well known trade mark&#x27; [<a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_93">Section
                             2(zg)</a>]. The word has been explained in a plethora of judgments.</blockquote>

                             what should be the meaning of the expression &#x27;distinctiveness&#x27; in the
                             situation when the trade mark is a word mark of descriptive nature.
                             When a trade mark, which is a word mark, is arbitrarily adapted and
                             is such having no co-relation to the goods in question, then in such a
                             case distinctiveness is achieved by normal and ordinary use of the
                             trade mark with respect to the goods and it has been repeatedly held
                             that such trade mark is entitled to the highest degree of protection.
                             However this is not and cannot/should not be so for a trade mark
                             which is a descriptive word mark. Some colour has to be taken for
                             the word &#x27;distinctive&#x27; as found in the proviso to <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_94">Section 9</a> from the
                             expression &#x27;well known trade mark&#x27; which follows the distinctiveness
                             aspect as found in the said proviso. Courts should ordinarily lean
                             against holding distinctiveness of a descriptive trade mark unless the
                             user of such trade mark is over such a long period of time of many
                             many years that even a descriptive word mark is unmistakably and
                             only and only relatable to one and only source i.e. the same has
                             acquired a secondary meaning. A case in point is the use of &#x27;Glucon-
                             D&#x27; for 60 years in the recent judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_95">Heinz
                             Italia v. Dabur India Ltd</a>., (2007) 6 SCC 1 A period of 60 years is
                             indeed a long period of time and thus distinctiveness of the
                             descriptive word mark used as a trade mark was accepted, albeit in
                             a tweaked form of the normal descriptive word &#x27;Glucose&#x27;. Therefore,
                             when the descriptive trade mark is used only by one person
                             undisturbed for a very long period of time, without anyone else
                             attempting to use the trade mark during this long period time, a case
                             can be established of a descriptive word having achieved
                             distinctiveness and a secondary meaning.&quot;

                    persuaded to come to a prima facie conclusion that Respondents&#x27;
                    trademark HAIR SPA has acquired distinctiveness to claim an
                    exclusive monopoly and exclude others from using the generic

                    of various products sold by the Respondents, mostly shampoos and
                    hair colours under the banner of Respondents&#x27; Company and
                    &quot;L&#x27;OREAL&quot; marks, with sprinklings of sales in hair spa product and
                    curiously some invoices do not have sales pertaining to the hair spa
                    product. From the said invoices it cannot be said at this stage that
                    there is undisturbed user of HAIR SPA for a very long time, without
                    any other entity attempting to use it, so as to hold even prima facie

                     as held in Marico limited (supra) that sometimes the sales or the
                     values can be deceptive but even then it would be a point which is best
                     decided during the trial.
</p><p id="p_53">                     27.     Applying the aforestated observations to the facts of this case,
                     Respondents have failed to discharge the onus of establishing prima
                     facie case of infringement. It would also be apposite to refer to the
                     observations of the Division Bench in Marico Limited (supra), while
                     dealing with the question of grant of interim injunction in a claim for
                     infringement, pertaining to descriptive trademarks. Relevant passages
                     are as follows:-

                             present case being the first issue of whether the appellant by virtue
                             of the registrations has got an exclusive right to use the expressions
                             &quot;LOSORB&quot; and &quot;LO-SORB&quot; and is thereby entitled to prevent
                             anyone else from using any trade mark which is identical or
                             deceptively similar to the registered trade marks.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">                             23.     A reading of the aforesaid sections taken together show that :
                             A trade mark is ordinarily used in relation to goods of a
                             manufacturer. A trade mark can be registered but ordinarily
                             registration is not granted if the mark falls under Subsections (1)(a)
                             to (1)(c) of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_96">Section 9</a>. The proviso, however, provides for entitlement
                             to registration although ordinarily not permissible under <a href="/doc/1288548/" id="a_97">Section
                             9(1)(a)</a> to (c), provided that the mark has acquired a distinctive
                             character as a result of its use prior to registration or is otherwise a
                             well known trade mark. Registration is only prima facie evidence of
                             its validity and the presumption of prima facie validity of
                             registration is only a rebuttable presumption, see para 31 of N.R.</blockquote>

                             conferred by registration for exclusive use of the trade mark in
                             relation to goods is if the registration is valid and which flows from
                             the expression &quot;if valid&quot; occurring in <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_99">Section 28</a>. The expression &quot;if

                             are pending as on the date of filing of a suit for infringement if the

                             valid&quot; as occurring in <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_102">Section 28</a>) then the Court may raise an issue

                             Board for rectification of the register. Even in the circumstances
                             where the Court stays the suit for three months and permits a party
                             to apply for cancellation/rectification, the Court can pass any

                             mark takes up the plea with respect to registration of trade mark

</p><p id="p_57">                             26.     In view of the aforesaid legal position, the first issue which
                             arises is whether the learned Single Judge was justified in holding
                             that he was entitled to look into the validity of registration of the
                             trade mark. Of course, we must hasten to add we are doing so and so
                             has the learned Single Judge done, only for the purpose of deciding
                             the interlocutory application for grant or refusal of injunction and as
                             envisaged in <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_106">Section 124(5)</a>.
</p><p id="p_58">                             27.     In the facts of the present case, we find that the injunction
                             application was disposed of at a stage when the defendant filed an
                             application for vacation of the injunction and no written statement of
                             the defendant was on record. As already discussed hereinabove, the
                             stage of challenging the validity of registration by the defendant
                             arises only when the written statement is filed, because it is only in
                             the written statement that the plea of the registration being invalid
                             would be taken up in furtherance of the expression &quot;if valid&quot; as
                             found in <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_107">Section 28</a> and also similar language as found in <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_108">Section
                             124(1)(a)</a>. This also flows from the fact that under <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_109">Section 31(1)</a>
                             registration is only a prima facie evidence of validity and not
                             conclusive evidence. Registration would only be a conclusive
                             evidence of validity if the rectification/cancellation proceedings filed
                             for cancellation of the registered trade mark do not finally succeed.
                             We are, therefore of the view that in the facts of the present case
                             since the issue of invalidity of registration is to be taken up only in a
                             written statement for an issue to be framed with respect thereto in

                             filed when the impugned order was passed, where such an issue
                             would/could be raised, the learned Single Judge was justified in

                             reference to the expression &quot;if valid&quot; as occurring in <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_111">Section 28</a> and

                             considered this issue of prima facie validity of registration of trade
                             mark for deciding the interlocutory application and which is very
                             much permissible and in fact so provided under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_114">Section 124(5)</a>.
</p><p id="p_60">                             29.     Now let us examine the issue of prima facie validity of
                             registrations of the appellant for deciding the aspect of grant of
                             injunction in the facts of the present case. When we look at the facts
                             in the present case, we find that when the application was filed for
                             registration of the trade marks &quot;LOSORB&quot; and &quot;LO-SORB&quot;, the
                             applications clearly stated &quot;proposed to be used&quot;. Quite clearly
                             therefore on the date of registration there was no user at all of the
                             trade mark, much less such use of it so as to give the trade mark a
                             distinctive character as a result of use made of it or the same being a
                             well known trade mark. Clearly therefore, the registration of the
                             trade mark &quot;LOSORB&quot; and &quot;LO-SORB&quot; were prima facie invalid
                             because the said trade marks basically are a minor variation of a
                             descriptive expression &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; which is not an unusual
                             juxtaposition of words in the English language and no evidence
                             existed before the Registrar of distinctiveness because the marks
                             were sought to be registered not on proof of actual user so as to
                             make the same distinctive on the date of filing of the application for

                             &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; conveys the same meaning as &quot;ABSORBS LOW&quot;.
                             Such descriptive word marks are clearly such for which there is an
                             absolute ground for refusal of registration by virtue of <a href="/doc/382675/" id="a_115">Section
                             9(1)(b)</a> of the Act because clearly the said word marks are in fact
                             clear indications of designation of the kind, quality, intended
                             purpose or other characteristics of the goods of which the trade
                             mark is applied. The registrations being prima facie invalid no
                             action for infringement would thus lie. On the issue of acquiring
                             distinctiveness subsequent to the making of the application for
                             registration, we have already dilated at length in the earlier part of
                             this judgment while dealing with the issue of passing off that it
                             cannot be said that the mark &quot;LOW ABSORB&quot; has acquired a

                     observations in Marico Limited (supra):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">                             &quot;12. An important aspect with respect to the issue of passing of is
                             that the respondent is selling its product with a prominent trade
                             mark &quot;Sundrop&quot; and which appears on the packaging of the
                             respondent in a very prominent size, much larger than the size of the
                             expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot;. The colour scheme of
                             the respective packaging is also wholly different. Appellant&#x27;s colour
                             scheme is orange and the respondent&#x27;s blue. Merely because, the
                             consumers are same and the trade channel same, it cannot be said
                             that in the facts and circumstances of the case, there is a possibility
                             of confusion, because there are more than enough differentiating
                             features on the packaging so as to avoid any issue of the respondent
                             passing of its goods as that of the appellant.

                             respective products of the parties are identical viz. edible oil, it
                             cannot be said that the respondent is passing of its goods as that of
                             the appellant-plaintiff.&quot;

                     aforementioned and comparing the use of expression of &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;
                     as a descriptor with the registered trademark &#x27;BERINA&#x27; along with
                     the trade dress, colour combination, etc. which are completely
                     different, it cannot be said that Appellants have an intent to

                     origin. For ready reference a comparative of the competing rival

                     &#x27;peach&#x27; while that of the Respondents is &#x27;blue&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27;. Even the
                     use of the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; in terms of their font, lettering
                     style, colour, etc is different. Standalone factor that consumers and the
                     trade channels are common, cannot lead to a conclusion that there is a
                     possibility of confusion, because in this case the differential factors
                     overweigh trivial commonalities/similarities, if any. It is trite that
                     passing off is a cause which is premised on a misrepresentation by the
                     Defendant with a view to encash on the goodwill and reputation of the
                     Plaintiff, leading to confusion amongst the consumers. Once the
                     elements of confusion and misrepresentation are out of the frame, it
                     cannot be urged that claim for passing off is made out. The Trial Court
                     has thus erred in all aspects in granting injunction in favour of the
                     Respondents. In fact, as rightly contended by the Appellants, Trial
                     Court has not even dealt with the most crucial issues raised by the
                     Appellants, despite noting the contentions on those aspects.
</p><p id="p_64">                     31.     It was strenuously urged by learned counsel for the Appellants
                     that a plea was taken before the Trial Court that the Plaintiffs
                     trademark &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is generic and common to trade and that the
                     Appellants were using the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; as a descriptor and
                     not in the sense of the trademark. Examples were cited to show how
                     mark was common to trade and a generic term. Reading of the
                     impugned order shows that the stand of the Appellants that these
                     issues were raised before the Trial Court is substantiated. Trial Court
                     has in so many words recorded these contentions, however, neither of
                     them have been dealt with. Trial Court has only recorded the
                     contentions and thereafter extracting <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_116">Section 124</a> of the Act,
                     concluded that sitting in the arm chair of an ordinary customer,

                     the consumer of average intelligence and imperfect recollection and
                     that the Defendants can pass off their goods as that of the Plaintiffs to
                     their detriment. On this basis a finding of prima facie case, balance of
                     convenience and irreparable harm has been rendered in favour of the
                     Respondents, restraining the Appellants from dealing with the
                     expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;, in any manner whatsoever. A holistic
                     reading of the impugned order also shows that the Trial Court has
                     decided the matter oblivious of the record before it, which contained
                     as many as 219 pages of the judgments filed by the Appellants and the
                     obvious consequence is that the Trial Court has not applied its mind to
                     the judgments and the propositions of law relied upon, which may
                     have tilted the case in favour of the Appellants. This becomes
                     significant as the judgment in Marico Limited (supra), entirely covers
                     the case of the Appellants, but there is not even a reference to the
                     judgement, though cited and filed by the Appellant.
</p><p id="p_65">                     32.     Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents has relied on
                     several judgments during the course of arguments but having gone
                     through them this Court is of the view that none of these judgments
                     come to the aid of the Respondents. Reliance was placed on the
                     judgment in Lupin Ltd. (supra), to contend that prima facie
                     satisfaction of the Court to stay the trial under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_117">Section 124</a> of the Act
                     is also not enough to refuse grant of interim injunction. It is only in
                     exceptional circumstances such as the registration being ex-facie
                     illegal or fraudulent that the Court will refuse interim injunction in
                     favour of the registered proprietor of the trademark and a heavy
                     burden lies on the Defendant to rebut the strong presumption in law to
                     the validity of a registered trademark. There can be no dispute on the
                     proposition of law laid down in the said case. In my view, the
                     judgment only inures in favour of the Appellants as the Court has held

                     that it is open to the Court to go into the question of validity of the
                     registration of the trademarks of a Plaintiff, in view of the expression
                     &#x27;if valid&#x27; in <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_118">Section 28</a> of the Act, relying on the observations of the
                     Division Bench in the case of Marico Limited (supra), wherein it was
                     held that under <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_119">Section 31</a> of the Act registration is only prima facie
                     evidence of the validity of the registration albeit a heavy onus lies on
                     the Defendant to rebut the presumption of validity. The Court also
                     observed that though a challenge to the validity of the registered
                     trademark can finally succeed only in rectification proceedings,
                     however, there is no express or implied bar taking away the
                     jurisdiction and power of the Civil Court to consider the challenge to
                     the validity at the interlocutory stage by way of a prima facie finding.
                     In Anil Verma (supra), the Court held that descriptive nature of a
                     mark can be determined by applying two tests: (a) Degree of
                     Imagination Test; and (b) Competitors&#x27; need test, which are inversely
                     proportional to each other. If the degree of imagination required is
                     higher, than need of the competitor decreases. If the need of the
                     competitors is not so high and there are alternate ways of describing
                     some services, then the degree of imagination required would be
                     higher. In the said case, the Court found as a matter of fact that the
                     expressions &#x27;Cash for Gold&#x27; and &#x27;Gold Buyers&#x27; do not describe the
                     entire gamut of services offered by the Plaintiff and the expressions
                     could be suggestive of some part of the business of the Plaintiff and no
                     evidence was placed on record by the Defendants to suggest that the
                     expressions were perceived in the market as descriptive expressions.
                     In fact, in the same judgment the Court observed that the expression
                     &#x27;WE BUY GOLD&#x27; was a sentence which described what the Plaintiff
                     does i.e. buys gold and therefore held that it was descriptive in nature.
                     The judgment is wholly inapplicable to the present case as the

                     expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is clearly descriptive of the product, which is
                     used for treatment and nourishment of damaged hair and at the cost of
                     repetition, be it stated that it is not used by the Appellants in the
                     trademark sense, but merely as a descriptor of the product in question.
</p><p id="p_66">                     33.     In Bata India Limited (supra), the Court held that POWER
                     could at best be termed as a suggestive mark for footwear which
                     would make it inherently distinctive. Even if one considers the nature
                     of the mark, it does not direct anyone immediately to shoes or to
                     footwear and imagination could at best lead to products related to
                     electricity, batteries etc. and it cannot therefore be termed as a
                     descriptive mark. Quite contrary, in the facts of the present case the
                     use of the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; would immediately direct a person
                     with average intelligence and prudent mind to a treatment pertaining
                     to hair and the descriptive nature of the mark can hardly be disputed.
                     In Hem Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and Others (supra), the Court
                     expounded the principle that a registered trademark is infringed by a
                     person if he uses it in such a manner as to render the use of the mark
                     likely to be taken as a trademark i.e. it indicates a connection in the
                     course of trade between the person and his goods, irrespective of his
                     intention. The Court, thereafter, came to a conclusion that the use of
                     the mark &#x27;MADHUR&#x27; by the Defendant was a use in the sense of a
                     trademark and was not descriptive of the product Agarbatti. Reliance
                     on the said judgment is wholly inapt in the facts of the present case as
                     the Appellants are not using the expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; in a
                     trademark sense. In Pidilite Industries Limited (supra), the issue
                     before the Court was an infringement of three registered trademarks of
                     the Plaintiff, two-word marks and one label mark viz. &#x27;FEVICOL
                     MARINE&#x27;. The contention of the Defendant was that both Plaintiff
                     and Defendant were using the word &#x27;MARINE&#x27; in a descriptive

                     word having a dictionary meaning and commonly used. The Court
                     held that the word &#x27;MARINE&#x27; forms a prominent and essential part of
                     the three registered trademarks of the Plaintiff and going by the
                     products for which they were used i.e. adhesives, it could not be said
                     that the trademarks are descriptive. Moreover, it was also found that
                     by reason of open, continuous and extensive sales over a period of 09
                     years, the mark &#x27;MARINE&#x27;, either by itself or as a constituent of the
                     registered trademark &#x27;FEVICOL MARINE&#x27;, had acquired a secondary
                     meaning/distinctiveness and had come to be exclusively associated
                     with the Plaintiff. &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27; is a word of common usage, common
                     to the trade and descriptive of the product and thus, in my view, the
                     judgment would be inapplicable to the facts of the present case. For
                     the same reason, the judgments in Walter Bushnell Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors.

                     the Supreme Court held that the mark had acquired extraordinary
                     reputation and goodwill in the State of Andhra Pradesh and
                     &#x27;EENADU&#x27; newspaper and T.V. were extremely well-known and
                     almost household words. Though the word &#x27;EENADU&#x27; may be a

                     identified the products and services provided by the Respondent

                     today only because of the use of the same for a considerably long time
                     as the tagline/slogan by the Respondent and the resultant association
                     thereof with the product toothpaste. Till it was so used, none, from the

                     descriptive of a toothpaste. It was further observed that the test of
                     descriptive is not of the day after long/repeated usage of some words
                     in relation to some goods or services, but of the day before such use
                     and therefore, before the day of first use of the expression
                     &#x27;ALLROUND PROTECTION&#x27;, in relation to a toothpaste, the same
                     could not have been said to be descriptive thereof. Clearly, both the
                     judgments would not apply to an expression &#x27;HAIR SPA&#x27;, when used
                     in the context of a product used for hair treatment and this is sufficient
                     to distinguish the two judgments from the present case.
</p><p id="p_68">                     35.     In Globe Super Parts (supra), the dispute before the Court
                     related to the mark &#x27;SUPERFLAME&#x27; and the question was whether
                     any proprietary rights can or have been acquired in the said mark. The
                     Court held that there was no word Superflame in the standard
                     dictionary of English language and prima facie it would appear that
                     the word was not a common place word of English language nor has
                     any meaning in that language. Therefore, the conclusion is inescapable
                     that it is a coined or fancy word and is made meaningful only when
                     applied to the product for which it is created. It was further observed
                     that Yellow flame, Red flame and Blue flame are part of general
                     public knowledge and have been in existence in the physical world
                     and may actually be descriptive of a naturally existing flame, but the
                     same could not be said for Superflame and that while the word
                     Superflame may have a meaning by itself, but that would not
                     denigrate the amount of skill and labour spent thinking it up and
                     giving it an expression. Since the judgment was passed post the trial,
                     on the basis of the evidence, the Court held that there was ample
                     evidence in the form of testimony of witnesses of the Defendant, who
                     admitted that the Plaintiffs were the first persons to use the word
                     Superflame upon their goods and the word Superflame is a coined or a

                     gas cookers or appliances. Appellants in the present case have been
                     able to prima facie demonstrate that the expression HAIR SPA is a
                     word which is commonly used and is common to the trade, by placing
                     on record plethora of documents indicating its use by various beauty
                     parlours, salons, etc. and can&#x27;t be equated with the word Superflame,
                     held to be a coined and fancy word by the Court.

                     Appellants is also in my view wholly misplaced as the same deals
                     with the presumption of confusion under <a href="/doc/1646788/" id="a_120">Section 29(3)</a> of the Act,
                     where there is identity of trademark and identity of the goods/services
                     for which the trademark is registered. In view of the finding in the
                     earlier part of the judgment that the Appellants are not using the HAIR
                     SPA as trademark, this judgment is clearly distinguishable in the facts
