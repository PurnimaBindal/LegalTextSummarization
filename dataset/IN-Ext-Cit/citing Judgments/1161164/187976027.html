</p><p id="p_2">1.These six petitions raise an important question of law concerning the

maintainability of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to

allowing or rejecting a pre-grant opposition filed under Section 25 (1) of the

Act</a>, particularly after the amendment to the relevant provisions by way of

<a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_5">Patents (Amendment) Act</a>, 2005 („<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_6">Amendment Act</a>‟) as well as the judgment

Patents &amp; Designs</a> (2008) 10 SCC 368 require to be examined.



The statutory scheme of the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_8">Patents Act</a>

</p><p id="p_5">3. <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_9">Section 15</a> of the Patents Act states that where the Controller is satisfied

that the application for grant of patent, or any specification or any other
W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009         page 3 of 25
 document filed in pursuance thereof, does not comply with the requirement of

the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_10">Patents Act</a> or the Rules, "the Controller may refuse the application or

may require the application, specification or other documents, as the case may

be, to be amended to the satisfaction before he proceeds with the application

or refuse the application on failure to do so."
</p>
<p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">4. Prior to its amendment in 2005 with effect from 1 st January 2005, <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_11">Section

25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_12">Patents Act</a> provided that at any time within four months from

the date of advertisement of the acceptance of a complete specification "any

person interested may given notice to the Controller of Patents („Controller‟)

of opposition to the grant of patent on the grounds set out in <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_13">Section 25</a> (1) (a)

to 25(1) (k) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_14">Patents Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_15">Section 25</a> (2), prior to the 2005 amendment,

stated that when any such notice of opposition is given, the Controller shall

notify the applicant (for a patent) and give to the applicant and the opponent

an opportunity of being heard before deciding the case. Therefore, at the pre-

grant stage, prior to the amendment in 2005, the Controller could either refuse

the patent application or require the applicant to make amendments to the

satisfaction of the Controller and if such changes were not made as directed,

he would refuse the application. Therefore <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_16">Section 15</a> of the Patents Act

contemplated either eventuality resulting from a decision of the Controller on

a pre-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_17">Section 25(1)</a> i.e. the grant of the patent with or

without amendments, or the refusal of the patent.

</p><p id="p_9">5. Prior to its amendment in 2005, against an order under <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> refusing

a patent and against an order under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_19">Section 25</a>, an appeal lay in terms of

<a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_20">Section 116</a> of the Patents Act to the High Court. Prior to 2005, there was no
W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 4 of 25
 provision for a post-grant opposition. However, the 2005 amendments

brought a significant change in this scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_10">


</p><p id="p_11">6. In 2002 amendments were made to the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_21">Patents Act</a> to provide for appeals to

the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in terms of the newly

inserted Section 117 A instead of appeals to the High Court under Section

</p><p id="p_12">116.   However, these amendments were not notified till 2nd April 2007.

Meanwhile another major set of amendments were introduced with effect

from 1st January 2005 under the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_22">Amendment Act</a> of 2005. For the first time a

provision was made, in the form <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_23">Section 25</a> (2) to provide for a post-grant

opposition. <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_24">Section 25(1)</a> concerning pre-grant opposition remained more or

less the same and sub-clauses (a) to (k) set out the various grounds on which a

pre-grant opposition could be filed. It also incorporated the pre-grant

opposition procedure which required the Controller to hear the opposer.

While under the amended <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_25">Section 25</a> (1) „any person‟ could file a pre-grant

opposition [as against only an „interested‟ person under the pre-amended

<a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_26">Section 25</a> (1)], only an „interested‟ person could file a post-grant opposition

under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_27">Section 25</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_28">Patents Act</a> as amended. The post-grant opposition

had to be filed "at any time after the grant of the patent but before the expiry

of a period of one year or from the date of publication of grant of the patent."

The amended <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_29">Section 25(2)</a> sets out the grounds on which such post-grant

opposition could be made. Under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_30">Section 25</a> (3) when such post-grant

opposition notice is given, the Controller simultaneously with notifying the

patentee shall also constitute an Opposition Board which would then conduct

the examination of such opposition and submit its recommendations to the

Controller. <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_31">Section 25(4)</a> states that thereafter the Controller shall make an

W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 5 of 25
 order, after giving the patent holder and the opposer an opportunity of being

heard and pass an order either to maintain or to amend or to revoke the patent.

Under <a href="/doc/41012435/" id="a_32">Section 25(6)</a> in the event the Controller orders that the patent shall be

maintained subject to amendment of the specification or any other document,

the patent shall stand amended accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">7. Simultaneous with the introduction of the remedy of a post-grant

opposition, the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_33">Amendment Act</a> 2005 also amended <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_34">Section 117A</a> to provide

an appeal against an order passed under <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_35">Section 25(4)</a> by the Controller on the

post-grant opposition which could be an order "either to maintain or to amend

or to revoke the patent."            Therefore as it presently stands, after the

amendment in 2005, while <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_36">Section 117A</a> provides an appeal to the IPAB

against an order under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_37">Section 25</a> (4), it does not expressly provide an appeal

against an order in a pre-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_38">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents

Act. What is significant however is that <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_39">Section 117A</a> does continue to

provide an appeal to the IPAB against an order of the Controller under

<a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_40">Section 15</a> of the Patents Act.
</p>
<p id="p_15">


The decision in J.Mitra &amp; Co. case
</p><p id="p_16">8. Before discussing the ratio of the judgment in J. Mitra&amp; Co., the facts of

that case may be noticed briefly. On 14th June 2000 J. Mitra filed an

application for the grant of a patent. A pre-grant opposition was filed by Span

Diagnostics Ltd. („Span‟) in 2000. On 23rd August 2006 the Controller

rejected Span‟s pre-grant opposition. As on that date against an order

rejecting the pre-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_41">Section 25</a>, an appeal was available to

Span before the High Court under <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_42">Section 116</a> of the Patents Act (it must be
W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 6 of 25
 clarified here that although Section 117 A was inserted in the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_43">Patents Act</a> in

2002, it was not notified till 2nd April 2007 and therefore as on August 2006

the older regime of an appeal before the High Court under <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_44">Section 116</a>

continued). Consequently, Span filed FAO Nos. 292 and 293 of 2006 in the

High Court on 17th October 2006 to challenge the rejection of its pre-grant

opposition by the Controller under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_45">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents Act.




</p><p id="p_17">9. An objection was taken by J. Mitra &amp; Co. to the maintainability of the

appeal before the High Court on the ground that the appeal was required to be

transferred to the IPAB in terms of Section 117 G notified with effect from 2nd

April 2007. By a judgment dated 1st April 2008 the High Court held that in

view of the fact that <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_46">Section 25</a> (2) which provided for a post-grant opposition

was introduced only on 4th April 2005 and Section 117 A was notified with

effect from only 2nd April 2007, the appeal filed by Span in the High Court on

17th October 2006 under <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_47">Section 116</a> was maintainable before it. However,

even while it noted that no appeal against an order under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_48">Section 25</a> (1) of the

<a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_49">Patents Act</a> was maintainable before the IPAB, the High Court transferred the

said appeal also to the IPAB because Section 117 G mandated that "all

appeals against any order or decision of the Controller" would get transferred

to the IPAB.
</p>
<p id="p_18">


</p><p id="p_19">10. Faced with the above anomalous situation, J. Mitra &amp; Co. filed a Special

Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the order of the High Court.

After analyzing the various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_50">Patents Act</a>, the Supreme Court

in para 29 (SCC, p. 381) held as under:

<p id="p_20">
W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 7 of 25
            "29. In the present case, the Legislature intended to provide
           for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to
           the Appellate Board against "post-grant proceedings". The
           Legislature intended to have a dichotomy between "pre-
           grant opposition" and "post-grant opposition". However, the
           Legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory
           appeal against grant of patent. The Legislature intended to
           obliterate appeal from "pre-grant proceedings", which
           existed earlier. However, it was left to the Executive to
           bring the enacted law into force vide notification. For some
           unknown reasons, the amended <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_51">Sections 116</a> and <a href="/doc/54389909/" id="a_52">117A(2)</a>
           were not brought into force till 2.4.07 whereas the concept
           of "pre- grant" and "post-grant" oppositions were brought
           into force w.e.f.1.1.2005. This is where the legislative intent
           got defeated during the interregnum. It is during this
           interregnum that respondent No. 3 filed its FAO No. 293/06
           in the High Court under <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_53">Section 116</a>, as it stood on 19.10.06
           under the <a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_54">Patents (Amendment) Act</a>, 1999. On that date, the
           amended <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_55">Section 117A</a>, suggested by <a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_56">Patents (Amendment)
           Act</a>, 2005, was not brought into force. On 19.10.06 the old
           law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the High
           Court. Respondent No. 3, in both the cases, preferred first
           appeals to the High Court under <a href="/doc/1277867/" id="a_57">Section 116</a> as it then
           stood. They are FAO No. 292/06 and FAO No. 293/06. We
           have to decide the fate of these pending appeals. One more
           aspect needs to be mentioned. <a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_58">Under the Patents
           (Amendment) Act</a>, 2005, appeal is provided to the Appellate
           Board against the order of the Controller under <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_59">Section
           25(4)</a>. However, that statutory appeal is maintainable only
           in "post-grant opposition" proceedings whereas respondent
           No. 3 herein has instituted first appeals under the law then
           prevailing, challenging the Order rejecting "pre-grant
           opposition" dated 23.8.06."

</p><p id="p_22"> 11. It was noticed by the Supreme Court that there were hardly one or two

matters of that nature that were pending in the High Court. It was observed

that Span could not be left without a remedy. Consequently, it was ordered

that the two appeals filed by Span should be heard and decided by the High

Court. An observation in para 31 of the order "that the Appellate Board

after 2nd April 2007 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders

passed by the Controller under <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_60">Section 25(4)</a> i.e. in cases of orders passed

in "post-grant opposition" is what has given rise to the present round of

litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">12. The challenge in these writ petitions is two types of orders of the

Controller in a pre-grant opposition filed under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_61">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents

Act. One allowing such opposition and refusing the grant of patent. The other,

rejecting the opposition and granting the patent. Arguments have been

advanced by learned counsel appearing for the applicants for the grant of

patent whose applications have been refused by accepting the pre-grant

opposition. Arguments have also been advanced on behalf of those who had

filed pre-grant oppositions which have either been allowed or rejected.




Distinction between pre-grant and post-grant opposition

</p><p id="p_25">13. In the first instance a distinction has to be drawn between a pre-grant

opposition and a post-grant opposition. While a pre-grant opposition can be

filed under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_62">Section 25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_63">Patents Act</a> at any time after the publication

of the patent application but before the grant of a patent, a post-grant

opposition under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_64">Section 25(2)</a> of the Patents Act has to be filed before the

W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 9 of 25
 expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the grant of patent. A

second significant difference, after the amendment of 2005, is that a pre-grant

opposition can be filed by „any person‟ whereas a post-grant opposition under

<a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_65">Section 25(2)</a> can be filed only by „any person interested‟. It may be noticed

that the application for revocation of a patent in terms of <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_66">Section 64</a> of the

Patents Act can also to be filed only by „any person interested‟. In other

words, the post-grant opposition and the application for revocation cannot be

filed by just about any person who is not shown to be a person who is

„interested‟. A third significant difference is that the representation at the

stage of pre-grant is considered by the Controller himself. Rule 55 of the

Patents Rules requires the Controller to consider the „statement and evidence

filed by the applicant‟ and thereafter either refuse to grant the patent or

require the complete specification to be amended to his satisfaction.           Of

course, in that event notice will be given to the applicant for grant of patent

who can file his reply and evidence. This Court finds merit in the contention

that the pre-grant opposition is in fact „in aid of the examination‟ of the patent

application by the Controller. The procedure is however different aspect as far

as the post-grant opposition is concerned. There in terms of <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_67">Section 25</a> (3), the

Controller has to constitute an Opposition Board consisting of such officers as

he may determine and refer to such Opposition Board the notice of opposition

along with other documents for its examination and recommendations. After

receiving the recommendations of the Opposition Board, the Controller gives

the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard. The Controller

then takes a decision to maintain, amend or revoke the patent. The fourth

major difference between the pre-grant and the post-grant opposition is that

while in terms of Section 117 A an appeal to the IPAB is maintainable against

W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 10 of 25
 the order of the Controller in a post-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_68">Section 25(4)</a> of

the Patents Act, an appeal has not been expressly been made available against

an order made under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_69">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents Act.
</p>
<p id="p_26">


</p><p id="p_27">14. There are two possible situations arising from the order passed by the

Controller in a pre-grant opposition.            Where the pre-grant opposition is

rejected, the aggrieved person would obviously be the person who has filed

the pre-grant opposition. Where the Controller accepts the pre-grant

opposition and therefore refuses the grant of patent or suggests amendments

which are then not carried out by the applicant resulting in the refusal of the

grant of patent, the aggrieved person obviously would be the applicant for the

patent.
</p>
<p id="p_28">


Where the pre-grant opposition is rejected and patent is granted

</p><p id="p_29">15. In the first eventuality, where the pre-grant opposition is rejected, it is

apparent from the decision in J. Mitra and from a reading of <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_70">Section 25</a> with

<a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_71">Section 117A</a> that as long as the person who has filed that opposition happens

to be a person interested, he would, after 1st January 2005 [the date with effect

from which <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_72">Section 25</a> (2) came into force although the provision was

introduced only on 4th April 2005] have the remedy of filing a post-grant

opposition. He can, after 2nd April 2007, also file an application before the

IPAB under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_73">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act for revocation of the patent. In

other words, as explained by the Supreme Court in J. Mitra &amp; Co. as long as

that person is able to show that he is a person „interested‟, he is not without a

remedy after his pre-grant opposition is rejected. He in fact has two remedies.


W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009    page 11 of 25
 Even if his post-grant opposition is rejected, he can thereafter file an appeal to

the IPAB under <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_74">Section 117A</a>. Against the decision of the IPAB in either

event he will have the remedy of seeking judicial review in accordance with

law by filing a petition in the High Court. At this juncture it may be noticed

that in an order dated 2nd March 2009 in SLP (C) No. 3522 of 2009 (Indian

Network for People with HIV/AIDS v. F.Hoffman-La Roche) the Supreme

Court permitted the unsuccessful pre-grant opposer, who had challenged the

rejection of his opposition by the Controller, to participate in the post-grant

stage.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">16. The law is well settled that notwithstanding that a High Court has the

power and the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to interfere

with the orders of any statutory authority which is of a quasi-judicial nature, it

will decline to exercise such jurisdiction where there is an efficacious

alternative statutory remedy available to the aggrieved person. See for e.g.,

</p><p id="p_33"> 17. Counsel for the parties have drawn the attention of this Court to a recent

decision of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/499132/" id="a_83">Glochem

Industries Ltd. v. Cadila Healthcare Ltd</a>. (its decision dated 6th November

2009 in Writ Petition No. 1605 of 2009). Although in that case the petitioner

whose pre-grant opposition had been rejected was obviously a person

„interested‟ the High Court overruled the objections as to maintainability

since it took the view that the Controller‟s order in that case suffered from

obvious jurisdictional errors. The Bombay High Court nevertheless noted that

"it is a matter of prudence and discretion as to whether this court should

entertain the writ petition or not" and that in the facts and circumstances of

that case it was "not proper to non-suit the petitioners at the threshold on this

count." To this Court it appears that the settled law as explained in several

decisions of the Supreme Court (which incidentally have not been adverted to

by the Bombay High Court in Glochem) makes it clear that this Court should

not entertain the writ petition, not because it does not have the power or

jurisdiction, but because the petitioner has an efficacious alternative statutory

remedy to exhaust.
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">18. To summarise this part of the discussion, as regards persons who have not

succeeded in the pre-grant opposition stage to prevent the grant of a patent,

and are persons „interested‟ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_84">Section 25(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_85">Section

64</a> of the Patents Act, their remedy against the rejection of their pre-grant

opposition is to file a post-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_86">Section 25(2)</a> and await the

decision of the Controller. If they are still aggrieved by that decision under




W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 13 of 25
 <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_87">Section 25(4)</a> of the Patents Act, they can file an appeal before the IPAB in

terms of <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_88">Section 117A</a> of the Patents Act.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

Where the pre-grant opposition is by a third party
</p><p id="p_37">19. It was contended by some of the counsel appearing for those who filed the

pre-grant opposition, that where the pre-grant opposer is a third party and not

a person „interested‟, then such a person would not have the remedy of either

filing a revocation under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_89">Section 64</a> or a post-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_90">Section

25(2)</a>. In that event the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_91">Article 226</a> of the Constitution cannot

be shut out to such a person. This was countered by learned counsel for the

applicants for grant of patent by submitting that the legislature consciously

intended not to give persons who are not interested further opportunities to

challenge the grant of a patent as that would make the whole process

extremely cumbersome for the applicant for a patent. Consequently, it is

submitted that the said legislative scheme cannot be substituted by the Court

and that there was nothing unreasonable in not entertaining a writ petition at

the instance of such person.
</p>
<p id="p_38">


</p><p id="p_39">20. In the first place this Court would like to observe that none of the

applicants who have filed a pre-grant opposition in these cases, and whose

applications have either been accepted or rejected, are persons who are not

„interested persons‟. Therefore this question is purely academic as far as this

batch of petitions is considered. Secondly, prior to the amendment in 2005, a

pre-grant opposition could be filed only by an interested person and not a

third party. The right of „any‟ person to file a pre-grant opposition was

granted only with effect from 1st January 2005 when the re-cast <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_92">section 25</a> (1)

W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 14 of 25
 became effective. Given the differences in the pre-grant and post-grant

oppositions, the legislature appears to have consciously denied to a third party

a further statutory remedy of a post-grant opposition in the event of such third

party not succeeding in the pre-grant stage to prevent the grant of patent.

Since there is no challenge to the constitutional validity of the re-cast <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_93">Section

25</a> by any third party in these proceedings, this Court is not called upon to

decide that issue. Nevertheless, as regards the maintainability of a writ

petition by such third party pre-grant opposer against the Controller‟s order

rejecting the opposition, this Court would like to observe that the power under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_94">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is wide and can be exercised on the facts and

circumstances of a given case where it appears to this Court that there is no

other efficacious remedy available or that the interests of justice require this

Court to interfere.
</p>
<p id="p_40">


</p><p id="p_41">21. Therefore where a pre-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_95">Section 25</a> (1) is filed by a

person who is a third party and not a person interested in the sense of the term

under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_96">Section 25(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_97">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act, and such pre-grant

opposition is rejected by the Controller, it would be for this Court when

approached by such third party pre-grant opposer under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_98">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution to determine if in the facts and circumstances, the petition

requires to be entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_42">


Pre-grant opposition is accepted and the grant of patent is refused
</p><p id="p_43">22. In the second eventuality where the pre-grant opposition is accepted and

the grant of patent is refused by the Controller, although the decision is one

taken under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_99">Section 25(1)</a>, it is in effect a decision relatable to and under
W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009   page 15 of 25
 <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_100">Section 15</a> of the Patents Act. An appeal is provided under <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_101">Section 117A</a> of

the Patents Act against the decision of the Controller under <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_102">Section 15</a> of the

Patents Act. It appears to this Court that the observation in J. Mitra in para

24 that "the Appellate Board after 2nd April 2007 is entitled to hear appeals

only arising from orders passed by the Controller under <a href="/doc/44128070/" id="a_103">Section 25(4)</a> i.e. in

cases of orders passed in post-grant opposition" has to be understood in the

context of that case where the Court was only considering whether against the

rejection of a pre-grant opposition an appeal lay to the High Court or to the

IPAB. Considering that the appeal in that case had been filed in the High

Court on 17th October 2006 prior to <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_104">Section 117A</a> being notified, the Supreme

Court in J. Mitra&amp;Co. held that the said appeal would continue before the

High Court. The question whether an appeal would lie against the refusal by

the Controller to grant a patent after accepting the pre-grant opposition under

<a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_105">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents Act did not arise for consideration in J.Mitra &amp;

Co. The further question whether such refusal to grant patent would in fact be

relatable to <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_106">Section 15</a> of the Patents Act also did not arise for consideration.

Consequently, there was no occasion for the Supreme Court in J. Mitra &amp; Co.

to decide whether in such event an appeal would be available to the applicant

for patent before the IPAB.
</p>
<p id="p_44">


</p><p id="p_45">23. In the considered view of this Court where the grant of patent is refused

by the Controller after accepting a pre-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_107">Section 25(1)</a> of

the Patents Act, the applicant for a patent will have a remedy by way of an

appeal to the IPAB under <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_108">Section 117A</a> of the Patents Act. The refusal to

grant patent is in fact relatable to and should be understood as an order by the

W.P. (Civil) No. 8388 of 2009
</p><p id="p_48">25. In this petition the Petitioner Eli Lilly &amp; Co. filed an application on 23 rd

January 1995 for a patent in respect of „Tetracyclic Derivatives.‟ Exclusive

Marketing Rights were granted to it on 26th August 2004. The first

examination report was issued by the Patent Office on 12th April 2005. On

23rd September 2004 Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited („RLL‟) filed a pre-grant

opposition. On 22nd March 2007 the Assistant Controller of Patents and

Designs, New Delhi gave a decision on the pre-grant opposition allowing the

process claims 11 to 25 and 28 and declined the product claims. On 22 nd May

2007 Eli Lilly &amp; Co. filed a review petition as regards the rejection of its

product claim. The Assistant Controller dismissed the review petition on 20 th

June 2008 on the ground that it was not maintainable. Further, Eli Lilly &amp; Co.

was directed to comply with the directions in the impugned order dated 22 nd

March 2007 deleting the products and retaining the process claims by 20th

June 2008. Since this was not done by Eli Lilly, by a decision dated 1st July

2008 the Assistant Controller passed an order refusing to grant patent. On 4 th

July 2008 Eli Lilly &amp; Co. requested the Assistant Controller to reconsider the

order dated 1st July 2008. Thereafter, the present petition was filed by Eli

Lilly &amp; Co under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_110">Article 226</a> challenge the orders dated 22nd March 2007, 20th

</p><p id="p_52">27. In view of the decision of this Court as detailed hereinbefore, this Court

declines to exercise its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_111">Article 226</a> to entertain this petition,

not because it does not have the power to do so, but because in the considered

view of this Court, the Petitioner has an efficacious remedy by way of an

appeal under <a href="/doc/525487/" id="a_112">Section 117</a> A of the Patents Act before the IPAB. The order

refusing the grant of patent is in fact an order under <a href="/doc/673988/" id="a_113">Section 15</a> of the Patents

Act which in terms of Section 117 A is an appealable order. If the appeal

before the IPAB is filed by Eli Lilly &amp; Co within a period of two weeks from

today, accompanied by an application for condonation of delay in filing the

appeal, the IPAB will consider and decide such application, after hearing

RLL. The IPAB will take into account the period during which Eli Lilly &amp;

Co.‟s review application against the order dated 22nd March 2007 and

thereafter the present writ petition were pending. All contentions of both Eli

Lilly &amp; Co. and RLL are left open to be urged before the IPAB which will be

dealt with such contentions in accordance law. The petition is disposed of in

the above terms.

is the same as in WP (Civil) 8388 of 2009 except that the pre-grant opposition

in this case was filed by the Respondent Ajanta Pharma Limited („APL‟).


W.P. (C) Nos. 332 of 2010 &amp; 13295, 12006, 8393, 8392 &amp; 8389 of 2009    page 18 of 25
</p><p id="p_55"> 29. Aggrieved by the decision dated 23rd February 2007 by the Assistant

Controller allowing the process claims of Eli Lilly &amp; Co., APL filed an appeal

in this Court being FAO No. 136 of 2007 on 3 rd April 2007 i.e. one day after

coming into force of <a href="/doc/525487/" id="a_114">Section 117</a> A of the Patents Act. By an order dated 1st

May 2007 this Court transferred the appeal to the IPAB. It is stated by APL

that at that point of time Eli Lilly &amp; Co. did not challenge the order of this

Court and participated in the proceedings before the IPAB. However, after

waiting more than 13 months, on 11th June 2008 Eli Lilly &amp; Co. filed an

interlocutory application before the IPAB seeking dismissal of the APL‟s

appeal on the ground of maintainability. The IPAB by its order dated 13th

August 2008 rejected Eli Lilly‟s interlocutory application. In its order the

IPAB held that the right of APL to file an appeal in this Court had accrued

even on the date when APL had filed a pre-grant opposition and that right

could not be taken away only because Section 117 A had been notified with

effect from 2nd April 2007. Secondly, since the High Court had itself

transferred the appeal to it, the IPAB was bound to hear the appeal.




</p><p id="p_56">30. Mr. Rajiv Kumar Virmani, learned Senior counsel appearing for the APL

vehemently opposed the plea of the Petitioner that it should be permitted to

file an appeal before the IPAB on the ground that by not challenging the

earlier order dated 1st May 2007 passed by this Court, Eli Lilly should be

deemed to have waived its right to file an appeal or to oppose APL‟s appeal

before the IPAB.

</p><p id="p_58"> 31. This Court has difficulty in accepting the above submissions on behalf of

APL. It is also unable to concur with the views expressed by IPAB for the

following reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_59"> (i) The earlier order dated 1st May 2007 passed by this Court and the

 decision dated 13th August 2008 by IPAB did not have the benefit of the

 later decision dated 21st August 2008 of the Supreme Court in J.Mitra &amp;

 Company (supra) which clears the anomalous situation concerning the

 maintainability of an appeal in this Court after the notification of <a href="/doc/525487/" id="a_115">Section

 117</a> A of the Patents Act. It is plain now that since APL‟s appeal was filed in

 this Court after 2nd April 2007, its appeal cannot be maintained in this Court.


</p><p id="p_60"> (ii) It is not possible to agree with the view of IPAB that since the right to

 file an appeal had accrued on the very date that APL had filed its pre-grant

 opposition, and on which date <a href="/doc/525487/" id="a_116">Section 117</a> A of the Patents Act had not

 come into effect, the appeal would be maintainable in the High Court, and

 by virtue of Section 117 G, before the IPAB. As clearly explained by the

 Supreme Court in J.Mitra the remedy for an interested person whose pre-

 grant opposition has been rejected is to file a post-grant opposition.


</p><p id="p_61"> (iii) Since in this case APL filed its appeal in the High Court after the

 coming into force of Section 117 A, it cannot take advantage of the direction

 in J Mitra &amp; Co. to continue with its appeal before the IPAB.


</p><p id="p_62"> (iv) It is not the contention of APL that it is not an interested party.

 Therefore, to the extent that the pre-grant opposition has been rejected and

 the process claims of Eli Lilly have been entertained, it is in the same

 position as an interested party whose pre-grant opposition has been refused.

 As already explained hereinbefore, APL had two remedies in such

 <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_118">Patents Act</a> or file an application under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_119">Section 64</a> before the IPAB for

 revocation of the patent. In any event no appeal is maintainable in this Court

 or the IPAB at the instance of APL against the Controller‟s order dated 22nd

 March 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_63">


</p><p id="p_64">32. APL‟s appeal before the IPAB is not maintainable and is liable to be

dismissed as such. In any event it has been rendered infructuous since in the

meanwhile Eli Lilly‟s patent has itself been refused. Therefore, as and when

Eli Lilly succeeds in getting the Controller to grant its patent (either the

product or the process patent or both), two courses are open to APL. It can file

an application under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_120">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act before the IPAB for

revocation of the patent. It can also file a post-grant opposition under <a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_121">Section

25</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_122">Patents Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_65">


</p><p id="p_66">33. As far as Eli Lilly is concerned, it has a remedy by way of an appeal

before the IPAB against the impugned orders dated 22nd March 2007 (to the

extent of refusal of the grant of a product patent) and the consequential order

of 1st July 2008 refusing the grant of patent. If such appeal is filed within a

period of two weeks accompanied by an application for condonation of delay

it would be considered by IPAB in accordance with law after hearing APL as

well.

</p><p id="p_70">35. The Petitioner M/s. UCB Farchim SA filed an application on 9th January

2007 in the patents office for grant of patent. A pre-grant opposition was filed

by the Respondent No.1 Cipla Limited („Cipla‟) on 4th December 2008. On

24th July 2009 the Assistant Controller passed an order allowing the pre-grant

opposition and refusing the grant of patent. It is the said order which has been

challenged in the present petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_123">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.




</p><p id="p_71">36. Cipla has filed a note of arguments which have been reiterated by its

counsel Ms.Pratibha Singh. It is contended that after the decision of the

Supreme Court in J. Mitra &amp; Co. (supra) "the correct course of action to be

followed by the Petitioner would be that of preferring an appeal to the IPAB

under <a href="/doc/525487/" id="a_124">Section 117</a> A of the Patents Act and not filling of the present writ

petition."
</p>
<p id="p_72">


</p><p id="p_73">37. This Court has held hereinabove that the correct course of action for an

applicant for grant of patent who is aggrieved by the refusal to grant patent is

to file an appeal before the IPAB.
</p>
<p id="p_74">


</p><p id="p_75">38. Accordingly, this Court declines to entertain the present writ petition and

permits the Petitioner to file an appeal within a period of two weeks before

IPAB accompanied by an application for condonation of delay. The IPAB

will consider such application, after hearing Cipla, and after accounting for

the period during which the present writ petition was pending.

</p><p id="p_78">40. The Petitioner M/s. Yeda Research &amp; Development Co. Limited

(„YRDCL‟) has filed an application for grant of patents on 5th February 2003.

The Respondent Natco Pharma Limited („NPL‟) filed a pre-grant opposition

Assistant Controller of Patens rejected the application of YRDCL for grant of

patents. The said order has been challenged in the present petition.

the Patents Act against the order dated 3rd March 2009 passed by the Assistant

Controller of Patents. If such an appeal is filed within two weeks,

accompanied by an application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal,

the IPAB will consider such application on merits in accordance with law

after accounting for the period during which the present writ petition has been

pending. Needless to say that IPAB will hear NPL before passing such order.
