                                   or impairing the goods which are put in the foreign

                                   companies abroad. What is pleaded is that the
                                   physical features of the printers sold abroad are
                                   different from the features of the printers sold in

                                   placed in the International market are not impaired

                                   distribution of the goods. With respect to after sales
                                   services, since the respondents do not warranty
                                   anything regarding their goods sold abroad, but
                                   imported into India and further sold, they not being
                                   responsible for the warranty of those goods, nothing
                                   turns thereon, as regards said plea. There may be
                                   some merit that the ordinary consumer, who is
                                   provided with warranties and after sales by the
                                   appellants, on not receiving satisfactory after sales
                                   service, may form a bad impression of the product of
                                   the respondents and thus to said extent one may
                                   recognize a possible damage to the reputation of the
                                   respondents    pertaining     to   Samsung/SAMSUNG
                                   printers and Samsung/SAMSUNG products sold in
                                   India after importation. But, this can be taken care of
                                   by   passing   suitable     directions   requiring   the
                                   appellants to prominently display in their shop that
                                   the Samsung/SAMSUNG printers sold by them are
                                   imported by the appellants and that after sales
                                   services and warranties are not guaranteed nor are
                                   they provided under the authority and control of the
                                   respondents and that the appellants do so at their
                                   own end and with their own efforts. This would
