made applicable to certain `backward areas' in India that were

predominantly occupied by tribal people. These backward regions

covered an area of more than 1,20,000 square miles. However, the

characteristics of these areas and their populations varied widely. By Act

XIV of 1874, Santhal Parganas and Chutia Nagpur Division (now known

as Chhotanagpur Division) were created and in these `Scheduled

districts', tribal communities were accorded a certain degree of

autonomy to regulate their affairs on the basis of their own conventions

and traditions. Many of these communities chose their leaders through

an informal consensus among other customary methods for selection.

When the Constitution was enacted, these areas were designated as

`Scheduled Areas'. <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_1">Article 244</a> of the Constitution explicitly states that

the provisions of the Fifth Schedule shall apply in respect of the

administration and control of the Scheduled Areas in any State other

than the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The

provisions of the Sixth Schedule guide the administration of tribal areas

in those states.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3. Paragraph (4) of the Fifth Schedule states that there shall be in each

State having a "Schedule Area", a `Tribes Advisory Council' consisting of

not more than twenty members of whom, as nearly as may be, three-

fourths shall be the representatives of the Scheduled Tribes in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                        2</span>
Legislative Assembly of the State. It was the duty of the `Tribes Advisory

Council' to advise on matters pertaining to the welfare and advancement

of the Scheduled Tribes in the State. Paragraph (5) of the Fifth Schedule

states that the Governor of the State may by public notification direct

that any particular Act of Parliament or the Legislature of the State shall

not apply to a Scheduled Area or would apply subject to such exceptions

and modifications as he may specify. The Governor of the State may also

make regulations for the peace and good government of any area in a

State which is for the time being a Scheduled Area. The Governor of the

State has also been given the power to repeal or amend any existing Act

of Parliament or of the Legislature of the State which is for the time being

applicable to the area in question.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4. Hence, it is evident that the framers' intent behind including the Fifth

Schedule was that of a separate administrative scheme for Scheduled

Areas in order to address the special needs of tribal communities.

During the debates on the floor of the Constituent Assembly, some

members had criticized such differential treatment for Scheduled Tribes.

In response to such criticisms, Shri K.M. Munshi had said that `Adivasis'

or tribes were many in number belonging to different "ethnic, religious

and social groups" and he explained the object of the Drafting

Committee's proposals in the following words:

       "We want that the Scheduled Tribes in the whole country should
       be protected from the destructive impact of races possessing a
       higher and more aggressive culture and should be encouraged to
       develop their own autonomous life; at the same time we want them
       to take a larger part in the life of the country adopted. They should
       not be isolated communities or little republics to be perpetuated
       for ever..... object is to maintain them as little unconnected
       communities which might develop into different groups from the
       rest of the country..... and that these tribes should be absorbed in
       the national life of the country."

Schedule to the Constitution of India, the President of India made an

Order known as The Scheduled Area (Part A States) Order, 1950. With

respect to the then combined State of Bihar, this Order was applied to

Ranchi district, Singhbhum district (excluding Dalbhum sub-division)

and Santhal Pargana district. The following table shows the chronology

of the governmental measures which have identified Scheduled Areas in

the territories that lie in the present-day State of Jharkhand:

            practice, the principles enunciated in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_9">Article 39</a> and
            other Directive Principles of State Policy have to be
            followed more rigorously. On account of their
            simplicity arid ignorance, over the decades the tribals
            have been dispossessed of their natural and economic
            resources like land, forest, water, air, etc.. The
            dispossession has not been confined to that through
            private parties. For the purpose of promotion of
            general economic development projects, the State also
            has been depriving them of the basis means of
            livelihood. These processes have been operative since a
            long time causing human misery and socio-economic
            damage. No reliable picture is yet available, for
            instance, we are not seized on the total quantum of
            land alienated from the tribals both on private and
            State account nor the number of families, clans or
            Tribes involved. This has compelled some to perceive
            development as an agent of destruction. But since
            planned development has been an article of faith with
            us, it has to be ensured that implementation of the
            policies and programmes drawn up in tribal interest
            are implemented in tribal interest. Since, by and large,
            the politico-bureaucratic apparatus has failed in its
            endeavor, powers should be developed on the people
            so that they can formulate programmed which suit
            them and implement them for their own benefits."

belong to scheduled tribes, and (c) one-third of the seats should be

reserved for women. The Committee felt that certain provisions in Part IX

Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas are expected to have a majority of

tribal population, the Panchayats at different tiers should have a

majority of members who belong to the Scheduled Tribes (Hereinafter

discharged by the Gram Sabhas in Tribal areas. They pertained to

safeguards for the rights of the tribal communities in matters relating to

land, water, forest and minor forest produce; enforcement of customary

rights such as grazing, fuel, fodder, minor forest produce, building

materials;   mobilization   for   community       welfare   programmes     and

organising voluntary    labour for community           works;   promotion of

solidarity and harmony among all sections of people; consideration of the

report on the audit of accounts of the Gram Panchayat; women and child

development; identification of the beneficiaries for poverty alleviation and

other programmes and host of other welfare measures such as drinking

water supply, sanitation, conservancy and drainage; public health

measures; village roads and streets; small tanks; maintenance of public

properties   and   community      assets.   The   Committee     gave   detailed

suggestions with regard to the powers, functions and procedures of the

to <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_18">Section 4(g)</a> whereby all the seats of Chairpersons of Panchayats at all

three tiers in Scheduled Areas are to be reserved in favour of Scheduled

per cent reservation of Chairperson positions in favour of STs would

</p>
<p id="p_66">

</p><p id="p_67">13. It was also argued that the cent per cent reservation of Chairperson

positions was excessive and hence violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution. Some of the petitioners had urged that the office of a

Chairperson should be treated as a solitary post and hence reservation

of such office was not permissible. In support of this contention, they

had relied on an earlier Judgment of the Patna High Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1062799/" id="a_20">Janardhan Paswan v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1988 Pat 75. This case was

distinguished by the High Court keeping in mind that it was decided

before the commencement of the Seventy-Third Amendment and that

<a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_21">Article 243-D</a> in Part IX of the Constitution had contemplated the said

reservation policy. However, the High Court held that the second proviso

to Section 4(g) of the PESA Act, 1996 reserving all the seats of

Chairpersons of Panchayats in favour of Scheduled Tribes was

unconstitutional. The relevant portion of the High Court Judgment reads

as follows:-

provisions to be unconstitutional. The only reason given by the High

Court was that cent per cent reservation of the offices of Chairpersons is

excessive, unreasonable and against the principles of equality. It may

also be noted that the Bhuria Committee Report had recommended that

the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of Panchayats should belong to

Scheduled Tribes. This recommendation was accepted by the Union

Government and the PESA Act, 1996 was enacted to give effect to the

same. The Parliament has conferred such special reservation on account

of the pivotal role of the Chairperson in a Panchayat. It must have been

felt that if the Chairperson positions are occupied by non-tribal persons

in Scheduled Areas, there is no guarantee that such persons will

account for the special interests of the Scheduled Tribes.



</p><p id="p_72">16. While enacting the Fifth Schedule, the Constituent Assembly was of

the view that the subjection to normal laws would have exposed the

tribal communities to two dangers in particular. Both arose out of the

fact that they were primitive people, simple, unsophisticated and

frequently improvident. Firstly, there was a risk of their agricultural land

being usurped by the more civilized section of the population. This would

threaten their livelihood and sustenance since the occupation of the

tribals was for the most part agricultural. Secondly they were more likely

to be victimized by the `wiles of the moneylender'. The primary aim of the

government policy then was to protect the tribal communities from these



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                         1</span>
two dangers and to preserve their customs. This objective was pursued

by incorporating special provisions that were to be made applicable to

these backward areas. The main contention made by the counsels for the

respondents is that it is not justifiable to reserve all Chairperson

positions in Panchayats located in Scheduled Areas in favour of persons

belonging to the ST category. At this juncture, we must clarify that

Sections 21(B), 40(B) and 55(B) of the JPRA have since been amended to

confine reservation to the office of Mukhiya (at Gram Panchayat level),

Pramukh (at Panchayat Samithi level) and Adhyaksh (at Zila Parishad

level).
</p>
<p id="p_73">

</p><p id="p_74">17. The counsel for the respondent had contended that the constitutional

intention behind <a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_28">Article 243-D</a> is not that of 100 per cent reservation but

only proportionate reservation and it speaks of rotation of the reserved

seats. However, we must emphasize that <a href="/doc/1445032/" id="a_29">Article 243-M(4)(b)</a> permits

`exceptions and modifications' in the application of Part IX to Scheduled

Areas. The respondents have also argued that the maximum reservation

which is legally permissible is only up to 50 per cent and reliance was

placed on the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_30">Indra Sawhney v. Union of

India</a>, (1992) Suppl. (3) SCC 217 and <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_31">M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore</a>,

(1963) 1 SCC 439. However, it should be kept in mind that both of these

decisions were given in respect of reservation measures enabled by

<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_32">Article 16 (4)</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_75">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                       2</span>
</p><p id="p_76">18. At the outset, we are of the view that the principles of reservation

which are applicable for public employment and for admission to

educational institutions cannot be readily applied in respect of a

reservation policy made by the legislature to protect the interests of the

Scheduled Tribes by assuring them of majority reservation as well as the

occupancy of Chairperson positions in Panchayats located in Scheduled

Areas. This policy broadly corresponds with the past practice wherein the

Scheduled Areas were administered as per the provisions of the Fifth

Schedule to the Constitution and the same was expected to adhere to the

advice of the Tribes Advisory Councils, which were predominantly

controlled by Scheduled Tribes. By extending the Panchayati Raj system

to these areas, Scheduled Tribes should not be put in a relatively

disadvantageous position. In the Panchayati Raj system contemplated by

Part IX, the Scheduled Tribes should have an effective say in the

administration. That is why the Bhuria Committee recommended that all

Chairperson positions should be reserved in favour of Scheduled Tribes.



</p><p id="p_77">19. The Counsel for the respondents also contended that the exclusive

reservation in favour of Scheduled Tribes unfairly limits the scope of

political participation for others and since all the offices of Chairpersons

are reserved, there is no scope for rotation of seats as contemplated by

the third proviso to <a href="/doc/1898596/" id="a_33">Article 243-D(4)</a> of the Constitution. It was also

pointed out that in some of the Districts notified as Scheduled Areas, the

Scheduled Tribes are not in a majority. First of all, it is to be remembered

that the impugned reservation policy is applicable only to Scheduled

Areas which were hitherto covered by the Fifth Schedule to the

Constitution. We must make it abundantly clear that this pattern of

reservation has been designed only for Scheduled Areas which merit

such exceptional treatment. In the present case, it should be noted that

the Scheduled Areas under consideration are restricted only to certain

Districts in the State of Jharkhand. In some Districts where STs are not

predominantly in occupation, only certain blocks have been notified as

Scheduled Areas by themselves. On account of migration of non-tribal

people in some areas, there may be a relatively lesser proportion of tribal

population but historically these areas were occupied almost exclusively

by Tribal people.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">20. In the course of the proceedings, our attention was also drawn to a

Constitution Bench decision reported as <a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_34">R.C Poudyal v. Union of India</a>

(1994) Supp. 1 SCC 324, wherein the majority had upheld the

reservation of some seats in the favour of the Bhutia and Lepcha

communities in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly. In that case the

majority had held that even though legislative seats could not be

ordinarily reserved on the basis of ethnic and religious identity, an

exception could be made in this case on account of the particular

historical factors that led to the integration of Sikkim with the Union of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                         2</span>
India. The judgment in that case does not directly aid the case of either

side in the present litigation. However, the opinions delivered in that

case did touch on the importance of the `one-man, one-vote' principle

that should be followed in liberal democracies. While this principle

entails that there should be parity between the weightage given to the

votes cast by individuals, the same cannot be enforced to an absolute

standard. This is because territorial constituencies are of varying sizes

with regard to the number of voters residing in them. This means that

there is bound to be some disparity in the weightage accorded to the

votes cast by individuals across different constituencies. This problem

exists in all electoral formats where representatives are chosen from

territorial constituencies. Needless to say the principle of `one-man, one-

vote' cannot be applied in an absolute sense in the context of Panchayat

elections in Scheduled Areas. However, it is the responsibility of the

executive to identify territorial constituencies which have a certain

degree of parity in their population levels. It is of course important to re-

draw these constituencies from time to time, in keeping with the

demographic shifts in the concerned area.
</p>
<p id="p_80">

</p><p id="p_81">21. Concerns were also raised that in some instances the notified

Scheduled Areas include certain blocks in particular districts but do not

include the remaining blocks of the same districts. This is not a serious

hurdle because it is quite clear that the exceptional treatment for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                           2</span>
Scheduled Tribes will be confined to the blocks that have been notified

as Scheduled Areas. This means that in the Districts where only some of

the blocks have been notified as Scheduled Areas, the impugned

provisions of the JPRA will be applicable at the level of Panchayat

Samitis within the notified area but not at the level of the Zilla Parishad

for the whole district.

</p>
<p id="p_87">

</p><p id="p_88">23. In light of these observations, it is our considered opinion that the

High Court of Jharkhand had erred in striking down Sections 21(B),

40(B) and 55(B) of the Jharkhand Panchayat Raj Act which give effect to

the second proviso of Section 4(g) of the Panchayats (Extension to

Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. We hold that in Panchayats located in

Scheduled Areas, the exclusive representation of Scheduled Tribes in the

Chairperson positions of the same bodies is constitutionally permissible.

This is so because <a href="/doc/1445032/" id="a_37">Article 243-M(4)(b)</a> expressly empowers Parliament to

provide for `exceptions and modifications' in the application of Part IX to

Scheduled Areas. The provisos to Section 4(g) of the PESA contemplate

certain exceptions to the norm of `proportionate representation' and the

same    exceptional   treatment    was    incorporated   in     the   impugned

provisions of the JPRA.

<p id="p_89">

</p><p id="p_90">24. The next point that arises for consideration is whether it is

Panchayati Raj Institutions located in Scheduled Areas of the State of

Jharkhand? The High Court had struck down Sections 17(B)(2), 36(B)(2)

and 51(B)(2) of the JPRA as unconstitutional by virtue of reasoning that

reservations to the extent of 80% of the seats in panchayats were

excessive, arbitrary and disproportionate, thereby violating <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article 14</a> of

the Constitution. The Counsels for the respondent had referred to the

observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_39">M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore</a>, AIR 1963

SC 649 and <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_40">Indra Sawhney v. Union of India</a> (1992) Supp 3 SCC 217

which had prescribed an upper ceiling of 50% for reservation of posts in

public employment. Reference was also made to a decision of the Patna

High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1362862/" id="a_41">Krishna Kumar Mishra v. State of Bihar</a>,

AIR 1996 Pat. 112, wherein a similar view had been adopted.

provisions contemplate that in Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis

and Zila Parishads located in Scheduled Areas, the reservation of seats

for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be made on the

basis of the proportion of their respective population, provided that

the petitioners before the High Court that the members of backward class

were not entitled to get reservation in the scheduled area. With respect to

scheduled castes, the State was bound to provide reservation to them even

in the Scheduled Areas. As already noticed, under the PESA 50% of the

seats in Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads should be

reserved in favour of schedule tribes and the ceiling is fixed to the extent

that this reservation put together shall not exceed 80% of the total seats.

The contention of the respondents is that this policy will lead to reverse

discrimination against persons who are not eligible for such reservation

benefits. It may be noticed that this reservation policy is exclusively

applicable to scheduled areas which had hitherto been the subject of a

separate   administrative   scheme    under   the   Fifth   Schedule   of   the

State can treat unequals differently with the objective of creating a level-

whether `reasonable classification' has been made on the basis of intelligible

affirmative action measures, the enquiry should be governed by the

standard of proportionality rather than the standard of `strict scrutiny'. Of

course, these affirmative action measures should be periodically reviewed

and various measures are modified or adapted from time to time in keeping

with the changing social and economic conditions. Reservation of seats in

Panchayats is one such affirmative action measure enabled by Part IX of the

the intended beneficiaries in the form of persons belonging to scheduled

castes, scheduled tribes, women and other backward class of citizens.

While introducing the 73rd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_53">Amendment Act</a>, the Statement of Objects and

Reasons clearly contemplated democratic decentralization to pursue the

legitimate governmental objective of ensuring that the traditionally

marginalized groups should progressively gain a foothold in local self

view of the fact that the scheduled areas under consideration were

completely under a separate administrative scheme as per the Fifth

Schedule to the Constitution. In fact, 50% of reservation in favour of the

scheduled tribes by itself was not challenged before the High Court.

Therefore, the question that now remains is whether reservation should

be made in favour of the scheduled castes and backward class for the

purpose of scheduled areas. The Constitutional mandate is that the

Panchayats, with regard to the principle of proportionate representation.

relating to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_54">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_55">Article 16(4)</a> by drawing an analogy with the

limits    placed   on   reservations   in   higher   education   and   public

employment. We must emphasize that <a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_56">Article 243-D</a> is a distinct and

independent constitutional basis for reservation in Panchayat Raj

Institutions. This reservation cannot be readily compared to the

affirmative action measures enabled by Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the

Constitution. Especially on the unviability of the analogy between <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_57">Article

16(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_58">Article 243-D</a>, we are in agreement with a decision of the

reservation, it was held:

<p id="p_109">33. For the sake of argument, even if an analogy between <a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_64">Article 243-D</a>

and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_65">Article 16(4)</a> was viable, a close reading of the Indra Sawhney

decision will reveal that even though an upper limit of 50% was

prescribed for reservations in public employment, the said decision did

recognise the need for exceptional treatment in some circumstances.

This is evident from the following words (at Paras. 809, 810):


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">      "809. From the above discussion, the irresistible conclusion that
      follows is that the reservations contemplated in Clause (4) of

      might, on account of their being put of the mainstream of national
      life and in view of conditions peculiar to and characteristical to
      them, need to be treated in a different way, some relaxation in this

      to be exercised and a special case made out."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_110">34. We believe that the case of Panchayats in Scheduled Areas is a fit

case that warrants exceptional treatment with regard to reservations.

The rationale behind imposing an upper ceiling of 50% in reservations

for higher education and public employment cannot be readily extended

to the domain of political representation at the Panchayat-level in

Scheduled Areas. With respect to education and employment, parity is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                       3</span>
maintained between the total number of reserved and unreserved seats

in order to maintain a pragmatic balance between the affirmative action

measures and considerations of merit. Under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_67">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_68">16(4)</a> the

reservation of seats in favour of socially and educationally backward

classes (SEBC) is ordinarily done on the basis of proportionate

representation and an upper ceiling of 50% allows for considerable

flexibility in distributing the benefits of higher education and public

employment among a wide range of intended beneficiaries such as the

Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Women and Other

Backward Classes (OBC). However, the same approach of providing

proportionate representation is likely to be less effective in the context of

reservations for panchayats in scheduled areas. One reason for this is

the inherent difference between the nature of benefits that accrue from

access to education and employment on one hand and political

participation on the other hand. While access to higher education and

public employment increases the likelihood of gradual socio-economic

empowerment of the individual beneficiaries, involvement in local-self

government is intended as a more immediate measure of protection for

the individual as well as the community that he/she belongs to.

Especially in the context of Scheduled Areas, there is a compelling need

to safeguard the interests of tribal communities with immediate effect by

giving them an effective voice in local self-government. The Bhuria

Committee Report had clearly outlined the problems faced by Scheduled



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                           3</span>
Tribes and urged the importance of democratic decentralisation which

would empower them to protect their own interests.



</p><p id="p_111">35. By reserving at least half of the seats in panchayats located in

Scheduled Areas in favour of STs, the legislature has adopted a standard

of compensatory discrimination which goes beyond the ordinary

standards     of     `adequate     representation'      and       `proportionate

representation'. The standard of `adequate representation' comes into

play when it is found that a particular community is under-represented

in a certain domain and a specific threshold is provided in order to

ensure that the beneficiary group comes to be adequately represented

with the passage of time. For instance in Part IX of the Constitution, the

reservation in favour of women which amounts to one-third of all the

seats in Panchayats is an embodiment of the `adequate representation'

standard.
</p>
<p id="p_112">

</p><p id="p_113">36. However, in instances where the Constitution does not specify the

quantum of reservations, the idea of `proportionate representation' is the

rule of thumb. As mentioned earlier, proportionate representation has

been the controlling idea behind reservations in the context of education

and employment which have a basis in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_69">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_70">16(4)</a>

respectively. Even in the context of Panchayati Raj Institutions, <a href="/doc/1849207/" id="a_71">Article

243-M(1)</a>    and    <a href="/doc/72125/" id="a_72">Article   243-M(6)</a>   explicitly   refer   to   `proportionate

representation' as the controlling idea behind reservations in favour of

SCs, STs and Backward Classes respectively. With respect to the

panchayats located in Scheduled Areas, the flexibility provided by <a href="/doc/1445032/" id="a_73">Article

243-M(4)(b)</a> has led to the enactment of the PESA which specifies

`proportional representation' as the norm for reservations in favour of the

intended beneficiaries, but makes a departure from this standard in

order to protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes in particular.



</p><p id="p_114">37. There is of course a rational basis for departing from the norms of

`adequate representation' as well as `proportionate representation' in the

present case. This was necessary because it was found that even in the

areas where Scheduled Tribes are in a relative majority, they are under-

represented in the government machinery and hence vulnerable to

exploitation. Even in areas where persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes

held public positions, it is a distinct possibility that the non-tribal

population will come to dominate the affairs. The relatively weaker

position of the Scheduled Tribes is also manifested through problems

such as land-grabbing by non-tribals, displacement on account of

private as well as governmental developmental activities and the

destruction of environmental resources. In order to tackle such social

realities, the legislature thought it fit to depart from the norm of

`proportional representation'. In this sense, it is not our job to second-

guess such policy-choices. A similar position was also adopted by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                         3</span>
Madhya Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/448003/" id="a_74">Ashok Kumar Tripathi v. Union of

India</a>, 2000 (2) MPHT 193,where Dharmadhikari, J. made the following

observations (extracted from Para. 36, 37):
</p>
<p id="p_115">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">      "... To safeguard interests of Scheduled Tribes living in remote or
      hilly areas or forests with primitive culture of their own, the
      Constitution envisages formation of Scheduled Areas for them, and
      application of laws to them with 'exceptions and modifications', so
      that they are able to preserve their culture and occupation and are
      not exposed to exploitation by forward classes of Urban Population.
      The protective discrimination in favour of such deprived section of
      the Society can go to the extent of complete exclusion, if the
      circumstances so justify, of advanced classes in Local Self
      Governance of Scheduled areas. The main object and purpose
      behind such reservations based on population, even in excess of
      50% is with a view that the exclusive participation of deprived and
      oppressed sections of the Society in Local Self-Government bodies
      in their areas is ensured because in open competition with the
      advanced sections of the Society they can never have any share to
      participate in Self-Governance. A close and careful examination of
      the provisions of the Central and <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_75">State Act</a>, in the light of
      Constitutional provisions, shows that principle of proportionate
      representation based on the population of the reserved categories
      has been adhered to but only departure has been made from it in
      giving them larger share of self-governance by reserving seats for
      them as member and in the Scheduled Areas a monopoly of seats
      of Chairpersons has been created for them so that they conserve
      their culture and way of living. ... For taking a decision on the
      policy of reservation as to whether it is reasonable or
      unreasonable, the Court has to examine the overall Scheme of the
      Constitution as envisaged in Part IX and IX A and the
      corresponding Central and State Legislation brought to implement
      it. The aim and object of the reservation policy contained in Part IX
      and IX A is that the Backward and oppressed sections of the
      Society have to be encouraged in the democratic process by giving
      them a share of governance which hither-to was denied to them
      since the times of British India and after independence. The other
      object at the same time is to protect them from urban influences so
      that they may be able to conserve their culture and way of life and
      are not exposed to exploitation by the advanced or socially and
      economically powerful sections of the society.

<p id="p_116">       At the Bar it was argued that such excess policy of reservation is
      bound to create bad blood between the two classes and would be a
      serious deterrent to bring such oppressed classes into the
      mainstream of democratic life. There are arguments for and
      against this. In the matters of policy the best judges are the
      Legislators who are closer to the society and represent them. They
      have a study of the society and have advantage of reports based on
      sociological surveys made by experts. They better understand the
      needs of the society and the various sections forming it. It is not
      for this Court to enter into this forbidden arena and lay down a
      policy of reservation. The argument advanced on behalf of the
      petitioners only shows that the attitude of the members of the
      advanced sections of the society towards castes and tribes
      continues to be more of competition than compassion. The
      reservation in various walks of life made in their favour for the last
      50 years of the independence has not been successful in improving
      their socio-economic condition and have not made them effective
      participant in the democratic process. The necessity is still felt by
      the legislators in making special provisions for them in the
      Constitution and the laws to ensure their effective participation at
      least in the local self Government institutions as a first step to give
      them due share of governance in the Assemblies of the States and
      the Parliament. The argument that the policy of reservation would
      segregate them rather than assimilate them with the common
      stream is one for the legislator to consider on the basis of existing
      social situation. In the matters of policy, wisdom of legislature
      cannot be questioned or the policy laid down cannot be upset by
      the Court which is ill equipped to deal with the subject."




</p><p id="p_117">38. Even though there are cogent reasons for the exceptional treatment

accorded to Scheduled Tribes, there are some other concerns that merit

consideration. One such concern is with the very identification of

Scheduled Areas in the first place. It is a common refrain that the

efficacy as well as legitimacy of affirmative action measures can be

questioned if they are not targeted properly. In the present case, it was

pointed out that the identification of Scheduled Areas is done on the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                          3</span>
basis of census data and the same is collected after intervals of 10 years.

It was urged that the identification of Scheduled Areas may not be

accurate if it was based on outdated data. Even though we were shown

data describing the distribution of the population belonging to the

Scheduled Tribes category in the various districts of Jharkhand (As per

the 2001 census), it will suffice to say that the identification of Scheduled

Areas is an executive function and we do not possess the expertise

needed to scrutinize the empirical basis of the same. The data submitted

before us indicates that while the Scheduled Tribes are indeed in a

majority in some Scheduled Areas, the same is not true for some other

Scheduled Areas. This disparity is understandable keeping in mind that

there has been a considerable influx of non-tribal population in some of

the Scheduled Areas. In this regard, we must re-emphasize the Bhuria

Committee's recommendation that persons belonging to the Scheduled

Tribes should occupy at least half of the seats in Panchayats located in

Scheduled Areas, irrespective of whether the ST population was in a

relative minority in the concerned area. This recommendation is in line

with the larger objective of safeguarding the interests of Scheduled

Tribes.
</p>
<p id="p_118">
</p><p id="p_119">39. The other significant criticism of aggregate reservation amounting to

80% of the seats in Panchayats located in Scheduled Areas is that it

amounts to an unreasonable limitation on the rights of political




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                          4</span>
participation of persons belonging to the general category. The rights of

political participation broadly include the right of a citizen to vote for a

candidate of his/her choice and right of citizens to contest elections for a

public office. In the present case, it was urged that reservations

amounting to 80% of the seats in Scheduled area panchayats will have

the effect of limiting the choices available to voters and effectively

discourage persons belonging to the general category from contesting

these elections. While the exercise of electoral franchise is an essential

component of a liberal democracy, it is a well-settled principle in Indian

law that such rights do not have the status of fundamental rights and

are instead legal rights which are controlled through legislative means

(See N.P. Ponnuswami's case, AIR 1952 SC 64).              For instance, the

Constitution empowers the Election Commission of India to prepare

electoral rolls for the purpose of identifying the eligible voters in elections

for   the   Lok   Sabha   and   the   Vidhan    Sabhas.   Furthermore,     the

<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_76">Representation of People Act</a>, 1951 gives effect to the Constitutional

guidance on the eligibility of persons to contest these elections. This

includes grounds that render persons ineligible from contesting elections

such as that of a person not being a citizen of India, a person being of

unsound mind, insolvency and the holding of an `office of profit' under

the executive among others. It will suffice to say that there is no inherent

right to contest elections since there are explicit legislative controls over

the same.
</p>
<p id="p_120">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                            4</span>
</p><p id="p_121">40. In the context of reservations in Panchayats, it can be reasoned that

the limitation placed on the choices available to voters is an incidental

consequence of the reservation policy. In this case, the compelling state

interest in safeguarding the interests of weaker sections by ensuring

their representation in local self-government clearly outweighs the

competing interest in not curtailing the choices available to voters. It

must also be reiterated here that the 50% reservations in favour of STs

as contemplated by the first proviso to Section 4(g) of the PESA were not

struck down in the impugned judgment. Even though it was argued

before this Court that this provision makes a departure from the norm of

`proportionate representation' contemplated by <a href="/doc/247277/" id="a_77">Art. 243-D(1</a>), we have

already   explained   how   <a href="/doc/1445032/" id="a_78">Art.   243-M(4)(b)</a>   permits    `exceptions   and

modifications' in the application of Part IX to Scheduled Areas. Sections

17(B)(1), 36(B)(1) and 51(B)(1) of the JPRA merely give effect to the

exceptional treatment that is mandated by the PESA.


</p><p id="p_122">41. However, in addition to the 50% reservations in favour of Scheduled

Tribes, the State of Jharkhand is also under an obligation to account for

the interests of Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes. The

same has been contemplated in Sections 17(B)(2), 36(B)(2) and 51(B)(2) of

the   JPRA    which    incorporate    the   standard       of   `proportionate

representation' for Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes in such a

manner that the total reservations do not exceed 80%. This does not




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                           4</span>
mean that reservations will reach the 80% ceiling in all the Scheduled

Areas. Since the allocation of seats in favour of Scheduled Castes and

Backward Classes has to follow the principle of proportionality, the

extent of total reservations is likely to vary across the different territorial

constituencies identified for the purpose of elections to the panchayats.

Depending on the demographic profile of a particular constituency, it is

possible that the total reservations could well fall short of the 80% upper

ceiling. However, in Scheduled Areas where the extent of the population

belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes exceeds 30%

of the total population, the upper ceiling of 80% will become operative.


</p><p id="p_123">42. Irrespective of such permutations, the legislative intent behind the

impugned provisions of the JPRA is primarily that of safeguarding the

interests of persons belonging to the Scheduled Tribes category. In light

of the preceding discussion, it is our considered view that total

reservations exceeding 50% of the seats in Panchayats located in

Scheduled Areas are permissible on account of the exceptional treatment

mandated under <a href="/doc/1445032/" id="a_79">Article 243-M(4)(b).</a> Therefore, we agree with the

appellants and overturn the ruling of the High Court of Jharkhand on
