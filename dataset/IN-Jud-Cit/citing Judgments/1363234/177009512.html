        THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a> OF
THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO QUASHING THE

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners are knocking at the doors of this Court

calling in question the action of the respondents in declining to

accept the caste and income certificates furnished by the

petitioners   along   with   their      respective   applications   for

appointment to the posts of Graduate Primary Teachers for 6th

standard to 8th standard classes of 2022.
</p>

<p id="p_2">      2. Since the issue in all these cases is similar, the subject

writ petition i.e., W.P.No.23752 of 2022, is taken as the lead

petition, as the pleadings are complete in the said petition, and

is heard with the consent of the parties.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      3. For the sake of convenience, facts in brief in the

subject Writ Petition - W.P.No.23752 of 2022, as borne out

from the pleadings are narrated:
</p>

<p id="p_4">      A notification is issued on 22-02-2022, by the 1st

respondent bringing in certain amendments to the Karnataka

Civil Services General Recruitment Rules. In terms of the said

notification, another notification on 21-03-2022 comes to be

issued calling for applications from eligible candidates for

recruitment to the posts of Graduate Primary Teachers from 6th

standard to 8th standard classes in Government and aided
</p><p id="p_5">                                  - 11 -
</p>



<p id="p_6">institutions.    The   petitioners   in   all   these   cases   finding

themselves eligible to be considered for appointment to the

posts of Graduate Primary Teachers applied. While submitting

their applications, the documents that were in their possession

were all uploaded or attached to the said applications.           One

such document that was uploaded was the caste and income

certificate.    All other criteria in the cases of these petitioners

were considered by the Deputy Director of Public Instruction

(Adm.) of respective districts (for short &#x27;DDPI&#x27;), to whom the

task of selection of Graduate Primary Teachers was entrusted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Every other criteria was accepted by the DDPI, except

applications which accompanied caste and income certificates

depicting the caste and income of the father of the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_8">This forms the bone of contention in all these cases. Those

applications which accompanied caste and income certificate of

the father were all treated to be general merit candidates

despite being entitled to reservation under Category 2A, 2B, 3A

and 3B, which forms the chunk of reservations under, other

Backward Classes (OBC). The challenge that is raised is to the

aforesaid action of treating all these petitioners to be general

merit candidates and the reason for treating them being the

marriage of daughters.

</p>



<p id="p_10">      4. Heard Sri K.Shashikiran Shetty, learned senior counsel

appearing for the petitioners, the learned Advocate General

along with the learned Additional Government Advocates -
</p>
<p id="p_11">Sri B.V.Krishna, Sri M.Vinod Kumar, Smt. Shwetha Krishnappa,

Sri N. Kumar, representing the State and Sri Ananda K.,

learned counsel for respondent No.3.
</p>

<p id="p_12">      5. The learned senior counsel for the petitioners would

urge that the State is repeating what it had been admonished

by the judgments of coordinate Bench of this Court. Coordinate

Benches have held that the caste and income certificates of an

individual can neither be taken into consideration nor that of

the spouse as it is that of the parents will have to be taken into

consideration. He would contend that the issue is clearly

covered by the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of

SURINDER SINGH1. He would submit that the said judgment

has been followed by a coordinate Bench of this Court in

SMT. YOGESHWARI2 and later, by the Division Bench in the

case of SMT.DIVYASHREE3.             He would further contend that

the selecting authority - DDPI in the case at hand, has no

<p id="p_16">     jurisdiction to interpret the caste and income certificates and

     decline to accept what is issued by the competent authorities or

     demand a particular certificate.         He would also place reliance

     upon the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in

     EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR4 and would also submit that a Special

     Leave Petition preferred by the State against the said judgment

     has been dismissed in S.L.P.No.12648 of 2019. In all, he would

     contend that the action of the State impugned in these

     petitions is contrary to law.
</p>

<p id="p_17">           6. On the other hand, the learned Advocate General

     refuting the submissions of the learned counsel for the

     petitioners, would seek to urge the following contentions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           a. The petition in the form that it is presented is not

              maintainable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           b. The petitioners have to approach the Karnataka State

              as it is recruitment to the State and recruitment or

<p id="p_21">         -   Without prejudice to the aforesaid contentions, he

             would contend that the caste and income certificates

             policy of the State as enunciated in the Government

             Order dated 12.12.1986, which directs that the caste

             and income certificate of a married woman shall

             always relate to the husband and not to the parents.

<p id="p_30">Issue No. (i) : Whether the writ petitions challenging the

by   the    Selecting    Authority     -   DDPI     would     be

<p id="p_31">      8. The contention of the State is that these petitions in

the form they are presented before this Court would not be

maintainable.    No doubt, the Apex Court in the case of

L.Chandra Kumar (supra) has held that the Tribunals would

be the Courts of first instance and any matter relating to

service or recruitment to service under the services of the State

would be maintainable only before the Tribunal. In the case at

hand, the issue is with regard to the Selecting Authority - DDPI

interpreting a caste and income certificate that is issued by the

competent authority. Though it concerns recruitment to the

posts of Graduate Primary Teachers, the only issue is with

regard to the interpretation and power of interpretation of the

Selecting Authority - DDPI. The number of applicants to the

posts of Graduate Primary Teachers in the subject recruitment

is close to six thousand and the applicants whose applications

aforesaid and are directed to be brought under general merit

responsibility      of   setting   the   wrong    right   which   is   also

interpreted and held in a particular manner by the Apex Court,

by the Division Bench of this Court and that of the co-ordinate

Bench. Therefore, these petitions are held to be entertainable

only on the solitary issue concerning caste and income

certificates and in the peculiar circumstances.

<p id="p_34">         9. Reference being made to the judgment of the Apex

Court in the case of T.K.RANGARAJAN6 in which the Apex

Court has held that the high Court ought to have entertained

the petition and not shirk its responsibility as the situation

demanded urgent redressal. The High Court of Madras had

relegated all the petitioners therein to approach the State

Administrative Tribunal. The Apex Court has held as follows:

         is   empowered     to   exercise   its  extraordinary
         jurisdiction to meet unprecedented extraordinary
         situation having no parallel. It is equally true that
         extraordinary powers are required to be sparingly
         used. The facts of the present case reveal that this
         was most extraordinary case, which called for
         interference by the High Court, as the State

<p id="p_35">       6. It is true that in <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_9">L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of
India</a> [(1997) 3 SCC 261 : 1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 577] this Court
has held that it will not be open to the employees to
directly approach the High Court even where the question
of vires of the statutory legislation is challenged. However,
this ratio is required to be appreciated in context of the
question which was decided by this Court wherein it was
sought to be contended that once the Tribunals are
established under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_10">Article 323-A</a> or <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_11">Article 323-B</a>,
jurisdiction of the High Court would be excluded.
Negativing said contention, this Court made it clear that
jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article
226</a> of the Constitution is a part of the inviolable basic
structure of the Constitution and it cannot be said that
such Tribunals are an effective substitute of the High
Courts in discharging powers of judicial review. It is also an
established principle that where there is an alternative,
effective, efficacious remedy available under the law, the
High Court would not exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> and that has been reiterated by holding
that the litigants must first approach the Tribunals which
act like courts of first instance in respect of the areas of
law for which they have been constituted and therefore, it
will not be open to the litigants to directly approach the
High Court even where the question of vires of the
statutory legislation is challenged.

<p id="p_36">       7. In L. Chandra Kumar case [(1997) 3 SCC 261 :
1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 577] the Court inter alia referred to and
relied upon the case in <a href="/doc/981675/" id="a_14">Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of
India</a> [AIR 1956 SC 479 : 1956 SCR 267] wherein Bose, J.
made the following observations: SCR p. 284

             &quot;The heart and core of a democracy lies in the
      judicial process, and that means independent and
      fearless judges free from executive control brought
      up in judicial traditions and trained to judicial ways
      of working and thinking. The main bulwarks of
      liberty and freedom lie there and it is clear to me
      that uncontrolled powers of discrimination in matters
      that seriously affect the lives and properties of
      people cannot be left to executive or quasi-executive
      bodies even if they exercise quasi-judicial functions
      because they are then invested with an authority
      that even Parliament does not possess. Under the
      Constitution, Acts of Parliament are subject to
      judicial review particularly when they are said to
      infringe fundamental rights, therefore, if under the
      Constitution Parliament itself has not uncontrolled

<p id="p_38">      freedom of action, it is evident that it cannot invest
      lesser authorities with that power.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_39">      8. The Court further referred to the following
observations     from    the    decision in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_15">Kesavananda
Bharati v. State of Kerala</a> [(1973) 4 SCC 225] as under:
(SCC p. 300, para 77)

             &quot;77. ... From their conclusions, many of which
      have been extracted by us in toto, it appears that
      this Court has always considered the power of
      judicial review vested in the High Courts and in this
      Court under Articles 226 and 32 respectively,
      enabling legislative action to be subjected to the
      scrutiny of superior courts, to be integral to our
      constitutional scheme.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_40">The Court further held: (SCC pp. 301-02, paras 78-81)

             &quot;78. ... We, therefore, hold that the power of
      judicial review over legislative action vested in the
      High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> and in this Court
      under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_17">Article 32</a> of the Constitutionis an integral and
      essential feature of the Constitution, constituting
      part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the
      power of High Courts and the Supreme Court to test
      the constitutional validity of legislations can never
      be ousted or excluded.

<p id="p_46">the   Administrative Tribunals from  the  Malimath
Committee&#x27;s Report (1989-90), which are reproduced
hereinunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      Functioning of Tribunals
             &quot;8.63. Several Tribunals are functioning in the
      country. Not all of them, however, have inspired
      confidence in the public mind. The reasons are not
      far to seek. The foremost is the lack of competence,
      objectivity and judicial approach. The next is their
      constitution, the power and method of appointment
      of personnel thereto, the inferior status and the
      casual method of working. The last is their actual
      composition; men of calibre are not willing to be
      appointed as presiding officers in view of the
      uncertainty of tenure, unsatisfactory conditions of
      service, executive subordination in matters of
      administration and political interference in judicial
      functioning. For these and other reasons, the quality
      of justice is stated to have suffered and the cause of
      expedition is not found to have been served by the
      establishment of such Tribunals.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             8.64. Even the experiment of setting up of the
      Administrative Tribunals under the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_22">Administrative
      Tribunals Act</a>, 1985, has not been widely welcomed.
      Its members have been selected from all kinds of
      services including the Indian Police Service. The
      decisions of the State Administrative Tribunals are
      not appealable except under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_23">Article 136</a> of the
      Constitution. On account of the heavy cost and
      remoteness of the forum, there is virtual negation of
      the right of appeal. This has led to denial of justice
      in many cases and consequential dissatisfaction.
      There appears to be a move in some of the States
      where they have been established for their
      abolition.&quot;</blockquote>

<p id="p_47">     (It is to be stated that in Tamil Nadu, at present, the
Administrative Tribunal is manned by only one man.)

Finally, the Court held thus: (SCC p. 311, para 99)

             &quot;99. In view of the reasoning adopted by us,
      we hold that clause 2(d) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_24">Article 323-A</a> and clause
      3(d) of <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_25">Article 323-B</a>, to the extent they exclude the
      jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme
      Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the
      Constitution, are unconstitutional. Section 28 of the
</p><p id="p_48">                          - 21 -
</p>



<p id="p_49">     Act and the &#x27;exclusion of jurisdiction&#x27; clauses in all
     other legislations enacted under the aegis of Articles
     323-A and 323-B would, to the same extent, be
     unconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the
     High Courts under Articles 226/227 and upon the
     Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_26">Article 32</a> of the Constitution
     is a part of the inviolable basic structure of our
     Constitution. While this jurisdiction cannot be
     ousted, other courts and Tribunals may perform a
     supplemental role in discharging the powers
     conferred by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the
     Constitution. The Tribunals created under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_27">Article
     323-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_28">Article 323-B</a> of the Constitution are
     possessed of the competence to test the
     constitutional validity of statutory provisions and
     rules. All decisions of these Tribunals will, however,
     be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the
     High Court within whose jurisdiction the Tribunal
     concerned falls. The Tribunals will, nevertheless,
     continue to act like courts of first instance in respect
     of the areas of law for which they have been
     constituted. It will not, therefore, be open for
     litigants to directly approach the High Courts even in
     cases where they question the vires of statutory
     legislations (except where the legislation which
     creates the particular Tribunal is challenged) by
     overlooking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
     concerned. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid and
     constitutional and is to be interpreted in the manner
     we have indicated.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_50">      10. There cannot be any doubt that the
aforesaid judgment of larger Bench is binding on this
Court and we respectfully agree with the same.
However, in a case like this, if thousands of
employees     are    directed    to   approach    the
Administrative Tribunal, the Tribunal would not be in
a position to render justice to the cause. Hence, as
stated earlier, because of very very exceptional
circumstance that arose in the present case, there
was no justifiable reason for the High Court not to
entertain the petitions on the ground of alternative
remedy provided under the statute.&quot;

</p>



<p id="p_53">The Apex Court considers the judgment of the larger Bench in

the case of L.Chandra Kumar (supra) and then holds that in

cases where thousands of employees are directed to approach

the Tribunal, it would not be in a position to render justice to

the cause and, therefore, in very exceptional circumstances,

the High Court has to entertain the petitions and not dismiss

them on the ground of alternative remedy as provided under

the statute. The situation in the case at hand is similar to what

arose   before   the   Apex    Court.    There   are   hundreds   of

applications where the cases of applicants who come under the

reservation of category 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B are held to be

general merit candidates and the issue is only with regard to

interpretation of whose caste and income should be taken into

consideration i.e., the husband or the parents.        Therefore, in

this peculiar and atypical situation, I entertain the petitions

despite objection of the State. Merely because there exists an

alternative remedy as provided under the statute, fetters

cannot be laid at the hands of this Court exercising its

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to

remedy any situation which would warrant immediate and

necessary interference.       The first issue is thus answered

against the State.

<p id="p_55">Issue No.II: Whether the caste and income of the

husband of the female applicant should be taken into

consideration or the caste and income of the parents?
</p>

<p id="p_56">     10. This issue is whether the caste and income of the

parents should be taken into consideration or that of the

spouse. One common stream that runs through all these cases

is that the applications submitted by these petitioners were

accompanied by caste and income certificates issued by the

respective Tahsildars taking the caste and income of the father

into consideration and not the spouse. The certificates were in

tune with law. It is the action of the Selecting Authority - DDPI

to have interpreted the law, to its whim, according to a

Government Order dated 12.12.1986, to contend that on once

the daughter gets married the income of the spouse will have

to be considered for the purpose of caste and income certificate

and not that of the parents. On these lines objections are also

filed by the State, it has categorically contended that once the

daughter gets married, she loses to be the dependent of the

parents and then, the term dependent would mean the spouse

and children of a married person and by no stretch of

imagination the applicants can speculate that the spouse after

marriage loses dependency on the parents. It is the emphatic

</p>



<p id="p_58">submission of the State that it is the spouse and only the

spouse   whose   caste   and   income   should   be   taken   into

consideration in the case at hand. I decline to accept any such

submissions.   The issue whether the caste and income of an

individual should be taken into consideration or that of the

parents should be taken into consideration or of the spouse to

be taken into consideration need not detain this court for long

or delve deep into the matter. The Apex Court in the case of

Surender Singh (supra), has held as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           &quot;8. The question which still arises is, whether
     it was open to the High Court, to include the
     individual&#x27;s income in determining his eligibility for
     being declared as backward class, by reading down
     the policy instructions on the subject? Insofar as the
     instant aspect of the matter is concerned, there can
     be no doubt that the issue is determinable with
     reference to the decision rendered by this Court
     in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_30">Indra     Sawhney v. Union        of    India [Indra

                 Para 4, it is clarified that the creamy layer status of
                 a candidate is determined on the basis of the status
                 of his parents and not on the basis of his own status
                 or income or on the basis of status or income of
                 his/her spouse. Therefore, while determining the
                 creamy layer status of a person the status or the
                 income of the candidate himself or of his/her spouse
                 shall not be taken into account.&quot;</blockquote>

          In view of the above, there is no room for any
          further consideration, whether or not the individual&#x27;s
          income is to be taken into consideration, while
          computing the total income relevant to determine
          whether an individual belongs to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;.
          The above clarification reveals, that it is only the
          parents&#x27; income, which has to be taken into
          consideration.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                                         (Emphasis supplied)


The Apex Court holds that there is no room for any further

consideration         of    individuals     income     to   be   taken   into

consideration while computing total income.                 The clarification

issued therein would reveal that it is only the parents&#x27; income

which has to be taken into consideration.                   The Apex Court

further in the case of SUNITA SINGH7 has held as follows:

     Caste category, the appellant should not have been
     issued with a caste certificate showing her caste as
     Scheduled Caste. In that regard, the orders of the
     authorities as well as the judgment of the High Court
     cannot be faulted.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                                       (Emphasis supplied)


The Apex Court was considering determination of caste status

of a community &#x27;Jatav&#x27; on the basis of caste status of the

husband. It is held that determination of caste status on the

basis of the caste of the husband was unsustainable as the

caste is determined by birth which cannot change by marriage.

<p id="p_65">  the facts     and    circumstances    of   the   present
  case?
</p>
<p id="p_66">      17. I have given my anxious consideration to the
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties
and perused the entire material on record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_67">      V. CONSIDERATION

</p><p id="p_68">       18. The substance of the case of the petitioner is
that she applied for the post of Civil Judge in response to
the notification issued by the 6th respondent under
Category III(B) as she belonged to Veerashiava community
and she succeeded in the preliminary and Main
examinations conducted by the 6th respondent and
thereafter she also attended viva voce. Later, she came to
know that her application was not forwarded for police
verification and medical test, as she has not submitted the
caste certificate. Therefore the petitioner has once again
applied and obtained the fresh caste and income certificate
that she belongs to Category III(B) and income of the
family does not exceed Rs.16,000/- issued by the
Tahsildar, Chamarajanagar as per Annexure-G dated
3.2.2016. Thereafter the petitioner has applied for the
validity certificate before the jurisdictional authority - 2nd
respondent. The 2nd respondent rejected the said
application on the ground that husband&#x27;s income has to be
taken into consideration. That is the subject matter of the
Appeal before the Appellate Authority - Commissioner for
Backward Classes. The Appellate Authority by an order
dated 18.11.2016 (Annexure-K) allowed the appeal and set
aside the order passed by the 2nd respondent - Deputy
Commissioner &amp; Chairman, District Caste &amp; Verification
Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_69">        19. The order passed by the Appellate authority has
reached finality. Thereafter, the petitioner has submitted
the detailed representations dated 27.2.2017 and
22.3.2017 to the 2nd respondent to issue validity
certificate based on the order dated 18.11.2016 passed by
the Appellate Authority. Inspite of the representations,
when the 2nd respondent has not proceeded to consider the
representations in pursuance of the order passed by the
Appellate Authority, the petitioner was forced to file writ
petition before this Court in W.P. No.17079/2017. This
Court after hearing the parties, by the order dated
9.11.2017 allowed the said writ petition and directed the
respondent - District Caste &amp; Income Verification
Committee to consider the representations and take a
</p><p id="p_70">                            - 29 -
</p>



<p id="p_71">decision as expeditiously as possible, but not later than
two months from the date of receipt of the order. The said
order passed by this Court has reached finality.
</p>
<p id="p_72">       20. It is an undisputed fact that the 2nd respondent
</p><p id="p_73">- Deputy Commissioner &amp; Chairman, District Caste &amp;
Income Verification Committee, Chamarajanagar and
members of the Committee in its meeting dated 27.2.2017
raised eight questions and sought clarification from the
Appellate Authority - Commissioner, Department of
Backward Classes, Bangalore as per Annexure-P dated
6.3.2017 and from the Government as per Annexure-S
dated 25.3.2017. It is also not in dispute that the Appellate
Authority by a letter dated 17.3.2017 (Annexure-G)
intimated the 2nd respondent - Deputy Commissioner &amp;
Chairman, District Caste &amp; Caste Verification Committee to
issue validity certificate to the petitioner - Yogeshwari in
accordance with law since the appeal filed before the
Appellate Authority was allowed and the order passed by
the 2nd respondent was set aside. The order passed by the
Appellate Authority - Commissioner, Department of
Backward Classes has reached finality. The Commissioner
also clarified the same to the Secretary, Backward Classes
on 30.5.2017 as per Annexure-R. At clarification No.3, he
has specifically stated that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in
the case of SURINDER SINGH vs. PUNJAB STATE
ELECTRICITY BOARD, PATIALA AND OTHERS (AIR 2015 SC
</p><p id="p_74">537) has clarified that the creamy layer status of a
candidate is determined on the basis of the status of
his/her parents and not on the basis of his/her own status
or income or on the basis of status or income of his/her
spouse. Therefore while determining the creamy layer
status of a person, the status or the income of the
candidate himself or his/her spouse shall not be taken
into account. The clarification reveals that it is only the
parents income, which has to be taken into consideration.
The said clarification issued by the Commissioner,
Department of Backward Classes to the Secretary also has
reached finality.
</p>
<p id="p_75">        21. It is also relevant to state at this stage that in
response to the clarification sought by the 2nd respondent
</p><p id="p_76">- Deputy Commissioner dated 25.3.2017, the Prl.
Secretary, Law Department by a letter dated 6.9.2017 has
answered all the queries. The relevant portion of the

is clarified that the creamy layer status of a candidate is
determined on the basis of the status of his parents and
not on the basis of his own status or income or on the
basis of status or income of his/her spouse. Therefore,
while determining the creamy layer status of person the
status or the income of the candidate himself or of
his/her souse shall not be taken into account.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_80">      The above clarification reveals, that it is only the

<p id="p_81">        22. It is also clarified that while determining the
creamy layer status of a person, the status or income of
the candidate himself or his/her spouse shall not be taken
into account and the clarification reveals that it is only the
parents income which has to be taken into consideration.
Inspite of the clarification issued by the Appellate Authority
as well as the Prl. Secretary, Law Department,
unfortunately the 2nd respondent - Deputy Commissioner
&amp; District Caste &amp; Income Verification Committee
proceeded to pass the impugned order dated 13.12.2017
mainly on the ground that the income of the husband of
the petitioner has to be taken into consideration and the
certificate sought cannot be granted. The same is against
the very Government Order issued by the State
Government dated 30.3.2002 made in G.O. No. ¸ÀPÀE 225
©¹J 2000 and contrary to the dictum of the Hon&#x27;ble
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/22081445/" id="a_37">SURINDER SINGH vs.
PUNJAB STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD, PATIALA AND
OTHERS</a> reported in AIR 2015 SC 537, wherein                 at

</p>



<p id="p_83">       &quot;9. Based on the aforesaid declaration of
law, we are of the view that it was not open to the
High Court to evaluate the office memorandum
dated 8.9.1993 from any other parameters. It also
needs to be noticed, that the issue which came up
for determination in Ashok Kumar Thakur&#x27;s case
(AIR 1996 SC 75) came to be re-examined before
a Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/63489929/" id="a_38">Ashok Kumar
Thakur vs. Union of India</a> (2008) 6 SCC 1, wherein
on the subject of identification of the &quot;creamy
layer&quot;, the Constitution Bench observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_84">       &quot;1-B. IDENTIFICATION OF CREAMY LAYER

</p><p id="p_85">         415. Income as the criterion for creamy
  layer exclusion is insufficient and runs afoul of
  Sawhney (I). (See p.724 at para 792).
</p><p id="p_86">  Identification of the creamy layer has been
  and should be left to the Government, subject
  to judicial direction. For a valid method of
  creamy layer exclusion, the Government may
  use its post-Sawhney (I) criteria as a
  template. (See OM of 8.9.1993, Para
  2(c)/Column 3), approved by this Court in
  <a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_39">Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs. State of Bihar</a>
  (1995) 5 SCC 403, para 10. This schedule is a
  comprehensive attempt to exclude the creamy
  layer in which income, government posts,
  occupation and landholdings are taken into
  account.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_87">       Here again, this Court expressly approved
the office memorandum dated 8.9.1993. In view of
the decisions rendered by this Court in both Ashok
Kumar Thakur&#x27;s cases (supra), we are of the view
that the High Court clearly erred in reading down
the office memorandum dated 8.9.1993 and to
include therein the income of the individual concern
while determining whether or not he fall within the
&quot;creamy layer&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_88">       10. Despite the declaration of law in the
judgments, referred to hereinabove, it is also
necessary to take into consideration the
clarification issued by the Government of
India, Ministry of Personnel, P.G. and
Pensions (Department of Personnel and
Training) dated 21.11.2002. The aforesaid
clarification was with reference to the office
memorandum        dated   8.9.1993.     Relevant

<p id="p_90">extract of the clarificatory letter dated
21.11.2002 is being reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_91">        &quot;I am directed to refer to your
  letter No.2/25/2001 RC-1/670 dated 17-
  10- 2002 on the above noted subject and
  say that determination of creamy layer
  for an OBC candidate is done with

</p><pre id="pre_2">  No.36012/22/93-Estt(res)           dated

      Based on the aforesaid conclusion,
</pre><p id="p_92">there is really no room for any doubt, that the
exposition with reference to category VI in
the office memorandum dated 8.9.1993
related only to the income of the parents of
the individual concerned. And that, the
income of the individual concerned was not to
be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_93">        11. The above issue came to be
examined yet again by the Government of
India,     Ministry    of    Personnel,    Public
Grievances &amp; Pensions (Department of
Personnel      and    Training)     through    its
memorandum dated 14.10.2004. In the above
memorandum, a large number of queries were
clarified. Queries at serial nos.(vi) and (vii) of
paragraph 4 are relevant to the present
controversy, and are accordingly reproduced
hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_94">         &quot;4. Following questions have been
  raised from time to time about the application
  of the above provisions to determine creamy
  layer.
</p>
<p id="p_95">         (vi) Will a candidate who himself is a
  directly recruited Class I/Group A Officer or a
  directly recruited Class II/Group B officer who
  got into Class I/Group A at the age of 40 or
  earlier be treated to be falling in creamy layer
  on the basis of his service status?
</p>
<p id="p_96">        (vii) will a candidate who has gross
  annual income of Rs.2.5 lakh or above or
  possesses wealth above the Exemption limit
  as prescribed in the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_40">Wealth Tax Act</a> for a

</p>



<p id="p_98">     period of three consecutive years be treated
     to fall in creamy layer?&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_99">         The aforesaid queries came to be answered
  in paragraph 8 by observing as under:
</p>
<p id="p_100">             &quot;8. In regard to clauses (vi), (vii) and
</p><p id="p_101">     (viii) of para 4, it is clarified that the creamy
     layer status of a candidate is determined on
     the basis of the status of his parents and not
     on the basis of his own status or income or on
     the basis of status or income of his/her
     spouse. Therefore, while determining the
     creamy layer status of a person the status or
     the income of the candidate himself or of
     his/her spouse shall not be taken into
     account.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_102">          In view of the above, there is no room for
  any further consideration, whether or not the
  individual&#x27;s   income    is   to  be   taken   into
  consideration, while computing the total income
  relevant to determine whether an individual
  belongs to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;. The above
  clarification reveals, that it is only the parents
  income, which has to be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_103">       23. Writ Petition No.24115/2018 is filed by the
State Government against the order passed by the
Appellate Authority dated 18.11.2016 mainly on the
ground that the order passed by the Appellate Authority
cannot be sustained as it was not a speaking order.
Admittedly the 2nd respondent - Deputy Commissioner &amp;
Chairman, District Caste and Income Verification
Committee passed the order on 13.12.2017 rejecting the
grant of Validity certificate, which is the subject matter of
W.P. No.3390/2018 filed by the petitioner - Yogeshwari.
Admittedly, the Deputy Commissioner &amp; Chairman, District
Caste and Income Verification Committee raised certain
queries and sought clarification from the Appellate
authority and also the State Government and the State
Government has clarified the queries and therefore now
the State Government ought not to have filed the writ
petition.    Instead of filing the writ petition against the
order passed by the appellate authority, the State
Government ought to have directed the                Deputy
Commissioner &amp; Chairman, Distinct Caste &amp; Income
Verification Committee to issue the validity certificate in
accordance with law. The same has not been done. The
order was passed by the appellate authority on 18.11.2016
</p><p id="p_104">                            - 34 -
</p>



<p id="p_105">and the writ petition No.24115/2018 was filed by the State
Government on 1.6.2018 challenging the said order, after
the delay of more than 1 ½ years stating that the appellate
authority has not passed speaking order and no reasons
are assigned.
</p>
<p id="p_106">        24.    It   is not the case of the State Government
that the income of the husband has to be taken into
consideration while considering the issue of validity
certificate to the petitioner - Yogeshwari. If that is so, the
State Government ought not to have filed the present writ
petition and drove the petitioner - Yogeshwari
unnecessarily before this Court. The State Government
should act as custodian of the citizens of the State and the
State Government is in position of the mother and treat all
the children of the State equally and should not
discriminate.     Unfortunately, the State Government filed
the writ petition No.24115/2018 without there being any
ground to challenge the order passed by the appellate
authority. The order of the appellate authority has been
culminated into the impugned order passed by the 2nd
respondent - District Caste Verification Committee after
obtaining clarification from the very appellate authority and
the State Government.           In all fairness, the State
Government ought not to have filed writ petition
No.24115/2018.        The writ petition filed by the State
Government is devoid of merits and liable to be rejected.

<p id="p_107">                        VI. CONCLUSION

</p><p id="p_108">      25. For the reasons stated above, the 1st point
raised in these writ petitions has to be answered in
the affirmative holding that the petitioner -
Yogeshwari in W.P. No.3390/2018 has made out
case to quash the impugned order dated 13.12.2017
(Annexure-W) passed by the respondent - Deputy
Commissioner &amp; Chairman, District Caste and
Verification Committee and to issue direction to the
said respondent to issue validity certificate in her
favour subject to the condition that her parents
income does not exceed the limit prescribed in the
Government Order dated 30.03.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_109">      26. In view of the above, the 2nd point raised
in the present writ petitions has to be held in the
negative holding that the State Government has not
made out any case to interfere with the order dated
18.11.2016 passed by the appellate authority, in the
facts and circumstances of the case.

     dated 13.12.2017 passed by the 2nd respondent -

      The co-ordinate Bench was following the judgment of the

Apex Court in the case of SURINDER SINGH (supra). The co-
</p>
<p id="p_114">ordinate Bench set at naught similar action of determination of

the caste and income of the applicant on the basis of the caste

and income of the husband and directed that the caste and

income of the parents is to be taken into consideration. It is

further germane to notice a later judgment of the Division

Bench in the case of SMT.DIVYASHREE A.S. VS. THE

COMMISSIONER IN W.P.NO.11322/2022, DISPOSED ON

29.11.2022, wherein, the Division Bench has held as follows:

decision in the case of Surinder Singh Vs. Punjab

appointment of Smt. Yogeshwari. The relevant
paragraphs are as under:
</p>

<p id="p_116">           &quot;20. It is an undisputed fact that the 2nd
   respondent - Deputy Commissioner &amp; Chairman,
   District Caste &amp; Income Verification Committee,
   Chamarajanagar and members of the Committee
   in its meeting dated 27.2.2017 raised eight
   questions and sought clarification from the
   Appellate Authority - Commissioner, Department
   of Backward Classes, Bangalore as per Annexure-P
   dated        6.3.2017       and      from      the
   Government        as   per    Annexure-S     dated
   25.3.2017. It is also not in dispute that the

   (Annexure-G) intimated the 2nd respondent -
   Deputy Commissioner &amp; Chairman, District Caste
   &amp; Caste Verification Committee to issue validity
   certificate to the petitioner - Yogeshwari in
   accordance with law since the appeal filed before
   the Appellate Authority was allowed and the

   clarified the same to the Secretary, Backward

   Annexure-R. At clarification No.3, he has

   parents and not on the basis of his/her own
   status or income or on the basis of status or

   the parents income, which has to be taken into
   consideration. The said clarification issued by the

clarification clearly stated that the creamy layer

his/her own status or income or on the basis of
status or income of his/her spouse. Therefore while
determining the creamy layer status of a person, the

clarification reveals that it is only the parents
income, which has to be taken into consideration.

<p id="p_121">     10. Therefore, in view of this decision, the

    dated 6.12.2016 on the ground that the Income

 KUMAR GIJROYA v. DELHI SUBORDINATE
 SERVICES SELECTION BOARD AND ANOTHER</a>
 reported in (2016) 4 SCC 754, held that non-
 submission of a reserved (OBC) category
 certificate of the selected candidate within the cut
 off date mentioned in the advertisement
 cannot render a candidate ineligible for selection,
 as it would amount to denial of equality of
 opportunity contemplated under Articles 14, 15,
 16 and 39-A of the Constitution of India and
 allowed the application and the KEA was directed
 to include the name of the Applicant in the said
 selection list and to appoint the applicant
 pursuant to the said selection list. The
 KEA      challenged    the   said   &#x27;order    before
 the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Karnataka in Writ
 Petition No.49066/2017 (EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
 KARNATAKA EXAMINATIONS AUTHORITY v.
</p><p id="p_126"> STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER) and
 connected cases. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court by order
 dated 26.03.2018 has upheld the view taken by
 this Tribunal with regard to claim for reservation
 by the Applicant in the said Application, but so far
 as the direction to appoint the Applicant
 therein is concerned, the Hon&#x27;ble High Court has
 modified the said direction to read that the
 Government shall issue appointment order to the
 Applicant after issuance of Validity Certificate by
 the prescribed competent authority. Hence, a
 direction has to be issued to the KEA to consider
 the caste and income certificate produced by the
 Applicants in relation to income of their
 husband.&#x27;

</p><p id="p_127">13. Therefore, it is evident that non-submission
of a reserved (OBC) category certificate of the
selected candidate within the cut-off date
cannot render a candidate ineligible for
selection, as it would amount to denial of
equality of opportunity contemplated under

<p id="p_129">            11. Admittedly, in this case, the order of the
      Tribunal holding that applicant has produced caste
      and income certificate of her father instead of her
      husband is bad in law does not hold good. In the
      endorsement for cancellation also it is stated that a
      married woman should furnish the caste and income
      of her husband, as she was selected under IIA
      women reservation and as she is married, her
      father&#x27;s income and caste certificate cannot be
      considered. Therefore, respondent has come to the
      conclusion that she has given wrong information and
      her appointment was cancelled. But such contention

<p id="p_130">                                       (Emphasis supplied)

Therefore, in the considered view of this Court, the issue stands

covered by the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of

SURINDER SINGH (supra) and the judgment of the Division

Bench in the case of SMT. DIVYASHREE (supra) and that of

the co-ordinate Bench in Smt. YOGESHWARI (supra).            The

submission of the learned Advocate General is, that the Apex

Court in the case of INDRA SAWHNEY (supra) had permitted

the State Governments to regulate the procedures providing

reservations to other backward classes and therefore, the

Government Order dated 12.12.1986 or the Government Order

dated 28.10.1993 should be followed, would amount to placing

the Government Order on a higher pedestal than that of the

judgment of the Apex Court, the Division Bench of this Court

and that of the co-ordinate Bench, which can by no stretch of

imagination be done, therefore, the said submission is rejected.

<p id="p_132">In the result, I hold that the action of the Selecting authority -
</p>
<p id="p_133">DDPI in interpreting and holding that the caste and income of

the husband is to be taken into consideration is contrary to law

and a direction is to be issued to the respondents to consider

the applications of the petitioners on the basis of caste and

income certificates of the parents and not their spouse and as

belonging to the respective categories against which they have

applied for. Issue No.2 is accordingly answered.

<p id="p_135">      11. The issue is whether the Selecting Authority - DDPI

would get the jurisdiction to interpret a caste certificate issued

process. This issue need not detain this Court for long or delve

deep into the matter. A Division Bench of this Court in

Executive Director (supra) has held as follows:

also provided under <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_56">Section 4-F</a> of the Act against the
orders of the Tahsildar under <a href="/doc/170121756/" id="a_57">Section 4-A</a> and the order in
appeal by the concerned Assistant Commissioner under
<a href="/doc/32369260/" id="a_58">Section 4-B</a>. Further, an appeal against the Orders of the
Caste Verification Committee and Income and Caste
Verification Committee is also provided for under <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_59">Section
4-D</a> of the Act to the Authorities as mentioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_163">       17. Therefore, if the Caste Certificate/s and
Income and Caste Certificate/s are issued in the
prescribed form by the Competent Authority, it is
only the Authority under the Act which can
adjudicate upon such certificate, and that too in the
manner provided under the Act and Rules. Therefore,
KEA, a Selecting Authority, could not have taken
upon itself the jurisdiction to decide upon the
validity of the Income and Caste Certificate that is
issued in the Prescribed Form by the Competent
Authority and make a short shrift of the statutory
mechanism.
</p>
<p id="p_164">      18. The validation of the Caste Certificate and the
Income and Caste Certificate, as the case may be, is
because <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_60">Section 4-C(l)</a> of the Act read with Rule 9 of the
Rules. While Section 4-C(l) contemplates constitution of
</p><p id="p_165">                            - 46 -
</p>



<p id="p_166">Committee/s for verification of the Caste Certificate and
Income and Caste Certificate, Rule 9 of the Rules
mandates that no person who claims the benefit of
reservation shall be appointed to a service or to a post
under the Government with an Establishment in public
sector without production of a validity certificate. Thus, in
terms of the Act and Rules what is inevitable is that every
candidate seeking reservation in appointments to a service
or post with the Government or Establishment in Public
Sector, should initially obtain a Caste Certificate or the
Income and Caste Certificate, and the same should be
verified and validated with issuance of the Validity
Certificate; and the terms of the Act and Rules, which are
detailed and elaborate, do not brook jurisdiction in a
Selecting Authority or the Appointing Authority to decide
on the validity of a Caste Certificate and an Income and
Caste Certificate.
</p>
<p id="p_167">      19. Therefore, the question that arises now is at
what stage should the Validity Certificate be obtained and
by whom. The Validity Certificate, as stated in Section 4-
C(2) of the Act, can be issued only at the instance of a
person who has obtained a Caste Certificate/Income and
Caste Certificate, or any Appointing Authority or an
Authority making admission to a course of study in the
university or educational institution. However, the stage at
which the Validity Certificate will have to be ascertained
from the provisions of the Act and Rules, more specifically
<a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_61">Section 4-C</a> of the Act and Rule 9 of the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_168">        20. The G.O. dated 12-2-1993 stated that a
Selection/Recruiting Authority in the interregnum between
publishing of the Provisional Select List and the finalisation
of the Final Select List, shall send the selection list to the
then prescribed Competent Authority who had to verify the
claims made by the candidates and issue Validity
Certificates. But, Rule 4-C enables only the Appointing
Authority (or the admitting Authority in the matter of
admissions to Educational Institutions) as against the
Selecting/Recruiting Authority, to initiate the process for
verification by the concerned Verification Committee. As
such it cannot be held that the Selecting/Recruiting
Authority could initiate the said process.
</p>
<p id="p_169">       21. If this be so, it would also inevitably be that
until the finalisation of the selection list, which is an
exercise to be completed by the Selecting/Recruiting
Authority, the process for verification of Caste Certificate
and Income and Caste Certificate and issuance of Validity
</p><p id="p_170">                          - 47 -
</p>



<p id="p_171">Certificate thereof also cannot be initiated until the
selection list is finalised by the Selecting/Recruiting
Authority. This is also because Rule 9 of the Rules
prescribes embargo only as against appointment of
persons claiming benefit of reservation without a Validity
Certificate, and if the embargo had to be at any stage
before the issuance of the Appointment, it would have
been so specified in Rule 9 of the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_172">        22. For the foregoing reasons, the questions
that are formulated for consideration are answered
declaring that the KEA cannot decide on the validity
of the Income and Caste Certificate, or exclude the
Applicants from the Revised Provisional List, and
that     the    Appointing     Authority    shall    issue
appointment orders only after the requisite Validity
Certificates are issued by the Competent Authorities
under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and Other Backward Classes (Reservation of
Appointments, etc.) Act, 1990 and the Karnataka
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other
Backward           Classes         (Reservation         of
Appointments, etc.) Rules, 1992. Therefore, the
direction issued by the Tribunal to the Karnataka
Examination Authority to include the name of the
applicants at appropriate places in the Provisional
Lists dated 6-12-2016 for the posts of the Assistant
Professors in the Government First Grade Colleges in
the State of Karnataka in the respective subjects of
&#x27;Social Work&#x27;, &#x27;History&#x27; and &#x27;Commerce&#x27; and forward
the same to the Principal Secretary, Education
Department (Higher Education) does not call for any
interference by this Court. However, the direction to the
Principal Secretary, Education Department (Higher
Education) to appoint the applicants as per this final
Selection List is modified to read that the Principal
Secretary, Education Department (Higher Education) can,
subject to all exceptions permissible in law, issue
appointment orders to the applicants for the posts of
Assistant Professors in the Government First Grade
Colleges in the State of Karnataka in the respective
subjects of &#x27;Social Work&#x27;, &#x27;History&#x27; and &#x27;Commerce&#x27; only
upon the Validity Certificate issued by the prescribed
Competent Authorities. Further, it is clarified that the
finding of the Tribunal that the applicants belong to OBC
category is only a prima facie finding based on the
Certificate issued by the Tahsildar, and whether the
applicants indeed belong to OBC category is a matter to be

The issue formulated by the Division Bench was whether the

Selecting Authority - the Karnataka Examinations Authority

therein, while finalizing the select list can decide about the

validity of a caste and income certificate issued by the

competent authority, it is answered against the Karnataka

Examinations Authority, the Selecting Authority. The State

tossed the said decision of the Division Bench unsuccessfully

before the Apex Court in SLP No.12648 of 2019. Therefore, the

finding of the Division Bench in so far as this Court is concerned

has become final and the action challenged in the cases at hand

is the one that was similar to what was challenged before the

Division Bench i.e., the Selecting Authority interpreting caste

and income certificate issued by the competent authority. In

the light of the Selecting Authority - DDPI having no jurisdiction

to do so, the action of the Selecting Authority, albeit on the

Government Order dated 12.12.1986 and the directions of the

State is unsustainable. Therefore, this issue is answered in

favour of the petitioners and against the respondents.

<p id="p_177">      12. It is rather surprising that the State is time and again

repeating the very same mistake and driving the applicants to

knock at the doors of this Court despite the declaration of law

by the Apex Court and that of this Court, by clinging on to a

Government Order dated 12.12.1986, which is on the face of it

unsustainable.     Therefore, it is for the State to direct the

selecting authorities to act in tune with law and not contrary to

law. It is high time to state, sets its house in order, and refrain

from generating unnecessary litigation.
</p>

<p id="p_178">      13. For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the writ

petitions are maintainable for the reasons rendered on issue

No.1; the caste and income certificates submitted by the

petitioners shall be taken into consideration by the Selecting

Authority - DDPI; the Selecting Authority - DDPI has no

jurisdiction to interpret the caste certificates issued by the

competent authorities. The petition would thus succeed.
