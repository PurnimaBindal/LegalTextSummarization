1.         By this order, I shall  dispose off  the contentions, raised on behalf of the 

           parties, on the point of sentence.

2.         In the present case, both the convicts, namely, Sri Kant Chawla (A­1) &amp; 

           Jagpal   Singh   Chaney   (A­2)  have   been  convicted  for   the   offence 

           punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1">sections  120B</a> IPC  read with  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">sections  420</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a> 

           IPC read with <a href="/doc/86648814/" id="a_5">section 13</a> (2) and 13 (1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Prevention of Corruption  

           Act</a>,   1988.     Convict,  Sri   Kant   Chawla(A­1),  has   been   convicted,   in 

           addition,   for   the   offence   punishable   under  <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_7">section  13(2)</a>  read   with 

           <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_8">section  13</a> (1) (d)  of the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_9">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988.   Convict, 

           Jagpal   Singh   Chaney   (A­2),   has   been   convicted,   in   addition,   for   the 

           offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_10">sections 420</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_11">468</a> IPC.  



3.         It has been strongly  contended  on behalf of the State by the Ld. Sr. PP 

           for the CBI  that this is a  corruption case, in which, the convicts  have 

           been convicted, as  they were operating as an organised racket and have 

           caused illegal   huge pecuniary loss to the  State Bank of Bikaner and 

           Jaipur,  Govt. of India Undertaking.     That they have cheated   the said 

           bank   to   the   tune   of  Rs.31.58   lakhs  when   loan   was   fraudulently 


CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors.                                                                                         Page 2 of  68 
                                                                    3
                                                                                                          CBI case No. : 37/11 

           sanctioned.  They have, therefore, caused loss to the public exchequer of 

           the  said   amount.     It  has  further   been  stated  that  the  amount,   to   the 

           extent   to   which   the   Government   has   been   cheated,   was   not   a   small 

           amount as the case  pertains to the period prior to the year 2006, when it 

           was a huge and fat  amount.

               

4.         The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum     prescribed 

           substantive punishment with fine be handed over to all the convicts, so 

           that enough and clear  message goes to one and all and especially to the 

           potential offenders, who are in the waiting to commit such like   frauds 

           so   that   the   punishment   act   as   a   deterrence   and   the   intent     of   the 

           legislature is fulfilled. 



5.         Convict Sri Kant Chawla, has prayed that a lenient view be taken on the 

           ground   that     there   is   no   allegation   against   him   that   he   has   been 

           benefited even with single penny.   That he has an old and ailing  mother 

           of 80 years of age.     That he is the only male member in the family to 

           support his wife and  his son, who is bed ridden.   That he, himself, has 

           also been afflicted with health problems.

                                                                    4
                                                                                                          CBI case No. : 37/11 

6.         Convict  Jagpal Singh Chaney  has submitted that he is 63 years of age 

           and is afflicted with various ailments like - high Blood Pressure, Blood 

           Sugar, etc.  That he is also suffering from Glucoma and is unable to see 

           properly.  That he has not been convicted previously.   He has, however, 

           been convicted  in another case also by this Court.



7.         Both   the   convicts   have,   thus,   prayed   for   a   lenient   view.    They   have 

           prayed  for release on probation.  



8.         The   contentions,   raised   by   the   the   convicts,   have   met   stiff     and   very 

           strong opposition on behalf of the State.  It has been urged that convict 

           Sri Kant Chawla, the then public servant, is a convict before this Court, 

           in as many as  three  different cases as he had illegally and dishonestly 

           sanctioned loans/ Cash Credit Limits on the basis of false and fraudulent 

           documents in the year 2006, when it was quite a big sum.   It has, further, 

           been   stated on behalf of the State that   being a public servant at the 

           relevant time, convict Sri Kant Chawla acted corruptly with full vigour, in 

           sanction   of   loan   and   then   after   in   permitting   overdraft   beyond   his 

           discretion and power, one after the other.   It has, therefore, been urged 

           that   this   convict     is   a   habitual     offender     and   deserves   maximum 

CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors.                                                                                         Page 4 of  68 
                                                                    5
                                                                                                          CBI case No. : 37/11 

           punishment. 



9.         Similarly, it is stated that convict Jagpal Singh Chaney is held guilty in 

           two cases.     it is stated that in pursuance to the systematic and well­

           planned   conspiracy,   he   forged   reports/documents   and   acted   in 

           connivance with other convicts in this case.  



10.        It is further urged on behalf of the State that most of the pleas taken by 

           the convicts   are routine and stock pleas and in any case, in the case 

           under   the   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_12">Prevention   of   Corruption   Act</a>,     these   pleas   taken     are   not 

           considered as  mitigating circumstances.  It has, therefore,  been  prayed 

           that exemplary punishment  be awarded to the convicts  herein.  



11.        On behalf of the CBI, following case law have been cited:

           (i) State of Punjab  Vs. Rakesh  Kumar, AIR 2009 Supreme Court 391,

           (ix) State of J &amp; K  Vs. Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC 611. 




12.        On behalf of the convicts, no case law has been cited:




13.        At the very outset, it is observed that there is no quarrel over the settled 

           propositions of law discussed in the aforesaid case law,  cited.

14.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as Dr. Subramanyam 

           Swami  Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh, 2012, AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed 

           that ­:

                                 "The   magnitude   of   corruption   in   our   public   life   is  
                      incompatible with the concept of socialistic secular democratic  
                      public.  The duty of the Court is that any anti corruption law has  
                      to   be   interpreted   and   worked   out   in   such   a   fashion   as   to  
                      strengthen to fight against corruption."


15.        It has further been observed in the same case that  "In a situation where 

           two constructions are eminently reasonable, the Court has to accept the  

           one   that   seeks   to   eredicate     corruption     to   the   one   which   seeks   to  

           perpetuate it."




CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors.                                                                                         Page 6 of  68 
                                                                    7
                                                                                                          CBI case No. : 37/11 

16.                   It   has   been   held   in   case   reported   as  Narendra     Champak   Lal 

           Trivedi  Vs. State of Gujrat, 2012 (7) SCC page 80 that­:                                             "Corruption 

           at any level does not deserve either  sympathy or leniency."  



17.        The   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of  State   of   Rajasthan  Vs. Vinod 

           Kumar, decided on, 18th May, 2012 (Criminal Appeal No. 1887) reiterated 

           the law laid down in State of  J&amp;K  Vs.  Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC P 611, 

           and observed  that superannuation of the convict  and the pendency  of 

           criminal   trial   for over a period of time cannot    be treated   a special  

           reason to reduce  the sentence.   



18.        In the same appeal quoting 'M B Joshi Vs. State   of Maharashtra, AIR 

           2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble  Apex  Court observed that­:

                       "It is the defect  of the system that longevity  of the cases tried  
                       under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_13">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> is too lengthy.  If that is  
                       regarded  as sufficient  for reducing  the sentence  mandated by 
                       the Parliament legislative exercise  would stand defeated." 


19.        It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case reported as 

           State of J &amp; K  Vs. Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC  P 611,  that ­:

                       "Corruption     at   any   level,   by   any   person,   of   any  

CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors.                                                                                         Page 7 of  68 
                                                                    8
                                                                                                          CBI case No. : 37/11 

                       magnitude, is condemnable, which cannot be ignored by 
                       the   Judicial   Courts,   when   proved.     No   leniency   is 
                       required     to   be   shown     in   proved   cases   under     the  
                       <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">Prevention   of   Corruption   Act</a>   which     itself     treats   the  
                       offences   under   it   of   a   special   nature   to   be   treated  
                       differently than the general penal offences.  The convicts  
                       of the offences under the Act are to be dealt with heavy  
                       hand  and deterrant  rod.   No  populous  or sympathetic 
                       approach  is needed in such cases."


20.        It was observed by the Hon'ble High Court in the cases reported as   Jai 

           Bhagwan    Vs.   State   (NCT   of   Delhi),    2008   150   DLT   46   (Delhi)   and  

           Ravinder Kumar Arora Vs. CBI  Manu/DE/8816/2007 (Delhi) ,  that ­: 

                       "It   is   a   normal   thing   that   'trial'   of   the   person   is 
                       considered   a period of 'agony' undergone by him.   But  
                       we   tend   to   forget   the   agony   of   the   society   and   the  
                       complainant who dared  lodge the complaint. The entire  
                       purpose   of   the   legislature   of   sentencing   the   offenders 
                       stands defeated  and that is the one reason that wages of  
                       corruption   are   considered   more   attractive     in   this

                        "When corruption was sought to be eliminated from the 
                        polity all possible stringent measures are to be adopted  
                        within the bounds of law. One such measure is to provide  
                        condign   punishment.   Parliament   measured   the 
                        parameters   for such condign punishment and in that 
                        process   wanted   to   fix   a   minimum   sentence   of  
                        imprisonment   for   giving   deterrent   impact   on   other  
                        public   servants   who   are   prone     to   corrupt   deals.  That  
                        was precisely the reason why the sentence   was fixed as 
                        seven years and directed   that even if the said period of  
                        imprisonment need not be given, the sentence shall not  
                        be   less   than   the   imprisonment   for   one   year.   Such   a 
                        legislative insistence  is reflection of Parliament's resolve  
                        to meet corruption cases with very strong hand to give  
                        signals   of   deterrence   as   the   most   pivotal   feature   of  
                        sentencing of corrupt public servants. All public servants  
                        have to face very serious consequences.   If on the other

                        sentence even if the case ends in conviction, its fallout  
                        would   afford   incentive   to   public   servants   who   were 
                        susceptible   to   corruption   to   indulge   in   such   nefarious  
                        practices   with   immunity.   Increasing   the   fine   after  
                        reducing the imprisonment to a nominal period can also  
                        defeat the purpose as the corrupt public servants could  
                        easily raise the fine amount through the same means."

           furtherance of a conspiracy and during its pendency, is admissible  
           against each co­conspirator. Despite the unreliability of hearsay 
           evidence,   it   is   admissible   in   conspiracy   prosecutions.   Thus 
           conspirators   are   liable   on   agency   theory   for   statements   of   co­
