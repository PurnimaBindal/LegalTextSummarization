SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(Under Order XIIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure)

1.      In this suit for trademark infringement, trade name,
dilution, passing off, rendition of accounts etc. the defendant no.
1 has filed an application for Summary Judgment under Order
XIIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter &#x27;the Code&#x27;).

2.      All the parties have caused their appearance in the case,
pleadings are complete but the issues are yet to be framed.

           Summary Judgment mooted by Defendant No. 1

3.      The defendant no. 1 has sought a summary judgment not in
respect of all the matters in the suit but only with respect to one
of the claims in the suit pertaining to the sale of goods
originating from the plaintiff and which are being sold on
defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the plaintiff&#x27;s authority.

                           Description of the Parties

4.      As per the pleadings the plaintiff, TTK Prestige Ltd, is
engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing and sale of
kitchen appliances like pressure cookers (both electric and non-
electric) and various other similar goods under the trademark
PRESTIGE.

5.      The defendant no. 1, M/S Hiveloop Technology Private
Limited, is an online selling platform operating through its
website www.udaan.com.


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                   Page No. 2 of 64
 6.      The defendant no. 2, M/S Hiveloop Logistic Private
Limited, is the logistic arm of the defendant no. 1.

                           Brief Facts of the Case

7.      In brief, the cause of action of the plaintiff, has its genesis
in the averments that it enters into an agreement/contract with its
respective       dealers    and   distributors,   which   restricts    the
dealers/distributors concerned from offering or selling the
plaintiff&#x27;s products through any online/e-commerce mode
without the prior written consent of the plaintiff. An accusing
finger has been raised against the defendant no. 1 vis-Ã -vis the
sale of the plaintiff&#x27;s products on its online platform without the
plaintiff&#x27;s consent resulting in trademark infringement and
passing off. The categorical stand of the plaintiff is that any
online sale of plaintiff&#x27;s products, under the trade mark
PRESTIGE and its logo, without the authorization from the
plaintiff is completely illegal, unlawful and in breach of such
contract. It is the case of plaintiff that the products sold or offered
for sale under the plaintiff&#x27;s said trademark and its logo without
its consent is unlawful amounting to infringement of plaintiff&#x27;s
registered trade mark apart from committing an act of passing
off.

8.      In the Written Statement of the defendant no. 1, amongst
others, it&#x27;s stand is that such online sales and offers for sale do
not constitute a valid cause of action against it for the reason that
there is no privity-of- contract between the plaintiff and
defendant no. 1. The position is that when the plaintiff puts its
products in the distribution chain, the title of the products under
the trademark PRESTIGE and its logo passes immediately upon

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                    Page No. 3 of 64
 the sales by the plaintiff to the distributors/dealers. Further the
contract between the plaintiff and its distributors/dealers
demonstrates that the breach of this condition merely provides
remedies such as costs and damages against the defaulting
distributors/dealers and entitles termination of the agreement
with such dealers/distributors. There is no room for fastening of
any liability upon any third party, in the present case, the
defendants herein.

              Grounds pleaded for a Summary Judgment

9.      The moot question which has been raised by the defendant
no. 1 is whether the resale of genuine products of plaintiff on
defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the plaintiff&#x27;s consent
constitutes trademark infringement and/or passing off. The
grounds pressed into service by the defendant no. 1 are as under:-

                (i). Doctrine of Exhaustion:- It has been pleaded that
                as per the section 30(3) of the Trademarks Act, 1999
                and binding precedents, once the goods have been
                lawfully acquired there are no holds barred. If such
                goods are put into market and further sold, there
                would be no infringement of the trademark
                irrespective of the fact whether such a market is an
                international market or a domestic market. A strong
                exception has been taken to alleged division between
                the offline market and the online market and the
                plaintiff&#x27;s claim on an exhaustion of rights only in
                the offline market, terming such sub-division of the
                market, especially by means of a contract, contrary
                to the settled legal position in the context of

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                  Page No. 4 of 64
                 domestic     market     and     international     market.
                Defendant No. 1&#x27;s stand is that once the plaintiff has
                sold its goods to its dealers and distributors, any
                further offer to sell or sale of its goods does not
                amount to trademark infringement.

                (ii). Ingredients of Passing-off not made out:- The
                defendant no. 1 has also challenged the claim of
                passing-off as pressed into service by the plaintiff
                stating that the most basic elements of passing off
                including    misrepresentation      and    damage       are
                conspicuous by absence. The entire basis of the tort
                of passing off is that the law does not permit any one
                to carry on his business in such a way as would
                persuade the customers or clients in believing that
                the goods or services belonging to someone else are
                his or are associated therewith. However, when
                sellers sell genuine goods originating from the
                plaintiff on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform, this most
                basic ingredient of the tort is not satisfied.

                (iii). No Privity of Contract:-<a href="/doc/137624/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the Sale
                of Goods Act, 1930 has been invoked to bring home
                the fact that upon a contract for sale of a specific
                property, the property is transferred to the buyer and
                no further condition can be imposed upon the buyer.
                Even if a binding contract exists between the
                plaintiff and its dealer and/or distributor, this
                condition cannot be enforced against defendant no. 1
                since there is no privity of contract between the
                plaintiff and defendant no. 1. The contracts on which
CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                     Page No. 5 of 64
                 the plaintiff places reliance itself identifies the
                remedies which are available to the plaintiff in the
                event of a breach of the condition relating to
                restriction on selling through e-commerce platforms.
                The remedies identified by the contract are costs and
                damages against the defaulting distributors/dealers
                and such breach also entitles the plaintiff to
                terminate the agreement with the dealer/ distributor.

                (iv). No illegality:- The plaintiff has not alleged, let
                alone demonstrated, that any of its distributors or
                dealers are selling on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform.
                The condition as stipulated in the plaintiff&#x27;s
                agreements with its dealers and distributors is not
                passed on to subsequent purchasers and, in any
                event, the plaintiff has no privity of contract with
                such       subsequent   purchasers.   Thus,    even      the
                allegation that there is any breach of contract is
                extremely tenuous since the plaintiff has not alleged
                or produced any document/ proof whatsoever to
                show that the persons to whom the conditions under
                its contract applied have sold on defendant no. 1&#x27;s
                platform. The plaintiff has not identified a single
                distributor or dealer which has breached the alleged
                condition. At the very least, in order to make out a
                breach of contract, it was incumbent upon the
                plaintiff to firstly identify the relevant party with
                whom the contract exists, and which breached the
                condition; secondly, it ought to have impleaded the
                said party; and, thirdly, it ought to have pleaded and

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                      Page No. 6 of 64
                 produced the contract that the plaintiff has with the
                said party. The plaintiff has taken none of these
                crucial steps. Instead, the plaintiff alleges that &quot;any
                online sale of plaintiff&#x27;s products under the trade
                mark       PRESTIGE   and    its   logo   without     the
                authorization from the plaintiff is completely illegal,
                unlawful and in breach of such contract&quot;. This
                contention is ex-facie misconceived in law.

10.     The defendant no. 1 raised the following questions of law
for consideration in the application:

            (a). Whether the offer to sell or sale of goods
            originating from the trademark proprietor amounts to
            trademark infringement, where the trademark owner
            has sold the goods to its distributors/ dealers with the
            condition that they will not sell the products through
            the e-commerce mode without its consent?

            (b). Whether by restricting the downstream distribution
            of goods the plaintiff is seeking to impermissibly create
            a perpetual monopoly and if so, to what effect?

            (c). Whether such restrictions between the plaintiff, its
            dealers and distributors can be enforced by a Court in a
            suit for trademark infringement or passing against
            defendant no. 1, with whom there is no privity of
            contract?

            (d). Whether a suit for inducement to breach of contract
            is maintainable where the parties to the contract are not
            identified, not impleaded as a party to the suit and the


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                   Page No. 7 of 64
             contract which is alleged to be breached is not
            produced before the Court?

11.The defendant no. 1 accordingly prayed for a summary
    judgment seeking dismissal of the plaintiff&#x27;s claims which
    relate to sale of goods originating from the plaintiff and which
    are being sold on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the
    plaintiff&#x27;s authority; award of the costs incurred by it and any
    other order as deemed fit in the interests of equity and justice.

                           Arguments of Parties

12. I have heard Shri Rajshekhar Rao, Sh. Aditya Gupta, Sh.
    Raghav Kacker and Ms. Krutika Vijay along with their
    associate learned Counsel on behalf of the applicant/defendant
   no. 1.
13. On behalf of the plaintiff/non-applicant, Ld. Counsel
    ShriManish Kumar Mishra with Ms. Akansha, has addressed
    the arguments.

14.Shri Nischal Anand, ld. Counsel has made a brief address on
    behalf of defendant no. 2.

15. In the course of the arguments Ld. Counsel for the parties
    have invariably referred to the pleadings and documents on
    record. Case law has also been cited in copious measures.
    Written arguments have been filed by all the parties.

         (i). Maintainability of Summary Judgment Application

16.The very application for summary judgment has been
    challenged by the plaintiff.

17.Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the application
    for summary judgment is not maintainable either in law or on

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 8 of 64
     facts. It has been submitted that the limited issue on which the
    defendant no. 1 has been seeking summary judgment is the
    subject matter of the appeal being FAO (COMM) 519/2019.
    The defendant no. 1 has also challenged the order dated
    25.10.2019 passed by this Court granting limited injunction
    to the plaintiff with prima facie view taken in its favour. This
    Court, at two occasions, has taken a prima facie view in
    favour of the plaintiff by way of ex-parte injunction dt.
    15.10.2019 and bi-parte injunction dated 25.10.2019.
    Therefore, the plaintiff&#x27;s chances of succeeding in the suit is
    reasonably good and it cannot be deprived of its right to prove
    its case in trial.

18. The next limb of the argument on maintainability as put
    forward by the plaintiff is that the issue whether the goods
    sold on the platform of defendant no. 1 have been lawfully
    acquired and the same are without the consent of the plaintiff
    is a mixed question of fact as well as law which can only be
    proved in trial and not at this stage. This requires summoning
    of witnesses from both the sides including the sellers,
    distributors and dealers who have sold the goods to the
    defendant no. 1 to prove the inter se relationship of the
    defendant no. 1 and these parties, business arrangement in
    acquiring the goods in question and whether the goods are
    genuine and with consent of the plaintiff etc. Therefore, oral
    evidence cannot be dispensed with.

19. Another aspect of challenge to the maintainability of this
    application is the issue of defendant no. 1 being an
    intermediary. It is submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench
    of High Court of Delhi has already held that that the said issue
CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 9 of 64
     has to be decided only in trial. Reliance has been placed upon
    <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_3">Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. Amway India Pvt. Ltd.
    and Ors</a>. (2020 SCC OnLine Del 454) citing Paras 141 and
    145 of the judgment.

20.Responding to the above, Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1
    has submitted that Order XIIIA of the Code has been inserted
    by way of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and empowers a
    Court deciding a commercial suit to decide a claim without
    recording oral evidence. Despite the existence of provisions
    such as rejection of a plaint under Order VII Rule 11 and
    judgment on admissions under Order XII Rule 6, the
    Legislature had felt the necessity to introduce Order XIIIA in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">
    the Code</a> to obviate the need for trial in each and every case.

21. Carrying his argument forward, Ld. Counsel for the
    defendant no. 1 submitted that it is now well-settled by the
    Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi that the threshold for deciding
    an application for summary judgment under Order XIIIA of
    the CPC, a &quot;real prospect of succeeding&quot; is one that is
    &quot;realistic&quot; as opposed to merely being &quot;fanciful&quot;, and which
    carries some degree of conviction as opposed to merely being
    arguable. The Court may take into account the evidence that is
    placed before it on the application for summary judgment and
    the evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available
    at trial. When a summary judgment application allows the
    Court to find the necessary facts and resolve the dispute,
    proceeding to trial would generally not be proportionate,
    timely or cost effective. The standard for fairness is not
    whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 10 of 64
     it gives the Court the confidence that it can find the necessary
    facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to resolve
    the dispute. The judgment of <a href="/doc/45300504/" id="a_5">Kamdhenu Limited vs. Aashiana
    Rolling Mills Ltd</a>., 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2426 has been
    cited on this aspect with emphasis on para 35 of the
    Judgment. It is submitted that the thread running through the
    judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi is that trial of a
    commercial dispute is no longer the norm when the conditions
    for summary judgment, as elucidated above, are met.

22.In further continuation, Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1
    submitted that Order XIIIA Rule 1(2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> of the Code</a> makes it
    clear that a summary judgment may be delivered by the Court
    on a claim, or a part of a claim, or a question of law on which
    the claim (in whole or in part) depends. There is therefore no
    bar on a part of a claim or a question of law being decided by
    the Court by way of a summary judgment. In all cases, the
    aim of providing such an option to the Court is to narrow the
    scope of the dispute which is to be tried, and to provide as
    much certainty to parties as possible prior to the trial.

23. Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 2 supported the proposition
    of law as advanced by the defendant no. 1.

                           (ii). Merits of the Case

24. Detailed arguments have been held on the merits of the case
    by the respective parties.

                (A) Defendant No. 1&#x27;s Arguments on Merits

25.On merits, the Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1 argued that
    defendant runs a B2B (business to business) e-commerce


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 11 of 64
     platform which enables sellers to list their products on the
    defendant&#x27;s platform for purchase by buyers. The defendant
    does not determine the content of the listings by third-party
    sellers, each element of which is determined by the sellers
    themselves, including the product name, product description,
    price, product guarantees and warranties, discounts to be
    offered and return criteria.

26.The plaintiff claims to be owner of the trademark PRESTIGE
    with respect to kitchen appliances. The plaintiff has averred
    that it enters into agreements with its dealers and distributors,
    which        according   to    the   plaintiff   restricts    such
    dealers/distributors from offering for sale or selling the
    plaintiff&#x27;s products through any online/e-commerce mode
    without the consent of the plaintiff. As per the plaintiff&#x27;s, the
    sale of the plaintiff&#x27;s products on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform
    without the Plaintiff&#x27;s consent amounts to trademark
    infringement and passing off.

27.An ex-parte interim injunction has been granted by the
    Learned Additional District Judge on 15.10.2019, restraining
    the defendants from using any platform for sale of goods of
    the plaintiff and from selling them on any online platform
    including www.udaan.com. The ex-parte interim injunction
    has been modified by order dated 25.10.2019 pursuant to an
    application filed by defendant no. 1 under Order XXXIX Rule
    4 of the CPC, whereby it was inter alia directed that upon
    being notified by the plaintiff of a counterfeit product being
    sold on its platform, defendant no. 1 was to notify the seller
    and take down such listing from its platform in the absence of


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 12 of 64
     any evidence of genuineness of the product from the seller. It
    is pertinent to note that there was no direction passed
    prohibiting the listing of genuine products of the plaintiff on
    the platform of defendant no. 1.

28.Upon an appeal filed by the plaintiff and cross-objections
    filed by the defendant no. 1, the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi
    has been pleased to pass an order on 24.01.2020, staying the
    directions contained in paragraph 1 of the order dated
    2510.2019 which directed defendant no. 1 to disclose the
    complete details, addresses and contact details of its sellers on
    its website and further staying the directions in paragraph 6 of
    the said order which required defendant no. 1 to verify the
    guarantee and warranties of products listed on its platform.
    The order dated 24.01.2020 also stated that the defendant had
    to provide complete details of sellers to the plaintiff upon
    request. These details of sellers who had listed PRESTIGE
    branded products on the defendant&#x27;s platform had already
    been provided by the defendant to the plaintiff by a letter
    dated 06.11. 2019 and no further request for seller&#x27;s details
    has been received by the defendant since the order dated
    24.01.2020.

29.A significant part of the plaintiff&#x27;s claim relates to sale of
    goods originating from the plaintiff which are being sold on
    defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the plaintiff&#x27;s authority.
    The plaintiff&#x27;s own case demonstrates that a part of its claim,
    and in fact a significant part, relates to the sale of goods on
    defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform which are genuine, i.e. which
    originate from the plaintiff itself, but are merely being sold


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 13 of 64
     without &quot;authorization&quot; from the plaintiff. Such goods are
    hereinafter referred to as &quot;genuine goods&quot;. This is evident
    from various pleadings/documents of the plaintiff.

30. In para 14 of the plaint the plaintiff has stated that &quot;the
    defendants are not only causing to sell/selling/offering for sale
    plaintiff&#x27;s products bearing the trade mark PRESTIGE and its
    logo without any authorization from the plaintiff but are also
    knowingly involved along with third parties in selling/offering
    for    sale     counterfeit        products      bearing   the      trademark
    PRESTIGE and its logo and deceiving the public at large.&quot; It
    is evident from this averment that the plaintiff refers to two
    distinct types of listings on defendant No. 1&#x27;s platform - those
    that are the Plaintiff&#x27;s products but being offered for sale
    without authorization, and those that are allegedly counterfeit.

31.The plaintiff has itself categorized the listings on the
    defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform into various categories and the
    listings which the plaintiff claims are &quot;unauthorized&quot; are
    separately mentioned and contra-distinguished from listings
    of &quot;fake products&quot;, &quot;products falsely applying false
    trademarks&quot;, &quot;Products with no warranty&quot;, &quot;products with
    tampered warranty&quot;, &quot;listing wrong brands under Prestige&quot;.
    Illustrative screenshots annexed by the plaintiff of listings of
    the plaintiff&#x27;s product under the trademark PRESTIGE on
    defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform, have been cited on pages 23 and
    31 of the plaint, and complete set of screenshots of product
    listings      on       defendant     no.   1&#x27;s     platform      marked        as
    &quot;Unauthorized Listings&quot; by the plaintiff, which screenshots
    are at page 233-485 of the documents filed with the plaint and


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                             Page No. 14 of 64
     the same have also been placed as Annexure-C of the instant
    application.

32.The legal notice dated October 1, 2019, addressed by the
    plaintiff to defendant no. 1 did not make any mention,
    whatsoever, of any counterfeit/ fake products or products with
    tampered warranty. The only allegation in the legal notice was
    that the plaintiff&#x27;s own products are being sold on defendant
    no. 1&#x27;s platform without the former&#x27;s consent.

33.As such there is a clear admission that part of the plaintiff&#x27;s
    claim relates to &quot;unauthorized&quot; sale of the &quot;plaintiff&#x27;s
    products&quot; on the platform of defendant no. 1, which is
    demonstrated by para 16 and 18-19 of the plaint. The
    defendant no. 1 has made clear in prayer (a) of the present
    application, it is seeking a summary judgment only with
    respect to such of the plaintiff&#x27;s claims which relate to sale of
    goods originating from the plaintiff and which are being sold
    on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the plaintiff&#x27;s authority.

34.In this context, the undisputed position of law is that the offer
    to sell or sale of goods originating from the trademark
    proprietor without the trademark proprietor&#x27;s consent does not
    amount to trademark infringement or passing off, even if the
    trademark owner has sold the goods to its distributors/ dealers
    with the condition that they will not sell the products through
    the e-commerce mode without its consent. The plaintiff&#x27;s own
    case as stated in the plaint, more specifically para 11 of the
    plaint, is that it sells the plaintiff&#x27;s products manufactured by
    it through dealers and distributors,. The plaintiff has
    categorically admitted that the title of products under the trade

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 15 of 64
     mark and logo PRESTIGE passes immediately upon sale by
    the plaintiff to its distributors/sellers, which is demonstrated
    by page 39 of the plaint; Clause 3.7 and Clause 4.5 of the
    Distributorship Agreement from page 191 onwards. Thus, the
    plaintiff itself releases the genuine goods into the chain of
    commerce, and the title in these genuine goods is passed on to
    the buyer i.e., the plaintiff&#x27;s distributor or dealer.

35.The position of law, both in terms of Section 30(3) of the
    Trademarks Act, 1999 and binding precedent interpreting the
    Trademarks Act, is crystal clear on the doctrine of
    &quot;exhaustion&quot; of trademark rights. Once goods bearing a
    registered trademark are lawfully acquired by a person, the
    further sale of those goods in the market is not infringement
    of trade mark merely because the goods had initially been put
    on the market under the registered trademark by the
    proprietor.

36.The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Trademarks Bill,
    1999 states as under in the context of Section 30 of
    Trademarks Bill, 1999:-

        &quot;Sub-clauses (3) and (4) recognize the principle of
        &#x27;exhaustion of rights&#x27; by preventing the trade mark
        owner from prohibiting on the ground of trade mark
        rights, the marketing of goods in any geographical
        area, once the goods under the registered trademark
        are lawfully acquired by a person. However, when
        the conditions of goods are changed or impaired
        after they have been put on a market, the provision
        will not apply.&quot;

37. The judgment of Kapil Wadhwa v Samsung Electronics, 2012
    SCC Online Del 5172 is cited on this aspect.


CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                     Page No. 16 of 64
 38.Given that the plaintiff has admitted that with respect to
    genuine goods, the title of products under the trade mark
    PRESTIGE passes immediately upon the original sale by the
    plaintiff to its distributors/dealers, it is clear that such goods
    are &quot;lawfully acquired&quot; goods for the purposes of section
    30(3) TM Act. Therefore, as per the mandate of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_7">section 30(3)</a>,
    further sale of such lawfully acquired genuine goods on the
    platform of defendant no. 1 by any person does not amount to
    trademark infringement.

39.Once sold, the trademark proprietor cannot control the chain
    of supply and the downstream distribution of goods, and
    certainly cannot do so under the trademark law. This is the
    entire objective of the doctrine of &quot;first sale&quot; or the &quot;doctrine
    of exhaustion&quot; statutorily incorporated in Section 30(3) of the
    TM Act. The law recognizes that once a product is sold by the
    trademark proprietor, the trademark rights in that product are
    &quot;exhausted&quot; and can no longer be exercised against
    downstream purchasers.

40.The doctrine of exhaustion under Section 30(3) of the TM Act
    has been recognized by two separate Division Bench
    decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi.

41. The Court in Kapil Wadhwa v Samsung Electronics, 2012
    SCC Online Del 5172 has held as under:

        &quot;Where goods bearing a registered trade mark are
        put on the market and are lawfully acquired by a
        person, the sale of the goods in the market by that
        person is not infringement of the trade mark by
        reason only of further sale in the market&quot;. And the
        Principle of International Exhaustion of Rights itself
        takes away the right of the respondents to control

CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 17 of 64
         the further sale and further distribution of the
        goods.&quot;

42.This decision in Kapil Wadhwa v Samsung Electronics(supra)
    has been applied by another Division Bench decision of the
    Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in the context of sale of genuine
    products on e-commerce websites. <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_8">In Amazon Seller Services
    Pvt. Ltd. v. Amway India Enterprises Pvt. Ltd</a> the Court held
    as under:_

        &quot;There is merit in the contention of Amazon that by
        permitting private entities like Amway to restrict
        downstream distribution of genuine goods, by
        enforcing contractual stipulations against third
        parties, the judgment of the learned Single Judge
        recognizes a monopoly that can be exercised in
        perpetuity. There is also force in the contention that
        this runs contrary to the legal position explained in
        <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_9">Kapil Wadhwa v. Samsung Electronics</a> (supra)

43.The rationale behind the doctrine of exhaustion of trademark
    rights is encapsulated in the authoritative commentary J.
    Thomas McCarthy on &#x27;Trademarks and Unfair Competition&#x27;,
    5th Edition (June 2021), Chapter 25:41, which states as
    follows:

        &quot;The overarching policy is that once an IP owner
        sells a product, certain IP rights are &quot;exhausted&quot; as
        to that particular sold product. The Supreme Court
        said that the basic principle is that &quot;when an item
        passes into commerce, it should not be shaded by a
        legal cloud on title as it moves through the
        marketplace.&quot;

        ...............................................................
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The logical inference to draw from the Supreme
        Court&#x27;s COTY and CHAMPION cases discussed
        previously is the general rule that a distributor who
        resells branded goods without change is not an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 18 of 64</span>
         &quot;infringer&quot; and thus needs no &quot;license.&quot; As the
        Second Circuit observed:
</p>
<p id="p_2">        As a general rule, trademark law does not reach the
        sale of genuine goods bearing a true mark even
        though the sale is not authorized by the mark owner.
        ... Thus, a distributor who resells trademarked
        goods without change is not liable for trademark
        infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        ...............................................................
</p>
<p id="p_4">        The same right extends to a retailer&#x27;s use of a mark
        in cyberspace. A retailer can use a brand name on
        Web site ads selling that branded product without a
        license from the trademark owner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        ............................................................
</p>
<p id="p_6">        The Ninth Circuit has repeated the &quot;exhaustion&quot; or
        &quot;first sale&quot; rule in the following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_7">        The right of a producer to control distribution of its
        trademarked product does not extend beyond the
        first sale of the product. Resale by the first purchaser
        of the original article under the Producer&#x27;s trademark
        is neither trademark infringement nor unfair
        competition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        ............................................................
</p>
<p id="p_9">        The Eleventh Circuit recited the &quot;exhaustion&quot; rule in
        somewhat different language, emphasizing that the
        rule applies only where the goods have not been
        altered or changed:
</p>
<p id="p_10">        The resale of genuine trademarked goods generally
        does not constitute infringement.... Under what has
        sometimes been called the &quot;first sale&quot; or
        &quot;exhaustion&quot; doctrine, the trademark protections of
        the Lanham act are exhausted after the trademark
        owner&#x27;s first authorized sale. ... Therefore, even
        though a subsequent sale is without an trademark
        owner&#x27;s consent, the resale of a genuine good does
        not violate the [Lanham] Act... This doctrine does
        not hold true, however, when an alleged infringer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 19 of 64</span>
         sells trademarked goods that are materially different
        than those sold by the trademark owner.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_11">44.This rationale of exhaustion also finds international support in
    the decision of the Chancery Division of the United Kingdom
    in Zino Davidoff SA v. A &amp; G Imports Ltd., (1999) 3 All ER
    711 which held that:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        &quot;As the parties agree, it is well established that the
        principle of exhaustion applies to all intellectual
        property rights. So if an article made in accordance
        with a patent is put upon the market in one member
        state by or with the consent of the owner of the
        patent rights, that owner cannot use those rights to
        prevent or hinder the importation of the goods into a
        second member state or to prevent their sale there.
        The expression &#x27;exhaustion of rights&#x27; accurately
        encapsulates the principle involved. The proprietary
        rights have been used up. The owner of them has
        nothing left to deploy against further exploitation of
        the goods. This principle applies not only to patents
        and copyright, but to trade marks as well. So, once
        the rights holder has put protected products on the
        market or has consented to such marketing, he loses
        all rights to object to further exploitation. This effect
        is indefeasible. The rights owner cannot override it
        by contract. The member states cannot override it by
        national legislation.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">45.Along the same lines, in the context of patent rights, the U.S
    Supreme Court decision dated May 30, 2017 in Impression
    Products v. Lexmark International holds that:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        &quot;When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that
        product &quot;is no longer within the limits of the
        monopoly&quot; and instead becomes the &quot;private,
        individual property&quot; of the purchaser, with the rights
        and benefits that come along with ownership. ... A
        patentee is free to set the price and negotiate
        contracts with purchasers, but may not, &quot;by virtue of
        his patent, control the use or disposition&quot; of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                  Page No. 20 of 64</span>
         product after ownership passes to the purchaser. ...
        We have explained in the context of copyright law
        that exhaustion has &quot;an impeccable historic
        pedigree,&quot; tracing its lineage back to the &quot;common
        law&#x27;s refusal to permit restraints on the alienation of
        chattels.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">46. The next limb of the argument of the Ld. Counsel for the
    defendant no. 1 is that contractual stipulations cannot defeat
    the doctrine of exhaustion. It is submitted that the plaintiff&#x27;s
    sole ground for alleging that its genuine goods which are
    being sold on the platform of defendant no. 1 have not been
    &quot;lawfully acquired&quot; and are therefore not covered by Section
    30(3) of the TM Act, is that the plaintiff has contractually
    restricted its dealers/distributors from selling such genuine
    goods via e-commerce. However, the doctrine of exhaustion
    of trademark rights as established in common law and
    explicitly laid out in Section 30(3) of the TM Act, cannot be
    defeated by mere contractual stipulations.
</p>
<p id="p_14">47. To expound the above further, Ld. Counsel for the defendant
    no. 1      submitted that the rationale behind the doctrine of
    exhaustion and <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_10">Section 30(3)</a> is to maintain the purity of the
    chain of commerce and prevent trademark owners from
    exercising a perpetual monopoly over their products even
    after such products have been lawfully acquired from the
    trademark proprietor. Allowing contractual stipulations that
    attempt to exercise exactly such a monopoly would negate the
    very rationale behind the doctrine and section 30(3) TM Act.
    Importantly, the language of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_11">Section 30(3)</a> not only comes to
    the aid of a person who lawfully acquires a product, but all
    those &quot;claiming under or through him&quot;. Therefore, all


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 21 of 64</span>
     subsequent purchasers of a lawfully acquired product are also
    entitled to avail the doctrine of exhaustion. This is the reason
    why the doctrine is also often referred to as the &#x27;first sale&#x27;
    doctrine i.e., the proprietor cannot exercise trademark rights
    beyond the first sale of its products and the first sale exhausts
    all trademark rights in a product.
</p>
<p id="p_15">48. To bring home this point, it has further been submitted by Ld.
    Counsel for the defendant no. 1 that pertinently, several
    provisions of the TM Act have been made &quot;subject to any
    agreement subsisting between the parties&quot;. An example of this
    is <a href="/doc/609696/" id="a_12">section 52</a> which deals with the rights of registered users
    and starts with the language &quot;Subject to any agreement
    subsisting between the parties, a registered user may institute
    proceedings...&quot; However, such phrasing is conspicuous by its
    absence in Section 30(3) of the TM Act, which clearly
    indicates the Legislature&#x27;s intention to ensure that parties
    cannot override the public policy goal of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_13">section 30(3)</a> by
    contract.
</p>
<p id="p_16">49. Not stopping at that, Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1
    further expounded the concept by submitting that the
    overriding nature of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_14">section 30(3)</a> over any contract between
    the trademark proprietor and the first purchaser of any
    products originating from the trademark proprietor also
    extends to all subsequent downstream dealings in those
    products. This is evident from the language of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_15">Section 30(3)</a>,
    which explicitly permits &quot;dealing in those goods by that
    person or by a person claiming under or through him&quot;, where
    &quot;that person&quot; refers to the first person who lawfully acquired
    the goods from the trademark proprietor. The provision
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 22 of 64</span>
     extends the benefit of the doctrine of exhaustion to persons
    claiming &quot;under or through&quot; such person, including all
    downstream purchasers of the products. Therefore, the sale of
    genuine products on the platform of defendant no. 1, whether
    or not the plaintiff has consented to such sale, is permissible
    under Section 30(3) TM Act.
</p>
<p id="p_17">50. Since the sale of genuine products on the platform of
    defendant no. 1 is permissible under <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_16">Section 30(3)</a>, it is a
    logical corollary that such sale does not amount to
    infringement of trademark. The plaintiff therefore has no
    cause of action whatsoever against any entity for trademark
    infringement due to sale of genuine goods, let alone against
    defendant no. 1. In fact, the sample contracts between the
    plaintiff and its authorised distributors/dealers, provide for a
    specific remedy against such dealers/distributors for selling
    the Plaintiff&#x27;s products via e-commerce in breach of the
    contract under Clause 3.10 of the Distributorship Agreement
    and Clause 4.8 of the Authorized Dealer Agreement. It is clear
    that even the plaintiff merely contemplates a contractual
    remedy in the event that its genuine products are sold via e-
    commerce by its dealers/distributors.
</p>
<p id="p_18">51. The next limb of the argument of defendant no. 1 is that the
    plaintiff&#x27;s contention that invocation of Section 30(3) TM Act
    requires &quot;consent&quot; of the trademark proprietor is entirely
    misconceived. It is submitted that the Plaintiff has sought to
    argue that defendant no. 1 cannot take the benefit of Section
    30(3) of the TM Act, 1999, since the invocation of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_17">Section
    30(3)</a> also requires consent of the trademark proprietor. This
    argument is completely misconceived. Firstly, section 30 TM
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 23 of 64</span>
     Act deals with the limits on the effect of a registered
    trademark and <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_18">section 30(3)</a> operates as an exception to
    infringement of a trademark i.e., even if an act were to
    amount to infringement under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_19">Section 29</a>, it would not be
    infringement by virtue of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_20">Section 30</a>. <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> deals with
    infringement of registered trademarks and deems certain acts
    to be infringement only if the trademark is used in the course
    of trade by a person not using by way of permitted use. Any
    use of a trademark with the consent of the trademark
    proprietor, as suggested by the plaintiff, would not amount to
    infringement under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_22">Section 29</a> in the first instance, as it would
    be &quot;permitted use&quot; as defined by <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_23">section 2(1)(r)</a> of the Trade
    Marks Act.
</p>
<p id="p_19">52. The acceptance of the plaintiff&#x27;s contention would make
    section 30(3) TM Act redundant, as there would be no need to
    have an exception for infringement for an activity that would
    not amount to infringement under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_24">section 29</a> at all. It is well-
    settled position that a statutory provision cannot be interpreted
    in a manner that would render it redundant.
</p>
<p id="p_20">53. The next aspect of the argument of the defendant no. 1 is that
    there is no cause of action for passing off. It is submitted that
    the plaintiff claims that the sale of genuine goods on the
    platform of defendant no. 1 amounts to the tort of &quot;passing
    off&quot;. This claim is completely meritless, for various reasons. It
    is submitted that the basis of the tort of passing off is that no
    person can carry on business so as to &quot;pass off&quot; his goods or
    services as those belonging to someone else and thus take
    advantage of the reputation of such other person. Consumers
    should not be deceived into thinking that goods which in fact

     originate from Person &#x27;A&#x27;, originate from Person &#x27;B&#x27;.
    However, the position is the present case is different. The
    instant application for summary judgment is limited to
    genuine goods of the plaintiff, i.e. goods which originate from
    the plaintiff and are marketed on the platform of defendant no.
    1 as originating from the plaintiff. Since there is absolutely no
    deception taking place, the most basic ingredient of the tort of
    passing off is not satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_21">54. The next argument put forward by the defendant no. 1 is that
    no cause of action for inducement of breach of contract by
    defendant no. 1 is there in the suit albeit the plaintiff has
    claimed that defendant no. 1&#x27;s actions amount to inducement
    of breach of contract, by interfering in the performance of the
    contractual        obligations   of   the   plaintiff&#x27;s     authorized
    distributors/dealers. However, the plaintiff has categorically
    admitted in its reply to the present application in para F.2 at
    page 10 that it has not even impleaded the sellers who are
    responsible for selling the plaintiff&#x27;s products on the platform
    of defendant no. 1. Moreover, apart from one &quot;sample
    contract&quot; each with a distributor and dealer, the plaintiff has
    not even placed on record the actual contract which it alleges
    has been breached, whether by inducement by defendant no. 1
    or otherwise. It is submitted that there can be no finding of
    breach of contract or inducement of breach of contract unless,
    at the very least, the party which has breached the contract is
    impleaded in the suit and the contract of which breach is
    alleged is on record.
</p>
<p id="p_22">55.It is submitted in continuation of the above argument that the
    plaintiff&#x27;s reply to this allegation is noteworthy and shows the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                      Page No. 25 of 64</span>
     absurdity of the plaintiff&#x27;s case. Para 12 of the plaintiff&#x27;s reply
    to application for summary judgment, is pertinent to note,
    where it is said that, &quot;It is highly misconceived being contrary
    to law that the plaintiff was required to identify the relevant
    party with whom the plaintiff has contractual relations and
    with respect to whom interference or inducement of breach is
    alleged impleaded the said party and also filed the relevant
    contract.&quot;
</p><p id="p_23">             (B). Arguments of Defendant no. 2 on Merits

</p><p id="p_24">56.Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 2 adopted the arguments
    addressed on behalf of the defendant no. 1 stating that the
    defendant no. 2 is a logistics company and does not partake in
    the sale or purchase of the products in question in the present
    suit. The same is also apparent from the plaintiff&#x27;s own
    pleadings, wherein the only averment made with respect to
    the defendant no. 2 is at Para 13 of the Plaint stating that the
    defendant no. 2 provides &quot;logistics and payment services
    including delivery of the product and receiving payment on
    behalf of the sellers.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_25">57.It is therefore submitted on behalf of the defendant no. 2 that
    as per the plaintiff&#x27;s own assertions, the activities of the
    defendant no. 2, as on the date of filing of the suit, were
    limited to the following services:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            a. Packaging of products;

             d. Collecting payments for delivery of products.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">58. Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 2 further submitted that it
    is pertinent to mention that none of the activities stated above
    fall within the ambit of &#x27;use of a mark in the course of trade&#x27;
    in accordance with <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_25">Section 29(1)</a> and Section 29(6) of the TM
    Act, 1999. In view of the above and as per the plaintiff&#x27;s own
    pleadings, there is no cause of action that has arisen against
    the defendant no. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                     (C). Arguments of Plaintiff on Merits

</p><p id="p_28">59. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff has vehemently opposed the
    application of the defendant no. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_29">60.At the outset, it is submitted that the defendant no. 1 cannot
    take the defense of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_26">Section 30</a> (3) of the Act since the
    Defendant as per its own defense is not selling the goods on
    its platform by itself. The defendant no. 1 claims to be a B2B
    (Business to Business) platform and an intermediary under the
    <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_27">Information Technology Act</a>, 2000, though such claims are
    denied by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_30">61.It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_28">section 29</a> of the
    Act lays down the situations when the acts of a party are
    considered as infringement of a registered trade mark. <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_29">Section
    29(1)</a> of the Act reads that &quot;a registered trade mark is
    infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or
    a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of
    trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar
    to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of
    which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                     Page No. 27 of 64</span>
     render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as
    a trade mark.&quot; By virtue of this section, a person who is not
    the registered proprietor or a permitted user of a trade mark,
    will be liable for infringement of a registered trade mark of
    the registered proprietor.
</p>
<p id="p_31">62. Expounding his arguments further, Ld. Counsel for the
    plaintiff submitted that <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_30">section 30</a> of the Act is an exemption
    and provides defense to an infringement action in certain
    cases. As per <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_31">Section 30</a> (3) of the Act, if the goods bearing a
    registered trade mark are lawfully acquired by a person, then
    the sale of such goods in the market is not infringement, if the
    goods bearing the registered trade mark are put in the market
    by the registered proprietor or with the consent of the
    registered proprietor.       Therefore, in order to avail the
    exemption under <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_32">Section 30</a> (3) of the Act the defendant has
    to establish firstly that the defendant is using the trade mark of
    the registered proprietor (herein PRESTIGE) and is not a
    registered proprietor or permitted user of the same, and
    secondly that the defendant is selling the goods which have
    been lawfully acquired, and thirdly that the registered
    proprietor (herein TTK Prestige) has put the goods in the
    market with its consent, in the present case consent to sell the
    goods on online platforms including on www.udaan.com.
</p>
<p id="p_32">63.Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff deeply dwelt on the aspect of
    lawful acquisition It is submitted that an essential ingredient
    to be satisfied to avail <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_33">Section 30(3)</a> defense is the &#x27;lawful
    acquisition&#x27; of the goods. In the present case, the goods being
    sold by the defendant no. 1 on its platform are not lawfully
    acquired since there is no consent of the plaintiff. The plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 28 of 64</span>
     has produced agreements with its distributors and dealers with
    specific clause that these distributors/sub dealers will not sell
    the plaintiff&#x27;s goods on e-commerce websites without
    permission from the plaintiff and the clause 3.10 on Page 12
    and clause 4.8 on Page. 25 of annexures to application for
    summary judgment are self-speaking of the matter. In view of
    the said clauses, the goods which are being sold on the
    platform of the defendant no. 1 cannot be considered as
    lawfully acquired by it.
</p>
<p id="p_33">64. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that in order to establish
    that these goods are not lawfully acquired, it has to be first
    established that the Distributorship Agreement entered into by
    the plaintiff are not valid contract and are unlawful. It is
    submitted that agreements such as the Distributorship
    Agreements of the plaintiff, which impose certain conditions
    on the trade, are valid agreements and negative covenants
    with positive covenants during the subsistence of a contract
    would not be regarded as a restraint of trade unless the same
    is completely one-sided. On this aspect reliance has been
    placed on <a href="/doc/50131131/" id="a_34">Ozone Spa Pvt. Ltd. vs. Pure Fitness and Others</a>
    2015 (63) PTC 505 (Del) placing emphasis on paras 32, 33,
    34(i) of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_34">65. Carrying forward the above argument, Ld. Counsel for the
    plaintiff submitted that in the present case, the issue whether
    the goods sold on the platform of defendant no. 1 have been
    lawfully acquired and the same are without the consent of the
    plaintiff is a mixed question of fact as well as law which can
    only be proved in trial and not at this stage. This requires
    summoning of witnesses from both the sides including the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 29 of 64</span>
     sellers, distributors and dealers who have sold the goods to the
    defendant to prove the inter se relationship of the defendant
    no. 1 and these parties, business arrangement in acquiring the
    goods in question and whether the goods are genuine and with
    consent of the Plaintiff etc. Therefore, oral evidence cannot be
    dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_35">66.Next, the Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff dwelt on the concept of
    the defendant no. 1 being an intermediary. It is submitted by
    the Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff that even otherwise, the
    defendant herein cannot take the defense of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_35">section 30(3)</a> as it
    has taken the defense of being an intermediary under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_36">IT
    Act</a> 2000, which is apparent in para 6 (a) of the written
    statement. The defense of <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_37">section 30</a> (3) and being an
    intermediary are contrary to each other as <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_38">Section 30(3)</a> is
    available to a seller as evident from the section itself,
    reproduced hereinbelow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            &quot;(3) Where the goods bearing a registered trade
            mark are lawfully acquired by a person, the sale
            of the goods in the market or otherwise dealing in
            those goods by that person or by a person
            claiming under or through him is not
            infringement of a trade by reason only of--(a) the
            registered trade mark having been assigned by the
            registered proprietor to some other person, after
            the acquisition of those goods; or (b) the goods
            having been put on the market under the
            registered trade mark by the proprietor or with his
            consent....&quot;

<p id="p_36">67.Reliance has been placed upon <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_39">Amazon Seller Services Pvt.
    Ltd. vs. Amway India Pvt. Ltd. and Ors</a>. (2020 SCC OnLine
    Del 454) citing in particular Paras 141 and 145 stating that
    Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of High Court of Delhi has already

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 30 of 64</span>
     held that the said issue has to be decided only in trial. It is
    submitted that the fact whether Defendant No. 1 will be
    allowed to sell the genuine goods on its platform will depend
    upon whether Defendant No. 1 is an intermediary or not. If
    defendant no. 1 is not an intermediary, then all the liabilities
    of <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_40">Section 29</a> in connivance with sellers/ distributors will fall
    upon the Defendant No. 1 including the damages which has
    been caused to the plaintiff. This issue can only be decided in
    trial and the oral evidence of witnesses cannot be dispensed
    with.
</p>
<p id="p_37">68.Challenging the argument of the defendant no. 1 as regards
    non-impleading the dealers/distributors who have allegedly
    committed the breach of agreement and therefore has no
    prospects in succeeding in the suit, Ld. Counsel for the
    plaintiff stated that such argument is fallacious as non-
    impleadment of distributors/dealers does not absolve the
    defendant no. 1 from its liability of infringement under the
    Act as well as under the <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_41">Information Technology Act</a>. The
    case of the plaintiff is that the defendant no. 1 is inducing
    breach of contract and committing infringement in connivance
    with other sellers on its platform. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of
    Delhi in the judgment of Amazon Sellers (supra) has held that
    issue of inducement to breach of contract is an issue which
    can be decided only in a trial. The Plaintiff cannot be deprived
    of its right to summon the sellers as witnesses, cross-examine
    them including cross-examination of defendant no. 1&#x27;s
    witnesses to prove the inter se business relationship of the
    defendant no. 1 with the sellers, role of the defendant no. 1 in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 31 of 64</span>
     breach of such contracts as well as the damages which have
    been caused to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_38">69. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the judgments cited
    by the defendant no. 1 are distinguishable. The defendant no.
    1 has not established as to why the oral evidence ought to be
    dispensed with and nothing is required to be established in the
    trial with respect to lawful acquisition of the goods and
    consent of the plaintiff. The judgment relied upon by the
    defendant no. 1 does not help the case of the defendant and
    are distinguishable.
</p>
<p id="p_39">70. It is submitted that the judgment of <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_42">Kapil Wadhwa vs
    Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd</a>. 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5172 is
    distinguishable as admittedly, the defendants were importing
    genuine goods; there was no plea that the defendants were
    selling counterfeit goods or there was an impairment with the
    goods; it was not a case of sale on online market place; the
    defendants had not taken the defense of being intermediaries.
</p>
<p id="p_40">71. Distinguishing the case of Samsung Electronics (supra) it is
    submitted that the said suit had been disposed of by the Ld.
    Single Judge vide its order dated 16.01.2018 since the Ld.
    Single Judge has categorically recorded the admission on the
    part of the plaintiff that the defendant were importing genuine
    goods and it&#x27;s a pure question of law and nothing was
    required to be proved in trial. This is not the situation here.
</p>
<p id="p_41">72.As regards the distinguishing aspect of <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_43">Amazon Seller
    Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. Amway India Pvt. Ltd. and others</a>- 2020
    SCC OnLine Del 454 It has been submitted that in that case

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 32 of 64</span>
     pleadings with respect to trade mark registration or
    proprietorship rights and hence the case of trade mark
    infringement was not made out. On the other hand, in the
    present case the plaintiff has enlisted its trade mark
    registrations and has also pleaded infringement of trade mark.
    The Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench has held that the issue of
    intermediaries and the breach of agreements are issues to be
    decided in trial. It is further pertinent to mention herein that
    all the judgments cited by the defendant no. 1 acknowledge
    the fact of lawful acquisition of the goods which the
    defendant has not established in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_42">73. Ld. Counsel for plaintiff also cited Tayabbhai International
    A/S vs. Hind Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. AIR 1997 SC 1240
    on the aspect of contempt under Order XXXIX Rule 2A<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44"> of the
    Code</a> and another judgment passed by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court
    of Chhatishgarh on 08.05.2015 titled as Mile Stone Soft Tech
    Pvt. Ltd. vs. Nidhi Chhiber on <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_45">Contempt of Court Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_43">74. Responding to the submissions of the defendant no. 2, Ld.
    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that though it has not filed
    any application for summary judgment, it has adopted the
    arguments of the defendant no. 1 and has raised various
    grounds viz. the defendant being a logistics company is not
    involved in sale or purchase of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods under the
    trade mark PRESTIGE and that the activities of defendant no.
    2 are not covered under the ambit of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_46">Section 29</a> of the Act and
    thus no cause of action exists against defendant no. 2. The
    same are not tenable as the defendant no. 2 is a 100% owned
    subsidiary of defendant no. 1 and is acting in collusion with
    defendant no.1 to provide transport, storage, logistics services
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 33 of 64</span>
     to the users registered on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform.
    Reference is made to para 5 of the Replication filed by the
    plaintiff to the Written Statement filed by defendant no. 2. The
    role of the defendant no. 2 and its involvement in the
    infringing activities can only be decided at the trial and the
    defendant no. 2 cannot take shelter and seek summary
    judgment without going to trial. On this aspect reliance is
    again placed on Amazon Seller Services (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_44">75.In view of the above facts and circumstances the Defendants
    have not established a case of summary judgment and the
    present application is liable to be dismissed with costs.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                   Rebuttal Arguments of Defendant No. 1</span>

<p id="p_45">76.In rebuttal, Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1 made
    submissions to refute the arguments of plaintiff and
    distinguished the case law propounded by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_46">77.It is submitted that the plaintiff&#x27;s reliance on the judgment of
    the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in
    <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_47">Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Amway India Enterprises
    Pvt. Ltd</a>.(supra) is entirely misconceived. The said judgment
    does not stand for the proposition that even a case where the
    most basic particulars of the claim are not made out and the
    Court does not even have the benefit of the contract of which
    breach is alleged must be sent to trial. The Hon&#x27;ble High
    Court merely stated that whether &quot;in fact any of the online
    platforms induced a breach of contract between the DSE and
    its ABOs/sellers is at best a matter of evidence, and not of
    inference&quot;. However, in the present case, even the contract
    whose breach is alleged is not filed and the party which has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 34 of 64</span>
     breached the contract is not before the Court. In such a case,
    the plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on this claim
    of inducement of breach of contract and there is no
    compelling reason for this claim to proceed to trial

</p><p id="p_47">78.Responding to the plaintiff&#x27;s stand on the issue of exhaustion,
    Ld. Counsel for the defendant no. 1 submitted that the
    plaintiff argued that due to the contractual restriction on the
    dealers/distributors of the plaintiff against selling the
    plaintiff&#x27;s products via e-commerce, even genuine goods of
    the plaintiff sold on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform are
    unauthorized and are not lawfully acquired. The response of
    the defendant no. 1 is that any contractual restriction
    prohibiting a buyer of goods from alienating those goods once
    title has passed is contrary to law. However, even assuming
    that such a contractual restriction is valid, the lawfulness of
    the acquisition of goods cannot be affected by a subsequent
    sale. Since the plaintiff has categorically admitted that title in
    its goods passes to its dealers/distributors, and that the goods
    listed on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform which are relevant for this
    application are genuine goods, the plaintiff cannot claim that
    an acquisition which was lawful at the time it was made
    subsequently becomes unlawful due to further sale. At most,
    the plaintiff may allege that such further sale amounts to a
    breach of contract by its dealers/distributors. However, this
    has no bearing on the doctrine of exhaustion of trademark
    rights or the effect of Section 30(3) of the Trademarks Act,
    1999. Therefore, regardless of the contractual restriction
    placed by the plaintiff, once a lawful acquisition of the
    plaintiff&#x27;s goods has occurred, there is an immediate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                Page No. 35 of 64</span>
     exhaustion of the trademark rights in such goods and no case
    can be made out for trademark infringement merely on the
    ground of the contractual restriction.
</p>
<p id="p_48">79. The second limb of the plaintiff&#x27;s argument that the question
    of &quot;lawful acquisition&quot; is to be established at trial has been
    responded by submitting that the products in question have
    been lawfully acquired is based entirely on the plaintiff&#x27;s own
    categorical admissions in the plaint and documents filed along
    with the plaint. The sole fact pleaded in the plaint to allege
    that the acquisition of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods was &#x27;unlawful&#x27; is
    that the Plaintiff has not consented to sale of such goods on
    defendant No. 1&#x27;s platform. However, even assuming that
    such lack of consent is true and is valid in law, it does not
    dilute the effect of Section 30(3) of the Trademarks Act, 1999
    and does not provide any cause of action for a claim of
    trademark infringement. There is therefore no question that
    remains to be tried with respect to the issue of &#x27;lawful
    acquisition&#x27; Reliance on the Order dated 26.02.2018 passed
    by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in <a href="/doc/109397105/" id="a_48">Samsung Electronics
    Company v. Kapil Wadhwa, CS(OS</a>) 1155/2011 is reiterated.

<p id="p_49">80.Responding to the plaintiff&#x27;s argument that defendant no. 2
   cannot take the benefit of <a href="/doc/371543/" id="a_49">section 30(3)</a>, since for invoking

   be used in the course of trade it as plaintiff has sued the
   defendant on the basis that they have connived with the sellers,
   while the defendants takes the defence of an intermediary and
   the defendant no. 1 seems to be fighting the case and taking
   the defence on behalf of its sellers, it is submitted that this


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 36 of 64</span>
    argument is an admission that the defendant is not engaged in
   any infringing act and the claim fails on this basis alone. It is
   also submitted that the argument exposes a fatal flaw in the
   plaintiff&#x27;s case that they have not impleaded the sellers as a
   party to the case. The plaintiff seems to be taking advantage of
   its own wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_50">81. The next argument of the plaintiff which is refuted by the
   defendant no. 1 is regarding whether or not the defendant is an
   intermediary is a question of trial. In response it has been
   submitted that <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_52">section 79</a> of the IT Act, 2000 is only a defence
   to liability. Without infringement of trademark being
   established, there is no question of liability. Hence, defendant&#x27;s
   intermediary status is irrelevant to deciding as to whether the
   plaintiff has established infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_51">82.In conclusion and to sum-up, it is submitted on behalf of the
   defendant no. 2 that the above submissions establish that a
   significant part of the plaintiff&#x27;s claim relates to sale of
   genuine goods originating from the plaintiff which are being
   sold on defendant no. 1&#x27;s platform without the plaintiff&#x27;s
   authority. This conclusion flows from the categorical
   admissions made by the plaintiff in the plaint and documents
   filed along with the plaint. The offer to sell or sale of genuine
   goods originating from the trademark proprietor without the
   trademark proprietor&#x27;s consent does not amount to trademark
   infringement or passing off, even if the trademark owner has
   sold the goods to its distributors/dealers with the condition that
   they will not sell the products through the e-commerce mode
   without its consent. This conclusion is based on the express
   language of Section 30(3) of the TM Act, binding precedents
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 37 of 64</span>
    interpreting this provision, and the doctrine of exhaustion of
   trademark rights that is well-settled across common law
   jurisdictions.
</p>
<p id="p_52">83.It is then stated that it is evident that the plaintiff has no real
   prospect of succeeding on the claim that the sale of genuine
   goods originating from the plaintiff on the platform of
   defendant no. 1, without the plaintiff&#x27;s authority, amounts to
   trademark infringement or passing off. There is no compelling
   reason to go to trial in this case and oral evidence is not
   required to be adduced in this case. It is also stated that in the
   present application, the submissions made by the defendant no.
   1 are limited to the admissions made by the plaintiff itself, and
   the interpretation of Section 30(3) of the TM Act even
   assuming that all allegations made by the plaintiff are true. The
   issue to be determined is therefore a pure question of law, and
   there is no additional evidence that either the plaintiff or
   defendant no. 1 could present at trial with respect to this issue.
   The plaintiff&#x27;s claim in this respect is not even arguable, being
   directly contrary to law. There is no compelling reason for this
   claim to proceed to trial, as all the facts required to decide this
   claim are already before this Court.

   issues. These issues may be issues of facts, or issues of law. If

    disposed of by a judgment on the preliminary issue, more
   pertinently, if such issue pertains to jurisdiction of the Court or
   a bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in force.
   It has been so provided under Order XIV Rule 2<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_53"> of the Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_56">86.But this is not the only exit gate for a lis. If a party fails to
   present written statement called for by the Court, a judgment
   may be pronounced against it under Order VIII Rule 10<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54"> of the
   Code</a>. Order VII Rule 11 provides for rejection of plaint, if one
   or more of the grounds stated therein are attracted. A judgment
   on admissions can be passed in accordance with Order XII
   Rule 6<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55"> of the Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_57">87.So, as the scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_56"> of the Code</a> shows, that trial is procedure,
   which must be followed as ritual, invariably in all the cases, as
   a rule of thumb, is not the correct interpretation. In appropriate
   cases, if the requisite conditions are met with, a litigation may
   be shown the exit door in accordance with the law.
</p>
<p id="p_58">88.The concept of summary judgment as enshrined in the Order
   XIIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure and applicable only in
   respect of a commercial suit is of a recent origin with the
   enactment of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. It is a unique
   provision, so far having no sibling in any other statute.
</p>
<p id="p_59">89.On a cursory examination, it may appear that the summary
   judgment is akin to &#x27;judgment on admission&#x27; under Order XII
   Rule 6<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure or a &#x27;default judgment&#x27;
   under Order VIII Rule 1<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_58"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure or in
   some way similar to the &#x27;summary procedure&#x27; under Order
   XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure. A careful scrutiny of
   the provision reveals that it is in fact quite different from these

    provisions. It is an independent provision, self-contained in
   itself having characteristic distinctions vis-Ã -vis the other
   provisions cited above.
</p>
<p id="p_60">90.In the judgment of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Vs. K. S.
   Infraspace LLP reported as 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1311, the
   Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has been pleased to hold that
   &quot;keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment
   of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure
   provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and
   the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully
   interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to
   benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade
   and commerce which in turn will further economic growth of
   the country.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_61">91.It is the duty of the Court to show an exit door to a litigation
   without following the entire ritual of trial, if the same can be
   done within four corners of the law. It is, in fact, a duty
   incumbent upon the Court to resort to all such measures, in
   accordance with the law to curtail the dockets explosion. This
   situation can be best illustrated by quoting the following poem

<p id="p_62">92.The provision of Summary Judgment gives a right of any party
   to a commercial dispute instituted under the Commercial
   Courts Act, 2015 to get a claim decided in its favour without
   going through the process of recording the oral evidence. It is

    an effective tool for deciding cases where it can be clearly
   demonstrated that a trial is unnecessary. In various quarters
   this provision has been labelled as a &#x27;blunt instrument&#x27; that can
   abruptly terminate litigation. However, as the case law
   jurisprudence that has developed on this subject has
   recognized it is a tool that allows Courts to weed out cases that
   do not need a trial to be resolved, and the precious time of the
   Courts can be utilized fruitfully by focusing on the areas of
   actual dispute, which require particular attention. The Superior
   Courts, in a catena of case law, have strictly interpreted this
   provision so that the rule does not deprive the parties of their
   innings in the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_63">93.All commercial disputes are covered under the provision of
   Order XIIIA with only one exception i.e. the cases originally
   instituted under the summary procedure under Order XXXVII
   of the Code of Civil Procedure, in which case this provision
   cannot be invoked.
</p>
<p id="p_64">94.The right to get a summary judgment can be claimed by any of
   the parties to a commercial dispute and this window is not
   open all the times. It is open from any stage after the service of
   summons of the suit upon the defendant till the stage of the
   framing of the issues. Once the issues have been framed, the
   window gets closed for good. It has been so expounded in the

   Bizcraft LLP &amp; Anr</a> 2017 SCC OnLine Del 6394.
</p>
<p id="p_65">95.There are four ways in which the claims can be decided by
   way of a summary judgment. Firstly, the entire claim of either
   of the parties; secondly, a part of claim of either of the parties;

<p id="p_67">96.A Court may give a summary judgment against any party to a
   commercial dispute on two grounds. These two grounds have
   been joined by the word &#x27;and&#x27; connoting that both the grounds
   must exist together and simultaneously. The first ground is that
   the Court considers that the plaintiff has no real prospect of
   succeeding on the claim or that the defendant has no real
   prospect of successfully defending the claim. The second
   ground is that there is no other compelling reason why the
   claim should not be disposed of before recording of oral
   evidence.

</p>
<p id="p_70">99.Thus, while undertaking the task of considering a case or a
   claim for summary judgment, is indeed a task which must
   weigh and evaluate a host of factors. This situation can be
   aptly described by referring to the Verse 17 from Chapter 4 of
   Bhagvad Gita, which reads that &quot;à¤à¤°à¤°à¤£à¤£ à¤¹à¤ªà¤ª à¤¬à¤£à¤¦à¤µà¤¯à¤¯ , à¤¬à¤£à¤¦à¤µà¤¯à¤¯ à¤

   logic for an action must be known, so also the logic for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                              Page No. 44 of 64</span>
    inaction and that the logic for a prohibited action must also be
   known, therefore the practice of &#x27;karma&#x27; is profound.
</p>
<p id="p_71">100.    An application for summary judgment has three aspects
   viz. the factual submissions; the legal submissions; and the
   documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_72">101.    While dealing with an application for summary judgment
   the Courts must consider certain factors. The following factors
   have been culled out from various judgments--
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        (i). Whether the claimant has a &quot;realistic&quot; as opposed
        to a &quot;fanciful&quot; prospect of success? Swain v. Hillman
        MANU/UKWA/0649/1999: [2001] 1 All ER 91. A
        &quot;realistic&quot; claim is one that carries some degree of
        conviction. This means a claim that is more than
        merely arguable. ED &amp; F Man Liquid Products v.
        Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8].
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        (ii). Court must not take at face value and without
        analysis everything that a claimant says in his
        submissions before the Court. ED &amp; F Man Liquid
        Products v. Patel (supra).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        (iii). Court must take into account not only the
        evidence actually placed before it, but also the
        evidence that can reasonably be expected to be
        available at trial. Royal Brompton Hospital NHS
        Trust v. Hammond (No 5) [2001] EWCA Civ 550

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">        (iv). The Court must be satisfied that there is no
        genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 45 of 64</span>
         or defence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        (v). It is not enough simply to argue that the case
        should be allowed to go to trial because something
        may turn up which would have a bearing on the
        question of construction. ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers
        Ltd. v. TTE Training Ltd. [2007] EWCA Civ. 725

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">        (vi). Summary judgment ought to be refused if there
        were compelling reasons to conduct a trial.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">        (vii). Court has to strike a balance between a fair trial
        and expedition.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">102.    In this context the case of the plaintiff has to be considered
   for grant of a summary judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_74">103.    The scope and ambit of a summary judgment aspect
   having been considered, I would not analyze the specific
   objections of the plaintiff to the consideration of the instant
   application.
</p>
<p id="p_75">104.    The first objection of the plaintiff that the limited issue on
   which the defendant no. 1 has been seeking summary
   judgment is the subject matter of the appeal being FAO
   (COMM) 519/2019. This Court, at two occasions, has taken a
   prima facie view in favour of the plaintiff by way of ex-parte
   injunction dt. 15.10.2019 and bi-parte injunction dated
   25.10.2019. In fact, the scope of an injunction application vis-
   Ã -vis a summary judgment is quite different and there is no
   room for overlapping. While an injunction is subject matter of
   interlocutory jurisdiction and based on prima-facie view, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 46 of 64</span>
    summary judgment pertains to final reckoning in a suit on the
   entire claim or a part of the claim. Both operate for different
   reasons and objectives. Hence, I do not find any force in this
   plea.
</p>
<p id="p_76">105.    The other two aspects pressed into service viz. whether the
   goods sold on the platform of defendant no. 1 have been
   lawfully acquired and the same are without the consent of the
   plaintiff; and whether the defendant is of defendant no. 1 is an
   intermediary, would be discussed in the course of the
   consideration of this application.
</p>
<p id="p_77">106.    Thus, the summary judgment application as presented is
   maintainable in the eyes of law. Whether, the same can be
   eventually allowed is a different matter altogether. This
   requires the sifting of the factual and legal aspects argued by
   the parties and tested on the touchstone of the various criteria
   stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_78">107.    The pleadings of the case have crystallized and the
   respective parties have produced all the documents in their
   power and possession. It cannot be lost sight of the fact that in
   commercial matters in the present business milieu the evidence
   primarily constitutes to be documentary one and the scope of
   oral evidence is limited, if not altogether ruled out. The
   admission and denial of documents is also a step in lending
   further credibility to the documents by the adversary. This also
   reduces the scope for oral evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_79">108.    The plaintiff has put various violations on the part of the

             covenants during the subsistence of a contact
             be it of employment, partnership, commerce,
             agency or the like, would not normally be
             regarded as being in restraint of

             to do business in the same field as the
             employer would be in restraint of trade and,
             therefore, a stipulation to this effect in the
             contract would be void. In other words, no
             employee can be confronted with the

             present employer or be forced to idleness;

              profession or not, the courts take a stricter
             view in employer-employee contracts than in
             other contracts, such as partnership
             contracts, collaboration contracts, franchise
             contracts, agency/distributorship contracts,
             commercial contracts. The reason being that
             in the latter kind of contracts, the parties are
             expected to have dealt with each other on
             more or less an equal footing, whereas in
             employer- employee contracts, the norm is
             that the employer has an advantage over the
             employee and it is quite often the case that

             the question of whether the restraint is
             partial or complete is not required to be
             considered at all whenever an issue arises as
             to whether a particular term of a contract is

<p id="p_83">112.    In my view, the judgment has relied upon by the plaintiff
   on an all-together different context than the one that is in
   question there. The case-law cited by the plaintiff does not lay
   down that the any such agreement binds the third parties too.
   The question in this case is whether an agreement between the
   plaintiff and its distributors/dealers cannot bind a third person.
   The answer is squarely a big No. The agreements between the
   plaintiff and its distributors/dealers are &#x27;in personam&#x27; and not
   &#x27;in rem&#x27;. They do not have any force to bind the world at large.
   Thus, various rights and obligations defined in various
   agreements between the plaintiff and its distributors/dealers
   are enforceable between the parties to the agreement inter-se
   only and cannot bind any third person or the world at large.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                  Page No. 51 of 64</span>
<p id="p_84"> 113.    Further, these agreements define the corresponding rights
   and liabilities between the plaintiff and its distributors/dealers.
   Admittedly, these parties are not joined in the suit. No
   damages have been claimed against them. Who are these
   parties (distributors/dealers) is conspicuous by absence. How
   their acts or omissions can impinge upon the defendants is also
   not explained.
</p>
<p id="p_85">114.    The liability on the defendants can either be fastened by
   virtue of a contract or by virtue of the operation of the law. Of
   course, there being no express or ostensible privity of contract
   between the plaintiff and the defendants, there being a
   contractual obligation of the defendants does not arise. Even
   presuming for the sake of argument that the defendants do
   attract a liability, the moot question is whether it can be
   imposed when the principal obligators viz. distributors/dealers
   of plaintiff have not been sued and given a go-bye.
</p>
<p id="p_86">115.    Thus, the obligation of the defendants can only be searched
   for in the realm of law. The moot question here is whether the
   law imposes any obligations upon the defendants herein to
   which they are answerable, without reference to any contract
   whatsoever. If the law has imposed certain obligations, the
   question       of       any   contractual   obligation   fades      into
   insignificance.

   law of torts termed a law of unfair competition. It originated as
   the common law, but many aspects of the same have been
   given a statutory recognition. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_70">The Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 sails

   <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_79">Section 30</a> of the Act lists down limits on the effect of

             further sale may be debatable as infringement
            of a trade mark, but there can be no further

            and this would not be legislation by the Court,
            we revisit sub section (3). It can be broken into
            three segments; (i) goods bearing a registered

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">            (ii) the sale of the goods in the market by that

</blockquote><p id="p_92">121.    As the doctrine of exhaustion goes, in the product
   distribution chain, a trademark right is typically exhausted by
   the first sale of good or placing the same in market. The
   trademark owner or others with the consent of the owner have
   no right to prevent or prohibit others from reselling or using
   the product. The basic principle of this doctrine is that once the
   right holder has been able to obtain economic return from the
   first sale or placing in the market, the purchaser or transferee
   of the goods or services is entitled to use or dispose it off
   without any further restriction.
</p>
<p id="p_93">122.    The doctrine of exhaustion focuses on properly balancing
   the interests of the trademark owners vis-Ã -vis the product
   owners. Exhaustion of rights is linked to the distribution right.
   The right to distribute objects means that such objects is
   released by or with the consent of the owner as a result of the
   transfer of ownership. However, the owner does not lose all
   extensions of the trademark right. The bond between the
   trademark and the product cannot be severed. If a legally
   obtained product damages a trademark&#x27;s intrinsic values,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                                 Page No. 58 of 64</span>
    including distinctiveness and goodwill, during reprocessing
   and reselling, it may still infringe the owner&#x27;s exclusive right
   to use the trademark. In the instant case, in respect of the
   genuine goods sold unauthorizedly, there is no such allegation,
   though a averment of this nature in reference to the other
   categories of goods may be available to the plaintiff, in line
   with the pleadings, crystallized on record.
</p>
<p id="p_94">123.    The defendant no. 2 has sought summary judgment only
   vis-Ã -vis the goods about which the categorical stand of the
   plaintiff is that they are genuine goods carving out only an
   exception that the same have been put up for sale
   unauthorizedly, in violation of the agreements. I have
   considerably dealt with the latter aspect. I do not subscribe to
   the argument of the plaintiff that the question of &quot;lawful
   acquisition&quot; is to be established at trial by leading evidence. In
   the instant case, even the contract whose breach is alleged is
   not filed and the party which has breached the contract is not
   before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_95">124.    A plain and meaningful reading of the plaint leaves no
   room for the doubt. There is clear averment in the plaint about
   various categories of goods. One of the such categories is
   &#x27;genuine goods&#x27; but being sold in a &#x27;unlawful&#x27; manner as the
   plaintiff has not consented to sale of such goods on defendant
   no. 1&#x27;s platform. The scheme of section 30(3) of the TM Act,
   1999 leaves no scope for any such stipulation and the same is
   therefore non-est in the eyes of the law. The objection is thus
   bereft of any legal force as there can be no estoppel against the
   law.

<p id="p_96"> 125.    Now coming to the aspect of &#x27;Ã­ntermediary&#x27; status of the
   defendant no. 1. This status emanates from <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_84">section 79</a> of the
   Information Technology Act, 2000. As the language of that
   section goes, it is simply a defence to liability. This
   provision is a safe harbour provision for intermediaries, to
   save them from liability for third party information on their
   websites.
</p>
<p id="p_97">126.    According to <a href="/doc/2959282/" id="a_85">section 79(1)</a>, any intermediary that complies
   with the provisions mentioned in <a href="/doc/90266491/" id="a_86">Sections 79(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/117237824/" id="a_87">79(3)</a>
   shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or
   communication link made available or hosted by him. Specific
   reference must be made to <a href="/doc/32152002/" id="a_88">Section 79(2)(b)</a> which states that
   to gain safe harbour protection, the intermediary must not (i)
   initiate the transmission; (ii) select the receiver of the
   transmission; and (iii) select or modify the information
   contained in the transmission and pursuant to <a href="/doc/117237824/" id="a_89">Section 79(3)</a>
   must observe due diligence while discharging its duties.

   Court of Delhi in <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_90">Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. Amway
   India Enterprises Pvt. Ltd</a>.(supra) covers the aspect of
   intermediaries from para 136 onwards. This case, more
   particularly the para 141, has been read by the plaintiff to
   argue that whenever a question of an entity being an
   intermediary arises the only recourse is a trial. In my view, this
   is not the correct interpretation of the judgment by the
   plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff has been attempting to read this
   para of the judgment in a perspective which is neither intended
   nor warranted.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">CS (Comm.) No. 2480/2019                               Page No. 60 of 64</span>

   (1996 (6) SCC 44) it has been held that &quot;in order to understand
   and appreciate the binding force of a decision is always
   necessary to see what were the facts in the case in which the
   decision was given and what was the point which had to be
   decided. No judgment can be read as if it is a statute. A word
   or a clause or a sentence in the judgment cannot be regarded as
   a full exposition of law. Law cannot afford to be static and
   therefore, Judges are to employ an intelligent in the use of
   precedents.&quot; <a href="/doc/681866/" id="a_92">In Deepak Bajaj vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; ANR</a>
   AIR 2008 SC 1935 It is well settled that a judgment of a Court
   is not to be read mechanically as a Euclid&#x27;s theorem nor as if it
   was a statute.
</p>
<p id="p_100">129.    In para 141 of the Amazon&#x27;s judgment (supra), it is held
   that, &quot;given the disputed questions of fact that emerges from
   the pleadings in the suit, it is obvious that the issues of whether
   an entity is an intermediary or not can be decided only after
   trial.&quot; This finding is only in reference to the cases under
   consideration in the judgment of <a href="/doc/190489477/" id="a_93">Amazon Seller Services Pvt.
   Ltd. vs. Amway India Enterprises Pvt. Ltd</a>.(supra) and not of
   universal application. In each particular case, the relevant
   pleadings shall hold the day to decide whether it should go to
   trial or not.
</p>
<p id="p_101">130.    Therefore, in the present case, in the particular set of facts,
   that too admitted facts, and read in conjunction with virtue of
   the operation of law based on the doctrine of exhaustion, there
   is no question of infringement in that particular nature of the
   transaction wherein the genuine goods of the plaintiff are put
   up for sale. For want of infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s

    trademark the question of liability becomes non-est. Therefore,
   in this matrix of facts, the defendant&#x27;s status as an intermediary
   or otherwise is inconsequential, though it may be relevant in
   the context of other types of transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_102">131.    In this matrix of facts, the plaintiff has no real prospect of
   succeeding on this claim of inducement of breach of contract
   and there is no compelling reason for this claim to proceed to
   trial. Any oral evidence, which the plaintiff is contemplating of
   leading, would only be a superfluous exercise. No evidence,
   which is contrary to the pleadings can be allowed to be
   adduced. Thus, contemplating that by some iota of evidence
   the tables may turn is nothing but a wishful thinking without
   any legal basis. If the argument of plaintiff on this count is
   accepted it would lead to a situation which has explained by
   Ogden Nash, in his poem &quot;One Times One Is Eight&quot; as under:-

   no warrant for proposition that in view of the settled position
   of law, the application of the defendant no. 1 deserves to be
   allowed. There is no compelling reason for this claim to
   proceed to trial, as all the facts required to decide the particular
   claim have crystallized in the pleadings and is an admitted
   position by the plaintiff from which it cannot take a &#x27;U&#x27; turn
