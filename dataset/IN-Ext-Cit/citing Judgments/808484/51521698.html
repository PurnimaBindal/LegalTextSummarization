</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.This writ petition is filed challenging Ext.P32, the

 proceedings of the District Collector, confirming a

 sale conducted in terms of the provisions of the

 <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_1">Revenue Recovery Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">2.Petitioner was a dealer in laboratory glassware and

 was an assessee under the KGST Act.   He had defaulted

 the tax due under the Act and finally, revenue

 recovery proceedings were initiated and Exts.P1 and

 P2 demand notices were issued on 16.10.2008 for

 recovery of Rs.4.22 crores.        This was based on

 Exts.P3 and P4 assessment orders for the years 1999-

 2000 and 2000-01.    Petitioner filed appeals before

 the statutory appellate authority which were rejected

 by Ext.P5 order.   Although the petitioner had filed

 further appeals before the Tribunal, there was no

 stay   and  as   a   result,   the   revenue   recovery

 proceedings continued.     Finally, 44 cents of land

 belonging to the petitioner, comprised in Survey

 No.380/1-1  in  Avanavancherry   Village,   Chirayinkil

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>




 Taluk was attached by the recovery authorities on

 1.12.2008.   In spite of it, payment was not made and

 finally, on 6.1.2009, notice under <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_2">section 49</a> of the

 Revenue Recovery Act was issued fixing sale of the

 property on 10.2.2009.     On that day, for want of

 sufficient    bidders,   sale   was   adjourned   and

 thereafter, fresh notice was issued scheduling the

 sale on 23.3.2009.  On that day, there were 7 bidders

 and although the upset price fixed was Rs.8.8 lakhs,

 the highest bid submitted was for Rs.11.5 lakhs.

 That offer made by the 6th respondent, being the

 highest, was accepted and he deposited 30% of the bid

 amount.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">3.Subsequently, the   petitioner's power  of  attorney

 holder submitted Ext.P7 application dated 22.4.2009

 to the 7th respondent seeking to set aside the sale

 and that application was rejected by Ext.P8 order.

 Thereafter,   wife  of  the  petitioner  made  Ext.P9

 application dated 25.6.2009 to the Revenue Divisional

 Officer seeking to set aside the sale.  The RDO heard

 his wife but orders were not passed. In the mean

 while, the Tribunal, before which the appeals filed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3</span>




 against Ext.P5, disposed of the appeals by Ext.P15

 order dated 18.10.2010.    By this order, the appeals

 were allowed and the Sales Tax Officer was directed

 to    issue  revised assessment orders.     Petitioner

 forwarded this order to the second respondent under

 cover of Ext.P16 representation.   In the mean while,

 in compliance with Ext.P15 order of the Tribunal, the

 Sales Tax Officer issued Exts.P18 and P19 revised

 assessment    orders,  reducing  the   tax   liability

 considerably.     In pursuance of Exts.P18 and P19

 revised assessment orders, the 4th respondent issued

 Ext.P21 communication under <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_3">section 69(6)</a> of the

 Revenue Recovery Act on 30.10.2010 itself seeking

 recovery of Rs.4,52,864/-.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4. Despite the appellate order and the reduction in the

 tax liability of the petitioner, rejecting Ext.P9

 application submitted by the wife of the petitioner,

 the second respondent confirmed the sale by Ext.P22

 order dated 30.9.2010.    On service of the order, on

 16.11.2010,    the  petitioner filed   W.P(C).34582/10

 before this Court and in fact, in spite of Ext.P22,

 on 15.1.2010, W.P(C).34428/10 was filed by the 6th

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>




 respondent seeking early confirmation of the sale in

 its favour. In W.P(C).34582/10, this Court passed

 order dated 19.11.2010 staying further proceedings

 pursuant to Ext.P22, confirming sale in favour of the

 6th respondent.       Subsequently, both the writ petitions

 came up together for final hearing and were disposed

 of by Ext.P24 judgment, setting aside Ext.P22 and

 directing the District Collector to pass fresh orders

 after hearing the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5. The operative portion of Ext.P24 reads thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        5. Heard counsel appearing on both sides as well as
        learned Government Pleader appearing for the official
        respondents.   On te basis of instructions, learned
        Government Pleader submitted that, Ext.P9 petition
        was pending consideration and disposal before the 3rd
        respondent when Ext.P23 order of confirmation was
        issued.    Under the above circumstances, I am
        constrained to observe that the order of confirmation
        was issued without disposing Ext.P9 application filed
        seeking to set aside the sale. Counsel representing the
        auction purchaser had raised an objection to the effect
        that, Ext.P9 was not submitted before the proper
        authority and that the said petition was filed not within
        the time stipulated under Section 52 and 53 of the
        Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. But I take note of the

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>




        fact that, confirmation of the sale was done behind the
        back of the petitioner at a time when Ext.P9 petition
        submitted by him was pending disposal.       It is also
        pertinent to note that the 3rd respondent has
        conducted a hearing on Ext.P9 and it is stated that the
        petitioner had submitted argument notes. Therefore,
        it is evident that the confirmation of sale was issued in
        violation of principles of natural justice. Further it is
        pertinent to note that the revenue recovery requisition
        on the basis of which the sale was conducted no more
        survives.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        6. Under the above mentioned circumstances, I am of
        the view that interest of justice will be served if the
        District Collector, who is the authority concerned
        under <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_4">Section 52</a> and <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_5">53</a> of the Act, is directed to take
        a fresh decision in the matter as to whether the sale
        need be confirmed or set aside, after affording a
        reasonable opportunity to both the parties concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        7. In the result, these writ petitions are disposed of.
        Ext.P23 in W.P(C).No.34582 of 2010 is hereby quashed.
        The 3rd respondent in that case (The Revenue Divisional
        Officer) is directed to forward the entire records
        pertaining to Ext.P9 petition to the District Collector.</blockquote><p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">        The District Collector is directed to take a decision as
        to whether the sale in question need be confirmed or
        set aside, considering all aspect of the matter, in
        exercise of the powers vested under Section 51 to 54
        of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. Needless to say
        that the petitioners in both these cases shall be
        afforded with reasonable opportunity of hearing

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>




        before finalising the proceedings. The needful in this
        regard shall be done by the District Collector at the
        earliest possible, at any rate within a period of three
        months from the date of receipt of a copy of this
        judgment."
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">6.It appears that while the matter was thus pending

 consideration        of     the    District      Collector,    the

 petitioner        submitted       an     application      to   the

 Commissioner of Commercial Taxes seeking to settle

 the liability under the Amnesty Scheme as provided

 under      section    23B    of   the   KGST    Act.       To that

 representation, he got Ext.P20 reply, informing that

 since      the   revenue     sale    was   not    confirmed,   the

 liability can be settled.                Subsequently, the 4th

 respondent      issued     Ext.P26    order     dated   18.2.2011,

 permitting the petitioner to settle the liability

 under the Amnesty Scheme on payment of Rs.1,79,107/-

 before the end of March, 2011.               Taking advantage of

 Ext.P26,      the    petitioner     remitted     the    amount  on

 21.2.2011 itself and this is evident from Exts.P27

 and P28.      Since the liability was thus settled by the

 petitioner on 21.2.2011 itself, the 4th respondent

 issued      Ext.P35     communication       to   the    Tahsildar,

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>




 informing that the liability has been settled and

 therefore, the revenue Recovery requisition issued on

 27.3.2006 should be returned.    Ext.P29 is a 'no dues'

 certificate issued by the 4th respondent on 24.2.2011

 certifying that no sales tax dues are outstanding

 against     the petitioner  as  on  that  date.   This

 certificate    also states   that it   was  issued for

 producing the same before the District Collector.   In

 pursuance of the directions of this Court in Ext.P24

 judgment,     the District   Collector  issued   notice

 calling the petitioner for a hearing.      Accordingly,

 he was heard and finally, the District Collector

 issued Ext.P32 proceedings dated 20.7.2011, rejecting

 Ext.P9 and confirming the sale in favour of the 6th

 respondent.      It  is  in  these  circumstances, the

 petitioner has filed this writ petition challenging

 Ext.P32 order.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">7.The main contention raised by the counsel for the

 petitioner has that since prior to Ext.P32, the

 petitioner had settled the entire liability and    the

 requisitioning authority had withdrawn the revenue

 recovery requisition, the District Collector had no

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                           8</span>




 jurisdiction to confirm the sale.     It is also his

 case that under the provisions of section 23 B of the

 KGST Act, once a requisition is withdrawn by the

 requisitioning  authority,  the  revenue   authorities

 were bound by such communication and for that reason

 also, the confirmation of sale is illegal.



</p><p id="p_18">8.On the other hand, a counter affidavit has been filed

 by the additional 7th respondent, justifying Ext.P32

 order.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">9.In so far as the 6th respondent purchaser of the

 property is concerned, the main contention raised is

 that he being a bona fide purchaser of the property,

 irrespective  of  the  outcome  of   the  departmental

 appeal, the sale in his favour will remain unaffected

 and that therefore, he was entitled to have the sale

 confirmed in his name.   It is also his case that the

 settlement of liability in an Amnesty Scheme would

 not, by itself, invalidate a revenue sale.

 validity     of  Ext.P32  proceedings  of  the  District

 Collector.     While appreciating the rival contentions,

 this Court has to bear in mind the undisputed fact

 that Exts.P1 and P2 demands were issued based on

 Exts.P3 and P4 assessment orders for the recovery of

 Rs.4.22 crores and consequent on Ext.P15 order passed

 by the Tribunal, the liability was revised and as per

 the revised assessment orders, the tax liability of

 the      petitioner  got  reduced  to  Rs.4,52,864/-.The

 reduced liability of the petitioner was settled by

 taking advantage of the Amnesty Scheme introduced

 under section 23B of the KGST Act and following

 Ext.P26 order, the petitioner remitted Rs.1,79,107/-

 as per Exts.P27 and P28 and thus the liability was

 settled in full. Following this, the 4th respondent

 issued Exts.P35 on 21.2.2011 withdrawing the revenue

 recovery     requisition.    A   'no  dues'  certificate

 Ext.P29 was also issued by the 4th respondent on

 24.2.2011 which was produced before the District

 Collector.      It is long thereafter, that the sale was

 confirmed by Ext.P32 dated 20.7.2011 and that too, in

 spite of the District Collector being aware of the

 above developments. The question is whether such a

 sale confirmation is legally tenable.



</p><p id="p_22">11.In my view, once a liability has been settled and

 the requisition which led to the revenue recovery

 action has been withdrawn, the District Collector had

 no jurisdiction to confirm the sale and this view I e

 take is fully supported by the judgment of the Apex

 Court in <a href="/doc/246132/" id="a_6">Mohan Wahi v. Commissioner, Income Tax,

 Varanasi &amp; Others</a> [2001 4 SCC 362].   That was a case

 where the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">Income Tax Act</a> were

 initiated by the Tax Recovery Officer against two

 persons who owned a property along with two other

 persons.     Finally, the property was sold in public

 auction and the bid was accepted and the purchaser

 had deposited 1/4th of the auction money.  However, in

 a     civil  suit,  the  Income  Tax  Department   was

 restrained from confirming the sale.       During the

 pendency    of  the  suit, departmental  appeal  filed

 against the assessment order was dismissed, however,

 the appellate Tribunal allowed the appeals.      As a

 result, the demands raised by the department stood

 wiped out and was reduced to nil.     Thereafter, the

 Tax Recovery Officer was requested for cancellation

 of the recovery certificates.     In spite of it, the

 sale was confirmed by the Tax Recovery Officer.

</p><p id="p_23">12.The sale confirmation was the subject matter of

 proceedings before the departmental authorities which

 were unsuccessful.     The writ petition filed against

 the proceedings of the Tax Recovery Officer was also

 dismissed by the High Court. In an appeal filed

 before the Apex Court, the first question framed for

 answer was whether the Tax Recovery Officer could

 have confirmed the sale when the demands for the

 recovery of which tax recovery certificates were

 issued,     had ceased  to  exist.  This question was

 answered by the Apex Court with reference to the

 various provisions of the second schedule to the

 <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">Income Tax Act</a> and it was held that since the sale

 was being held for an assumed demand which is found

 to be fictitious or held to have not existed at all,

 in fact or in the eye of the law, is one such event

 which would oblige the Tax Recovery Officer not to

 pass an order confirming the sale and rather annul

 the same.      The relevant paragraphs of the judgment

 reads thus:

        "7. Taking up first question the first, according to
        S.222 where an assessee is in default or is deemed to
        be in default in making a payment of tax, the Tax
        Recovery Officer may issue a certificate specifying the
        amount of arrears due from assessee and shall proceed
        to recover from such assessee the amount so specified
        by one or more of the modes which include attachment
        and sale of the assessee's immovable properties. The
        Second Schedule sets out the procedure for recovery
        of tax. We will refer to some of the rules contained in
        the Second Schedule and relevant for our purpose.
        Rules regarding attachment and sale of immovable
        property are contained in Part III of Second Schedule.
        Rule 56 provides that the sale shall be by public auction
        to the highest bidder and shall be subject to
        confirmation by the Tax Recovery Officer. Several
        provisions contained in the rules which follow Rule 56
        are in pari materia with the provisions dealing with
        attachment and sale of immovable property contained in
        Order 21 of the C.P.C. dealing with execution of
        decrees passed by civil Courts. However, in Order 21 of
        the C.P.C., a provision similar to Rule 56 of Second
        Schedule is not to be found. Rule 60 provides for an
        application to set aside sale of immovable property
        being made by defaulter or an interested person on his
        depositing the specified amount within 30 days from
        the date of sale. Rule 61 deals with application to set
        aside sale of immovable property on the ground of non-
        service of notice on the defaulter under the Schedule
        or on the ground of material irregularity in publishing or
        conducting the sale. Under Rule 62 a sale may be set
        aside on an application by the purchaser on the ground

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   13</span>




        that the defaulter had no saleable interest in the
        property sold. The prescribed time limit within which
        the application can be made under Rule 60,61 or 62 is
        30 days from the date of sale. Where no application is
        made for setting aside the sale or such an application
        having been made is disallowed, the Tax Recovery
        Officer shall make an order confirming the sale and
        thereupon the sale shall become absolute. On a sale or
        immovable    property    becoming    absolute,   a   sale
        certificate shall be issued under Rule 65.

</p><p id="p_25">        8. Under S.224, an assessee cannot dispute the
        correctness of any certificate drawn up by the Tax
        Recovery Officer but it is lawful for the Tax Recovery
        Officer to cancel the certificate for any reason if he
        thinks it necessary to do so or to correct any clerical
        or any arithmetical error therein. Sub-sec.(3) of S.225
        provides as under :-
</p><p id="p_26">        225. Stay of proceedings in pursuance of certificate and
        amendment or cancellation thereof.
</p><p id="p_27">        xxx     xxx    xxx
        (3) Where a certificate has been drawn up and
        subsequently the amount of the outstanding demand is
        reduced as a result of an appeal or other proceeding
        under this Act, the Tax Recovery Officer shall, when
        the order which was the subject-matter of such appeal
        or other proceeding has become final and conclusive,
        amend the certificate, or cancel it, as the case may be.

</p><p id="p_28">        9. The term 'reduced' in sub-sec.(3) of S.225 would
        include a case where the demand consequent upon an
        appeal or any proceedings under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">Income-tax Act</a> has

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   14</span>




        been reduced to (nil) also. The Tax Recovery Officer is
        obliged to give effect to such reduction in demand and
        accordingly amend or cancel the certificate. The scheme
        of Part III of Second Schedule indicates that the sale
        proceedings terminate on their becoming absolute
        whereafter all that remains to be done is the issuance
        of sale certificate. However, an order confirming the
        sale by the Tax Recovery Officer is a must. The
        efficacy of the sale by public auction in favour of the
        highest bidder has been made to depend on the order of
        confirmation    by  the   Tax    Recovery   Officer  by
        incorporating Rule 56 in the Schedule. It is true that
        ordinarily if there is no application filed for setting
        aside sale under Rules 60,61 or 62 and 30 days from the
        date of the sale have expired, the Tax Recovery Officer
        has to make an order confirming a sale. Nevertheless, an
        order shall have to be actually made. The combined
        effect of sub-sec.(3) of<a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_10"> S. 225</a> of the Act and Rule 56
        and Rule 63 of Second Schedule is that if before an
        order confirming the sale is actually passed by the Tax
        Recovery officer, the demand of tax consequent upon an
        order made in appeal or other proceedings under the Act
        has been reduced to nil, the Tax Recovery Officer is
        obliged to cancel the certificate and as soon as the
        certificate is cancelled, he shall have no power to make
        an order confirming the sale. The sale itself being
        subject to confirmation by the Tax Recovery Officer,
        would fall to the ground for want of confirmation.

</p><p id="p_29">        10. In the case at hand the sale was held on 11-1-1980.
        No application was filed for setting aside the sale
        either by the assessee or by the auction purchaser or

WPC.20889/11

        by anyone interested in the property. On expiry of 30
        days from the date of the sale the Tax Recovery
        Officer could have passed an order confirming the sale.
        However, the Tax Recovery Officer was injuncted by
        the writ of civil Court from confirming the sale. The
        interim order issued by the civil Court ceased to
        operate    on  12-1-1998   whereafter     an  order   of
        confirmation was passed on 25-3-1998 by the Tax
        Recovery Officer ignoring, or unmindful of, the
        important event which had taken place in between.
        Before 25-3-1998, the demand against the assessee
        admittedly stood reduced to nil. This fact was in the
        notice of Income-tax Officer as well as the
        Commissioner of Income Tax. Attention of the Income-
        tax Officer as also the Tax Recovery Officer was also
        invited   by  the    firm   M/s.   UPCC    through   its
        communication dated 22-11-1996 (Annexure P-6). On
        16-1-1997,   the   counsel   for   the   assessee    had
        specifically called upon the Income Tax Officer who
        had raised the demand against the assessee to confirm
        if all the recovery certificates issued against the
        assessee firm had stood withdrawn or cancelled. In
        view of the facts within the knowledge of the
        department and the communications so made, the Tax
        Recovery Officer could not have confirmed the sale on
        25-3-1998. Rule 56 in Second Schedule of the Income-
        tax Act, 1961 is neither a redundant nor a formal
        provision. It casts an obligation on the Tax Recovery
        Officer to pass an order confirming the sale
        consciously and with due application of mind to the
        relevant fact relating to sale by public auction which is
        to be confirmed. Under Rule 63, confirmation of sale is

WPC.20889/11
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     16</span>




        not automatic. An order confirming the sale is
        contemplated to make the sale absolute. Ordinarily,in
        the abence of an application under Rule 60,61 or 62
        having been made or having been rejected if made, on
        expiry of 30 days from the date of sale the Tax
        Recovery Officer shall pass an order confirming the
        sale. However, between the date of sale and the actual
        passing of the order confirming the sale if an event
        happens or a fact comes to the notice of the Tax
        Recovery Officer which goes to the root of the matter,
        the Tax Recovery Officer may refuse to pass an order
        confirming the sale. The fact that sale was being held
        for an assumed demand which is found to be fictitious
        or held to have not existed at all, in fact or in the eye
        of law, is one such event which would oblige the Tax
        Recovery Officer not to pass an order confirming the
        sale and rather annul the same. The High Court in our
        opinion, clearly fell in error in not allowing relief to the
        petitioner-appellant by setting aside the sale.

</p><p id="p_30">        11.Shri S.K. Jain, learned counsel for the auction-
        purchaser,respondent No.3, referred to <a href="/doc/1637242/" id="a_11">Janak Raj v.
        Gurdial Singh</a> (1967)2 SCR 77 and <a href="/doc/1965204/" id="a_12">Sardar Govindrao
        Mahadik v. Devi Sahai</a>, AIR 1982 SC 989 wherein it has
        been held that once a sale has taken place in execution
        of   a  decree,    the    sale   has   to   be   confirmed
        notwithstanding the fact that after the holding of the
        sale, the decree was set aside. In Janak Raj's case, sale
        was held in execution of an ex-parte decree. The ex-
        parte decree was set aside subsequent to the date of
        the sale but before an order confirming the sale was
        passed. This Court held that in the absence of an

        application for setting aside the sale having been moved
        on the grounds available under Rules 89 to 91 of Order
        21 of C.P.C., the Court could not have refused to
        confirm the sale. However, in this case itself, this Court
        has observed (at page 80) that there may be cases in
        which apart (from the provisions of Rules 89 to 91 the
        Court may refuse to confirm a sale, as for instance,
        where a sale is held without giving notice to the
        judgment debtor, or where the Court is misled in fixing
        a reserved price or where there was no decree in
        existence at the time when the sale was held. In Sardar
        Govindrao Mahadik's case, Janak Raj's case was
        referred. The Court has drawn a distinction between a
        Court auction held in favour of a decree holder and
        where the auction purchaser is an outsider or a
        stranger. In former case on the decree ceasing to exist
        before the sale is confirmed, the sale may be refused
        to be confirmed but in the latter case, equity in favour
        of the stranger should be protected and the judgment
        debtor should be left to suffer for the default on his
        part for not obtaining stay of the execution of the
        decree from where it was under challenge. Though the
        learned counsel for the auction purchaser has relied
        heavily on these decisions, suffice it to observe that
        these are the cases of auction sale held under Order 21
        of the C.P.C. and, therefore, may not apply to the case
        of an auction sale held under Second Schedule of the
        Income-tax Act in view of Rule 56 contained therein.
        Moreover, in these decisions also, the Supreme Court
        has contemplated situations where in spite of the
        auction sale having been held and no application for
        setting aside the sale having been moved, yet in

WPC.20889/11

        exceptional situation the sale may be refused to be
        confirmed and may be set aside. Shri S.K. Jain also
        relied on <a href="/doc/1313544/" id="a_13">Padanthil Ruqmini Amma v. P.K. Abdulla</a> (1996)1
        JT (SC) 381, wherein this Court has observed that
        unless the auction purchasers were protected, the
        properties which are sold in Court auction would not
        fetch a proper price. It is true that sanctity of sale of
        property by public auction has to be protected but at
        the same time a citizen faced with proceedings for
        recovery of assumed arrears should not be deprived of
        his property in spite of judicial or quasi judicial
        pronouncement holding, before the sale was confirmed,
        that there were no arrears. This observation applies a
        fortiori under the scheme of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_14">Income-tax Act</a>, the
        relevant provisions whereof have already been referred
        to by us."

 that the Apex Court had mainly placed reliance on

</p><p id="p_34">14.However, the contention of the counsel for the 6th

 respondent was that the sale in favour of a bona fide

 purchaser      in    pursuance     of   a    decree    will    remain

 ineffected even if the decree is set aside in an

 appeal.          This     contention       was    sought      to   be

 substantiated by the learned counsel by relying on

 the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/830216/" id="a_22">Janatha Textiles &amp;

 Others v. Tax Recovery Officer &amp; Another</a> [(2008) 12

 reference to these judgments, the Apex Court in Mohan

 Wahi held that "suffice it to observe that these are

 the cases of auction sale held under Order 21 of the

 C.P.C. and, therefore, may not apply to the case of

 an auction sale held under Second Schedule of the

 Income-tax Act in view of Rule 56 contained therein.

 Moreover, in these decisions also, the Supreme Court

 has contemplated situations where in spite of the

 auction sale having been held and no application for

 setting aside the sale having been moved, yet in

 exceptional situation the sale may be refused to be

 confirmed and may be set aside." Thereafter, the Apex

 Court has also held that while the sanctity of sale

 of property by public auction has to be protected, at

 the same time, a citizen faced with proceedings for

 recovery of assumed arrears should not be deprived of

 his property in spite of judicial or quasi judicial

 pronouncement holding, before the sale was confirmed,


 that there was no arrears. In view of the aforesaid

 authoritative pronouncement of the Apex Court, I am

 unable     to  accept the contention of  the  learned

 counsel for the 6th respondent and reject the writ

 petition on that basis.
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">17.In fact, this contention of the counsel for the 6th

 respondent was contradicted by the learned counsel

 appearing for the petitioner by pointing out that the

 6th respondent cannot be termed as a bona fide

 purchaser to claim the benefit of the principles laid

 down in the judgment in Janatha Textiles (supra).

 According to him, the 6th respondent purchased the

 property fully knowing about the pendency of the

 appeals     and therefore, is bound  to  restore  the

 property by way of restitution.

</p><p id="p_45">18.I have considered this contention.    It is true that

 the courts have always made distinction between a

 decree holder who purchased the property in execution

 of     that   decree  which  is  modified  or   reversed

 afterwards and an auction purchaser, who is not a

 party to the decree.     It has also been held that the

 decree holder who purchased the property is bound to

 restore the property to the judgment debtor by way of

 restitution whereas the third party auction purchaser

 who is a bona fide purchaser of the property is

 entitled     to  retain  the  property  irrespective  of

 whether      the   decree  is   modified   or   reversed

 thereafter.       Yet another principle that has been

 held is that a third party who purchased the property

 with the knowledge of the pending appeals against the

 decree cannot be termed as a bona fide purchaser to

 avoid      restoration  of  the  property   by  way  of

 restitution.     These principles have been discussed by

 the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1125222/" id="a_30">Chinnammal &amp; Others v. P.Arumugham

 Mahadik       v.   Devi    Sahai</a>    [(1982)     1   SCC    237] and

 disapproving the judgments of the Patna High Court in

 Chhota Nagpur Banking Association v. C.T.M. Smith

 [AIR      1943   Patna     325]    and   Madras    High    Court in

 <a href="/doc/683254/" id="a_33">R.Raghavachari v. M.A.Pakkiri Mahomed Rowther</a> [AIR

 1917 Madras 250], the Apex Court held thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "10. There is thus a distinction maintained between the
        decree holder who purchases the property in execution
        of his own decree which is afterwards modified or
        reversed, and an auction purchaser who is not party to
        the decree. Where the purchaser is the decree holder,
        he is bound to restore the property to the judgment
        debtor byway of restitution but not a stranger auction
        purchaser. The latter remains unaffected and does not
        lose title to the property by subsequent reversal or
        modification of the decree. The Courts have held that
        he could retain the property since he is a bona fide
        purchaser. This principle is also based on the premise
        that he is not bound to enquire into correctness of the
        judgment or decree sought to be executed. He is thus
        distinguished from an eo nomine party to the litigation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        11. There cannot be any dispute on this proposition and
        it is indeed based on a fair and proper classification.</blockquote><p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">        The innocent purchaser whether in voluntary transfer
        or judicial sale by or in execution of a decree or order
        would not be penalised. The property bona fide
        purchased ignorant of the litigation should be

        protected. The judicial sales in particular would not be
        robbed of all their sanctity. It is a sound rule based on
        legal and equitable considerations. But it is difficult to
        appreciate why such protection should be extended to
        a purchaser who knows about the pending litigation
        relating to the decree. If a person ventures to
        purchase the property ,being fully aware of the
        controversy between the decree holder and judgment
        debtor, it is difficult to regard him as a bona fide
        purchaser. The true question in each case, therefore, is
        whether the stranger auction purchaser had knowledge
        of the pending litigation about the decree under
        execution. If the evidence indicates that he had no
        such knowledge he would be entitled to retain the
        property purchased being a bona fide purchaser and his
        title  to  the    property    remains    unaffected    by
        subsequent reversal of the decree. The Court by all
        means should protect his purchase. But if it is shown by
        evidence that he was aware of the pending appeal
        against the decree when he purchased the property, it
        would be inappropriate to term him as a bona fide
        purchaser. In such a case the Court also cannot assume
        that he was a bona fide or innocent purchaser for
        giving  him    protection    against    restitution.   No
        assumption could be made contrary to the facts and
        circumstances of the case and any such assumption
        would be wrong and uncalled for.
</p>
<p id="p_48">        12. The Patna High Court in Chhota Nagpur Banking
        Association v. C. T.M. Smith AIR 1943 Patna 325
        expressed a similar view. Fazl Ali, C.J., as he then was,
        said (at 327) that where there is clear and cogent

WPC.20889/11

        evidence that a stranger purchaser was fully aware of
        the merits of the controversy in regard to the
        property purchased by him and was also aware that the
        validity of the decree was under challenge, there is no
        room for presumption that he was a bona fide
        purchaser. Reference may also be made to the decision
        of the Sind Judicial Commissioners Court in Jamnomal
        Gurdinomal v. Gopaldas, AIR 1924 Sind 101 where
        similar comment was made.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        13. The Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/683254/" id="a_34">R. Raghavachari v. M. A.
        Pakkiri Mahomed Rowther</a>, AIR 1917 Madras 250 has,
        however, taken a contrary view. It was held that
        restitution under Section 144 CPC cannot be demanded
        as against a bona fide purchaser who was not a party to
        the decree. The High Court also remarked that the
        reversal of the decree by the appellate Court or the
        knowledge of the purchaser about the pendency of the
        appeal makes no material difference to the operation
        of that rule.
</p>
<p id="p_50">        14. This proposition, we are, however, unable to accept.
        In our opinion, the person who purchases the property
        in court auction with the knowledge of the pending
        appeal against the decree cannot resist restitution. His
        knowledge about the pending litigation would make all
        the difference in the case. He may be a stranger to
        the suit, but he must be held to have taken calculated
        risk in purchasing the property. Indeed, he is evidently
        a speculative purchaser and in that respect he is in no
        better position than the decree holder purchaser. The
        need to protect him against restitution, therefore,

WPC.20889/11

        seems to be unjustified. Similarly the auction
        purchaser who was a name lender to the decree holder
        or who has colluded with the decree holder to purchase
        the property could not also be protected to retain the
        property if the decree is subsequently reversed.

</p><p id="p_51">        15. There is one other aspect which is more important
        than what we have discussed hitherto. It was
        emphasized by Lord Cairns in Rodger v. The Comptoir
        D'Escompte De Paris, (1969-71) LR 3 PC 465 at p. 475):
          ".....that one of the first and highest duties of all
        Courts is to take care that the act of the Court does
        no injury to any of the suitors, and when the
        expression "the act of the Court", is used, it does not
        mean merely the act of the Primary Court, or of any
        intermediate Court of Appeal, but the act of the Court
        as a whole, from the lowest Court which entertains
        jurisdiction over the matter up to the highest Court
        which finally disposes of the case. It is the duty of the
        aggregate of those Tribunals, if I may use the
        expression, to take care that no act of the Court in the
        course of the whole of the proceedings does an injury
        to the suitors in the Court."
</p>
<p id="p_52">        16. This is also the principle underlying Sec. 144 of the
        Code of Civil Procedure. It is the duty of all the Courts
        as observed by the Privy Council "as aggregate of those
        tribunals" to take care that no act of the Court in the.
        course of the whole of the proceedings does an injury
        to the suitors in the Court. The above passage was
        quoted in the majority judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1353689/" id="a_35">A. R.
        Antulay v. R. S. Nayak</a>, (1988) 2 SCC 602 at p. 672 :

        (AIR 1988 SC 1531). Mukherjee, J., as he then was,
        after referring to the said observation of Lord Cairns,
        said (at p. 672 of SCC: at 1561 of AIR):
</p><p id="p_53">        "No man should suffer because of the mistake of the
        Court. No man should suffer a wrong by technical
        procedure of irregularities. Rules or procedures are
        the handmaids of justice and not the mistress of the
        justice. Ex debito justitiae, we must do justice to him.
        If a man has been wronged so long as it lies within the
        human machinery of administration of justice that
        wrong must be remedied."
</p>
<p id="p_54">        17. It is well to remember that the Code of Civil
        Procedure is a body of procedural law designed to
        facilitate justice and it should not be treated as an
        enactment providing for punishments and penalties.
        The laws of procedure should be so construed as to
        render justice wherever reasonably possible. It is, in
        our opinion, not unreasonable to demand restitution
        from a person who has purchased the property in court
        auction being aware of the pending appeal against the
        decree."
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">19.Although the legal position as laid down by the Apex

 Court in the judgment in Chinnammal (supra) is not

 open to doubt, as clarified by the Apex Court itself,

 the      question    to    be    considered     is    whether   the

 petitioner has proved with dependable evidence that

 the 6th respondent purchased the property with the

 knowledge that the appeals filed by the petitioner

 were pending.       None of the documents produced by the

 petitioner      throw     any   light     on    this  aspect and

 therefore, there is total dearth of materials on this

 point.     In such a situation, this Court cannot accept

 the case of the petitioner that the 6th respondent

 purchased the property with the knowledge that the

 appeals filed by him were pending and that therefore,

 he cannot be termed as a bona fide purchaser.



</p><p id="p_57">20.Therefore, the petitioner is perfectly justified

 that in view of the statutory provisions of the

 the Apex Court in Mohan Wahi (supra), the District

 Collector could not have confirmed the sale even

 after issuance of Ext.P35, recalling the requisition

 made by the requisitioning authority.

 petitioner is relying on section 23B of the KGST

 relevant portion of the Act is <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_41">section 55</a>.    A reading

 of the above section makes it clear that when a sale

 is not confirmed or a confirmation is set aside, the

 entitled only to refund of the amount deposited and

 the section does not provide for any interest.     Even

 otherwise, the facts of this case also do not justify

 for the reason that the petitioner cannot be faulted

 for the acts committed by the official respondents in
