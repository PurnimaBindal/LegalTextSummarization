     forwarded the check list. It forwarded one set of the relied upon documents

     which did not have legible stamp and signature of the certifying officer and

     this fact to the notice of the Deputy Secretary and he made an endorsement
      


     of their information on 28th December, 2013. Then the detaining authority
   



     directed that legible copies of the relied upon documents and a check list

     Officer visited the office of the detaining authority on 27 th December .2013

     and supplied the legible copies of the relied upon documents. However, this





     Investigating Officer did not do the check list. Therefore, the check list was

     affidavit does not reflect that any further documents or materials were

     information and para-wise comments on the pre-detention representation

     by letter dated 28th March,2014 and additional brief facts. However,
      


     Mr.Singh submits that once the detaining authority received all the

     is absolutely no explanation as to why the detention order was not made till

     that the time taken by the then detaining authority as sought to be explained




                                                                 
     is by pointing out that it was making sincere efforts in order to satisfy itself

     as to the need to detain the detenu. Our attention is also invited to the




                                              
     judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/1824804/" id="a_6">Pradeep

     passing the detention order in this case vitiates the same. Mr.Singh submits

     that though the State/detaining authority has made an attempt to justify the





     delay by referring to pre-detention representation but there is no obligation

     to consider the same. Further, the sponsoring authority's affidavit does not





     make any reference to the comments on this representation.                                                       The

     purported to have taken place after 7th April, 2014. Mr.Singh therefore,

     Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that mere delay in making the

     order of detention under a law like COFEPOSA enacted for the purpose of




                                                      
     dealing effectively with persons engaged in smuggling and foreign

     have been posing serious threats to the economy and thereby security of the
                             
     nation. The Courts should not merely on account of delay assume that if

     not satisfactorily explained it must necessarily give rise to a inference that
                            
     there was no sufficient material for the subjective satisfaction of the

     detaining authority or that such subjective satisfaction was not genuinely
      


     reached. Taking of such a view would not be warranted unless the Court
   



     finds that the grounds are stale or illusory or that there is no real nexus

     Union of India</a> (2006) 4 SCC 796 the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India




                                                             
     reached the same conclusion. Thus, there are cases and cases and the

     question whether the prejudicial activities of a person necessitating the




                                             
     passing of order of detention are proximate to the time when the order is
                             
     made or the live link between the prejudicial activity and order of detention

     is snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Even in
                            
     the case of undue or long delay between the prejudicial activities and

     passing of the detention order, if, the same is satisfactorily explained and a

     reference to pre-detention representation and which was forwarded by the

     detenu. In the affidavit two such representations are referred. The attempt





     made is that in dealing with them and taking a decision thereon

     considerable time was consumed. These representations were considered in





     order to arrive at a proper subjective satisfaction that a person like the

     detenu is required to be preventively detained to prevent him from

     smuggling of goods in future. However, when we repeatedly queried

     issued on 13th January, 2014. The detenu surrendered on that day and was

     sent to judicial custody. The proposal for his preventive detention was




                                    
     placed prior thereto and before the screening committee on 26th November

     documents serially numbered from 1 to 2459. These are the events prior to

     the sponsoring authority was satisfied and going by the enormity and





     magnitude of the crime that the preventive detention was necessary, it drew

     up a proposal within four months of the seizure and forwarded it to the





     detaining authority on 16th December, 2013. However, it is candid in

     that the sponsoring authority had not forwarded the check list. It forwarded
   



     only sets of relied upon documents which did not have legible stamp and

     the check list according to the detaining authority. Therefore, a note

     2014. The Section Officer endorsed it on 1st January 2014. The letter dated
                            
     1st January, 2014 was sent to the sponsoring authority requesting it to

     forward the check list. On not receiving the check list a draft reminder

     scrutiny of the proposal, a scrutiny note was prepared which once again

     from indulging in smuggling activities in future, then, on the own showing
   



     of the detaining authority, a delay of 9 months and 13 days from the date of

     receipt of proposal has not been satisfactorily explained. The explanation

     Rafique (supra) the Division Bench held that in matters of this nature

     a person being involved and likely to be involved in future in smuggling

     activities is important in such matters, then the live link has been severed or




                                                               
     not must be determined accordingly and that delay simplicitor is not fatal.

<p id="p_33">     However, all decisions of the Supreme Court to which we have made




                                              
     extensive reference are in COFEPOSA matters. This is not a case where
                             
     the sponsoring and detaining authority says that delay must be ignored and

     brushed aside or is not relevant or a germane factor. If it is then, no capital
                            
     must be made of the delay in processing the files. However, in the present

     case, we do not find that the unreasonable and unacceptable delay can be
      


     ignored. For in such matters where a person has engaged in smuggling
   



     activities as alleged in July 2013, all proposals were scrutinized and finally

     to detain him in December 2013 but, till September 2014 the detention





     order has not been issued, then the live link must be taken to have been

     snapped. There is then no nexus with the activity of smuggling detected in





     2013 and the detention order of 29th September, 2014.
