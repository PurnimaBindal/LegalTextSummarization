</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. Facts leading to filing of the instant writ petition are that,-

1897 r/w. the enabling provisions of <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_2">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005, the

lockdown in the entire State of Kerala with immediate effect till 31.03.2020,

on satisfying that there was a strong possibility of widespread of Novel

Coronavirus (COVID-19).
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. Petitioner has further stated that having been satisfied that the

country was threatened with the spread of COVID-19 epidemic, as declared

as a pandemic by the WHO, and having considered it necessary to take

effective    measures      to   prevent    its       spread,   the   National   Disaster

Management Authority (NDMA), represented by its Chairperson, New Delhi

(respondent No.2), in exercise of the powers under Section 6(2)(i) of the

<a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_3">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005, issued order dated 24.03.2020 directing

Ministries/UT Governments and State/UT Authorities to take effective

measures in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country.

Thereafter, the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India,

New Delhi (respondent No.1) issued Exhibit-P2 order dated 24.03.2020

(Exhibit.P2), introducing national lockdown for 21 days w.e.f 25.03.2020.

</p><p id="p_6">      6. Petitioner has further stated that modifying the guidelines in

Exhibit-P2 order dated 24.3.2020, and the consolidated guidelines therein

on   25.03.2020,     27.03.2020,      2.4.2020,    3.4.2020     and   10.04.2020,

respondent has issued Exhibit-P3 order dated 15.04.2020.

</p><p id="p_7">      7. Meanwhile, in continuation of Exhibit-P1 order, the Secretary,

General Administration (Secret Section) Department, Government of

Kerala,   Thiruvananthapuram         (5th   respondent)   has   issued   G.O(Ms)

No.78/2020/GAD dated 17.04.2020 (Exhibit-P6) with revised guidelines to

all the departments, District Collectors, Superintendent of Police and other

Heads of Departments for containment activities of COVID-19, for strict

implementation in the State of Kerala. Thereafter, the 5 th respondent issued

G.O(Ms) No.127/2020/GAD dated 30.06.2020 (Exhibit-P7), making the

regulations and guidelines in Exhibit-P5 order of th 1 st respondent

applicable to the State of Kerala.

</p><p id="p_9">      8. The Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare,

Government of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram (respondent No.4), has issued

G.O.(Rt.) No.480/2020/H&amp;FWD dated 3.3.2020 (Exhibit-P8) relating to

general transfer of the employees in Health and Family Departments,

including Doctors, Nurses, Health Inspectors and other health workers.

Thereafter, he issued another order dated 26.06.2020 (Exhibit-P9),

modifying the dates stipulated in Exhibit-P8 order thereby extending the

proceeding related to general transfer. Again, th 4th respondent issued order

dated 22.07.2020 (Exhibit-P10) relating to general transfer of employees of

the Department of Health and Family Welfare amending Exhibit-P9 order

and fixing 30.07.2020 as the last date for submission and acceptance of

applications,14.08.2020 as the date for publishing draft list of candidates,

and 25.08.2020 as the date for publishing final list.

</p><p id="p_10">      9. Petitioner has contended that in Exhibit-P8 order dated 3.3.2020,

the norms for general transfer were set out in G.O.(P) No.3/2017/ P&amp;ARD

dated 25.02.2017, at the time when there was no threat of emergency of

any epidemic or pandemic. According to the petitioner, more than 30% of

the health workers will be transferred by Exhibits-P8 to P10 orders and that

if they are transferred, they had to undergo quarantine.

</p><p id="p_11">      10. Petitioner further contended that equally, such a general transfer

is violative of the COVID Protocol issued by the WHO, the scheme and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                   7</span>




purpose of Exhibits-P1 to P7, and the <a href="/doc/1005961/" id="a_4">Epidemic Diseases Act</a>, 1897, as well

as the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_5">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005 respectively.

</p><p id="p_12">      11. Petitioner has further contended that Exhibits P8 to P10 orders

are against the COVID-19 protocol issued by the World Health Organization

and respondents 1 to 3, 7 and 8. For the very reason, Exhibits P8 to P10

are arbitrary and violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article

14</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      12. Petitioner has further contended that the radical scheme set out

in Exhibits P1 to P7, as per the directives of the WHO, and respondents 1

to 3, 7 and 8 is that the people shall stay where they are. If the general

transfer proposed by Exhibits P8 to P10 is pressed into service, at least

30% of the health workers in service would be transferred to different

places. By and large such a situation would put the lives of the people of

Kerala in danger. Thus, Exhibits P8 to P10 are violative of the fundamental

right to life, provided under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_14">      13. Petitioner has further contended that th 4th respondent should

have considered the opinion of respondents 1 to 3, 7 and 8 before issuing

Exhibit P10 order. According to him, the situation prevailing in Kerala is very

severe, as the infection rate per day is more than 1000 and the mortality

rate due to COVID-19 is increasing repentantly. Several parts of Kerala are

under triple lock down being containment zones and cluster areas.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                  8</span>




</p><p id="p_15">      14. The community spread across the State is more or less

confirmed. The present factual situation necessitates and warrants the

services of health workers, including doctors, nurses, health inspectors etc.,

at the very same stations where they are serving.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      15. Petitioner has further contended that the transfer contemplated in

Exhibits P8 to P10, if implemented, all the health workers would be taken

away from the present stations. Their acquaintance with local places,

population, families etc., are essential for ascertaining track records/route

map of the patients and the persons, who are under quarantine, are under

the shadow of suspicion of being infected. Thus, Exhibits P8 to P10 are not

conducive to the health and lives of the people of Kerala. The proposed

general transfer will lead to a situation, where the health workers would be

massively put to quarantine. In such a situation, the entire fight

against COVID-19 pandemic in the State would be seriously and

adversely affected.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      16. Petitioner has further contended that the health workers as of

right, will avail full joining time, as provided under the service rules, in case

of transfers, and the same would affect the anti-Corona activities. The

norms for general transfer proposed in Exhibits P8 to P10 orders are set out

in G.O(P) No.3/2017/P&amp;ARD dated 25.02.2017, at the time when there was

no threat of emergency of any epidemic or pandemic.

</p><p id="p_46">      38. A conjoint reading of the abovesaid Governments orders issued

periodically from 3.3.2020 till 22.07.2020, as regards transfers, would show

that in terms of the existing guidelines for general transfers relating to

Government servants in Kerala, a specific time-line has been fixed for

submission of applications, preparation, and publication of the list, so as to

enable the incumbents to join the new station. All the Government servants

working in the Health Department are fully aware of the time-line even in

early March, 2020.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      39. It is also evident from Exhibit-P9 Government order dated

26.06.2020 that Government have also finalised the promotions to be given

to the eligible persons. Doctors, Health Inspectors, and others eligible to be

promoted as per the service rules, have to be considered and promoted to

the posts to which, they are eligible, to the place where the post is

available, and transferred from the place where he is working, and in the

transferred place, another suitable person has to be appointed. One cannot

expect the availability of the promotional post, in the place where a

Government servant is working, at present. Therefore, when promotions are

finalised even in the month of June, 2020, general transfers for 2020 could

not be finalised for the wake of Covid and, therefore, the Government have

extended the time for submission of applications till 30.06.2020. The order

dated 26.06.2020 further states that the draft list would be prepared by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                  26</span>




20.07.2020 and published on 30.07.2020. Thereafter taking note of the

difficulty that all persons deputed for COVID-19 duty at various places and

persons under quarantine will not be able to submit applications within the

stipulated time, the Government of Kerala have extended further time, for

submission of application till 30.07.2020, with a further time-line for

preparation of the draft list by 14.08.2020 and publication by 25.08.2020.

</p><p id="p_48">      40. In a given case, a post in Health Services may fall vacant on

account of retirement or for any other reason and if an ineligible person is

working at a place, he cannot be directed to man the post, and the post

cannot be kept vacant, when an eligible person has been already

considered. In the instant case, promotions have been finalised in June,

2020 itself, and those empanelled have to be posted in the respective

stations, wherever the posts are available and required to be filled up. If

promotional posts are kept vacant, it will have additional burden on the

existing Government servants. Mobility of Doctors, Health Workers and

others are required, even during lockdown period and there cannot be any

blanket order quashing Exhibits-P8 to P10 Government orders issued

regarding general transfers.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      41. What is stated in the impugned orders is only extension of

time-line for submission of applications, preparation of draft list, finalisation,

and publication of the same. Reading of the Government orders dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                    27</span>




3.3.2020, 20.06.2020 and 22.07.2020, indicate that promotions though

finalised in June, 2020, could be given effect to, due to the delay in

finalising the general transfers. Having regard to the need of the hour and

the nature of work performed by the Doctors, Health Workers and others,

connected to prevention and spread of COVID-19, their services at all

places are required.
</p>
<p id="p_50">      42. In the light of the requirement to man different posts at various

levels in Government services, particularly, health services, as discussed

above, and in the absence of any policy decision by the Government, not to

effect general transfers, which may have the effect of not filling up of the

posts, Court cannot strike down the impugned Government orders as

violative of fundamental rights. Though the following are not the decisions

relating to a ban on general transfer, yet this Court deems it fit to consider

what 'transfer' means and when the Court can interfere.

</p><p id="p_51">      43. Transfer is an incidence of service and not a condition.

</p><p id="p_52">          (i) <a href="/doc/288290/" id="a_10">In B. VARADA RAO v. STATE OF KARNATAKA</a> reported in
          1986 (II) LLJ 516, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that, it is
          well understood that transfer of Government servant, who is
          appointed to a particular cadre of transferable post from one place
          to another is an ordinary incident of service and therefore, does not
          result in any alteration of any of the conditions of service of his
          disadvantage. The Supreme Court declined to accept the case of
          the petitioner therein, that he should not be transferred.

     SUNGOMAL POSHANI</a> [1989 AIR 1433, 1989 SCR (2) 357], the
     Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_96">            "Transfer from one place to another is necessary in public
            interest and efficiency in the public administration. Whenever a
            public servant is transferred he must comply with the order but
            if there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on transfer it is
            open to him to make representation to the competent authority
            for stay, modification or cancellation of the transfer order. If the
            order of transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
            concerned public servant must carry out the order of transfer.
            In the absence of any stay of the transfer order a public
            servant has no justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
            merely on the ground of having made a representation, or on
            the ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the
            other. If he fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the
            transfer order, he would expose himself to disciplinary action
            under the relevant Rules, as has happened in the instant case.
            The respondent lost his service as he refused to comply with
            the order of his transfer from one place to the other."

<p id="p_54">     (iii) <a href="/doc/544894/" id="a_12">In N.K.SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA</a> reported in 1995 (I) LLJ 854, the
     Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the correctness of the order,
     has observed that, no roving inquiry into the matter is called for or
     justified within the scope of judicial review of a transfer scrutinized with
     reference to the private rights of an individual. It was further held that
     transfer of a Government servant in a transferable service is a
     necessary incident of the service career and that assessment of the
     quality of men is to be made by superiors taking into account several
     factors including suitability of the person for a particular post and
     exigencies of administration.

     transfer is very limited as it is an incidence of service and normally

     Government servant or employee of the public undertaking has any
     legal right to be posted forever at any one particular place or place of
     his choice since transfer of a particular employee appointed to the class
     or category of transferable posts from one place to other is not only an
     incident, but a condition of service, necessary too in public interest and
     efficiency in the public administration. Unless an order of transfer is
     shown to be an outcome of mala fide exercise or stated to be in
     violation of statutory provisions prohibiting any such transfer, the courts
     or the tribunals normally cannot interfere with such orders as a matter of
     routine, as though they were appellate authorities substituting their own
     decision for that of the employer/management, as against such
     orders passed in the interest of administrative exigencies of the
     service concerned.

     considered as to the correctness of the judgment of Allahabad High
     Court, whether the High Court was right in considering the competence
     of the appellant to be posted at a particular place and the transfer was
     found to be not on bona fide grounds. It is worthwhile to reproduce the
     decisions considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraphs 5 to 7,
     as follows:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                       30</span><p id="p_59">

             remain posted at a place of his choice nor can he insist that he
             must be posted at one place or the other. He is liable to be
             transferred in the administrative exigencies from one place to
             the other. Transfer of an employee is not only an incident
             inherent in the terms of appointment but also implicit as an
             essential condition of service in the absence of any specific
             indication to the contrary. No Government can function if the
             Government Servant insists that once appointed or posted in a

                  authority do not violate any of his legal rights. Even if a
                  transfer order is passed in violation of executive
                  instructions or orders, the courts ordinarily should not
                  interfere with the order instead affected party should
                  approach the higher authorities in the department. If
                  the courts continue to interfere with day-to- day
                  transfer orders issued by the government and its
                  subordinate authorities, there will be complete chaos in
                  the administration which would not be conducive to
                  public interest. The High Court overlooked these
                  aspects in interfering with the transfer orders."

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">             "9. It is difficult to fathom why the High Court went into the
             comparative conduct and integrity of the petitioner and
             Respondent No. 5 while dealing with a transfer matter. The
             High Court should have appreciated the true extent of scrutiny
             into a matter of transfer and the limited scope of judicial
             review....."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">             10. We are pained to observe that the High Court seriously
             erred in deciding as to whether Respondent No. 5 was a
             competent person to be posted at Ghaziabad-IV as Sub-
             Registrar. The exercise undertaken by the High Court did not
             fall within its domain and was rather uncalled for. We are
             unable to approve the direction issued to the State
             Government and Inspector General of Registration to transfer
             a competent officer at Ghaziabad-IV as Sub-Registrar after
             holding that Respondent No. 5 cannot be said to be an officer
             having a better conduct and integrity in comparison to the
             petitioner justifying his posting at Ghaziabad-IV. The High
             Court entered into an arena which did not belong to it and
             thereby committed serious error of law. ................. The High
             Court went into the competence and suitability of Respondent
             No. 5 for such posting. It is here that the High Court fell into a
             grave error. As a matter of fact, the impugned order of the
             High Court casts stigma in the service of Respondent No. 5

     PANDEY AND ORS</a>. [(2009) 8 SCC 337], the Hon'ble Supreme Court
     held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">                  "5. In the case of the <a href="/doc/146531721/" id="a_20">State of U.P. v. Gobardhan Lal</a> (2004)
          11 SCC 402, while dealing with a matter of transfer, this Court
          observed that allegations of mala-fides must inspire confidence of
          the Court and ought not to be entertained on the mere asking of it or
          on consideration borne out of conjectures or surmises and except
          for strong and convincing reasons, no interference would ordinarily
          be made with an order of transfer. That the burden of proving mala-
          fides is on a person leveling such allegations and the burden is
          heavy, admits of no legal ambiguity. Mere assertion or bald
          statement is not enough to discharge the heavy burden that the law
          imposes upon the person leveling allegations of mala-fides; it must
          be supported by requisite materials. In the present case, as noticed
          above, at the threshold, no allegations of mala-fides have been
          pleaded in the writ petition. It is only by way of a supplementary
          affidavit that allegations of mala-fides have been put forth by the
          Respondent No. 1 but even such allegations are not supported by
          any material whatsoever. In a matter such as the present one where
          plea of mala-fides is not made in the writ petition and the assertion
          of mala-fides is made for the first time in a supplementary affidavit
          which too is not supported by any convincing and cogent material,
          the plea of mala-fides hardly deserved acceptance, prima facie,
          justifying stay of operation of a transfer order. The High Court has
          referred to a decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/388728/" id="a_21">Arvind Dattatraya
          Dhande v. State of Maharashtra and Ors</a>. [(1997) 6 SCC 169] but in
          what we have said above, that decision cannot be applied to the
          facts of the present case. In the writ petition, the transfer order has
          been assailed by the present Respondent No. 1 on the sole ground
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> W.P.(C) No.15594 of 2020                        33</span>




          that it was violative of transfer policy framed by the appellant. The
          High Court did not, even find any contravention of transfer policy in
          transferring the Respondent No. 1 from Lucknow to Calicut. In a
          matter of transfer of a government employee, scope of judicial
          review is limited and High Court would not interfere with an order of
          transfer lightly, be it at interim stage or final hearing. This is so
          because the courts do not substitute their own decision in the matter
          of transfer. In the present case, High Court fell into a grave error in
          staying the transfer order which, if allowed to stand, may cause
          prejudice to the administrative functioning of the appellant."

     Supreme Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_104">                  "12. Transfer ordinarily is an incidence of service, and the
          courts should be very reluctant to interfere in transfer orders as
          long as they are not clearly illegal. In particular, we are of the
          opinion that transfer and postings of policemen must be left in the
          discretion of the State authorities concerned which are in the best
          position   to    assess   the   necessities   of   the   administrative
          requirements of the situation. The administrative authorities
          concerned may be of the opinion that more policemen are required
          in any particular district and/or another range than in another,
          depending upon their assessment of the law and order situation
          and/or other considerations. These are purely administrative
          matters, and it is well settled that courts must not ordinarily
          interfere in administrative matters and should maintain judicial
          restraint, vide <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_23">Tata Cellular v. Union of India</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_105">                     14. In our opinion, the High Court has taken a totally
          impractical view of the matter. If the view of the High Court is to
          prevail, great difficulties will be created for the State administration
          since it will not be able to transfer/deploy its police force from one
          place where there may be relative peace to another district or

          region/range in the State where there may be disturbed law and
          order situation and hence requirement of more police. Courts
          should not, in our opinion, interfere with purely administrative
          matters except where absolutely necessary on account of violation
          of any fundamental or other legal right of the citizen. After all, the
          State administration cannot function with its hands tied by judiciary
          behind its back. As Holmes, J. of the US Supreme Court pointed
          out, there must be some free play of the joints provided to the
          executive authorities."
