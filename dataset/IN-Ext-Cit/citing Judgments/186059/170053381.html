Per Justice G.S. Ahluwalia,

       This Criminal Appeal under <a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_1">Section 374</a> of Cr.P.C. has been

filed against the judgment dated 22/9/2005 passed by Fifth

Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court), Morena in S.T.
</p>
<p id="p_2">No.272/1998, by which the appellant has been convicted under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> of IPC and has been sentenced to undergo life

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The necessary facts for disposal of the present appeal in

short are that according to the prosecution case, on 23/5/1997 the

complainant-Hargovind (PW-1) lodged a report that on 22/5/1997

he had gone to attend the marriage ceremony of daughter of son-
</p>
<p id="p_4">in-law of his elder brother, where the appellant had caused

nuisance after consuming liquor and had slapped Bhura; the son

of his daughter, and, therefore, he had tried to pacify the

appellant, but he was also pushed by the appellant and also

extended the threat. On persuasion by other relatives, the

appellant went back to his house at Jaderua. After the entire

marriage ceremonies were over, the complainant came back to his

house, then his neighbors inquired about their health. When the

complainant informed that nothing has happened to him, then the

neighbors informed the complainant that at about 3 in the night,

the appellant alongwith one more boy had come on a motorcycle

and took away the son of the complainant, namely Mahesh with

them, on the pretext that the wife of the complainant is seriously ill

and is not speaking. Thereafter, the complainant came to

Ghosipura, Jaderua alongwith his wife and searched for his son

and the appellant, but could not get any information. Accordingly,

a report was lodged expressing suspicion that because of hot talk

in the marriage ceremony, the appellant might have abducted his

son with evil intention. The police registered the FIR (Ex.P/1) on
                                    3            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                      [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

the basis of aforesaid complaint and recorded the statements of

the witnesses. The appellant was searched and on 25/5/1997 he

was arrested. The appellant made a confessional statement

(Ex.P/11) and on the basis of disclosure statement made by the

appellant, the dead body of the deceased-Mahesh was recovered

and recovery Panchnama (Ex.P/7) was prepared. Dead body

Panchnama (Ex.P/8) and spot map (Ex.P/9) were also prepared.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The dead body of the deceased was sent for postmortem and

after completing the investigation, the police filed the charge-sheet

for offence under <a href="/doc/996413/" id="a_3">Sections 347</a>, <a href="/doc/1374258/" id="a_4">364-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">302</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a> of IPC against the

appellant and one Gangaram and co-accused Pappu alias

Laxminarayan was shown to be absconding.

<p id="p_6">3.   The Trial Court by order dated 14/10/1999 framed charge

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> of IPC against the appellant, whereas framed

charge under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_8">Section 302</a> or in the alternative 302 read with

<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_9">Section 120-B</a> of IPC against the co-accused Gangaram. The

appellant as well as co-accused Gangaram abjured their guilt and

pleaded not guilty.

examine any witness in their favor.

both the parties, convicted the appellant for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">Section

302</a> of IPC, whereas acquitted the co-accused Gangaram of all

the charges.

challenged, therefore, any reference to the co-accused Gangaram

shall be in respect of the allegations against the present appellant.

<p id="p_12">8.       Challenging the judgment and sentence dated 22/9/2005 it

is submitted by the counsel for the appellant that the entire case is

based on circumstantial evidence and the chain of circumstances

is not complete and, therefore, the appellant is entitled to be

acquitted. It is further submitted that the appellant is in jail from

the date of his arrest, and at the most the offence committed by

the appellant would be, an offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_11">Section 304</a> Part II of

I.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.       Per contra, it is submitted by the counsel for the State that

although the case is based on circumstantial evidence, but the

prosecution has proved all the circumstances beyond reasonable

doubt and the chain of circumstance is complete and it proves the

guilt of the appellant without any reasonable doubt.

     that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a
     case against an accused can be said to be fully
     established:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion
        of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.
        It may be noted here that this Court indicated that
        the circumstances concerned "must or should" and
        not "may be" established. There is not only a
        grammatical but a legal distinction between "may be
        proved" and "must be or should be proved" as was
        held by this Court in <a href="/doc/1035123/" id="a_13">Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v.
        State of Maharashtra</a> [(1973) 2 SCC 793] where the
        observations were made:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "Certainly, it is a primary principle that the
        accused must be and not merely may be guilty
        before a court can convict and the mental distance
        between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides
        vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            (2) the facts so established should be consistent
         only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused,
         that is to say, they should not be explainable on any
         other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,
            (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
         nature and tendency,
            (4) they should exclude every possible
         hypothesis except the one to be proved, and
            (5) there must be a chain of evidence so
         complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for
         the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
         accused and must show that in all human
         probability the act must have been done by the
         accused."
</blockquote><p id="p_26">12.2 The Supreme Court in the case of Padala Veera Reddy Vs.
State of A.P. reported in 1989 Supp (2) SCC 706 has held as
under :

     (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency
  unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;
     (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a
  chain so complete that there is no escape from the
  conclusion that within all human probability the crime was
  committed by the accused and none else; and
     (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain
  conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of
  any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused
  and such evidence should not only be consistent with the
  guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his
  innocence."

Khanna Reddy v. State of A.P</a>. reported in (2006) 10 SCC 172
has held as under :
</p><p id="p_30">       "26. It is now well settled that with a view to base a
   conviction on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must
   establish all the pieces of incriminating circumstances by
   reliable and clinching evidence and the circumstances so
   proved must form such a chain of events as would permit no
   conclusion other than one of guilt of the accused. The
   circumstances cannot be on any other hypothesis. It is also
   well settled that suspicion, however grave it may be, cannot
   be a substitute for a proof and the courts shall take utmost
   precaution in finding an accused guilty only on the basis of
   the circumstantial evidence. (<a href="/doc/180107416/" id="a_15">See Anil Kumar Singh v. State

  guilt is to be drawn should be fully proved and those

  accused with the crime. All the links in the chain of events
  must be established beyond a reasonable doubt and the
  established circumstances should be consistent only with
  the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally
  inconsistent with his innocence. In a case based on
  circumstantial evidence, the court has to be on its guard to
  avoid the danger of allowing suspicion to take the place of
  legal proof and has to be watchful to avoid the danger of
  being swayed by emotional considerations, howsoever
  strong they may be, to take the place of proof."

        emphasised that where a case rests squarely
        on circumstantial evidence, the inference of

        to be incompatible with the innocence of the
        accused or the guilt of any other person and
        further the circumstances from which an
        inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn

        it is the duty of the court to take care while
        evaluating circumstantial evidence. If the
        evidence adduced by the prosecution is
        reasonably capable of two inferences, the one
        in favour of the accused must be accepted. That
        apart, the circumstances relied upon must be

        the principles about the caution to be kept in
        mind by court. It has been stated therein that:
        "39. ... in a case depending largely upon
        circumstantial evidence, there is always a
        danger that conjecture or suspicion may take
        the place of legal proof. The court must satisfy
        itself that various circumstances in the chain of
        events have been established clearly and such
        completed chain of events must be such as to
        rule out a reasonable likelihood of the
        innocence of the accused. It has also been
        indicated that when the important link goes, the
        chain of circumstances gets snapped and the
        other circumstances cannot in any manner,

          As per the material on record, the informant
          searched for his son in the village in the late
          evening and next day in the morning he went to
          the fields and the dead body was found. The
          post-mortem report indicates that the death had
          occurred within 24 hours. Thus, the duration is
          not so long as to defeat or frustrate the version
          of the prosecution. Therefore, there can be no

          established before a conviction can be made on
          the basis of circumstantial evidence. These are:
          (SCC p. 185, para 153)
            "(1) the circumstances from which the
            conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
            fully established.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">            ... the circumstances concerned 'must' or
            'should' and not 'may be' established. ...

                    [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

           (2) the facts so established should be
           consistent only with the hypothesis of the
           guilt of the accused, that is to say, they
           should not be explainable on any other
           hypothesis except that the accused is
           guilty,
           (3) the circumstances should be of a
           conclusive nature and tendency,
           (4) they should exclude every possible
           hypothesis except the one to be proved,
           and
           (5) there must be a chain of evidence so
           complete as not to leave any reasonable
           ground for the conclusion consistent with
           the innocence of the accused and must
           show that in all human probability the act
           must have been done by the accused."
        Thus, in a case of circumstantial evidence, the
        prosecution must establish each instance of
        incriminating circumstance, by way of reliable
        and clinching evidence, and the circumstances
        so proved must form a complete chain of
        events, on the basis of which, no conclusion
        other than one of guilt of the accused can be
        reached. Undoubtedly, suspicion however grave
        it may be, can never be treated as a substitute
        for proof. While dealing with a case of
        circumstantial evidence, the court must take
        utmost precaution whilst finding an accused
        guilty, solely on the basis of the circumstances
        proved before it."

<p id="p_36">13.   Now, we shall consider the circumstances which have been

alleged by the prosecution, against the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_37">13.1 Motive

      According    to    the    prosecution      case,     on    22/5/1997

complainant-Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3)

had gone to attend the marriage ceremony of daughter of son-in-
</p>
<p id="p_38">law of his elder brother, where the appellant was creating

nuisance after consuming liquor. When the father of the

deceased-Mahesh, namely Hargovind (P.W.1) objected to it, then

the appellant had extended a threat for dire consequences. When

the parents of the deceased came back to their house on the next

morning, their neighbors inquired about the health of the parents

of the deceased and when they told their neighbors that nothing
                                  14            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

has happened to them, then the neighbors informed the parents of

the deceased that at about 3 in the night, the appellant alongwith

one more person, had come on a scooter and had taken away the

deceased with them on the ground that his mother is seriously ill

and is not speaking. Thereafter, the parents of the deceased tried

to search for the deceased as well as the appellant, but as they

could not locate them, therefore, the FIR (Ex.P/1) was lodged on

23/5/1997 at 18:10 hours.
</p>
<p id="p_39">     Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) are the

father and mother of the deceased. Both these witnesses have

specifically stated about the nuisance which was being created by

the appellant in the marriage ceremony of the daughter of the son-
</p>
<p id="p_40">in-law of the elder brother of Hargovind (PW-1), and when it was

objected by Hargovind (PW-1), then not only there was a scuffle

between the appellant and Hargovind (PW-1), but while leaving

the marriage ceremony, the appellant had also extended the

threat to Hargovind (PW-1). Complainant-Hargovind (PW-1) has

further stated that when they came back to their house, in the

morning of 23/5/1997, then their neighbors inquired about their

health and when he told them that nothing has happened to them,

then they were informed by the neighbors that the appellant had

come in the night and has taken away the deceased-Mahesh with

him on the ground that the mother of the deceased, namely, Rajo

w/o Hargovind (PW-3) is seriously ill and is not talking and,
                                  15            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

therefore, these witnesses went to the village of the appellant in

order to find out the deceased as well as the appellant, but they

could not locate them. Accordingly, the FIR (Ex.P/1) was lodged

by Hargovind (PW-1) on 23/5/1997 at 18:10 hours. In the FIR the

incident which had taken place in the marriage ceremony of the

relative of Hargovind (PW-1) on 22/5/1997, as well as the

nuisance created by the appellant in the said marriage, and threat

extended by the appellant to Hargovind (PW-1) is also specifically

mentioned. It is also specifically mentioned in the FIR, that on the

next day, when Hargovind (PW-1) and his wife (PW-3) came back

to their house, then their neighbors inquired about their health

condition and when they informed that they are alright and nothing

has happened to them, then their neighbors told Hargovind that at

about 3 in the night the appellant alongwith one boy had come on

a scooter and has taken away the son of Hargovind with them on

the ground that the mother of the deceased, namely, Rajo W/o

Hargovind (PW-3) is seriously ill and is not talking, and

accordingly, the deceased went alongwith the appellant and

another boy. It is also mentioned in the FIR that thereafter

Hargovind (PW-1) went to village Ghosipura, Jaderua in order to

find out the appellant and the deceased, but could not locate

them. It is also mentioned in the FIR that the appellant is already

known to Hargovind (PW-1) and a suspicion was also expressed

that as some hot talk had taken place between the appellant and
                                     16            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                        [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

Hargovind, therefore, it appears that the appellant has abducted

his son with an evil intention. The promptness with which the FIR

(Ex.P/1) was lodged clearly indicates that the appellant had some

hot talk and scuffle with Hargovind, as the appellant was creating

nuisance after consuming liquor and, therefore, the appellant had

extended a threat for dire consequences to Hargovind (PW-1).
</p>
<p id="p_41">Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) have been

cross-examined in detail, but the counsel for the appellant could

not point out anything in the cross-examination which may make

their evidence unreliable.
</p>
<p id="p_42">      Nandram (PW-7) is the brother of Hargovind (PW-1) and this

witness had also gone to attend the marriage ceremony of the

daughter of the son-in-law of his elder brother. He has also stated

that as the appellant was creating nuisance after consuming

liquor, therefore, Hargovind (PW-1) had intervened in the matter

and   the   appellant     had    extended      threat    of   facing    dire

consequences. Mohankumar (PW-9) is also one of the witnesses,

who was present in the marriage ceremony and he has also

stated about the threat extended by the appellant to Hargovind

(PW-1). Mahesh (PW-11) is also a witness, who was present in

the marriage ceremony and he has also supported the

prosecution case about the threat extended by the appellant to

Hargovind (PW-1). Whereas, Dataram (PW-5) and Siyaram (PW-
</p>
<p id="p_43">15) have turned hostile and they have not supported the
                                  17            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_44">     From the evidence of these witnesses, it is clear that there is

nothing to disbelieve the evidence of these witnesses specifically

when a detailed FIR was already lodged by Hargovind (PW-1) on

the next date of incident, i.e. 23/5/1997, and by that time the

whereabouts of the appellant and the deceased were not known.
</p>
<p id="p_45">Thus, in the light of the FIR (Ex.P/1), which was lodged by

Hargovind (PW-1) as well as the evidence of Hargovind (PW-1)

and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3), Nandram (PW-7), Mohan Kumar

(PW-9) and Mahesh (PW-11), this Court is of the considered

opinion that on 22/5/1997, during the marriage ceremony of the

daughter of the son-in-law of the elder brother of Hargovind (PW-
</p>
<p id="p_46">1), the appellant-Munshilal was creating nuisance after consuming

liquor and when it was objected by Hargovind (PW-1), then he had

a scuffle with him and while leaving the place, he had also

extended a threat to Hargovind (PW-1). It is submitted by the

Counsel for the appellant, that in a case, which is based on

circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must prove the motive,

beyond reasonable doubt, as motive is an important circumstance

and in the present case, the prosecution has not proved the

motive, beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_47">     The submission made by the Counsel for the appellant is

misconceived and is hereby rejected. It is incorrect to say that in

all the cases, which are based on circumstantial evidence, the
                                  18            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

prosecution must prove the motive, otherwise, the chain of

circumstance would not be complete.

         learned counsel for the parties and we agree
         with the learned counsel for the appellant that

         that the appellant had committed the murder of

         alone who has committed the offence, and this
         is one such case, the Court cannot hold that in
         the absence of motive of the accused being
         established by the prosecution, the accused
         cannot be held guilty of the offence. <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_28">In Ujjagar

evidence, where the other circumstances are strong and

motive has been proved beyond reasonable doubt specifically

     the learned Amicus Curiae is that the prosecution failed
     to prove any motive. It is contended that the evidence
     which was led including the recovery of bunch of keys
     from guardroom was with a view to point out that he
     wanted to commit theft of the cash lying in the office but
     no evidence was led by the prosecution to prove that how
     much cash was there in the pay office.

     is hidden in the mind of the accused and it has been held

     murderer to kill a particular person. This Court in

     following in para 18: (SCC pp. 697-98)
          "18. ... It is generally an impossible task for the
       prosecution to prove what precisely would have
       impelled the murderers to kill a particular person. All
       that prosecution in many cases could point to is the
       possible mental element which could have been the
       cause for the murder. In this connection we deem it
       useful to refer to the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/1844193/" id="a_30">State
       of H.P. v. Jeet Singh</a>: (SCC p. 380, para 33)
          '33. No doubt it is a sound principle to remember
       that every criminal act was done with a motive but its
       corollary is not that no criminal offence would have
       been committed if the prosecution has failed to prove
       the precise motive of the accused to commit it. When

     the prosecution succeeded in showing the possibility of
     some ire for the accused towards the victim, the
     inability to further put on record the manner in which
     such ire would have swelled up in the mind of the
     offender to such a degree as to impel him to commit the
     offence cannot be construed as a fatal weakness of the

       "54. So far as the issue of motive is concerned, the

     the motive, upon taking into consideration the evidence

     as against the initial story that the accused was enraged
     against the victim, because the victim used to tease him
     on the point of his marriage with a bar girl Helen
     Fernandes. Motive is a mental state, which is always
     locked in the inner compartment of the brain of the
     accused and inability of the prosecution to establish the

under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">             "33. In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive
     assumes great significance and importance, for the
     reason that the absence of motive would put the court on
     its guard and cause it to scrutinise each piece of
     evidence very closely in order to ensure that suspicion,
     emotion or conjecture do not take the place of proof.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">             34. <a href="/doc/1107450/" id="a_33">In Subedar Tewari v. State of U.P</a>. this Court
     observed as under: (SCC p. 115, para 20)
           "20. ... The evidence regarding existence of motive
       which operates in the mind of an assassin is very often
       than (sic) not within the reach of others. The motive
       may not even be known to the victim of the crime. The
       motive may be known to the assassin and no one else
       may know what gave birth to the evil thought in the
       mind of the assassin."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">         35. Similarly, in <a href="/doc/144689/" id="a_34">Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of
     Bihar</a>, this Court held as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">         "In a case of circumstantial evidence, the evidence
     bearing on the guilt of the accused nevertheless
     becomes untrustworthy and unreliable because most
     often it is only the perpetrator of the crime alone who
     knows as to what circumstances prompted him to adopt a
     certain course of action leading to the commission of the
     crime. Therefore, if the evidence on record suggest
     sufficient/necessary motive to commit a crime it may be
     conceived that the accused had committed it."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">     36. Thus, if the issue is examined in the light of the
     aforesaid settled legal proposition, we may concur with
     the courts below on the said aspect."</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">      Thus, it is clear that the appellant had not only extended the
threat and in order to execute the same, he acted promptly, so
that he can take away the son of Hargovind (PW-1) prior to their
return to their house. Thus, it is held that the prosecution has
proved the motive, beyond reasonable doubt.

                      [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

State of U.P., reported in (2014) 5 SCC 509 has held as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">         19. It is trite law that a conviction cannot be
         recorded against the accused merely on the
         ground that the accused was last seen with the
         deceased. In other words, a conviction cannot
         be based on the only circumstance of last seen
         together. The conduct of the accused and the
         fact of last seen together plus other
         circumstances have to be looked into. Normally,
         last seen theory comes into play when the time
         gap, between the point of time when the
         accused and the deceased were seen last alive
         and when the deceased is found dead, is so
         small that the possibility of any person other
         than the accused being the perpetrator of the
         crime becomes impossible. It will be difficult in
         some cases to positively establish that the
         deceased was last seen with the accused when
         there is a long gap and possibility of other
         persons coming in between exists. However, if
         the prosecution, on the basis of reliable
         evidence, establishes that the missing person
         was seen in the company of the accused and
         was never seen thereafter, it is obligatory on the
         part of the accused to explain the
         circumstances in which the missing person and
         the accused parted company. Reference may
         be made to the judgment of this Court in
         <a href="/doc/52554359/" id="a_35">Sahadevan v. State</a> [(2003) 1 SCC 534]. In
         such a situation, the proximity of time between
         the event of last seen together and the recovery
         of the dead body or the skeleton, as the case
         may be, may not be of much consequence.
         PWs 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 10 have all deposed that
         the accused was last seen with Diana. But, as
         already indicated, to record a conviction, that
         itself would not be sufficient and the prosecution
         has to complete the chain of circumstances to
         bring home the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>

</p><p id="p_59">         27. The last seen theory comes into play where
         the time-gap between the point of time when
         the accused and the deceased were last seen
         alive and when the deceased is found dead is
         so small that the possibility of any person other
         than the accused being the author of the crime
         becomes impossible, vide <a href="/doc/678574/" id="a_36">Mohd. Azad v. State

         754]
     Thus, it is clear that the sole circumstance of last seen
together would not be sufficient to hold that the accused is guilty
of committing the offence, provided there should be close
proximity between the last seen together and the time of death.
Further, there should be some more circumstance to indicate
towards the guilt of the accused.

<p id="p_61">     Rajo W/o Bhagri (PW-2) and Usha (PW-4) are the witnesses

of last seen together. They have stated that at about 3 AM in the

night, they were sleeping outside their house and at that time the

appellant came there on a scooter and started knocking at the

door of the house of Mahesh. When this witness inquired as to

why he is trying to awake deceased-Mahesh, then he disclosed

his identity as appellant-Munshilal; brother-in-law of deceased-
</p>
<p id="p_62">Mahesh. When this witness inquired that as to why the appellant

has come, then he informed that Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) is

seriously ill. When Rajo W/o Bhagri (PW-2) told that Rajo W/o

Hargovind (PW-3) had gone in the evening only, then the

appellant informed that Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) has fallen

sick at about 12 in the night and at about 1 AM Hargovind (PW-1)

has instructed the appellant to bring the deceased-Mahesh. It is

also submitted that one more boy was standing alongwith the

appellant who was introduced as the brother of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_63">Thereafter, the appellant and the another boy took away the

deceased-Mahesh with them on scooter. On the next day at about

10 AM, when the parents of the deceased-Mahesh came back,

then she inquired about their health condition. They informed that

nothing has happened to them. Thereafter, Rajo W/o Bhagri (PW-
</p>
<p id="p_64">2) also inquired as to when Mahesh met with them, then

Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) informed that

Mahesh had not reached there. Thereafter, Hargovind (PW-1) and

his wife (PW-3) went to Gwalior and came back in the evening of

the same day and informed that they could not trace out the

whereabouts of Mahesh. It was further stated that the dead body

of Mahesh was recovered on the third day.
</p>
<p id="p_65">     Gangaram (PW-6) has stated that he was informed by two

ladies, namely Rajjobai and Ramdei that the appellant had taken

away Mahesh with them and had informed that the mother of

Mahesh is seriously ill. On 23/5/1997 at about 10 AM when

Hargovind (PW-1) and his wife Rajo (PW-3) came back to their

house, they inquired about their health condition, then Hargovind

(PW-1) and his wife Rajo (PW-3) informed that they are perfectly

alright. Hargovind (PW-1) also informed that he had some hot talk

with the appellant in the marriage ceremony of the daughter of

Dataram and at that time the appellant had extended a threat.
</p><p id="p_66">                                  25            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

Thereafter, Hargovind (PW-1) and his wife Rajo (PW-3) went to

Gwalior in search of their son and on the same day Hargovind

(PW-1) and his wife Rajo (PW-3) came back and informed that

neither they could found the appellant nor could know about the

whereabouts of their son. Thereafter, this witness alongwith

Hargovind (PW-1) went to Police Station Kotwali Morena and

lodged a report. This witness denied the arrest of the co-accused

in his presence although he admitted his signatures on the arrest

memo of the appellant Ex.P/4. This witness further denied the

recording of any confessional statement made, by the appellant,

but he admitted his signatures on the memo of the appellant

Ex.P/2. This witness was declared hostile for the limited purpose

and was cross-examined. In cross-examination this witness has

admitted that the appellant had made a disclosure statement that

he has hidden his scooter in the house of Prakash S/o Bhagirath

Jatav and thus, memo Ex.P/2 was prepared. He also admitted

about the arrest of the co-accused Pappu Jatav and also admitted

his signatures on the arrest memo Ex.P/4. Thus, from the

evidence of Rajo W/o Bhagri (PW-2), Usha (PW-4) and Gangaram

(PW-6), it is clear that in the intervening night of 22-23/5/1997 at

about 3 AM, appellant went to the house of the deceased-Mahesh

and on the false pretext that the mother of the deceased is

seriously ill and is not talking and, accordingly, took away

deceased-Mahesh with him. The evidence of Rajo W/o Bhagri
                                  26            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

(PW-2) and Usha (PW-4) is corroborated by the evidence of

Gangaram (PW-6), who has specifically stated that he was

informed by Rajo W/o Bhagri (PW-2) and Usha (PW-4) that

appellant has taken away deceased-Mahesh with him at about 3

in the morning on the pretext that the mother of the deceased was

seriously ill. The conduct of these witnesses in enquiring about the

health condition of Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind

(PW-3) on their return from the marriage ceremony also clearly

shows that these witnesses are truthful witnesses. As already

pointed out, a detailed FIR was lodged on 23/5/1997 at about

18:10 hours in which each and every aspect of the matter has

been specifically mentioned, thus, it is clear that the appellant in

the intervening night of 22-23/5/1997 had come to the house of

the deceased at about 3 in the morning and on the false pretext

that the mother of the deceased is seriously ill took away the

deceased-Mahesh with him on a scooter.

<p id="p_67">13.3 Recovery of Dead body of Mahesh, on the disclosure

Statement of the appellant

     Mahesh (PW-11) has stated about the nuisance which was

being created by the appellant at the time of marriage ceremony.
</p>
<p id="p_68">He has further stated that after two days of the incident the

appellant was arrested by the police and arrest memo Ex.P/10

was prepared, which bears his signatures. The appellant had

given a confessional statement and had informed that the dead
                                    27            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                       [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

body of Mahesh is lying near a Nala. Thereafter, they went to

village Jarah alongwith the police as well as the appellant. The

dead body of the deceased was pointed out by the appellant and

at that time one Gamchha was wrapped around the neck of the

deceased. The memo of recovery of dead body is Ex.P/7, Safina

Form is Ex.P/9 and Dead body Panchayatnama is Ex.P/10. Thus,

Mahesh (PW-11) has proved making of confessional statement by

the appellant to the police in which he has disclosed the

information about the place, where the dead body of the

deceased, was lying.
</p>
<p id="p_69">     Nekram (PW-10) has also stated that on 25/5/1997, on the

disclosure made by the appellant, the dead body of the deceased

was recovered and the dead body recovery memo (Ex.P/7) was

prepared, which bears his signatures, Safina Form (Ex.P/8) was

prepared which bears his signatures and dead body Panchnama

(Ex.P/9) was also prepared, which bears his signatures.
</p>
<p id="p_70">     S.S. Raghuvanshi (PW-20) is the Investigating Officer and

this witness has also proved the recovery of dead body at the

instance of the appellant. Thus, it is clear that on the disclosure

statement made by the appellant, the dead body of the deceased

was recovered from a Nala in the presence of Nekram (PW-10),

Mahesh (PW-11) as well as S.S. Raghuvanshi (PW-20). Thus, it is

clear that the prosecution has proved the recovery of dead body at

the instance of the appellant.

                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

     It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant, that since

the dead body of the deceased was recovered from an open

place, therefore, it cannot be said that the dead body of the

deceased was recovered at the instance of the appellant. The

submission   made    by   the    Counsel     for   the    appellant    is

misconceived and is hereby rejected. It is the prosecution case,

that the place from where the dead body was recovered was an

isolated place. Although the dead body was not hidden, but it was

the appellant, who was aware of the fact, about the location of the

dead body. It is not the case of the defence, that the dead body of

the deceased Mahesh was already recovered, prior to making of

disclosure statement, made by the appellant. Thus, it is clear that

the dead body of the deceased Mahesh was recovered, only after

the disclosure statement was made by the appellant.

<p id="p_72">     The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/185993401/" id="a_38">Charandas Swami v.
State of Gujarat</a>, reported in (2017) 7 SCC 177, has held as
under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">         "57. The dead body of deceased Gadadharanandji
     was found on 4-5-1998 in a burnt condition in a ditch
     behind the house of PW 50 in Barothi Village in
     Rajasthan. How the dead body of Gadadharanandji
     reached that spot was revealed by none other than
     Accused 3. In what circumstances burnt injuries were
     caused on the dead body of Gadadharanandji, no
     prosecution witness has spoken about that. Be that as it
     may, the fact that the dead body recovered from Barothi
     Village on 4-5-1998 was that of Gadadharanandji could
     be known only after Accused 3, during the course of
     investigation, made a disclosure about the location where
     he had disposed off the dead body of Gadadharanandji.</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">     Till the aforesaid disclosure was made, in the records of
     Rajasthan Police, the dead body was noted as that of an
     unknown person. If, Accused 3 had not disclosed to the
                             29            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

investigating officer about the location where the dead
body was dumped by him -- which information was
personally known to him and at best Accused 5 and none
else, then the investigation would not have made any
headway.
</p><p id="p_74">   58. The disclosure made by Accused 3 to the
investigating officer was recorded in the panchnama, Ext.
188, when he had led the police party to the spot where
the dead body was dumped by him. That location
matched with the location from where the dead body of
an unknown person was recovered on 4-5-1998 on the
information given by PW 50 to the local police at Barothi.
The fact that the dead body was already recovered from
the same place on 4-5-1998 and so noted in the public
records in the State of Rajasthan does not undermine the
admissibility of the disclosure made by Accused 3 to the
investigating officer about the location where the dead
body of Gadadharanandji was dumped by him, which
information was exclusively within the personal
knowledge of Accused 3. The fact that the dead body
recovered on 4-5-1998 was of Gadadharanandji, was
unravelled and discovered only after the results of its
medical examination became available to the
investigating agency. Till then, it was considered to be of
an unknown person. The courts below have accepted the
case of the prosecution that the disclosure made by
Accused 3 about the location where the dead body of
Gadadharanandji was dumped by him, was admissible
under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_39">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act. The appellants,
however, take exception to that by relying on the reported
decisions.
</p><p id="p_75">   59. In our view, the decision in Navjot Sandhu has
adverted to all the previous decisions and restated the
legal position. In para 114, while considering the
arguments advanced by the parties regarding the sweep
of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_40">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, the Court formulated
two questions which read thus: (SCC p. 696)
   "(i) Whether the discovery of fact referred to in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_41">Section
27</a> should be confined only to the discovery of a material
object and the knowledge of the accused in relation
thereto or the discovery could be in respect of his mental
state or knowledge in relation to certain things --
concrete or non-concrete.
</p><p id="p_76">   (ii) Whether it is necessary that the discovery of fact
should be by the person making the disclosure or directly
at his instance. The subsequent event of discovery by the
police with the aid of information furnished by the accused
</p><p id="p_77">-- whether can be put against him under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_42">Section 27</a>."
</p><p id="p_78">                             30            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

In the context of these questions, the argument of the
counsel for the State in that case has been adverted to in
paras 115 to 118. The Court then after analysing <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_43">Section
27</a> of the Evidence Act, in paras 120 to 144 adverted to
the relevant decisions on the point. In paras 120 and 121,
the Court noted thus: (Navjot Sandhu case, SCC pp. 700-
</p><p id="p_79">02)
   "120. The history of case-law on the subject of
confessions under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_44">Section 27</a> unfolds divergent views
and approaches. The divergence was mainly on twin
aspects: (i) Whether the facts contemplated by <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_45">Section
27</a> are physical, material objects or the mental facts of
which the accused giving the information could be said to
be aware of. Some Judges have gone to the extent of
holding that the discovery of concrete facts, that is to say
material objects, which can be exhibited in the Court are
alone covered by <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_46">Section 27</a>. (ii) The other controversy
was on the point regarding the extent of admissibility of a
disclosure statement. In some cases, a view was taken
that any information, which served to connect the object
with the offence charged, was admissible under Section
</p><p id="p_80">27. The decision of the Privy Council in Kotayya case
which has been described as a locus classicus, had set
at rest much of the controversy that centred round the
interpretation of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_47">Section 27</a>. To a great extent the legal
position has got crystallised with the rendering of this
decision. The authority of the Privy Council's decision has
not been questioned in any of the decisions of the highest
court either in the pre-or post-independence era. Right
from the 1950s, till the advent of the new century and till
date, the passages in this famous decision are being
approvingly quoted and reiterated by the Judges of this
Apex Court. Yet, there remain certain grey areas as
demonstrated by the arguments advanced on behalf of
the State.
</p><p id="p_81">   121. The first requisite condition for utilising <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_48">Section 27</a>
in support of the prosecution case is that the investigating
police officer should depose that he discovered a fact in
consequence of the information received from an
accused person in police custody. Thus, there must be a
discovery of fact not within the knowledge of police officer
as a consequence of information received. Of course, it is
axiomatic that the information or disclosure should be
free from any element of compulsion. The next
component of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_49">Section 27</a> relates to the nature and extent
of information that can be proved. It is only so much of
the information as relates *distinctly to the fact thereby
                              31            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                 [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

discovered* that can be proved and nothing more. It is
explicitly clarified in the section that there is no taboo
against receiving such information in evidence merely
because it amounts to a confession. At the same time,
the last clause makes it clear that it is not the
confessional part that is admissible but it is only such
information or part of it, which relates distinctly to the fact
discovered by means of the information furnished. Thus,
the information conveyed in the statement to the police
ought to be dissected if necessary so as to admit only the
information of the nature mentioned in the section. The
rationale behind this provision is that, if a fact is actually
discovered in consequence of the information supplied, it
affords some guarantee that the information is true and
can therefore be safely allowed to be admitted in
evidence as an incriminating factor against the accused.
As pointed out by the Privy Council in Kotayya case:
(SCC OnLine PC : AIR p. 70, para 10)
    '... clearly the extent of the information admissible
must depend on the exact nature of the fact discovered'
and the information must distinctly relate to that fact.
Elucidating the scope of this section, the Privy Council
speaking through Sir John Beaumont said: (SCC OnLine
PC : AIR p. 70, para 10)
    '... Normally the section is brought into operation when
a person in police custody produces from some place of
concealment some object, such as a dead body, a
weapon, or ornaments, said to be connected with the
crime of which the informant is accused.'
(emphasis supplied)
We have emphasised the word "normally" because the
illustrations given by the learned Judge are not
exhaustive. The next point to be noted is that the Privy
Council rejected the argument of the counsel appearing
for the Crown that the fact discovered is the physical
object produced and that any and every information which
relates distinctly to that object can be proved. Upon this
view, the information given by a person that the weapon
produced is the one used by him in the commission of the
murder will be admissible in its entirety. Such contention
of the Crown's counsel was emphatically rejected with the
following words: (SCC OnLine PC: AIR p. 70, para 10)
    '... If this be the effect of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_50">Section 27</a>, little substance
would remain in the ban imposed by the two preceding
sections on confessions made to the police, or by
persons in police custody. That ban was presumably
                              32            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                 [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

inspired by the fear of the legislature that a person under
police influence might be induced to confess by the
exercise of undue pressure. But if all that is required to lift
the ban be the inclusion in the confession of information
relating to an object subsequently produced, it seems
reasonable to suppose that the persuasive powers of the
police will prove equal to the occasion, and that in
practice the ban will lose its effect.'
Then, their Lordships proceeded to give a lucid exposition
of the expression "fact discovered" in the following
passage, which is quoted time and again by this Court:
(SCC OnLine PC : AIR p. 70, para 10)
   '... In their Lordships' view, it is fallacious to treat the
"fact discovered" within the section as equivalent to the
object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place
from which the object is produced and the knowledge of
the accused as to this, and the information given must
relate distinctly to this fact. Information as to past user, or
the past history, of the object produced is not related to
its discovery in the setting in which it is discovered.
Information supplied by a person in custody that "I will
produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house" does
not lead to the discovery of a knife; knives were
discovered many years ago. *It leads to the discovery of
the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the
informant to his knowledge *, and if the knife is proved to
have been used in the commission of the offence, the
fact discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement
the words be added "with which I stabbed A", these words
are inadmissible since they do not relate to the discovery
of the knife in the house of the informant.'"
(emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_82">   60. This Court has restated the legal position that the
facts need not be self-probatory and the word "fact" as
contemplated by <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_51">Section 27</a> is not limited to "actual
physical material object". It further noted that the
discovery of fact arises by reason of the fact that the
information given by the accused exhibited the knowledge
or the mental awareness of the informant as to its
existence at a particular place. In para 128, the Court
noted the statement of law in Udai Bhan that: (Navjot
Sandhu case, SCC p. 705)
    "128. ... '11. ... A discovery of a fact includes the
object found, the place from which it is produced and the
knowledge of the accused as to its existence.' (Udai
Bhan case, AIR p. 1118, para 11)"
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">    The Court then posed a question as to what would be
                            33            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
               [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

the position if the physical object was not recovered at
the instance of the accused. That issue has been
answered on the basis of precedents, as can be
discerned from paras 129 to 132 of the reported
judgment.</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">    61. In para 139, the Court noticed the decision in
Damu which had dealt with the case where broken glass
piece was recovered from the spot matched with broken
tail lamp and in para 37 of that decision, the Court
observed thus: (Navjot Sandhu case, SCC p. 709)
    "139. ... '37. How did the particular information lead to
the discovery of the fact? No doubt, recovery of dead
body of Dipak from the same canal was antecedent to the
information which PW 44 obtained. If nothing more was
recovered pursuant to and subsequent to obtaining the
information from the accused, there would not have been
any discovery of any fact at all. But when the broken
glass piece was recovered from that spot and that piece
was found to be part of the tail lamp of the motorcycle of
A-2 Guruji, it can safely be held that the investigating
officer discovered the fact that A-2 Guruji had carried the
dead body on that particular motorcycle up to the spot.'
(Damu case, SCC p. 283)"
</p><p id="p_84">    62. The Court then noted that the above view taken in
Damu case does not make it a dent on the observations
made and the legal position spelt out in Om Prakash
which distinguishes Damu case because there was
discovery of a related physical object at least in part. We
may usefully reproduce paras 142 to 144 of the same
reported decision, wherein the Court observed thus:
(Navjot Sandhu case, SCC pp. 710-11)
    "142. There is one more point which we would like to
discuss i.e. whether pointing out a material object by the
accused furnishing the information is a necessary
concomitant of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_52">Section 27</a>. We think that the answer
should be in the negative. Though in most of the cases
the person who makes the disclosure himself leads the
police officer to the place where an object is concealed
and points out the same to him, however, it is not
essential that there should be such pointing out in order
to make the information admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_53">Section 27</a>. It
could very well be that on the basis of information
furnished by the accused, the investigating officer may go
to the spot in the company of other witnesses and
recover the material object. By doing so, the investigating
officer will be discovering a fact viz. the concealment of
an incriminating article and the knowledge of the accused
furnishing the information about it. In other words, where
                             34            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

the information furnished by the person in custody is
verified by the police officer by going to the spot
mentioned by the informant and finds it to be correct, that
amounts to discovery of fact within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_54">Section 27</a>. Of course, it is subject to the rider that the
information so furnished was the immediate and
proximate cause of discovery. If the police officer chooses
not to take the informant accused to the spot, it will have
no bearing on the point of admissibility under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_55">Section 27</a>,
though it may be one of the aspects that goes into
evaluation of that particular piece of evidence.
</p><p id="p_85">   143. How the clause "as relates distinctly to the fact
thereby discovered" has to be understood is the next
point that deserves consideration. The interpretation of
this clause is not in doubt. Apart from Kotayya case
various decisions of this Court have elucidated and
clarified the scope and meaning of the said portion of
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_56">Section 27</a>. The law has been succinctly stated in
Inayatullah case. Sarkaria, J. analysed the ingredients of
the section and explained the ambit and nuances of this
particular clause in the following words: (Inayatullah case,
SCC p. 832, para 12)
       '12. ... The *last* but the most important condition
   is that only "so much of the information" as relates
   *distinctly* to the fact *thereby* discovered is
   admissible. The rest of the information has to be
   excluded. The word "distinctly" means "directly",
   "indubitably", "strictly", "unmistakably". The word has
   been advisedly used to limit and define the scope of
   the provable information. The phrase "distinctly relates
   to the fact thereby discovered" is the linchpin of the
   provision. This phrase refers to that part of the
   information supplied by the accused which is the
   *direct* and *immediate* cause of the discovery. The
   reason behind this partial lifting of the ban against
   confessions and statements made to the police, is that
   if a fact is actually discovered in consequence of
   information given by the accused, it affords some
   guarantee of truth of that part, and that part only, of
   the information which was the clear, immediate and
   proximate cause of the discovery. No such guarantee
   or assurance attaches to the rest of the statement
   which may be indirectly or remotely related to the fact
   discovered.'
In the light of the legal position thus clarified, this Court
excluded a part of the disclosure statement to which we
have already adverted.

</p><p id="p_87">   144. In Bodhraj v. State of J&amp;K this Court after
referring to the decisions on the subject observed thus:
(SCC p. 58, para 18)
   '18. ... The words "so much of such information" as
relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, are very
important and the whole force of the section concentrates
on them. Clearly the extent of the information admissible
must depend on the exact nature of the fact discovered to
which such information is required to relate.'"
(emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_88">   63. Reliance was also placed on the recent decision of
this Court in Dupare. The Court adverted to the relevant
precedents and observed thus, in paras 23 to 29: (SCC
pp. 267-70)
   "23. While accepting or rejecting the factors of
discovery, certain principles are to be kept in mind. The
Privy Council in <a href="/doc/254739/" id="a_57">Pulukuri Kotayya v. King Emperor</a> has
held thus: (SCC OnLine PC : IA p. 77)
   '... it is fallacious to treat the "fact discovered" within

paras 11-13)
   '11. Although the interpretation and scope of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_60">Section
27</a> has been the subject of several authoritative
pronouncements, its application to concrete cases is not
always free from difficulty. It will therefore be worthwhile
at the outset, to have a short and swift glance at the
section and be reminded of its requirements. The section
says:
</p><p id="p_90">                             36            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005

       "27. How much of information received from
   accused may be proved --Provided that, when any
   fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of
   information received from a person accused of any
   offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of
   such information, whether it amounts to a confession
   or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
   discovered, may be proved."
</p><p id="p_91">   12. The expression "provided that" together with the
phrase "whether it amounts to a confession or not" show
that the section is in the nature of an exception to the
preceding provisions particularly <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_61">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_62">26</a>. It is
not necessary in this case to consider if this section
qualifies, to any extent, <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_63">Section 24</a>, also. It will be seen
that the first condition necessary for bringing this section
into operation is the discovery of a fact, albeit a relevant
fact, in consequence of the information received from a
person accused of an offence. The second is that the
discovery of such fact must be deposed to. The third is
that at the time of the receipt of the information the
accused must be in police custody. The last but the most
important condition is that only "so much of the
information" as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
discovered is admissible. The rest of the information has
to be excluded. The word "distinctly" means "directly",
"indubitably", "strictly", "unmistakably". The word has been
advisedly used to limit and define the scope of the
provable information. The phrase "distinctly relates to the
fact thereby discovered" is the linchpin of the provision.
This phrase refers to that part of the information supplied
by the accused which is the direct and immediate cause
of the discovery. The reason behind this partial lifting of
the ban against confessions and statements made to the
police, is that if a fact is actually discovered in
consequence of information given by the accused, it
affords some guarantee of truth of that part, and that part
only, of the information which was the clear, immediate
and proximate cause of the discovery. No such guarantee
or assurance attaches to the rest of the statement which
may be indirectly or remotely related to the fact
discovered.
</p><p id="p_92">   13. *At one time it was held that the expression "fact
discovered" in the section is restricted to a physical or
material fact which can be perceived by the senses, and
that it does not include a mental fact (see Sukhan v.
Emperor and <a href="/doc/883880/" id="a_64">Ganu Chandra Kashid v. Emperor</a>). Now it
is fairly settled that the expression "fact discovered"
includes not only the physical object produced, but also
                             37            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of
the accused as to this * (see <a href="/doc/254739/" id="a_65">Pulukuri Kotayya v. King
Emperor</a> and <a href="/doc/266197/" id="a_66">Udai Bhan v. State of U.P</a>.).'

after referring to the decision in Pulukuri Kotayya, the
Court adverted to seizure of clothes of the deceased
which were concealed by the accused. In that context,
the Court opined that: (Aftab Ahmad Anasari case, SCC
p. 596, para 40)
   '40. ... the part of the disclosure statement, namely,
that the appellant was ready to show the place where he
had concealed the clothes of the deceased is clearly
admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_68">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act because
the same relates distinctly to the discovery of the clothes
of the deceased from that very place. The contention that
even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the
clothes of the deceased were recovered from the house
of the sister of the appellant pursuant to the voluntary
disclosure statement made by the appellant, the
prosecution has failed to prove that the clothes so
recovered belonged to the deceased and therefore, the
recovery of the clothes should not be treated as an
incriminating circumstance, is devoid of merits.'
</p><p id="p_94">   26. <a href="/doc/557368/" id="a_69">In State of Maharashtra v. Damu</a> it has been held
as follows: (SCC p. 283, para 35)
   '35. ... It is now well settled that recovery of an object
is not discovery of a fact as envisaged in [<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_70">Section 27</a> of
the Evidence Act, 1872]. The decision of the Privy Council
in <a href="/doc/254739/" id="a_71">Pulukuri Kotayya v. King Emperor</a> is the most quoted
authority for supporting the interpretation that the "fact
discovered" envisaged in the section embraces the place
from which the object was produced, the knowledge of
the accused as to it, but the information given must relate
distinctly to that effect.'
The similar principle has been laid down in <a href="/doc/1037935/" id="a_72">State of
Maharashtra v. Suresh</a>, <a href="/doc/1627296/" id="a_73">State of Punjab v. Gurnam Kaur</a>,

</p><p id="p_95">   27. In the case at hand, as is perceptible, the recovery
had taken place when the appellant was accused of an
offence, he was in custody of a police officer, the recovery
had taken place in consequence of information furnished
by him and the panch witnesses have supported the
seizure and nothing has been brought on record to
discredit their testimony.

</p><p id="p_97">   28. Additionally, another aspect can also be taken note
of. The fact that the appellant had led the police officer to
find out the spot where the crime was committed, and the
tap where he washed the clothes eloquently speak of his
conduct as the same is admissible in evidence to
establish his conduct. In this context we may refer with
profit to the authority in <a href="/doc/342936/" id="a_78">Prakash Chand v. State (Delhi
Admn</a>.) wherein the Court after referring to the decision in
H.P. Admn. v. Om Prakash held thus: (Prakash Chand
case, SCC p. 95, para 8)
    '8. ... There is a clear distinction between the conduct
of a person against whom an offence is alleged, which is
admissible under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_79">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act, if such
conduct is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact
and the statement made to a police officer in the course
of an investigation which is hit by <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_80">Section 162</a> of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. What is excluded by <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_81">Section 162</a>
of the Code of Criminal Procedure is the statement made
to a police officer in the course of investigation and not
the evidence relating to the conduct of an accused
person (not amounting to a statement) when confronted
or questioned by a police officer during the course of an
investigation. For example, the evidence of the
circumstance, simpliciter, that an accused person led a
police officer and pointed out the place where stolen
articles or weapons which might have been used in the
commission of the offence were found hidden, would be
admissible as conduct, under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_82">Section 8</a> of the Evidence
Act, irrespective of whether any statement by the

        the site plan prepared by the investigating
        officer he did not give particulars or details of
        that place. Second is that the investigating
        officer did not mention about the amount of
        "mud and morang" noticed near the pit. The
        third is that he did not take into custody the
        wooden planks or the mud from the said place.
        The last is he did not indicate in the site plan
        that blood was found at that place nor did he
        take the bloodstained earth therefrom. After
        highlighting the above lapses of the
        investigating officer the Division Bench
        concluded thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_56">           "These omissions would, therefore, in our
           opinion clearly negative the theory set up
           by the prosecution that three dead bodies

           of the accused. By examining the
           statements of these two witnesses, namely,
           Tarawati and Shital Prasad, in the light of
           these circumstances, we would not be able

        dropping down such a sturdy circumstance
        (disinterment of the three dead bodies at the

        tenuous. It is apparent that the Division Bench
        had strained to ferret out some fragile grounds
        for sidelining such a highly incriminating
        circumstance. The very approach of the High
        Court in this regard does not merit approval. It is
        not possible to understand the rationale of the
        reasoning that if an investigating officer did not

        note down certain details that would render the

appellant only, who knew the place, where the dead body was
lying. Thus, this is one of the strong circumstance against the
appellant, which has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

13.4 Recovery of scooter:</blockquote>

<p id="p_102">      Prakash (PW-16) has specifically stated that the appellant

Mahesh has parked his scooter in his house on the pretext that it

has run out of fuel and, therefore, he may be permitted to park his

scooter, but the appellant never came back to take back his

scooter and the seizure memo of the scooter is Ex.P/14. Thus, it

is clear that Prakash (PW-16) has specifically proved that the

appellant-Munshilal had parked his scooter in his house on the

pretext that there is no fuel in the scooter and thereafter he never

came back to take away his scooter.
</p>
<p id="p_103">14.   Thus, in the considered opinion of this Court, the

prosecution has succeeded in proving the following circumstances

against the appellant :
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">        (i)     Motive.
        (ii)    Last Seen Together.
</pre><p id="p_104">        (iii)   Recovery of Dead body at the instance of
                the appellant.
</p><p id="p_105">        (iv)    Recovery of Scooter, which was used for
                abducting the deceased Mahesh.
</p><p id="p_106">        (v)     The deceased Mahesh had died homicidal
                death.
</p>
<p id="p_107">14.1 Thus, it is clear that the prosecution has established all the

circumstances beyond reasonable doubt. It is well established

principle of law that where a case is based on circumstantial

evidence, then the prosecution must prove each and every chain

of said circumstance and must prove that the complete chain of
                                  42            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                     [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

circumstance points towards the guilt of the accused. If all the

circumstances, which have been proved by the prosecution are

considered, then it is clear that the chain of circumstance is

complete. The appellant had a motive, as he had picked up a

quarrel with Hargovind (PW-1) in the marriage ceremony and had

also extended a threat and in order to fulfill the said threat, it

appears that he went to the house of Hargovind (PW-1) in the

night hours at about 3 AM and on the false pretext that the mother

of the deceased-Mahesh, namely, Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) is

seriously ill, took away the deceased with him and when

Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind (PW-3) came back to

their house on the next morning, then it was inquired by their

neighbors about their health and when they informed that they are

perfectly alright, then Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o Hargovind

(PW-3) were told by their neighbors that in the night hours at

about 3 AM the appellant had come alongwith one boy and had

taken away their son; deceased-Mahesh, on the pretext that the

mother of the deceased is seriously ill and they are calling the

deceased-Mahesh. Thereafter, Hargovind (PW-1) and Rajo W/o

Hargovind (PW-3) went to village Ghosipura, Jaderua in search of

the appellant as well as their son and when they could not find out

the whereabouts of the appellant as well as the deceased-
</p>
<p id="p_108">Mahesh, then on 23/5/1997 at 18:10 hours an FIR was lodged by

Hargovind (PW-1) in which a detailed description of each and
                                     43            Criminal Appeal No.770/2005
                        [Munshilal Vs. State of M.P.]

every aspect was given and a suspicion was specifically

expressed that because of the threat extended by the appellant, it

appears that the appellant must have abducted their son with an

evil intention. Thereafter, the appellant was arrested and on his

disclosure statement, the dead body of the deceased was

recovered from a place near a Nala. As per the postmortem

report, the death of the deceased was because of strangulation,

i.e. homicidal death.
</p>
<p id="p_109">15.   Accordingly, all the above mentioned circumstances indicate

towards the guilt of the appellant. Accordingly, this court is of the

considered opinion that the prosecution has succeeded in

establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty

of committing murder of deceased-Mahesh. The manner in which

the incident has taken place, it cannot be said that the act of the

appellant, would fall under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_93">Section 304</a> Part I of I.P.C.              Thus,

appellant-Munshilal is held guilty of committing offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_94">Section 302</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_110">16.   So far as the question of sentence is concerned, the

minimum sentence provided for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_95">Section 302</a> of IPC

is life imprisonment. Under such circumstance, the sentence

awarded by the trial court does not call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_111">17.   Accordingly, the judgment and sentence dated 22/9/2005

passed by the Fifth Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court),

Morena in S.T. No.272/1998 is hereby affirmed.

        The appellant is in jail and is undergoing the jail sentence.
