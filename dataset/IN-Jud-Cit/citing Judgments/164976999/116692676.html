           business inter alia of processing, marketing and exporting rice. The
           plaintiff no. 1 is the subsidiary of the plaintiff no. 2. The predecessor
           of the plaintiff no.1, „M/s Aromatic Foodstuff Trading&#x27;, coined and
           conceived the plaintiffs‟ mark „ROYAL&#x27; in 1989. The mark was later
           assigned to „M/s Kusha Inc.‟ (a wholly owned subsidiary of the
           plaintiff no.1, incorporated under the laws of the State of California,
           the United States of America) on 14.10.2000, who in turn assigned
           them to the plaintiff no. 1 vide Assignment Deed dated 16.12.2008. It
           is asserted that an application for registration of the mark was filed
           and the mark was registered in the year 2003. Thereafter, „M/s Kusha
           Inc.‟ assigned the plaintiffs‟ marks to the present plaintiff no. 1.

           the plaintiffs‟ marks have been put to extensive and continuous
           commercial use in India and rice has also been exported
           internationally under the said mark. The plaintiffs submit that they

           distribution of its Basmati Rice.
</p><p id="p_18">           11.      It is the case of the plaintiffs that in April, 2022, the plaintiff
           no.1 learnt of the defendant‟s use of the impugned mark through the
           plaintiffs‟ network of sales teams. The plaintiffs assert that attempts to
           arrive at an amicable settlement of the dispute failed. It is asserted that
           adoption of the impugned mark, being identical/deceptively similar to
           that of the plaintiffs‟ mark, is bound to result in causing irreparable

           mark „ROYAL&#x27; is distinguishable from other marks with the word
           „ROYAL&#x27; because it is in a label/logo/device format. The defendant

           trade.
</p><p id="p_22">           14.      It is further asserted that the defendant is using the word
           „ROYAL&#x27; in a laudatory and descriptive sense along with the mark
           „ZABREEN&#x27; in order to describe the royal quality of the rice having
           extra-long grain having royal taste. It is asserted that there is no
           possibility of confusion or deception being caused by the use of the
           mark „ZABREEN&#x27; along with descriptor term „ROYAL&#x27; by the

</p><p id="p_25">           16.      The learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the
           contention of the defendant that the word/mark „ROYAL&#x27; is
           descriptive in character, cannot be accepted. He submits that the mark
           can at best be stated to be suggestive. For the purposes of rice, it
           would be a completely arbitrary term. In support he places reliance on
           the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/3770661/" id="a_1">Bata India Limited v. Chawla Boot

           reply of the plaintiffs to the Examination Reports is also ill-founded
           inasmuch as the marks that were cited by the Trade Marks Registry
           were for different goods. Placing reliance on the judgment of this

           „ROYAL‟ as the registration is in a device mark is also incorrect
           inasmuch as the sole feature of the registered mark of the plaintiffs is

           Government of India, under Section 11 (1) of the Central Goods and

           „M/s Kusha Inc.‟ had adopted the mark „ROYAL&#x27; in the year 1989
           and had been using the same. He further admitted that the word
           „ROYAL&#x27; formed an essential and distinguishing feature of its trade

           to the benefit of the defendant in absence of any evidence of usage of

           submits that the word „ROYAL&#x27; indicates the kind and quality of the
           goods and services. It conveys a sense of pre-eminence and superior
           quality. It is a laudatory term which is incapable of distinguishing
           goods and services of one person from those of the other and thus is
           devoid of any distinctive character. He submits that mere registration
           of the mark „ROYAL&#x27; cannot grant the plaintiffs exclusive right to

           founded inasmuch as the said affidavit was given on behalf of the
           predecessor of the plaintiff no.1 and, therefore, can only bind the
           plaintiff no.1. It was also executed by Sh. Mittal in his personal
           capacity and not for and on behalf of the defendant company. He
           submits that even otherwise, the affidavit relates only to the device

           „ZABREEN&#x27; which is highly distinguishable and thus there cannot be
           any confusion between the plaintiffs‟ products and the defendant‟s

           of marks granted in favour of the plaintiffs are liable to be cancelled.

           ANALYSIS AND FINDING
</p><p id="p_46">           32.      I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsels
           for the parties.
</p><p id="p_47">           Word &#x27;Royal&#x27; whether descriptive of the product:
</p><p id="p_48">           33.      At the outset, it is to be considered whether the word „ROYAL&#x27;
           is descriptive or suggestive of the product- Rice and, therefore, if any
           exclusive right therein can be claimed by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_49">           34.      In „McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition&#x27;, the
           learned author explains the spectrum of distinctiveness of marks as:
</p><pre id="pre_4">                    (i)     „inherently distinctive‟;
                    (ii)    „non-inherently distinctive‟; and
</pre><p id="p_50">                    (iii)   marks with „no distinctiveness‟.
</p><p id="p_51">           35.      The learned author places the „suggestive‟ marks in the
           category of „inherently distinctive marks‟; while „descriptive marks‟
           in „non-inherently distinctive marks‟, for which secondary meaning is
           required. The learned author states that the placement on the spectrum
           of distinctiveness does not end the inquiry as to the strength of a mark:
           it is only the first step; the second step is to determine the strength of
           this mark in the market place. He states that the categorization of a
           mark on the spectrum of distinctiveness is a factual issue.
</p><p id="p_52">           36.      The learned author further states that the most popular test with
           the Court to determine whether the mark is „descriptive‟ or
           „suggestive‟ is the „Imagination Test‟. The more imagination that is
           required on the customer‟s part to get some direct description of the
           product from the term, the more likely the term is „suggestive‟, and
           not „descriptive‟. A descriptive term directly and clearly conveys
           information about the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the
           product or service, whereas the „suggestive‟ term only indirectly

           suggests these things. Thus, if one must exercise a reasoning process
           to determine attributes of the product or service, the term is suggestive
           not descriptive. If the mental link between the word and the product‟s
           attributes is not almost instantaneous, this strongly indicates
           suggestive and not direct descriptiveness.
</p><p id="p_53">           37.      The second test suggested by the learned author is „The
           Competitors‟ Need Test‟, that is, is the word or words likely to be
           needed by the competitive sellers to describe their goods? If the
           answer is in the positive, then the word/words are descriptive,
           otherwise they may just be suggestive.

                                     the question as to whether the mark is
                                     descriptive or suggestive, can be based on the
                                     following tests:
</p><p id="p_57">                                            a) Degree of imagination required to

                                     the word ‗POWER&#x27; does not direct any one
                                     immediately to shoes or to footwear. The
                                     imagination could at best lead to products
                                     related to electricity, batteries or related
                                     products. It could also lead to other various
                                     other connotations. It requires a ‗leap of mind

                                     Defendant No.2 has not shown a single
                                     footwear product using the word ‗POWER&#x27;.
                                     Though, some pending applications have been
                                     shown, it is a well-known fact that mere filing
                                     of applications or registering marks does not
                                     create any goodwill and also does not imply
                                     any use of the mark. The Plaintiff has been

                                     considers conflicting to its interest, vigilantly.

<p id="p_65">                                     30. By applying the above two tests, the
                                     word ‗POWER&#x27; is held to be a distinctive mark
                                     in respect of footwear. In Union Carbide
                                     Corp.         v.        Ever-Ready,         Inc.,

                                     U.S.P.Q. 623 (7th Cir. 1976) the Court applied
                                     the ‗intuitive nature basis&#x27;, rather than a
                                     logical analysis, as the basis for deciding as to
                                     whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive.
                                     While descriptive marks can acquire a
                                     secondary meaning and attain the status of a
                                     trademark, suggestive marks are inherently
                                     distinctive marks. This Court, therefore, holds
                                     that in every case where the defence of non-
                                     distinctiveness of marks is raised, the Court
                                     after analysing the evidence on record has to
                                     finally apply its own intuitive perception and
                                     there can be no objective formula to determine
                                     descriptiveness.
</p>

           of imagination for the consumer to form a connection of the word
           „ROYAL‟ to rice. It would require a reasoning process to determine
           the attributes of rice.
</p><p id="p_68">           40.      Applying the „Competitors‟ Need Test‟ again, the word
           „ROYAL&#x27; per se is not required by the competitors to be used to
           describe the product-rice or its quality. The word „ROYAL‟ is neither
           a natural synonym for the product nor its attribute.
</p><p id="p_69">           41.      In Marico Ltd. (supra), the Court was considering the trade
           mark &quot;LOSORB&quot; and the use of the expression „with low absorb
           technology‟ by the defendant therein.                 The Court held that the
           expression „low absorb‟ is a common descriptive expression/adjective
           and immediately conveys the meaning of the expression, that
           something which absorbs less. The Court found that the said
           expression was used in the functional sense for the character of the
           product, which is edible oil; it, therefore describes the characteristic of
           the product. In the present case, however, the same cannot be said for
           the word „ROYAL&#x27;, as far as rice is concerned.

           that it may still be pleaded by the plaintiffs that the defendants are
           guilty of passing off because of the adoption of the said word.

           device of two crossed spoons and below the device the words
           &quot;SPOONS BRAND&quot;. The Court held that the word &quot;ROYAL&quot; alone

           registrable without proof of acquisition of a distinctive character as a
           result of the use made of it. In the present case, the mark of the

                                     Thus, a particular element of a composite
                                     mark which enjoys greater prominence vis-à-
                                     vis other constituent elements, may be termed

                                     Take for instance where the disclaimed word
                                     is written in a distinctive style with
                                     embellishments within, on or around it, and
                                     the opponents mark also consists of the
                                     disclaimed word written in the same distinctive
                                     manner. Were it open to the opponent to
                                     contend that the disclaimed word ought to be
                                     ignored there would be nothing left to
                                     compare. Let me carry this illustration further
                                     with the modification that the embellishments
                                     in the two marks are different. If the
                                     disclaimed word is to be ignored all that
                                     would be left is the embellishments. This is not
                                     how a person in the market would view the
                                     marks while purchasing a product. There
                                     would remain an equal degree of possibility of
                                     deception and confusion as the public, being
                                     oblivious to the disclaimer would not analyze
                                     the marks as suggested by Dr. Shivade. In the
                                     circumstances, the disclaimer in the present
                                     case does not affect the plaintiff&#x27;s right to
                                     obtain an injunction for infringement.‖

</p><p id="p_81">           51.      Applying the above test to the facts of the present case, the
           word „ROYAL&#x27; remains a dominant part of the trade mark of the
           plaintiffs. Remove the said word, the remaining is only an
           embellishment. Therefore, the word „ROYAL&#x27; per se would also be
           entitled to protection, though while making a comparison with the
           complained mark, due deference would have to be laid to the fact that
           the plaintiff does not have a word mark registration.

<p id="p_82">           Mark common to trade:
</p><p id="p_83">           52.      The plea of the defendant that the word „ROYAL&#x27; is common
           to trade also cannot be accepted at the present stage. It would have to
           await a final decision when the parties have led their evidence. As
           held by this Court in Pankaj Goel (supra), a use of a similar mark by
           a third party in violation of the plaintiff‟s right is no defence.

           Correspondence with the Trade Mark Registry:
</p><p id="p_84">           53.      The reliance of the defendant on the response submitted by the
           predecessor of the plaintiffs to the Examination Reports again is not of
           much relevance. It would be for this Court to determine whether the
           use of the mark by the defendant infringes the rights of the plaintiffs
           in its registered trade mark, or amounts to passing off of the goods of
           the defendant as that of the plaintiffs.             As held by this Court in
           Teleecare (supra), such correspondence cannot act as an estoppel. In
           fact, this is a peculiar case where both the parties are relying upon the
           submissions made by the other before the Trade Mark Registry.
</p><p id="p_85">           54.      As far as the reply dated 17.08.2012 submitted by the plaintiff
           to the Examination Report is concerned, the same would show that the
           plaintiff, in fact, emphasised that the trade mark „ROYAL&#x27; had been
           used by it since 1989 and had acquired worldwide reputation on
           account of its exclusive and extensive use, as also on account of its
           promotional activities. The plaintiff also relied upon its registrations in
           the U.S.A and Canada. The plaintiff also sought to distinguish the
           cited marks on account of those been opposed to by the plaintiff and
           being in use for different products. Prima facie, therefore, the said
           reply, even otherwise, does not support the case of the defendant any
           further.

           and „ROYAL&#x27; Logo with device of Queen in relation to rice has been
           used by the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff since 1989 and has
           acquired distinctiveness. Though the learned counsel for the defendant
           submits that the same cannot act as an estoppel against the defendant,

           the same having been executed by Sh. Mittal in his personal capacity
           and/or the same being filed at the behest of the predecessor-in-interest

           any right in the word „ROYAL&#x27; as a trade mark. In fact, it is the case

           infringement made by the registered proprietor of the trade mark.
</p><p id="p_99">           64.      Though it has been held hereinabove that the word „ROYAL‟ is
           not descriptive of the product-rice, at the same time it cannot be
           disputed that it is a laudatory word. The Oxford Dictionary defines the
           word „ROYAL‟ as &quot;of a quality or size suitable for a king or queen;
           splendid&quot;; in Collins English Dictionary, it is defined to mean &quot;in the
           sense of regal, in the sense of splendid&quot;; and Cambridge Advanced
           Learner&#x27;s Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus defines it as &quot;a member of the royal
           family good or excellent, as if intended for or typical of royal.&quot;
</p><p id="p_100">           65.      As there is no doubt that the word „ROYAL‟ is a laudatory
           word, it would have to be determined as to whether the use of the
           same by the defendant is merely to depict the quality of its rice,
           thereby acting as a defence for the defendant to the claim of
           infringement made by the plaintiffs. In this regard, the earlier use of
           the mark by the defendant, that is complained of in the present suit is
           as under:

</p><p id="p_106">           68.       The use of word &#x27;ROYAL&#x27;, therefore, now appears to be only
           in form of depicting quality of the rice.
</p><p id="p_107">           69.      In Marico Limited (supra), the Court had held that the appellant
           therein was not entitled to succeed in an infringement action, also
           because the use by the respondent therein was in furtherance of its
           statutory rights of the use of the word which is descriptive of the kind,
           quality, intended purpose or characteristic of the goods. It was held
           that merely because the appellant therein states that the respondent is
           using the word as a trade mark, the same should not be taken as
           infringement of the trade mark of the appellant. Such use would fall
           within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_22">Section 30(2)(a)</a> of the Act and the
           respondent/defendant is always fully justified and is entitled to use the
           descriptive words in any and every manner that it so chooses and
           pleases to do. Such use can be described as being &quot;bona fide‖. In
           fact, it was held that there is ordinarily no lack of bona fides in using
           the normal descriptive words.
</p><p id="p_108">           70.      In this regard it is also relevant to note that the defendant, apart
           from the use of the word „ROYAL&#x27;, also claims to be using the words
           „GOLD‟, „BIRYANI‟ and „PREMIUM‟ for its various quality of rice.
</p><p id="p_109">           71.      It is also to be noted that the defendant is using its own trade
           mark &#x27;ZABREEN&#x27; prominently on the packaging. The packaging
           itself of the plaintiffs and defendants products is different as is evident
           from the below, which is an extract from the plaint itself:-

</p><p id="p_112">           72.      In my prima facie view, the use of the word &#x27;ZABREEN&#x27;
           prominently on its packaging is sufficient to take the defendant out
           from the mischief of infringement and passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_113">           73.      In Soothe Healthcare Private Limited (supra), the learned
           Single Judge of this Court observed that by use of the house mark
           „Dabur‟ along with difference in the color scheme, the possibility of
           confusion did not arise. Similar is the situation in the present case.

           With the use of the house mark of the defendant &#x27;ZABREEN&#x27;;
           difference in the color scheme and the packaging and with the
           proposed reduction in the size of the word &#x27;ROYAL&#x27; in the overall
           packaging by the defendant, in my opinion, a possibility of confusion
           being caused to an unwary consumer of imperfect recollection would
           prima facie stand negated.

<p id="p_114">           74.      The same, however, cannot be said for the packaging that is
           currently used by the defendant and was complained of by the
           plaintiffs in the present suit. The packaging itself would show that the
           word „ROYAL&#x27; has been used prominently in the packaging. The
           same is not, therefore, merely to depict the quality of the rice of the
           defendant but also as a trade mark itself. The use of the same would
           also lead to dilution of the mark of the plaintiffs and, therefore, cannot
           be permitted in such manner.
</p>
<p id="p_115">           75.      In view of the above, the defendant is restrained from using the
           packaging complained of by the plaintiff and reproduced hereinabove,
           during the pendency of the present suit.
