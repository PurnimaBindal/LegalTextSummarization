</p><p id="p_6">1.     This Full Bench is called upon to answer a reference made in terms of
the order of the Division Bench dated 27.08.2012. The Division Bench, by
its order of reference noticed a judicial conflict on the question whether
prior permission of the Court is necessary under Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 1
 <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 (hereafter "the Act") for rectification of a registered
trademark, during the pendency of a suit. The first view is that proceedings
for rectification of the defendant's mark cannot be initiated without the
prima facie satisfaction of the plea by the Court and that the suit cannot be
adjourned or stayed in terms of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_2">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Act to await the
outcome of the rectification proceedings initiated by the plaintiff before the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board (hereafter "IPAB") - if the procedure
outlined therein is not followed. The other view is that such proceedings (for
rectification before the IPAB) can be initiated without the permission of the
court trying the infringement suit and the consequence of not obtaining
permission is only that the applicant cannot seek stay of suit.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.     Before discussion of the rival contentions and their merits on the
question referred, a brief factual narrative is essential. The respondent,
Infosys Technologies Ltd. (hereafter called "Infosys") sued the preset
appellant Data Infosys (hereafter referred to as "the defendant") and claimed
permanent injunction against infringement of its registered trademarks in
"Infosys" and allied marks. The trademarks were registered in Classes 16, 9
and 7 under the erstwhile Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_3">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958
(hereafter referred to as "the 1958 Act"). Infosys also sought relief against
the use of its corporate name, including the use by the defendant of the
domain name - www.datainfosys.net which - it was argued- amounted to
infringement of its registered trademarks. The defendant entered appearance
and contested the suit. It argued that whereas Infosys was in the field of
software development, the defendant was providing internet services within




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 2
 India only and that the two business activities were different. Other defences
such as delay etc. were set-up.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.     During the pendency of the suit, the defendant's application for
registration of its mark "Data Infosys" was accepted and its registration was
granted in class 38, i.e. telecommunication, communication by computer, by
fibre, electronic transmission of voice, etc. The defendant was also granted
registration of the same mark "Data Infosys" in Class 9 as on 22.03.2004,
i.e. computer hardware; likewise, trademark registration was granted in
respect of class 42. The defendant sought leave of the Court to amend its
written statement and incorporate these developments; the Court permitted
leave to amend the suit/its defence, on 19.07.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.     Infosys thereafter sought rectification of the registered trademark
"Data Infosys" under Classes 38, 9 and 42 (classified under <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_4">Section 8</a> of the
Act read with Rule 22 and Fourth Schedule to the Trademark Rules, 2001)
before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB). Upon becoming
aware of these proceedings, the defendant moved an application alleging
that the initial filing of rectification proceedings without seeking leave of the
Court constituted an abuse of process and that the proceedings before the
IPAB were, therefore, null and void. By an order dated 17.07.2012, the
learned Single Judge, before whom the defendant's application was listed
considered and dismissed it.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">6.     The hearing before this Full Bench had been focused on the merits of
the two opposing and divergent views of reasoning - one favoring the view
espoused by Infosys, i.e. about its autonomy under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_6">Section 124</a> (1) (ii) to
apply for rectification, and the other on which reliance is placed by the
defendant that the provision itself constituted both a fetter and a condition
upon which rectification proceedings can be initiated and presented by one
of the parties to the litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.     In view of these rival submissions, the defendant relies upon <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_7">Section
124(1)(b)(ii)</a> and states that in the present case that provision itself governs
the present situation and mandates textually that wherever a suit with respect
to trademark enforcement is filed first, and no rectification proceedings are
pending, satisfaction of the Court with regard to prima facie tenability of the
trademark validity plea is a condition precedent to the party setting-up the
plea/agitating it by approaching the IPAB. This, learned counsel Sh. Pawan
Duggal argues, is because <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_8">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> spells-out distinct
conditions, i.e.

</p><p id="p_13">(i) filing of a suit in the absence of rectification proceedings;
</p>



<p id="p_14">FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 5
</p><p id="p_15"> (ii) plea by the party concerned, i.e. the defendant or plaintiff with respect to
invalidity of a trademark registration in the suit itself - which pre-supposes
that registration occurs during pendency of the proceedings;
</p>
<p id="p_16">(iii) prima facie satisfaction as to tenability of the plea with respect to
invalidity of the registration by a judicial order of the court;
</p>
<p id="p_17">(iv) framing of issue - of invalidity of the mark - by the Court and
subsequent adjournment of the suit to enable the party seeking rectification
to apply for it.
</p>
<p id="p_18">8.     Sh. Duggal argues that the consequence of not applying for
rectification is indicated specifically in <a href="/doc/789031/" id="a_9">Section 124(3)</a>; it is the statutory
abandonment of the plea by the party interested in setting-up the plea of
invalidity and correspondingly interested in its rectification in the suit. It is
also emphasized that the further autonomy granted under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_10">Section 124(5)</a> to
the Court to proceed and make such interlocutory orders, including
injunction, only emphasizes the interpretation pressed by the defendant.
Learned counsel submitted that if the requested steps, which include, most
importantly, prior permission of the Court through its satisfaction, as to
invalidity, is not obtained, the right to apply for rectification itself is
precluded.
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.     The defendant relies upon the ruling in <a href="/doc/1769441/" id="a_11">Kedar Nath v. Monga
Perfumery and Flour Mills, Delhi-6</a> AIR 1974 Delhi 12, where interpreting
<a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_12">Section 11</a> (of the 1958 Act), which corresponds to <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_13">Section 124</a> in the
present case, the Court held that:

       sustainable and issue as to validity will be raised to enable the
       party concerned to apply to the High Court for
       rectification...................."
</p>
<p id="p_21">       Dealing with the contention that the Court has to stay the proceedings
in the light of the expression "shall", it was further observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "19.........The defendant cannot file an application subsequent
       to the institution of the suit under Section 111(1)(i) and claim
       that the plaintiff's suit for infringement must be stayed. If no
       proceeding for rectification of the register is pending on the
       date of the institution of the suit by the plaintiff then Section
       111(1)(ii) is attracted and a Court may adjourn the case for a
       period of three months in order to enable the defendant to
       apply to the High Court for rectification of the register. In that
       case, the Court must be satisfied that the contention as to
       validity of the defendant's registration is bona fide and prima
       facie sustainable..............."
</blockquote><p id="p_22">10.    Similarly, the Gujarat High Court ruled in <a href="/doc/1955313/" id="a_15">Patel Field Marshal
Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Ltd</a>. 1999 PTC (19) 718, to the following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "8. ......In case, no such proceedings for rectification are
       pending at the time of raising the plea of invalidity, the
       prosecution of such plea by the person raising it depends on
       prima facie satisfaction of the court, about the tenability of this
       plea. If the plea has been found to be prima facie tenable and
       issue is raised to that effect then the matter is to be adjourned
       for three months at least to enable the person raising such plea
       to approach the High Court concerned, with a rectification
       application. In case, the rectification proceedings are not
       already pending, and the court is not even prima facie satisfied
       about the tenability of the plea raised before it, the matter rests
       there. In case, no issue is framed, the remedy of the aggrieved




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                             Page 7
        party is to agitate against non-framing of the issue for that
       reason either before the court itself, or by taking recourse to
       remedial forums, by which the suit is governed. One cannot
       envisage that a person who satisfies the court prima facie about
       the tenability of its plea, would be required to file an
       application for rectification within a specified time, else will
       lose his plea by abandonment, but, in case, a man facing
       infringement suit, after raising the plea about invalidity of
       registration of mark fails even prima facie to satisfy the court
       about tenability of its plea, is left free to agitate the issue de
       hors the suit as independent cause of action at any time
       thereafter, as in the present case, it would make the provision
       of Section 111, wholly irrelevant, and nugatory.</blockquote>

<p id="p_23">       9.     We are not impressed with the contention of the learned
       counsel for the appellant that <a href="/doc/324996/" id="a_16">Section 111</a> operates only if a
       party raises plea of invalidity of the mark and seeks stay of the
       proceedings and not otherwise. Plea that unless the defendant
       raising the plea of invalidity wants the stay of proceedings, the
       provision has no application does not commend itself on the
       plain reading of the section itself. Two-fold consequence has
       been provided on raising of an issue about the validity. Firstly,
       the stay of the proceedings of the trial, in case, the opportunity
       is availed to get the issue decided through rectification
       application. If such issue is already subject matter of a pending
       rectification proceedings, the court cannot proceed until such
       issue is determined. If such proceedings are not pending the
       trial court has to raise an issue in the suit on being prima facie
       satisfied about its tenability, and give an opportunity to the
       objector to have resort to rectification application for which
       minimum of three months' time is to be granted. That is to say
       trial is held up at least up to that time. On filing such
       rectification application within time allowed, entails further
       stay of proceedings in the suit until rectification application is
       decided. Secondly, failure to avail the opportunity results in
       abandonment of the issue. If the provision has been confined
       only to stay, proceedings of the suit at the request of the party




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 8
        concerned, subsection (3) of <a href="/doc/324996/" id="a_17">Section 111</a> sounds totally out of
       context............."
</p>

<p id="p_24">11.    Considerable reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_18">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr.
v. Orchid Chemicals and Pharmceuticals Ltd</a>. 2006 (32) PTC 733 (Del), a
Single Judge decision of this Court which supports the defendant's
contention. There, the Court, after noticing the provisions of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_19">Section
124(1)(b)(ii)</a> observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "31. On plain reading of this provision, it is apparent that the
       plaintiffs could not file the application for rectification without
       showing and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the Court
       about their plea of the invalidity of the registration of the mark
       of the Defendant. <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_20">Section 124</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is
       similar to the <a href="/doc/324996/" id="a_21">Section 111</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_22">Merchandise Marks
       Act</a>,1958......"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">12.    The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument, which sought to
distinguish Kedarnath (supra) and Patel Field Marshal (supra), and held as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "32. ......The plea of the plaintiffs, therefore, is that their
       application for rectification filed before the Appellate Board is
       maintainable without prima facie satisfaction of the tenability
       of their plea by the Court. If the application for rectification of
       the defendant's trade mark is maintainable without prima facie
       satisfaction of this Court, then this suit is also liable to be
       stayed as claimed by the plaintiffs under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_23">Section 124(b)</a> of the
       Act, though under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_24">Section 124(5)</a> of the Act, the application for
       injunction and for vacation or modification of an ex-parte
       order can be considered and decided by this Court. The
       distinction between <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_25">Section 124(b)(i)</a> and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_26">124(b)(ii)</a> is on the
       basis of pendency of the proceedings for rectification of the
       register and not on the basis of whether the party initiating the




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                            Page 9
        proceedings for rectification could initiate such proceedings
       before the institution of the suit or not. There can be other
       eventualities under which a party may not be able to initiate the
       proceedings for rectification before the institution of the suit,
       but that will not give them a right to circumvent the prima facie
       satisfaction of his plea for invalidity, by the Court. The
       distinguishing feature of the two sub clauses is only pendency
       of the proceedings and nothing more can be read into them.
       The plea of substantial compliance of the requirement of
       <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_27">Section 124</a> by the plaintiffs is also not sustainable. Either there
       is compliance of the said provision or non-compliance in the
       facts and circumstances. Compliance will be when after the
       institution of the suit, if an application for rectification is to be
       filed, prima facie invalidity of the opposing mark is to be
       demonstrated to the Court. The fact that the application could
       not be filed prior to the institution of the suit, will not entitle a
       party to circumvent the prima facie satisfaction of the Court.
       Consequently the proceedings for rectification of the
       defendant's mark could not be initiated by the plaintiffs without
       the prima facie satisfaction of their plea by this Court nor this
       case is liable to be adjourned or stayed for three months in
       terms of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_28">Section 124(b)(i)</a> of the Act to await the outcome of the
       rectification proceedings initiated by the plaintiffs before the
       Appellate Board.

        rectification which is already pending, in view of which, the suit
       could be stayed, pending final disposal of such proceeding. The
       provisions which would be applicable to the facts and
       circumstances of the present case are those which envisage that
       where the application for rectification of the order in such
       proceeding is not pending, then a party seeking rectification
       applies for rectification, subject to a prima facie satisfaction of
       the Court regarding invalidity of the registration of the mark of
       the opposite party. The appellants/plaintiffs, therefore, could
       not have filed an application for rectification without showing,
       establishing and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the Court
       that they have sufficient material to be able to invalidate the
       registration of the mark of the respondent/defendant. The
       aforesaid rectification proceeding which is filed is still pending
       for consideration. Therefore, the learned Single Judge was
       justified in not staying the Suit. In this connection, reference
       may be made to the provisions of <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_32">Section 124(5)</a> of the Trade
       Marks Act, which entitles the Court to deal with the

relevant judgments on the point. It concluded that as far as this Court is
concerned, the view upheld was that unless permission under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_36">Section 124</a> is
obtained - a provision referred to as "mandatory" - rectification proceedings




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                            Page 11
 would not be maintainable. The Division Bench summarized the position in
the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "Thus, insofar as this Court is concerned, it has taken the view
       that the permission under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_37">Section 124</a> (b) of the Act is
       mandatory and if the proceedings are filed without obtaining
       such a permission, those would not be maintainable."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">After so stating, however, the Division Bench (in United Biotech (supra))
took note of a Division Bench ruling of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1846072/" id="a_38">B.
Mohamed Yousuff v. Prabha Singh Jaswant Singh and Ors</a>. 2008 (38) PTC
576 (Mad) (DB), and held, that had the respondent in that case approached
the Madras High Court and sought permission for applying to rectify the
mark, the position would have been different. However, noting that the suit
was pending before the Madras High Court, which alone could have had the
occasion to deal with such application, this court further felt that the
application (for permission to file a rectification application) would have
been an empty formality, in view of the Division Bench ruling of that court
in B. Mohamed Yousuff. The Division Bench of this court therefore, held
that "the application could not be dismissed as not maintainable in the
absence of specific permission of the Madras High Court under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_39">Section 124</a>
(1) of the Trademark Act."
</p>
<p id="p_31">16.    Ms. Prathiba Singh, learned senior counsel for one of the intervening
parties who addressed arguments, supported the interpretation of the
defendant and stated that the consistent view of this Court as to the
mandatory nature of <a href="/doc/944811/" id="a_40">Section 124(1)(b)</a> is sound and should not be disturbed.
She argued that <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_41">Section 124</a> is a special provision, which relates to situations
wherein the defendant seeks to impeach a registered mark's validity in the




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 12
 context of, or during pendency of infringement proceedings. This provision
is schematically placed after the general power conferred upon IPAB, for
rectifying the trademark. Therefore, being a special provision, it prevails and
the Court, in its obligation to harmonize any perceived conflict between the
various provisions (wherever discerned) should apply the well accepted
principle that a special provision would prevail over general provisions. It
was therefore, argued that the summary of the legal position indicated in
United Biotech (supra) should be left undisturbed and ought to guide the
interpretation of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_42">Section 124</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_32">17.    It was argued by Ms. Singh, learned senior counsel that the principal
objective of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_43">Section 124</a> is to avoid conflicting decisions as to the validity of
the registered trademarks. <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_44">Section 124(1)(a)(i)</a> - first limb of the provision -
merely mandates a stay of suit if a rectification petition is pending at the
time. However, if no rectification is pending, the latter part, i.e. <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_45">Section
124(1)(a)(ii)</a> operates and obliges the litigant seeking deferment of the suit
proceedings to scrupulously follow the procedure, applying to the Court and
satisfying it that prima facie the plea is tenable. Upon the Court being
satisfied by its independent application of mind with respect to the tenability
of the plea an issue has to be framed and the suit adjourned. The applicant
seeking to rely on the plea of invalidity then has to approach the IPAB
within three months. The ruling given by the IPAB becomes binding. This
mechanism, i.e. <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_46">Section 124(1)(a)(ii)</a> is to be seen as a mandatory step to
ensure that litigants do not frustrate an infringement proceeding or trial in a
suit. It is thus urged that the important underlying purpose is to ensure that
the discipline of approaching the IPAB only with the permission of the




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 13
 Court is an essential safeguard for the litigants who might be otherwise
directly approaching the IPAB and thwart the infringement action which can
independently proceed in terms of <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_47">Section 125</a>. The power under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_48">Section
124(5)</a> in this regard was underlined. Learned counsel relied on the
proposition that the Parliament creates every provision with a purpose and
intention that each one of them should have effect and placed reliance on
<a href="/doc/790887/" id="a_49">The J.K. Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar
Pradesh and Ors</a>. AIR 1961 SC 1170.
</p>
<p id="p_33">18.    Learned counsel also submitted that there are several ways in which
<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_50">Section 124</a> can and is being abused. The first could be where the plaintiff
registered trademark owner, in whose favour an interim injunction is granted
in a suit, seeks stay of the suit to perpetuate the injunction where the
defendant has sought rectification. The second would be where the
defendant owns a registered trademark and an interim injunction is granted
after which the plaintiff seeks rectification and then a stay under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_51">Section
124</a>, to perpetuate the injunction and the third, where the plaintiff, a
registered trademark owner, upon being refused interim injunction, after
which the defendant files a rectification proceeding, seeking stay of the suit
so that the matter never proceeds to trial. It was urged that in each of these
situations, the purpose of application under <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_52">Section 125</a> is not seeking
adjudication of the question but prolong the status quo in the suit. It was
argued that each of these could indicate methods of abuse of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_53">Section 124</a>.
Commenting on the conflict of judicial opinions, learned counsel stated that
Astrazeneca UK Ltd.'s (supra) approach curtails the prejudice of an
aggrieved person to the remedy afforded by <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_54">Sections 47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_55">57</a> of the Act to




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 14
 seek rectification. She submitted that where, with or without obtaining
permission, a rectification proceeding can be initiated, however, if a suit is
pending and the rectification proceeding is availed later, <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_56">Section 124</a>
operates and if the party wishes a stay on the infringement action, it must
necessarily approach the Court for stay of the suit. The Court would, then
consider the prima facie tenability and if satisfied, frame an issue and grant
liberty to the party seeking rectification to do so. The decision of the IPAB
would be binding upon the parties. The question, therefore, is not whether
permission is required to file rectification but whether to seek stay of
proceedings, it is necessary to seek permission and follow the procedure
under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_57">Section 124</a> strictly and scrupulously. Learned counsel urges that
<a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_58">Sections 47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_59">57</a> provide generally for rectification and removal of marks
and confer jurisdiction upon the IPAB and <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_60">Section 124(1)(a)(ii)</a> regulates
rectification of marks in particular situations, i.e. during pendency of the
litigation. Being a specific provision which deals with one situation alone,
<a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_61">Section 124(1)(a)(ii)</a> has to prevail over the general provision of <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_62">Sections 47</a>
and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_63">57</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_34">Arguments of Infosys
</p><p id="p_35">19.    It was argued on behalf of Infosys by Sh. Sanjay Jain, learned senior
counsel that the view contrary to Astrazeneca UK Ltd.(supra) taken by the
Madras High Court in B. Mohamed Yousuff (supra) is the correct one. It was
argued that the Division Bench ruling in Astrazeneca UK Ltd.(supra) and
the other judgments of this Court, in their interpretation of <a href="/doc/944811/" id="a_64">Section
124(1)(b)</a>, have overlooked a salient and important aspect, namely that the
prima facie view of the Court in regard to tenability of a trademark




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 15
 invalidity plea is not to enable it to move the IPAB for rectification of a
registered trademark during pendency of the suit, but only for the purpose
seeking stay of the suit. As a consequence of the court holding that the
invalidity of the mark is not prima facie tenable, is limited, only for the
purpose mentioned in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_65">Section 124</a>, i.e there would not be a stay of the suit. It
was argued that thus, if the party seeking rectification does not obtain a
favourable ruling of the Court under <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_66">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> or obtains prima
facie view of the invalidity plea being tenable and yet does not avail of it,
(or does not avail of the plea by applying to the IPAB within the time
granted) the only result can be its abandonment or inability to set-up the
invalidity of the mark as a defence in the suit. It does not oust the
jurisdiction of the IPAB, which is the sole statutory body charged with the
duty of considering the validity of the mark.
</p>
<p id="p_36">20.    Learned senior counsel elaborated the submission by urging that the
constitution, powers and functions of the IPAB have been independently
dealt with in separate provisions of the Act, i.e. <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_67">Sections 57</a> (power to cancel
or vary registration and to rectify the register) and 47 (removal for register
and imposition of limitations on grounds of non-use). There is no bar to
indicate an embargo on the powers of the Board, i.e. IPAB- or the Registrar
(who has concurrent powers with the IPAB under those provisions) from
examining the validity of a registered trademark in the absence of the
Court's prima facie satisfaction in the pending suit. To hold - as Astrazeneca
UK Ltd.(supra) concluded - that the litigant's entitlement in an independent
proceeding before the competent Tribunal is unauthorized or would result in
a nullity, would, therefore, be reading into the statute consequences that are




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 16
 far beyond what are expressly spelt-out by it. It was submitted that being a
creation of statute, and vested with the exclusive authority to examine the
validity of registered trademarks, IPAB's jurisdiction cannot be ousted and
its authority reduced or curtailed or subordinated to that of the Civil Court in
the manner suggested by the defendant. Had such been the case, the
Parliament would have been more express in its articulation. Learned
counsel pointed out that even textually, <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_68">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> only enables
the Court to take a prima facie view but ultimately the decision about the
validity of the mark is that of the IPAB alone; it cannot be questioned or put
in issue in civil suit later. Learned counsel submitted that the Act,
particularly <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_69">Section 124</a>, is one of its kind in the sense that in a cognate
enactment, i.e. the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_70">Patents Act</a>, 1970, the IPAB as well as the Civil Court
have concurrent and coordinate jurisdiction with respect to validity or the
intellectual property right, i.e. the granted patent. Here, the jurisdiction of
the IPAB is exclusive and has to be implemented by the Civil Court except
to the extent of a statutory abandonment deemed by <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_71">Section 124</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_37">21.    Learned senior counsel heavily relied upon the following discussion
in B. Mohamed Yousuff (supra):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      "(N) In our considered view, <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_72">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Act is
      only an enabling provision. Sub clause (i) and Sub clause (ii) of
      Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_73">Section 124</a> operates at two
      different levels for two different situations. While Sub clause (i)
      deals with a situation where any proceeding for rectification is
      already pending, Sub clause (ii) deals with a situation where any
      proceeding for rectification is not pending. Both the sub clauses
      focus their field of operation only in relation to the stay of the
      civil suit. The conditions laid down in Sub Clause (ii) are
      intended to enable a party to obtain stay of the suit and not




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 17
      intended to provide for a discretion for the Court to permit or
     not to permit any application for rectification. Such a position is
     made clear by Sub sections (2) to (5) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_74">Section 124</a>, which deals
     with the consequences of filing and not filing an application for
     rectification and of the ultimate outcome of such application for
     rectification. In other words, the requirements of "raising an
     issue", "adjourning the case" and a "prima facie satisfaction"</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">     spelt out in <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_75">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> should be read as the
     requirements for the grant of a stay of the suit and not as a
     requirement or pre -condition for filing an application for
     rectification. The plain reading of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_76">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> shows
     that it does not mandate a party to obtain the "leave of the
     Court" or "an order of the Court", for filing an application for
     rectification. The right to file an application for rectification is a
     statutory right conferred upon a party who is aggrieved by an
     entry made in the Register. The said statutory right cannot be
     curtailed except by the very provisions of the statute. The said
     right is circumscribed by certain requirements such as the
     contravention of the provisions of the Act or failure to observe a
     condition entered on the Register etc., as spelt out under Sub
     sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_77">Section 57</a> of the Act. In respect of the
     "Forum" in which such an application for rectification could be
     filed, there is a restriction under <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_78">Section 125</a>, in that such an
     application could be filed only before the Appellate Board if a
     suit for infringement was already pending. Apart from these
     restrictions, we do not see any other restriction with regard to
     the filing of an application for rectification. To interpret
     <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_79">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> to mean that an order should be obtained
     from the civil Court for filing an application for rectification,
     regarding prima facie satisfaction, would amount to imposing
     one more restriction upon the right of a person to seek
     rectification of the Register. We do not find any such restriction
     or requirement of the leave/permission of the court, under
     <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_80">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a>. Therefore, with great respect to the
     learned Judges who were parties to the decisions of the Gujarat
     and Delhi High Courts, relied upon by the Delhi Party, we are of
     the considered view that the Tindivanam Party was right in filing
     an application for rectification, without obtaining the leave of




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                             Page 18
       this Court or without getting an issue framed and prima facie
      satisfaction recorded, in C.S. No. 726 of 2004."
</p>
<p id="p_39">22.    Learned senior counsel also submitted that though not in any manner
binding or even persuasive, the IPAB's ruling in Jeet Biri Manufacturing
Company Private Limited v. Pravin Kumar Singhal 2011 (47) PTC 231
(IPAB) provides even more insight into the matter. He particularly placed
reliance on its reasoning to the following effect - the Board, after
recapitulating the essential conditions of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_81">Section 124</a> and discussing <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_82">Section
124(1)(a)</a> proceeded to observe as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "20. Now the Court before whom such a suit is pending shall
       take the following steps as per the Act. They are,

       regarding validity of the registration.

<p id="p_40">23.    Ms. Anuradha Salhotra, learned counsel for an intervener, argued that
this court should consider the totality of the scheme of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_83">Section 124</a> and the
purpose for requiring the Court's prima facie satisfaction, i.e. whether to




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                             Page 19
 stay the suit. Furthermore, the consequence of not obtaining such
satisfaction results in the defendant's right (to plead invalidity of the mark)
in the suit, getting precluded. Also, argued learned counsel, once the IPAB
decides that the mark is invalid, it binds the parties, given the mandate of
<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_84">Section 124</a> (4). Even the court would have to follow the order made in
rectification proceedings. Learned counsel also highlighted that the
consequence of not following <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_85">Section 124</a> and approaching the IPAB
directly is vested in the provision itself, i.e. deemed abandonment of the
defence of invalidity.
</p>
<p id="p_41">24.    Mr. Hemant Singh, learned counsel, argued that there is no difference
between the two situations -one, when the rectification application is
preferred before filing of an infringement suit and the other, after the filing
of the suit. The only difference is that the suit gets stayed, automatically in
the first case, whereas the stay of suit (on the defendant's plea of trademark
invalidity) is discretionary and conditional upon the court arriving at a prima
facie satisfaction about the plea of invalidity being tenable. There is no
legislative intent to diminish the jurisdiction or power of either the Registrar
or the IPAB, in either case, either in respect of the extent of its jurisdiction
(while deciding the issue of invalidity of the mark) or in regard to the test to
be adopted for the purpose. The only difference in practical terms is that if
the court holds the plea of invalidty of the trademark registration to be prima
facie untenable, the consequence of deemed waiver of objection in the
infringement suit (as to invalidity of the mark) would follow. Furthermore,
in either case, the Civil Court's power to make appropriate interim orders




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 20
 during pendency of the rectification proceedings - in the infringement suit -
are not diminished.
</p>
<p id="p_42">25.    Sh. Hemant Singh argued that no permission is required or mandated
by <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_86">Section 124</a> before filing a petition with the IPAB and urged the Court to
follow the reasoning in <a href="/doc/1846072/" id="a_87">B. Mohamed Yousuff v. Prabha Singh Jaswant Singh
and Ors</a>. 2008 (38) PTC 576 (Mad) (DB). He argued that <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_88">Section 124</a> is a
mere procedural provision dealing with stay of suit in various situations
concerning infringement action. The substantive jurisdiction of IPAB is
derived from other provisions, i.e. <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_89">Sections 47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_90">57</a>. It was highlighted
that a similar power is conferred upon the Registrar in identical terms by
<a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_91">Section 125</a>. The only difference between the two is that in case of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_92">Section
124</a>, the Civil Court is empowered to issue interim orders - a power
obviously absent in the case of Registrar's proceedings.

useful to advert to the relevant provisions, (apart from <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_93">Section 124</a>, which

<p id="p_63">30.    <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_127">Section 124</a> deals with the following contingencies:
</p>
<p id="p_64">(i) when a defendant-to an infringement suit-sets up the plea of invalidity of
the plaintiff's registered trademark (<a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_128">Section 124(1)(a)</a>), or,

</p><p id="p_65">(ii) the plaintiff sets up the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark of
the defendant, which the defendant raises as a defense under <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_129">Section
30(2)(e)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_66"><a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_130">Section 125</a>, mandates that in the course of an infringement suit, where the
invalidity of registration of a mark plea is set up, then, "notwithstanding
anything contained in <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_131">section 47</a> or <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_132">section 57</a>, such application shall be
made to the Appellate Board and not to the Registrar." This means that
necessarily, where the registration of mark, allegedly infringing, is
questioned after initiation of suit, the person setting up such invalidity (of
mark) plea has to apply to the IPAB, which alone acquires jurisdiction to the
exclusion of the Registrar (who otherwise possesses jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_133">Sections 47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_134">57</a> of the Act).
</p>
<p id="p_67">31.    <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_135">Section 124(1)(ii)</a> textually indicates that premised on the plea of
invalidity of the registration of the trade mark (of the defendant, or the
plaintiff-as the case may be), the Court would frame the issue pertaining to
the invalidity of the trademark to be decided by the IPAB. If the Court is of




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 27
 the view that such invalidity plea is, prima facie, tenable, it would adjourn
the suit for a period of three months from the date of such consideration and
framing of issue-to enable the party concerned to apply to the Appellate
Board for rectification of the registration. When the Court prima facie
examines the tenability of the invalidity plea, the clock begins to tick for the
party who sets up the plea of un-tenability, to then initiate rectification
proceedings before the Appellate Board under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_136">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_137">57</a> of the Act.
That party should initiate the rectification proceedings within 3 months, or
such extended time as the Court may, for sufficient cause, allow. If such
rectification proceedings are initiated within the period of three months, or
within such extended period as the Court may allow for sufficient cause, the
trial of the suit "shall stand stayed until the final disposal of the rectification
proceedings". The effect of prima facie evaluation-one way or another, of
the tenability of the plea of invalidity, does not impinge on the right of the
party raising such a plea to apply to the Appellate Board for rectification.
Even where the Court, prima facie, says that the plea of invalidity is not
tenable, the party setting up such a plea is not precluded from preferring a
rectification application before the Appellate Board. Given the structure and
phraseology of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_138">Section 124</a>, the difference between clause (b) (i) and (ii) is
the pendency of proceedings before IPAB. If the rectification plea is
pending before the filing of the infringement suit, the court has no choice
but to adjourn the suit and await the final disposal of the challenge before
IPAB. If, on the other hand, no such plea is pending at the time of filing of
the suit (for infringement)- the court has to examine. If urged in the written
statement, the prima facie tenability of the invalidity plea; if it holds the plea
to be tenable, it should adjourn the matter to enable the party to approach




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 28
 IPAB. In case it holds the plea to be not tenable, there is no obligation to
adjourn the suit. There is another contingency, which flows from a plain
reading of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_139">Section 124</a>, which is that if the court grants time to the party to
approach the IPAB, and it does not so approach the court within the time, it
loses the right to argue that the suit is to be stayed. This view finds support
from the decision of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1846072/" id="a_140">B Mohammed Yousuff v.
Prabha Singh Jaswant Singh Rep</a>. by its POA Mr. C. Raghu, 2006 Law Suit
(Mad) 2267 ("While sub Clause (i) deals with a situation where any
proceeding for rectification is already pending, sub Clause (ii) deals with a
situation where any proceeding for rectification is not pending. Both the sub
clauses focus their field of operation only in relation to the stay of the civil
suit.") The court is of the opinion that Parliamentary intendment is clear that
if at the stage of filing of the suit, a rectification application is "pending"
before IPAB, there is no choice for the court, but to adjourn the infringement
suit. However, if no such application is pending, the court which is later
approached with an infringement suit (which "tries" it) has to appraise prima
facie tenability of the invalidity plea, whenever taken. It could be urged even
by way of amendment. Nevertheless, there cannot be an automatic stay, in
view of the express phraseology of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_141">Section 124</a> (1) (ii) which mandates
exercise of discretion. To postpone the consideration at the stage of framing
issues would be a narrow interpretation, undermining the broad basic
distinction between the two contingencies envisioned by <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_142">Section 124</a> (1) (b).
</p>
<p id="p_68">The allied issue is when does the court evaluate the necessity of staying the
suit. This is when the written statement is filed with the plea that either (a)
the rectification proceeding had been filed before the infringement suit and




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 29
 was therefore "pending" or (b) rectification application is to be preferred, or
was preferred after the suit was filed. This court is of the opinion that the use
of the expression "court trying the suit" (in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_143">Section 124</a> (1) ) does not refer
to the stage of the suit, but rather to the court having jurisdiction over the
infringement suit. The other view, (i.e. that in contingencies, where the party
opposing the registered trademark is either unaware of the registration, or
approaches the court, before receiving summons) the court upon being made
aware of the existence of the invalidity plea at the stage of framing issues, is
bound to adjourn it, and that the question of considering the invalidity plea
would arise at the stage of framing issues, does not flow from the
grammatical construction of the provision. According to this court, the
structure of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_144">Section 124</a> (1) firstly contemplates the parties who might
claim invalidity in the infringement suit and secondly deals with the stage
when such plea is urged, leading to different contingencies. For instance, the
two situations that arise are (1) if the rectification application was filed
before the plea is urged (<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_145">Section 124</a> (1)(b) (i)- in which event, its disclosure
compels the court ("the court trying the suit") to adjourn the suit) and (2)
where the suit is filed before a rectification proceeding/application is
preferred (<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_146">Section 124</a> (b) (ii)- in which event the court has to first decide
whether the invalidity plea is tenable, and then only adjourn the suit to
enable the party to approach the IPAB). These, in the opinion of the Court
are broad lines demarcated by Parliament in regard to the different
contingencies based on when a party approaches the court with a trademark
invalidity plea. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that in the first
eventuality, i.e where the rectification proceedings are pending, i.e where
they chronologically precede the infringement suit- the court has no choice




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 30
 in the matter; it cannot determine the prima facie tenability of the invalidity
plea. Such duty is cast only and only where the plea is urged in the suit for
the first time when there is no rectification proceeding at the time the suit
was filed.
</p>
<p id="p_69">32.    Prima facie evaluation of tenability of the plea of invalidity under
<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_147">Section 124</a> is only for the purpose of determining whether, or not, the
proceedings in the suit for infringement should be adjourned (not stayed) for
a period of 3 months from the date when the said issue is considered and
framed. However, in case rectification proceedings are not filed within the
period of three months from the date of raising the issue of invalidity and the
prima facie consideration of the validity of the said plea, the plea of
invalidity of the registered trademark is deemed to have been abandoned,
and the Court shall proceed with the suit as regards the other issues. By
virtue of <a href="/doc/789031/" id="a_148">Section 124(3)</a>, the issue of invalidity of the registered trademark
would not survive to be decided in the suit, as the plea of invalidity would
be deemed to have been abandoned in the suit. Even if the plaintiff, or the
defendant -as the case may be (i.e the party concerned setting up the
invalidity plea), files a rectification application under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_149">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_150">57</a> of the
Act after the expiry of the period of three months, or such extended time as
the Court may grant, though the rectification application would be
maintainable and would be decided on its own merits by the IPAB, the final
decision of the IPAB on the said application would have no bearing on the
suit, in view of the deemed abandonment of the plea of invalidity. Thus,
belated filing of the rectification proceedings (i.e. beyond the period of three
months, or such extended time as may be granted by the Court) would not

 result on the stay of the suit. The IPAB in Jeet Biri Manufacturing Co. P.
Ltd. v. Pravin Kumar Singhal, Trading as P&amp;J Aromatics &amp; Ors., 2011 (47)

        rectification and of the ultimate outcome of such application
       for rectification. In other words, the requirements of "raising
       an issue", "adjourning the case" and a "prima facie
       satisfaction" spelt out in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_168">Section 124</a> (1)(b)(ii) should be read
       as the requirements for the grant of a stay of the suit and not
       as a requirement or pre-condition for filing an application for
       rectification. The plain reading of <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_169">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a> shows
       that it does not mandate a party to obtain the "leave of the
       Court" or "an order of the Court", for filing an application for
       rectification. The right to file an application for rectification is
       a statutory right conferred upon a party who is aggrieved by
       an entry made in the Register. The said statutory right cannot
       be curtailed except by the very provisions of the statute. The
       said right is circumscribed by certain requirements such as
       the contravention of the provisions of the Act or failure to
       observe a condition entered on the Register etc., as spelt out
       under Sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_170">Section 57</a> of the Act. In
       respect of the "Forum" in which such an application for
       rectification could be filed, there is a restriction under <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_171">Section
       125</a>, in that such an application could be filed only before the
       Appellate Board if a suit for infringement was already
       pending. Apart from these restrictions, we do not see any
       other restriction with regard to the filing of an application for
       rectification. To interpret <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_172">Section 124</a> (1)(b)(ii) to mean that
       an order should be obtained from the civil Court for filing an
       application for rectification, regarding prima facie
       satisfaction, would amount to imposing one more restriction
       upon the right of a person to seek rectification of the Register.
       We do not find any such restriction or requirement of the
       leave/permission of the court, under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_173">Section 124</a> (1) (b) (ii).
       Therefore, with great respect to the learned Judges who were
       parties to the decisions of the Gujarat and Delhi High Courts,
       relied upon by the Delhi Party, we are of the considered view
       that the Tindivanam Party was right in filing an application
       for rectification, without obtaining the leave of this Court or

appointment of receiver, or the like.      On the other hand, the statutorily
created body of exclusive jurisdiction, i.e. the IPAB is not so constrained;
rather, it has the duty and the jurisdiction to examine and deal with the
merits of the plea of invalidity of the registration (of a trademark) based on
all the materials placed before it. The IPAB is a judicial tribunal, which is
unconstrained by the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, and guided by
principles of natural justice, but subject to provisions of the Act and the rules
made there under, empowered to regulate its own procedure (<a href="/doc/1758846/" id="a_183">Section 92(1)</a>).
Furthermore, it has the power to receive evidence; issue commissions for
examination of witnesses: and requisition any public record, etc. (<a href="/doc/535848/" id="a_184">Section

duty of examining the plea of invalidity of a registered trademark.           Its
decision, and that of no other court or body, can lead to the striking off or
retention of a mark on the register. It oversees the decisions of the Registrar
and has appellate powers in all such matters. The grounds for invalidating a




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 36
 mark, or deciding a plea of invalidity, are spelt out in <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_194">Sections 47</a>, <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_195">57</a> and
some other related provisions; the IPAB is the only judicial forum charged
with the jurisdiction of deciding upon those issues; any decision on those
issues, on the merits, by a court or another body (other than Registrar who
too has concurrent primary jurisdiction, except in the manner provided by
<a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_196">Section 125</a>) would result in a decision that is coram non judice.
Conversely, therefore, except while considering whether to grant
interlocutory relief, or while considering whether to adjourn the proceedings
by three months to enable the concerned party to move the IPAB under
<a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_197">sections 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_198">57</a>, the plea of invalidity would be prima facie evaluated by a
court under <a href="/doc/1251593/" id="a_199">Section 124(1)(b)(ii)</a>. These provisions clearly show that there is
a bar to exercise of jurisdiction of civil courts on the issue of examination of
merits of a plea of invalidity of a trademark. There can be no doubt that no
civil court can go into that issue under any circumstance at all-except on a
prima facie level.

Courts have dealt with several nuances of this issue, over the last six

question was considered in connection with Sea Customs Act (1878). It was
held that:

 The Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1996908/" id="a_200">Dhulabhai v. State of M.P</a>. (AIR 1969 SC 78)

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">       Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the

<p id="p_74">38.    What can be concluded from the above discussion is that where
special rights are created by a statute, which provides a mechanism for the
enforcement of such statutory rights then, even in the absence of an express
exclusion, the civil court's jurisdiction over those matters is barred. An
analysis of the provisions of the Act in this case, leads one to conclude that
in respect of matters relating to invalidity of registration of a trademark, the
jurisdiction to decide the merits of the dispute is exclusively that of the
statutory authorities-i.e. the Registrar or the IPAB; in the event of such
dispute being raised after the filing of an infringement suit, it is exclusively
that of the IPAB. The civil court's jurisdiction to go into the merits of the
plea of invalidity is therefore bared.
</p>
<p id="p_75">39.    The structure of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_207">Section 124</a> nowhere indicates that jurisdiction of
IPAB (where an invalidity plea is urged in, or after filing of suit) is
conditional upon the civil court's determination of the prima facie tenability
of the invalidity plea. Further, there is nothing in <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_208">Section 124(1)</a> or 124(2) to
suggest that either the plaintiff, or the defendant is precluded from moving
an application before the Registrar /IPAB under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_209">Section 47</a> or 57 of the Act
for removal/rectification of the registered trademark of the opposite party at
any point of time, i.e. before, or after the filing of the suit for infringement
by the plaintiff, or before or after the filing of the written statement by the
defendant. To infer so, in this court's opinion would result in anomalous




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 39
 consequences, because if a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_210">section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_211">57</a> - urging the plea
of invalidity is filed before filing of the suit, the IPAB would be obliged to
consider the matter on merits having regard to all the materials, as the suit
would necessarily have to be stayed (<a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_212">Section 124(1)(i)</a>). However, in the
other situation, access to the IPAB itself would be dependent upon the
assumed 'permission' of the civil court, entirely dependent upon that court's
prima facie view of the case. Now, the plea of invalidity and the grounds are
common - as indicated in <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_213">Sections 47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_214">57</a>. If such is the case, to hold-as
the Astra Zeneca line of authority mandates-that such a proceeding (under
<a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_215">section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_216">57</a>) is preconditioned upon prima facie view of the civil court,
results in different standards being applied to judge invalidity of the
trademark's registration. According to Astra Zeneca, while in the situation
covered by <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_217">Section 124(1)(i)</a>-the civil court is obliged to stay the
infringement suit, after being told that the pre-existing invalidity plea is
pending before the IPAB; however, under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_218">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>-if the civil court
decides that the invalidity plea is prima facie unmerited and refuses
permission-based purely on the nature of the prima facie assessment (and not
on merits-which it cannot consider) access to IPAB is completely barred.
An appeal against the civil court's prima facie assessment is no consolation,
because even the appellate court would only be considering the error, if any,
in the civil court's prima facie assessment. This court is unconvinced by the
arguments of the defendant and other counsel who supported the Astra
Zeneca (supra) decision about its soundness also because the deemed
abandonment of the invalidity plea - the consequence enacted by <a href="/doc/789031/" id="a_219">Section
124(3)</a>, is only in respect of the stay of the suit. There is a line of authority
that a legal fiction should not be extrapolated beyond the purpose for which

 the legislation is brought in. On interpretation of a legal fiction, it was held
in <a href="/doc/842410/" id="a_220">Controller of Estate Duty v. Krishna Kumari Devi</a> (173 ITR 561) that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">       "It is a settled Rule of interpretation of a fiction that the court

       facts which are incidental to the giving effect to that fiction. It
       will not be given a wider meaning than what it purports to
       do".
</blockquote><p id="p_76">The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/971800/" id="a_221">Commissioner of Income-tax Bombay City v.
Amarchand N. Shroff</a> (AIR 1963 SC 1448) administered a caution that
fictions should not be stretched beyond the purpose for which they were
enacted.     Likewise, earlier, in <a href="/doc/204111/" id="a_222">State of Travancore-Cochin &amp; Ors. v.
Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut</a> (AIR 1953 SC 333), it was observed that
when the "the Legislature provides that something is to be deemed other
than it is, we must be careful to see within what bounds and for what
purpose it is to be so deemed".      More recently, in <a href="/doc/1186914/" id="a_223">R. Kalyani v. Janak C.
Mehta</a>, (2009) 1 SCC 516, it was held that "A legal fiction must be confined

<p id="p_77">40.    Applying the reasoning of those decisions, the sequitur to-either the
court holding the invalidity plea to be prima facie untenable (and, therefore,
not adjourning the proceedings in the suit for any length of time), or the plea
of invalidity being held to be prima facie tenable, (and, consequently, the
proceedings in the suit being adjourned for a period of three months to
approach IPAB), and the concerned party not filing the rectification
application within the period of three months, or such extended period as the
court may grant, is not deemed abandonment of the right to claim

 rectification, but rather deemed abandonment of the defence of invalid
trademark registration in the infringement suit. In other words, the right to
claim rectification is never taken away. Thus, the Astra Zeneca (supra) line
of thinking does not appeal to us and we reject the same.
</p>
<p id="p_78">41.    This court, for the foregoing reasons, sums up the conclusions as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_79">(1)    IPAB has exclusive jurisdiction to consider and decide upon the
merits of a plea of trademark registration invalidity - applying <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_224">Section 47</a>
and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_225">57</a> of the Act- in the context of an infringement suit based on such
registered trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_80">(2)    The two situations whereby the infringement action is stayed, are
when the rectification proceedings are instituted before the filing of the suit
(<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_226">Section 124</a> (1) (i)) and after the plea of invalidity is held to be prima facie
tenable under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_227">Section 124</a> (1) (ii)) to enable the party urging invalidity to
approach IPAB.

<p id="p_81">(3)    Where the civil court based on its prima facie assessment states the
the invalidity plea is not tenable or where the litigant does not approach the
IPAB within the time granted (i.e when the court holds the plea to be prima
facie tenable) the only consequence is deemed abandonment of the invalidity
defense in the infringement suit. However, access to IPAB to invoke its
exclusive jurisdiction to test the invalidity of a trademark registration is not
precluded or barred in any manner whatsoever.

OPINION OF VIPIN SANGHI, J

</p><p id="p_84">1.     My learned Brother Bhat, J., prepared and circulated his draft
judgment. Since my understanding and interpretation of Section 124 of the
Trademarks Act, 1999 (the Act) was different on some aspects, I had
forwarded a draft containing my own understanding and interpretation of the
said provision to his Lordship. Some parts of my draft found favour with his
Lordship, and are incorporated in his judgment, which I have had occasion
to go through. There are two aspects on which our differences remain, viz.:-
</p>
<p id="p_85">2.     Firstly, while Brother Bhat, J., is of the view that there are only two
situations wherein the infringement action is stayed, viz.:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       (a)     when rectification proceedings are instituted before the filing of
               the suit [under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_228">Section 124(1)(i)</a>)], and;
</blockquote>



<pre id="pre_2">FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                          Page 43
        (b)     when rectification proceedings are instituted within the
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_47">               specified time after the plea of invalidity is held to be prima
               facie tenable under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_229">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>,

       I am of the view that even if the rectification proceedings are filed
after the filing of the suit, and before the Court takes notice of the said plea,
the suit would be liable to be straightaway stayed under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_230">Section 124(1)(i)</a>.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_86">3.     Secondly, while Brother Bhat, J. is of the view that in cases where
rectification proceedings are not filed before the filing of the suit - the filing
of such proceedings after the Court finds the plea of invalidity of the
registered trademark to be not prima facie tenable (even if they are filed
within the period of three months, or such extended time as the Court may,
for sufficient cause allow), would not oblige the Court to stay the
proceedings in the suit, I am of the view that even if the Court, prima facie,
assesses the plea of invalidity to be not tenable, the filing of rectification
proceedings within the time specified in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_231">Section 124</a> (b) (ii), would also lead
to stay of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_87">4.     Therefore, I have penned down my view on these aspects. A reading
of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_232">Section 124</a> (1) (a) &amp; (b) shows that these clauses deal with situations
where, in a suit for infringement of trademark, either the defendant urges
that the registration of the plaintiff's trademark is invalid, or the defendant
raises a defence founded upon its registered trademark and the plaintiff
pleads that the registration of the defendant's trademark is invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_88">5.     There is nothing in <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_233">Section 124</a> (1) or (2) to suggest that either the
plaintiff, or the defendant, is precluded from moving an application before




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                          Page 44
 the Registrar / Appellate Board under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_234">Section 47</a> or 57 of the Act for
removal/rectification of the registered trademark of the opposite party at any
point of time, i.e. either before, or after the filing of the suit for infringement
by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_89">6.     When a suit for infringement is filed by the plaintiff premised on its
own registered trademark, the defendant is entitled to plead that the
registration of the plaintiff's trademark is invalid. Prior to being served with
summons in the suit, the defendant may, or may not even be aware of the
registration obtained by the plaintiff of its trademark for myriad reasons.
There could be situations, where the defendant may not be aware of the
registration of the plaintiff's trademark on account of an oversight,
omission, or failure/error in the advertisement of the plaintiff's application
for registration of its trademark. Even if the defendant were aware of such
registration of the plaintiff's trademark before the suit for infringement is
filed, he may choose not to initiate proceedings under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_235">section 47</a>/ <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_236">57</a> of the
Act before the Registrar/ Appellate Tribunal, and may await action by the
plaintiff to enforce its rights accruing from the registration of its trademark
by making the first move by filing suit for infringement of its trademark. In
all such situations, the defendant is not precluded from preferring the
application under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_237">Section 47</a>/ <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_238">57</a> before the Appellate Board by resort to
<a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_239">Section 125</a> of the Act after the filing of the suit for infringement by the
plaintiff. There is no fetter imposed on the said right of the defendant by
any provision of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_90">7.     Similarly, where the defendant raises a defence premised on clause (e)
of sub-section 2 of Section 30 of the Act, the plaintiff is entitled to plead




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                           Page 45
 invalidity of the registration of the defendant's mark. <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_240">Section 124</a> does not
say that the plaintiff should move for removal, or rectification of the
defendant's mark either before, or after the raising of a plea in the suit. It
does not put any fetter on the plaintiff's right to invoke either <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_241">Section 47</a>, or
<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_242">Section 57</a>, except as found in <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_243">Section 125</a> of the Act. On this aspect, we all
are in agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_91">8.     The scheme of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_244">Section 124</a> (1)(i) appears to be, that the issue with
regard to stay of proceedings in the suit for infringement of a trademark
would be considered by the Court on the basis of the factual situation as it
obtains when such consideration takes place. Therefore, if on the date of
consideration of the said issue "proceedings for rectification of the
registration in relation to the plaintiff's or defendant's trademark are
pending before the Registrar or the Appellate Board", the Court shall stay
the suit pending final disposal of such proceedings, irrespective of the fact
that such rectification proceedings were initiated before, or after the filing of
the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_92">9.     The clause which has generated this debate is clause (ii) after clause
</p><p id="p_93">(b) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_245">Section 124(1)</a> of the Act. Clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_246">Section 124(1)</a>, deals with a
situation where - even though one of the parties to the suit has raised a plea
of invalidity of the registered trademark of the opposite party, he has not
initiated proceedings, and none are pending either under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_247">Section 47</a>, or 57 of
the Act in relation to the said trademark, when consideration by the Court on
the aspect of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_248">Section 124</a> takes place. When the Court takes notice of the
said plea of invalidity, and finds that the party setting up such a plea has not
initiated action under either <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_249">Section 47</a>, or 57 of the Act before the Appellate




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 46
 Board despite taking such a plea, only for the purpose of considering
whether to adjourn (and not stay) the case for a period of 3 months, the
Court would examine whether such a plea of invalidity is, prima-facie,
tenable. There is no other purpose of such consideration by the Court. The
adjournment of the proceedings in the suit by a period of three months
would be granted by the Court, upon finding the plea of invalidity of the
registered trademark to be, prima facie, tenable.          The purpose of this
adjournment is that, before proceeding is initiated under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_250">Section 47</a> or 57 of
the Act by the concerned party before the Appellate Board, the suit does not
proceed, and during the said period of three months (or such extended
period, as the Court may allow), the party raising the plea of invalidity could
approach the Appellate Board under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_251">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_252">57</a> of the Act. So that the
concerned party raising a challenge to the registered trademark does not
sleep over his right to initiate action under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_253">Section 47</a> or 57 of the Act before
the Appellate Board, and so that the proceedings in the suit are not unduly
delayed, <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_254">Section 124</a> specifies a period of three months as the period for
which the proceedings in the suit may be adjourned.
</p>
<p id="p_94">10.    The result of the rectification proceedings being filed by the
concerned party during the period of 3 months (or such further time as the
Court may extend) for which the proceedings in the suit are adjourned, is
that the suit is liable to be stayed by virtue of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_255">Section 124</a> (2) till disposal of
the rectification proceedings. This is because the exclusive jurisdiction to
rule on the aspect of validity, or invalidity, of the registered trade mark
under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_256">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_257">57</a> of the Act is that of the Registrar, or the Appellate
Board, as the case may be.
</p>



<p id="p_95">FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                          Page 47
</p><p id="p_96"> 11.    The effect of such a party not initiating action under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_258">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_259">57</a> of
the Act within three months, or such further time for which the proceedings
are adjourned and time is extended, is that the plea of invalidity of the
registered trademark stands abandoned qua the suit, and the Court shall
proceed with the suit with regard to other issues in the case.     Pertinently,
<a href="/doc/789031/" id="a_260">Section 124(3)</a> makes it clear that the Court shall proceed in regard to 'other
issues' in the case, meaning thereby, that the issue of validity of the
registered trademark shall not be decided by the Court, since the exclusive
jurisdiction in respect thereof vests in the Registrar or the Appellate Board,
as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_97">12.    Now, what happens if the Court were to arrive at a prima facie view
that such a plea of invalidity is not tenable? A reading of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_261">Section 124(ii)</a>, by
implication, suggests that the Court need not adjourn the proceedings in the
suit for any length of time to await the filing of rectification proceedings by
the concerned party, and may continue with the proceedings in the suit.
However, neither clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_262">Section 124</a>, nor any other provisions of the
Act says or suggests that such prima facie evaluation by the Court would, by
itself, form the basis of a final judgment by the Court. While trying a suit,
the Court is obliged to strike the issues and decide all of them. Thus, the
issue with regard to invalidity of the registered trademark, set up by one or
the other party in the suit, would also need to be decided in the suit.
However, as noticed by learned Brother Bhat, J, the jurisdiction of the Court
to decide the said issue is excluded. The exclusive jurisdiction to decide the
said issue vests in the Registrar or, the Appellate Board - as the case may
be. The decision of the Registrar/ Appellate Board on the issue/plea of




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 48
 invalidity of the registered trademark would bind the Court. Therefore,
unless and until the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark is
withdrawn, abandoned, or deemed to be abandoned in the suit, the
subsistence of the said plea, and the issue premised on the said plea, would
become a stumbling block for the Court to decide the suit, as a
decision/judgment in the suit must necessarily deal with all issues arising in
the suit. In fact, the decision on the said issue of invalidity of the registered
trademark may be central to the decision in the suit. Thus, the Court would
not be able to finally decide the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_98">13.    The scheme of the law, in my view, is not that the aspect of stay of
proceedings in the suit is dependent upon a prima facie evaluation of the
tenability of the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark. If that were
so, such prima facie evaluation would have been statutorily mandated even
in cases covered by clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_263">Section 124</a>. But that is not the position.
Since the right to file the rectification proceedings is not circumscribed by,
or dependent upon the filing of a suit for infringement by one or the other
party, there is no basis to differentiate between the two situations, namely,
where the rectification proceedings are initiated prior to the filing of the suit
and, where they are initiated after the filing of the suit (either before
consideration under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_264">Section 124</a> takes place, or after consideration under the
said Section takes place, and the rectification proceedings are filed within
the time specified under <a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_265">Section 124(2)</a>, or such extended time as the Court
may for sufficient cause allow).
</p>
<p id="p_99">14.    To my mind, the only difference in the impact - of finding the plea of
invalidity to be prima facie tenable, or untenable, is that whereas in the first




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 49
 case, the proceedings in the suit are adjourned forthwith, in the latter case -
the proceedings in the suit may continue. However, till the Court is satisfied
that the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark has been withdrawn,
expressly abandoned, or deemed to be abandoned [by virtue of <a href="/doc/789031/" id="a_266">Section
124(3)</a>], the Court would not be in a position to render judgment in the suit.
The Court would, necessarily, have to await the determination made by the
Appellate Board on the issue of validity or invalidity of the registered
trademark in question, and rely on the said determination of the Appellate
Board in its final judgment. With utmost respect to my learned Brother Bhat,
J., I cannot agree with his view that a mere prima facie finding by the Court
that the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark is not tenable, would
lead to "abandonment" of the said plea of invalidity as, abandonment can
take place only upon either a conscious act or omission of the concerned
party, and not because the Court prima facie does not find the plea of
invalidity to be untenable. In my view, the language of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_267">Section 124</a> (3) does
not support such an inference.
</p>
<p id="p_100">15.    As observed by Brother Bhat, J., prima facie finding against tenability
of the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark does not take away the
right of the concerned party to initiate rectification proceedings before the
Appellate Board, even after such prima facie evaluation. When the Court
examines the aspect of tenability of the plea of invalidity on prima facie
basis - whether, or not, the plea is found prima facie tenable, the clock
begins to tick for the party who sets up the plea of untenability, to then
initiate rectification proceedings before the Appellate Board under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_268">Section
47</a>/ <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_269">57</a> of the Act so as to be able to retain the plea of invalidity of the




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 50
 Registered trademark in the suit. That party should initiate the rectification
proceedings within 3 months, or such extended time as the Court may for
sufficient cause allow. If such rectification proceedings are initiated within
the period of three months, or within such extended period as the Court may
allow for sufficient cause, the Trial of the suit "shall stand stayed until the
final disposal of the rectification proceedings".
</p>
<p id="p_101">16.    <a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_270">Section 124(2)</a> shows that the "party concerned" i.e. the party setting
up the plea of invalidity of the registered trademark has to prove that "he has
made any such application as is referred to in clause (b)(ii) of sub-section
(1)". The expression "any such application as is referred to in clause (b)(ii)
of sub-section (1)", in my view, refers to the nature of the application, viz.
an application for rectification of the register in relation to the registered
trademark in question. The conditionality of the plea of invalidity of the
registered trademark being found to be, prima facie, tenable by the Court,
does not attach to such a rectification application. The expression "... within
the time specified therein or within such extended time as the court may for
sufficient cause allow ...", in my view, only refers to the time period i.e.
three months or such extended time as the Court may allow.
</p>
<p id="p_102">17.    However, if such application for rectification is not made to the
Appellate Board within the period of three months, or such extended time as
the Court may allow, the issue as to the validity of the trademark concerned
shall be deemed to have been abandoned in the suit, and the Court shall
proceed with the suit with regard to the other issues in the case. The effect
of the issue being deemed to have been abandoned in the suit, would be that




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                       Page 51
 the party setting up the plea of invalidity would be precluded from pursuing
the said plea in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_103">18.    Thus, in my view, irrespective of whether, or not, the Court finds the
plea of invalidity prima facie tenable, once a rectification application is filed
by the concerned party within the specified time, or extended time, the
proceedings in the suit are bound to be stayed to await the final disposal of
the rectification proceedings. The Court has no discretion in the matter of
stay of the suit, once it is brought to its notice that removal/rectification
proceedings in respect of the registered trademark in question is pending,
and the plea of untenability of the registered trade mark is subsisting (and
not withdrawn, abandoned or deemed to be abandoned) in the suit. This is
so, because the jurisdiction to rectify the register vis-à-vis a registered
trademark exclusively vests in the Registrar or the Appellate Board, as the
case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_104">19.    The reason for staying the proceedings in the infringement suit when
a plea of invalidity is raised in relation to the registered trademark in
question becomes clear when one examines the rights the registered
proprietor of the trademark is vested with. By virtue of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_271">Section 28</a> and <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_272">29</a> of
the Act, the registration of a trademark, if valid, gives to the registered
proprietor of the trademark the exclusive right to use of the trademark in
relation to the goods, or services in respect of which the trademark is
registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trademark in
any manner provided by the Act.
</p>



<p id="p_105">FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                         Page 52
</p><p id="p_106"> 20.    Therefore, so long as registration of the trademark subsists, the Court
would honour the said registration and enforce the exclusive rights of the
use of the trademark in favour of the registered proprietor of the trademark,
subject to other considerations provided for in the Act and as evolved by the
Courts on considerations of equity.
</p>
<p id="p_107">21.    Pertinently, the Parliament was conscious of the mischief that one or
the other party may play by raising an untenable plea of invalidity. Though
in that situation as well the suit would necessarily have to await the disposal
of the rectification proceedings by the Appellate Board, the power of the
Court to make interlocutory orders, including orders granting injunction,
directing keeping of accounts, appointing a Receiver, or attaching any
property, is preserved by <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_273">Section 124(5)</a> of the Act. Thus, the impact of the
stay of the proceedings in the suit on the parties, would stand mitigated.

ORDER OF COURT

This Full Bench therefore, in its unanimous opinion, holds that:
</p>
<p id="p_109">1.     (a)     IPAB has exclusive jurisdiction to consider and decide upon
the merits of a plea of trademark registration invalidity - applying <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_274">Section
47</a> and <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_275">57</a> of the Act- in the context of an infringement suit based on such
registered trademark. Access to IPAB is not dependent on the civil court's
prima facie assessment of tenability of a plea of invalidity of trademark




FAO (OS) 403/2012                                                        Page 53
 registration. In other words, Section 124 of the Trademarks Act does not
control the choice of a litigant to seek rectification of a registered trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_110">(b)    The decision in <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_276">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr. v. Orchid Chemicals
and Pharmceuticals Ltd</a>. 2007 (34) PTC 469 (DB) (Del) and all other
judgments which hold that the plea of rectification can be raised by a party
to an infringement suit, only if the court trying the suit, rules it to be prima
facie tenable and that if such finding is not recorded, the party cannot avail
the remedy of rectification of a registered trademark, is accordingly
overruled.
</p>
<p id="p_111">2.     This Court holds, by its majority judgment (Vipin Sanghi, J dissenting
on this point) that the two situations whereby the infringement action is
stayed, are when the rectification proceedings are instituted before the filing
of the suit (<a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_277">Section 124</a> (1) (i)) and after the plea of invalidity is held to be
prima facie tenable under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_278">Section 124</a> (1) (ii)). In the first situation, if such
plea exists, before the filing of the suit, the Court has to stay the suit to await
the decision of the IPAB. In the second situation, if there is no application
for rectification before the IPAB when the suit is filed and a party to the
infringement suit, wishes to challenge it after the filing of the suit, it may do
so, but the court has to assesses the tenability of the invalidity plea- if it
finds it prima facie tenable, then and then alone, would it stay the suit to
enable the party to approach the IPAB within a time period. If the party does
not avail of this, or approaches the IPAB after the period given, the court
would proceed with the suit; the plea of invalidity is deemed abandoned in
the infringement suit.
