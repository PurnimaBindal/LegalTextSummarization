Respected Shri Bhardwajji,

I am herewith enclosing our 214th Report on "Proposal for Reconsideration of
Judges cases I, I and III - S.P. Gupta Vs UOI reported in AIR 1982 SC 149,
Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association Vs UOI reported in 1993
(4) SCC 441 and Special Reference 1 of 1998 reported in 1998 (7) SC 739".
The proposal was placed before the Members of the Commission at 3.30 p.m.
today.     The Members of the Commission after due discussion and
deliberations have unanimously approved the report of the Commission. The
Commission, as already stated, examined the law on the subject. Various
recommendations of Parliamentary Standing Committees and law of foreign
jurisdiction like America, Australia, Canada and Kenya, where the executive
is the sole authority to appoint Judges or the executive appoints in
consultation with the Chief Justice of the Country have also been considered.

         I request you to consider this report and do the needful at the earliest.

      Since the matter is of great importance, I am submitting this report
today itself.


                                                                                       Yours sincerely,



                                                                                 ( AR. Lakshmanan )

PROPOSAL FOR RECONSIDERATION OF JUDGES CASES I, II &amp;

III - S.P..Gupta Vs UOI reported in AIR 1982 Supreme

Court      Advocates       on    Record      Association        Vs     UOI

reported in 1993(4) SCC 441 and Special Reference 1

of 1998 reported in 1998 (7) SCC 739



Preface : Part 1

</p><p id="p_2">1)   Why     reconsideration?          The    Supreme         Court    in

     Subhash Sharma Vs U.O.I. (reported in 1991(1)

     Supp. SCC 594) presided over by Ranganath Misra

     CJ, M.N. Venkatachaliah and M.M. Punchi JJ had

     expressed, doubts about the correctness of the

     interpretation         of   the   word    "consultation"          in

     regard    to    the    appointment       of     judges    in     S.P.

     Gupta Vs U.O.I. (reported in 1982 SC 149) in the

     following words (in paras 43 &amp; 45 of the said

     judgment):-
</p>
<p id="p_3">     "The     word     'consultation'           is     used      in      a

     constitutional provision in recognition of the

     status of the High constitutional dignitary who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             8</span>


formally        expresses        the       result        of        the

institutional process leading to the appointment

of judges.        To limit that expression to its

literal limitation shorn of its constitutional

background      and    purpose       is   to    borrow        Justice

Frankfurter's phrase "to stick in the bark of

words."
</p>
<p id="p_4">The    judges     in    that     case      had        opined       that

"Judicial    Review       is     a     part      of     the     basic

constitutional structure and one of the basic

features of the essential Indian constitutional

policy.     The essential constitutional doctrine

does not by itself justify or necessitate any

primacy of the executive wing on the ground of

its political accountability to the electorate.

On    the   contrary      what       is    necessary          is    an

interpretation         sustaining         the     strength         and

vitality of Judicial Review.                    It might under

certain circumstances be said that government is

not bound to appoint a Judge so recommended by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              9</span>


the judicial wing.          But to contemplate a power

for the executive to appoint a person despite

his being disapproved or not recommended by the

Chief Justice of the State and the Chief Justice

of India would be wholly inappropriate and would

constitute an arbitrary exercise of power. Then

again,     whenever    there      might   be   difference     of

opinion between the Chief Justice of a state and

the Chief Justice of India - Some of the weighty

reasons in this behalf are set out by the other

three Judges in their opinion - the opinion of

the   Chief    Justice      of    India   should   have      the

preponderant role.         We are of the view that the

primacy of the Chief Justice of India in the

process of selection would improve the quality

of selection.       The purpose of the 'consultation'

is    to    safeguard       the     independence        of   the

judiciary     and     to   ensure    selection     of    proper

persons.      The matter is not, therefore, to be

considered that the final say is the exclusive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              10</span>


prerogative of the executive government.                          The

recommendations              of         the             appropriate

constitutional functionaries from the judicial

organ   of    the    State    has      an   equally         important

role.        "Consultation        should      have       sinews    to

achieve the constitutional purpose and should

not     be     rendered       sterile         by        a     literal

interpretation.         Who       is   able    to       decide    the

qualities of lawyers proposed to be elevated to

the bench more than the judges of the Superior

Courts before whom they practice?                           There are

preponderant and compelling considerations why

the views of the Chief Justices of the States

and that of the Chief Justice of India should be

afforded a decisive import unless the executive

has some material in its possession which may

indicate      that    the    appointment           is       otherwise

undesirable.(Para 44)

The View which the four learned judges shared in

Gupta's case, in our opinion, does not recognize
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 11</span>


the   special         and       pivotal        position      of   the

institution of the Chief Justice of India.(Para

</p><p id="p_5">45)      The     correctness          of    the   opinion    of   the

majority       in    S.P.    Gupta      case      relating   to   the

status     and       importance        of      consultation,      the

primacy of the position of the Chief Justice of

India and the view that the fixation of Judge

strength        is        not        justiciable       should      be

reconsidered         by     a    larger      bench.     (Para     45)

Emphasis Supplied

The operative part of the order of reference is

contained in para 49 "as in our opinion the

correctness of the majority view in S.P. Gupta

case should be considered by a larger bench we

direct the papers of W.P. No. 1303 of 1987 to be

placed    before       the      learned      Chief    Justice     for

constituting a bench of nine Judges to examine

the two questions we have referred to above,

namely, the position of the Chief Justice of

India with reference to primacy and, secondly,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  12</span>


     justiciability of fixation of judge strength".

     In para 51 the Hon'ble Bench has clarified:-

     We clarify that apart from the two questions

     which we have indicated, all other aspects dealt

     with   by   us    are    intended   to   be   final   by    our

     present order. (Emphasis supplied)

     Therefore, only two questions were referred to

     the bench of nine judges namely (1) The position

     of the Chief Justice of India with reference to

     primacy     and    (2)    The    justiciability       of    the

     fixation of the judge strength.            It is important

     to note that no other question was referred to

     the larger bench.

</p>
<p id="p_8">The relevant portion of the majority judgment

delivered by Justice P.N.Bhagwati speaking for

himself      in    regard          to      the         expression

"consultation"        occurring          in      217     of   the

constitution is extracted herebelow:

"Each       of     the          three           constitutional

functionaries occupies a high constitutional

office and Cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_1">Art. 217</a> provides that

the appointment of a High Court Judge shall be

made after consultation with the functionaries

without assigning superiority to the opinion

of one over that of another.                  It is true that

the Chief Justice of India is the head of the

Indian     judiciary      and      may     be     figuratively

described as paterfamilias of the brotherhood

of Judges but the Chief Justice of a High

Court      is     also        an        equally        important
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            14</span>


constitutional       functionary            and      it    is    not

possible      to     say        that       so     far      as    the

consultative process is concerned, he is in

any way less important than the Chief Justice

of India.      In fact, under the constitutional

scheme, the Chief Justice of a High Court is

not       subject          to        the        administrative

superintendence of the Chief Justice of India

nor is under the control of supervision of the

Chief Justice of India...........

If primacy were to be given to the opinion of

the   Chief    Justice          of   India,     it      would,    in

effect and substance amount to concurrence,

because    giving     primacy        would      mean      that   his

opinion must prevail over that of the Chief

Justice of the High Court and the Governor of

the   State,       which    means       that       the      Central

Government must accept his opinion.                       But it is

only consultation and not concurrence of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                         15</span>


Chief Justice of India that is provided in Cl.

(1) of Art. 217.(Para 29). (emphasis supplied)

There       must   be     a       collegium       to      make

recommendation to the President in regard to

appointment of a Supreme Court or High Court

Judge.      The recommending authority should be

in consultation with wider interests. If the

collegium     is   composed       of    persons    who    are

expected to have knowledge of the persons who

may be fit for appointment on the Bench and of

qualities required for appointment and this

last requirement is absolutely essential - it

would go a long way towards securing the right

kind of Judges, who would be truly independent

and who would invest the judicial process with

significance and meaning for the deprived and

exploited sections of humanity." (para 30)

Regarding      fixation      of     judge    strength     the

majority judgment was of the view that this

was   not    justiciable      and      no   Mandamus     could
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   16</span>


     issue.    This        aspect      however         has    lost    its

     significance because in the case of Subhash

     Gupta the Attorney General made a statement

     that the government had no objection to the

     Hon'ble Court going into the question.

Para 490 - "This nine judge bench sat from

April 7, 1993, to hear this momentous matter

concluding its hearing on May 11, 1993 close

to   the   onset     of    the       summer    vacation.       I

entertained the belief that we all, after July

12, 1993, on the reopening of the Court, if

not earlier, would sit together and hold some

meaningful meetings, having a free and frank

discussion on each and every topic which had

engaged       our    attention,             striving     for    a

unanimous      decision         in   this    historic     matter

concerning mainly the institution of the Chief

Justice of India, relatable to this Court. I

was indeed overtaken when I received the draft

opinion dated June 14, 1993 authored by my

learned brother J.S. Verma, J. for himself and

on   behalf    of    my    learned     Brethren        Yogeshwar

Dayal,     G.N.     Ray,   Dr.       A.S.    Anand     and   S.P.

Bharucha, JJ.          The fait accompli appeared a

stark     reality;          the       majority      opinion      an

accomplishment. The hopes I entertained of a

free and frank discussion vanished.                      But then

came the opinion dated August 24, 1993 of my

learned brother Ahmadi, J. like a pebble of

hope     hewn    out    of        a   mountain      of    despair,

followed        by    the     opinions         of   my     learned

Brethern Kuldip Singh and Pandian, JJ. dated

September       7,     1993       and    September       9,    1993

respectively. No meaningful meeting thereafter

was possible as the views by that time seemed

to     have   been     polarized.         So     now     the   firm

opinions         of     the           eight     Brethren,        as

communicated, are known to me.                      Loaded with

these opinions, I set out to express my own,

more as a duty to the venture embarked upon,

for I owe it immeasurably, for being party to

the referral."

two   questions      to    a   Bench     of    nine       Judges,

namely, to test the correctness of the opinion

the status and importance of consultation and

the   primacy    of    the     position       of    the    Chief

Justice   of    India,      and   whether       fixation         of

Judge strength was not justiciable, clarifying

in the ultimate paragraph that apart from the

two questions aforeindicated all other aspects

dealt with were intended to be final by the

said order.      As I view it, due to the rigidity

of its terms, except for the two questions

specifically      referred,     no      other    matter   was

open to canvass as has seemingly been done.

brevity.     "Please      see      page     712     of    the

judgment).
</p>
<p id="p_16">

In   the    penultimate     para     of    his    concurring

judgment Kuldip Singh J. whose judgment came

as   late    as   September        7,     1993    (when   the

original majority judgment was signed on 14th

June, 1995) makes the following observations

"Before parting with the judgment it would be

appropriate to say that the opinion circulated

by Verma J. was based on elaborate discussion

amongst the Brother Judges who were available

and participated in the discussion.                 Although

Verma, J. incorporated various suggestions in

his original draft but a feeling left lurking

in my mind that I have something more to say
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                     23</span>


     in     support     of        the     conclusions         reached      by

     Verma, J. and that is how I ventured to embark

     upon writing a separate opinion".

     It     is   therefore         clear       that     there      was    no

     discussion,         no       meeting        of     minds      and     no

     consensus among the 9 judges on 14 of June

     1993 when the final draft judgment was signed

     by Justice Verma who spoke for himself and on

     behalf of Yogeshwar Dayal, G.N. Ray, Dr. A.S.

     Anand and S.P. Bharucha, JJ.                            The judgment

     therefore plainly is Per Incuriam.

     should      be     a     'collegium'         which        should      be

     consulted by the Chief Justice of India in

     every       appointment             the   nine      judge        bench,

     speaking         through       Justice       Verma        laid      down

     fourteen conclusions which are as follows:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                          24</span>


</p><p id="p_19">1.The process of appointment of Judges to the

  Supreme      Court    and   the     High    Courts     is   an

  integrated           'participatory             consultative

  process' for selecting the best and most

  suitable persons available for appointment;

  and    all     the   constitutional          functionaries

  must perform this duty collectively with a

  view primarily to reach an agreed decision,

  sub serving the constitutional purpose, so

  that     the    occasion      of        primacy    does     not

  arise.
</p>
<p id="p_20">2.Initiation of the proposal for appointment

 in the case of the Supreme Court must be by

 the Chief Justice of India, and in the case

 of a High Court by the Chief Justice of that

 High    Court;        and      for        transfer     of      a

 Judge/Chief      Justice       of    a    High     Court,    the

 proposal has to be initiated by the Chief

 Justice of India.              This is the manner in

 which     proposals      for    appointments          to     the

  Court or any High Court can be made, unless

  it is in conformity with the opinion of the

  Chief Justice of India.

  Justice    of   India,         indicating     that     the

  recommendee is not suitable for appointment,

  the   appointment    recommended        by    the    Chief

  Justice of India may not be made.               However,

  if the stated reasons are not accepted by

  the   Chief   Justice     of    India   and   the    other

     Judges of the Supreme Court who have been

     consulted in the matter, on reiteration of

     the recommendation by the Chief Justice of

     India, the appointment should be made as a

     healthy convention.       (Emphases Supplied).

        considered fit to hold the office.

</p><p id="p_25">7.      The opinion of the Chief Justice of India

"This opinion has to be formed in a pragmatic

manner and past practice based on convention is

a   safe     guide.          In     matters      relating      to

appointments in the Supreme Court, the opinion

given   by   the    Chief     Justice     of    India    in   the

consultative       process    has    to   be    formed   taking

into account the views of the two seniormost

Judges of the Supreme Court.              The Chief Justice

of India is also expected to ascertain the views

of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court

whose opinion it likely to be significant in

adjudging the suitability of the candidate, by

reason of the fact that he has come from the

same High Court, or otherwise.                 <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_7">Article 124 (2)</a>

is an indication that ascertainment of the views

of some other Judges of the Supreme Court is

requisite.     The object underlying <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_8">Article 124(2)</a>

is achieved in this manner as the Chief Justice

of India consults them for the formation of his

opinion.     This provision in <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_9">Article 124 (2)</a> is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                              30</span>


the   basis   for     the    existing     convention          which

required the Chief Justice of India to consult

some Judges of the Supreme Court before making

his    recommendation.            This   ensures       that    the

opinion of the Chief Justice of India is not

merely his individual opinion, but an opinion

formed collectively by a body of men at the apex

level in the judiciary.
</p>
<p id="p_36">In matters relating to appointments in the High

Courts, the Chief Justice of India is expected

to take into account the views of his colleagues

in    the   Supreme    Court      who    are    likely    to    be

conversant    with     the    affairs     of    the    concerned

High Court.     The Chief Justice of India may also

ascertain the views of one or more senior Judges

of that High Court whose opinion, according to

the Chief Justice of India, is likely to be

significant    in     the    formation     of    his    opinion.

The opinion of the Chief Justice of High Court

would be entitled to the greatest weight, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                            31</span>


the opinion of the other functionaries involved

must be given due weight, in the formation of

the opinion of the Chief Justice of India.                The

opinion of the Chief Justice of High court must

be formed after ascertaining the views of at

least    the    two   seniormost    Judges    of   the    High

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_37">The Chief Justice of India, for the formation of

his opinion, has to adopt a course which would

enable him to discharge his duty objectively to

select the best available persons as judges of

the Supreme Court and the High Courts.                    The

ascertainment of the opinion of the other Judges

by the Chief Justices of India and the                   Chief

Justice of High Court, and the expression of

their opinion, must be in writing to avoid any

ambiguity.

      which pertain to appointment of Supreme Court

      Judges respectively. The text of <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_16">Article 124(2)</a>

      is as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_71">      124(2) Every judge of the Supreme Court shall be

      appointed by the President by warrant under his

      hand and seal after consultation with such of

      the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High

      Courts in the States as the President may deem

      necessary for the purpose and shall hold office

      until he attains the age of sixty-five years:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                        43</span>


Provided that in the case of appointment of a

Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief

Justice of India shall always be consulted:

217(1) Every Judge of a High Court shall be

appointed by the President by warrant under his

hand and seal after consultation with the Chief

Justice of India, the Governor of the State,

and, in the case of appointment of a Judge other

than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the

High Court, and shall hold office, in the case

of an additional or acting judge, as provided in

<a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_17">Article 224</a>, and in any other case, until he

attains the age of sixty-two years.

The word "collegium" is no where present in the

constitution.     It was first used by Bhagwati J

in the majority judgement of S.P. Gutpa vs. UOI

(4:3) In Para 29 "There must be a collegium to

make recommendations etc." ...... (already extracted

in Para 2 of Part-1)        Again in the Presidential

reference   the     expression      "collegium"   and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                 44</span>


     "collegium      of    judges"    has    been      freely       used

     (Paras 15 and 22 to cite a few instances)

     It is submitted that any addition of words in

     the constitution would not be permissible under

     the   interpretive      jurisdiction         of   the     Supreme

     Court.   The Supreme Court has to interpret the

     constitution as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_72">2.   The advisory opinion in the guise of clarifying

     doubts raised regarding the norms laid down in

     the Judges II case has virtually reviewed its

     earlier decision.
</p>
<p id="p_73">     It is respectfully submitted that the opinion

     expressed in an advisory opinion is contrary to

     the plain language of <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_18">article 124(2).</a>                    What the

     article says is that the President shall consult

     the   Chief   Justice     of    India    and      such    of   the

     judges of the Supreme Court or the high court as

     he deems necessary. The article does not place

     any   ceiling    or    limitation       on   the    number      of

     judges other than the Chief Justice of India to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                    45</span>


     be consulted.           The President should always act

     on     the    aid    and     advice       of     the    Council      of

     Ministers (<a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_19">article 74</a>).                  However, contrary to

     what    was    said     in   the    Constitution,         both      the

     Judges II and Judges III cases have laid down

     that    consultation         with     the      Chief    Justice      of

     India means a collegium consisting of the Chief

     Justice of India and two or four judges as the

     case may be. Further, in both the cases it was

     stated that it is the Chief Justice of India who

     should consult with collegium of judges, whereas

     Constitution         says    that     the        President    should

     consult      the     Chief   Justice        of    India   and      such

     judges as he deems necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_74">3.   The three judges cases, i.e. the two judgements

     of   the      Supreme      Court    and     one     opinion     on   a

     Special Reference have all dealt with the scope

     of   "consultation"          and    it    was      in   the   Second

     Judges Case that the Supreme Court evolved the

     concept      of     'primacy'      for    the     opinion     of    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                        46</span>


     Chief Justice of India, which itself was to be

     based    on       a    consultative           process   amongst     the

     senior colleagues of the Chief Justice of India.

     At the hearing of the Special Reference for the

     opinion of the Court about the extent of the

     'consultative'            process,        it     was    conceded     on

     behalf of the Executive (and recorded in the

     Court's    opinion)            that     the    Government     was   not

     seeking       a       review    or      reconsideration       of    the

     judgement in the Second Judges case and that it

     would accept as binding (although an opinion and

     not a decision) the answers of the Court to the

     questions incorporated in the Special Reference.

</p><p id="p_75">4.   The     Supreme         Court's        opinion    in    the   Special

     Reference         not     only         strongly    reinforced       the

     concept of "primacy" of the Chief Justice of

     India's opinion but also increased the number of

     judges the Chief Justice of India must consult

     before providing his opinion and laid down a

     detailed set of guidelines on the procedure to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                       47</span>


     be followed in arriving at the Chief Justice of

     India's opinion to which "primacy" was attached.

     The     procedure           in    effect       transferred        the

     "primacy" from the Chief Justice of India to the

     group of Judges to be consulted.
</p>
<p id="p_76">5.   The collegium is now to consist of the Chief

     Justice      of    India        and    four    (instead    of     two)

     senior-most            judges     of     the     court     in      the

     appointment of a high court judge, the Supreme

     Court judge acquainted with that particular high

     court       should      also     be    consulted       raising     the

     number to six. The increased size of the group

     that    has       to   be   a    part    of    the     consultation

     process with several interests being involved

     has made the consultation process cumbersome and

     delays in filling up of vacancies is bound to

     arise.       The Presidential Reference also provides

     that every communication with the consultee has

     to     be    in    writing       and    the    views     should    be

     communicated to the Government.                      There is no

       indication as to what happens if there is no

       consensus      among     the     consultees     or   if    the

       majority dis-agrees with the Chief Justice of

       India. S.P. Gupta has laid down that the entire

       correspondence and communication between various

       authorities are open to public scrutiny (since

       the entire record was summoned, perused and made

       public in that case).

         upon   it    by    the     text       or    the       context.     The

         underlying         purpose          of     securing          judicial

         independence was salutary but the method of

         acquiring for the Court the exclusive power to

         appoint     judges       by    the        process      of    judicial

         interpretation is open to question. Against

         this backdrop the Committee recalls a recent

         discussion in the Rajya Sabha in which the

         Government        was     asked           regarding         alternate

         arrangements        to    fill       up     the   vacancies        and

         whether there was any scope for having a fresh

         review of the Supreme Court's judgment.</blockquote><p id="p_80">

may    be   noticed    at    this       stage.       On    a    scrutiny     of

several constitutions of other countries it may be

seen    that    in   all     other      Constitutions            either     the

Chief      Justice         of      the      country.         The      Indian

Constitution         has        followed         the   latter        method.

However,      the    2nd   judges        case    Advocates      on    <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_20">Record

Association vs. U.O.I</a>. (1993(4) SCC 441), as we have

seen     in    the       discussion        above,      has     completely

eliminated         and     excluded        the    executive        and    the

opinion       of    the        Hon'ble     Supreme      Court        in   the

Presidential reference (Special Reference 1 of 1998)

has reaffirmed this view with slight modifications.

</p><p id="p_82">       In America the State judges are elected. When

they are not elected their appointment is subject to

legislative concurrence. In the Supreme Court it is

the    President         who    nominates        the   Judges      but    the

nomination has to be confirmed by the Senate. In

Australia it is the executive that appoints judges.

In Canada the Governor General makes the appointment

of judges.
</p>
<p id="p_83">       In New Zealand the Chief Justice is appointed on

the recommendations of the Prime Minister by the

President. The Prime Minister in turn consults the

Attorney General; the A.G. informally consults the

President of Court of Appeal and other judges.

    As     for    High      Court       Judges,      Chief    Justice

recommends after consulting other Judges and gives

the list to the AG for scrutiny. AG scrutinizes the

list,    consults    New    Zealand       Law     Society    and   then

candidate's       consent     is        sought.     Thereafter     the

Cabinet finally recommends the names to the Governor

General who issues the appointment letter.

    Recently, the judges from the Apex Court and the

High Court of Kenya came to the Supreme Court and

they addressed the Supreme Court Bar. They confirmed

that they have a National Judicial Commission which

undertakes the selection process. In this National

Judicial Commission there is the Attorney General

and the Chief Justice, two senior most judges of the

Apex Court and an expert.

<p id="p_84">    Thus     it     may     be     seen      that     in     all   the

Constitutions, the executive has a role to play and

in some countries a major and exclusive role. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                   53</span>


Indian Constitution provides a beautiful system of

checks and balances under Articles 124(2) and 217(1)

for the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court

and     High    Courts    where    both    the    executive    and

judiciary       have   been   given    a   balanced    role.   As

already stated this delicate balance has been upset

by    the      2nd   Judges   case     (Advocate      on   Record

Association Vs Union of India 1993(4) SCC 4412 and

the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Presidential

Reference (Special Reference No.1 of 1998). It is

time the original balance of power is restored.

</p><p id="p_85">      The above recommendation for the need for an

urgent and immediate review of the present procedure

for appointment of judges is further fortified by

the views expressed by Justice J.S. Verma, who wrote

the lead judgment in Advocates on <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_21">Record vs. Union

of India</a> 1993(4) SCC 441, by his fortright views

expressed in an interview in the Front Line Magazine

dated       10.10.1998.        The     relevant     portion     is

reproduced below:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                     54</span><p id="p_86">


</p><p id="p_87">       When asked "you said in one of your speeches

that    judicial    appointments           have       become       judicial

disappointments.        Do     you       now    regret           your     1993

judgement? Justice Verma stated "My 1993 judgement,

which holds the field, was very much misunderstood

and    misused.    It   was    in    that      context       I    said    the

working of the judgment now for some time is raising

serious       questions,       which           cannot        be         called

unreasonable.      Therefore,        some      kind     of    rethink       is

required. My judgement says the appointment process

of High Court and Supreme Court Judges is basically

a     joint   or   participatory          exercise           between       the

executive and the judiciary, both taking part in it.

</p><p id="p_88">       Broadly, there are two distinct areas. One is

the    area   of   legal      acumen      of    the     candidates         to

adjudge their suitability and the other is their

antecedents. It is the judiciary, that is, the Chief

Justice of India and his colleagues or, in the case

of the High Courts, the Chief Justice of the High

Court and his colleagues (who) are the best persons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                       55</span>


to adjudge the legal acumen. Their voice should be

predominant.        So       far      as     the      antecedents          are

concerned, the executive is better placed than the

judiciary      to   know        the   antecedents       of     candidates.

Therefore, my judgement said that in the area of

legal     acumen      the       judiciary's        opinion     should       be

dominant      and     in        the   area       of   antecedents          the

executive's      opinion         should    be     dominant.     Together,

the     two   should        function       to    find    out    the     most

suitable (candidates) available for appointment."



</p><p id="p_89">      The     views        of      the     Parliamentary            Standing

Committee on Law &amp; Justice recommended the scrapping

of    the     present       procedure        for      appointments         and

transfers by Supreme Court and High Court Judges are

of great relevance in this context. As reported in

the Hindustan Times of 20.10.2008 "the Law Ministry

has agreed to review the 15-year-old system after

the     Parliamentary           Standing        Committee      on    Law     &amp;

Justice recommended doing away with the committee of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                       56</span>


judges (collegium). Presently, the collegium decides

the      appointments           and        transfer           of         judges.

Interestingly, the recommendations come close on the

heels of recent cases of corruption against judges

of the top courts in the country. Law Minister H.R.

Bhardwaj       told     Hindustan          Times       that        the     House

Committee's recommendation had been accepted, and an

action-taken report prepared by the Ministry would

now be placed before Parliament. "Collegium system

has   failed.         Its     decisions      on        appointments          and

transfers lack transparency and we feel courts are

not   getting       judges      on    merit.(......)         The       government

cannot    be    a     silent    spectator         on    such       a     serious

issue", Bhardwaj said. The House Committee had said:

"Through    a    Supreme       Court       judgement      in       1993,     the

judiciary wrested the control of judges appointments

and   transfers.        The     collegium      system          has       been   a

disaster    and       needs    to     be   done    away        with".       H.R.

Bhardwaj, Minister for Law &amp; Justice, said "It is

the right time to review this important matter".

"There was no problem till 1993 when the judiciary

tried to re-write the Article of the Constitution

dealing with appointments. They created a new law of

collegium       which   was         wrong.   In    a    democracy,          the

primacy    of    Parliament          cannot    be      challenged",          he

said.

appointment of Judges in High Courts and Supreme

Court     are    done     in    a     transparent         way.      We    have

said that from the very beginning of identifying the

eligible          persons,           the         various      places         of

recommendations,         be     it    at     the    level     of    the    High

Courts, or, at the Governor's level or at the level

of   the    Departments,         and        finally     be    the    Supreme

Court, should be transparent, and this should be put

up   in    the    web    site    then       and     there     so    that    the

person, who is going to occupy the Constitutional

place, is known to the public, and their background

should be allowed to be discussed by the public and,

finally, it has to go through the process of issuing

warrant     by    the    President          of    India.     But,    what   is

happening        presently      is    that       from   the    day    one    of

identifying        the   person       till        the   issuance     of     the

warrant, nothing is known to anybody except to the

persons who are involved in it. Even the persons,

who are identified and who are going to be made as

judges of the High Court or of the Supreme Court,

may not know about it. This type of secrecy is not

good for democracy".

    It may be noted in this context that in every

High Court the Chief Justice is from outside the

State   as   per    the   policy    of   the   Government.   The

senior most Judges who form the collegium are also

from outside the State. The resultant position is

that the judges constituting the collegium are not

conversant with the names and antecedents of the

candidates    and    more   often   than   not,   appointments

suffer from lack of adequate information.

    Two alternatives are available to the Government

of the day. One is to seek a reconsideration of the

three judgments aforesaid before the Hon'ble Supreme

Court. Otherwise a law may be passed restoring the

primacy of the Chief Justice of India and the power

of the executive to make the appointments.
