argue that the publication of Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_43">Section 4</a> in two

      <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_58">Section 4(1)</a> of the LA Act. He states that the respondents, after 


      publishing the Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_59">Section 4</a> on 4.07.2006 in the 


      regional   language,   that   is,   Hindi,   had   also   published   the   said 


      Notification   in   English   language   on   05.01.2007.   In   this   regard, 


      the learned senior counsel argues that the period of limitation of 


      one year in terms of proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_60">Section 6(1)</a> of the LA Act would 


      commence   only   from   05.01.2007,   that   is,   the   date   of   the   last 


      publication   of   the   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_61">Section   4</a>   of   the   Act.   He 


      further submits that the proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_62">Section 6(1)</a> refers only to the 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                    8</span>


      declaration of the Notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_63">Section 6</a> within the period 


      of one year from the date of publication of the Notification under 


      <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_64">Section 4</a> of the LA Act and not the publication of the declaration 


      under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_65">Section 6</a> (2). In other words, the proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_66">Section 6(1)</a> 


      whilst   prescribing   the   period   of   limitation,   only   refers   to   the 


      declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_67">Section 6</a>, which is in the nature of order and 


      excludes   the   publication   of   the   declaration   from   its   ambit. 


      Therefore,   the   subsequent   publication   of   declaration   of

       where the land is situated. Also, the people at Pargana Hapur in 


       the   Ghaziabad   district   are   well   conversant   with   the   Hindi 


       language.   In   our   considered   view,   the   publication   of   the 


       Notification in two newspapers having circulation in the locality 


       where the land is situated and where people are well conversant 


       with Hindi amounts to ample compliance with the requirement of

       the   subsequent   publication   of   English   translation   of   the   said 


       Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_88">Section 4</a> in two newspapers on 05.01.2007 is

       <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_90">Section   4(1)</a>   of   the   LA   Act,   which   can   be   treated   as   date   of

which is the date of publication of the Notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_92">Section 


4(1)</a> of the LA Act.  If the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_93">Section 6</a> of the LA 


Act is made before the expiry of the period of one year starting 


from 04.07.2006, then, only such declaration will be considered 


as valid for the purpose of the acquisition of land. However, in 


the  present   case,   the  declaration   under  <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_94">Section   6</a>  was issued  on 


18.12.2007   which   is   clearly   beyond   the   period   of   limitation   of 


one year as  mandated by the proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_95">Section  6(1)</a>  of the LA 


Act.   Therefore,   the   declaration   of   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_96">Section   6</a>

</p><p id="p_27">12)             The second point in issue before us is the invocation of the 


       urgency clause by the respondents to acquire the lands in dispute. 


       Mrs. Pinky Anand, learned senior counsel, submits that this Court 


       has issued direction to relocate the bone industries in Ghaziabad 


       vide its Order dated 17.08.2004, since then, the State Government 


       had not shown any kind of urgency and was only considering the 


       proposal of the Leather City Project in order to relocate the said 


       industries   for   public   purpose   as   they   were   located   in   the   dense 


       human habitation and causing environmental pollution and health 


       hazards. It was only in July, 2006 that the State Government had 


       issued   the   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_102">Section   4</a>   on   3.7.2006,   in 


       continuation   with   this,   after   the   lapse   of   more   than   a   year,   the 


       State   Government   has   issued   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_103">Section   6</a>   on 


       18.12.2007   by   invoking   urgency   provision   as   contemplated   by 


       <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_104">Section   17(1)</a>   and   <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_105">17(4)</a>   of   the   LA   Act.   In   other   words,   the 


       lackadaisical attitude of the State Government since the direction 


       of   this   Court   in   2004   nearly   2   years   ago   and   in   making   the 


       declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_106">Section 6</a> after the lapse of more than one year, 


       form the issuance of the Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_107">Section 4</a> of the LA

Act   does   not   exhibit   or   depict   any   kind   of   urgency   but   only 


lethargy   on   their   part   in   acquiring   the   lands.   Therefore,   the 


urgency   contemplated   in   the   <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_108">LA   Act</a>   cannot   be   equated   with 


dereliction of responsibility on the part of the State Government. 


The   learned   senior   counsel   contends   that   the   respondents   had 


unnecessarily   invoked   the   urgency   provisions   under 


<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_109">Section 17</a> (1) read with 17 (4) for the acquisition of the land for 


construction  of the Leather  City  Project  in order  to relocate  the 


said industries in view of the delay of two years in the issuance of 


the   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_110">Section   4</a>   and   delay   of   more   than 


seventeen months in making declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_111">Section 6</a> from the 


date   of   publication   of   the   Notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_112">Section   4</a>.   The 


learned   senior   counsel   argues   that   the   invoking   of   the   urgency 


provision under <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_113">Section 17(4)</a>, which excludes the application of 


the   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_114">Section   5-A</a>,   by   the   respondents   in   the   absence   of   any   real 


urgency   as   contemplated   by   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_115">Section   17</a>   amounts   to   illegal 


deprivation   of   the   right   to   file   objection   and   hearing   of   the 


appellants   and   inquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_116">Section   5-A</a>   of   the   LA   Act.   She 


submits that an expropriatory legislation like the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_117">LA Act</a> must be 


given strict construction. She further submits that <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_118">Section 5-A</a> is a

       their lands which can be dispensed with only in exceptional cases 


       of real urgency and not by side-wind.  The learned senior counsel 


       also submits that the entire acquisition proceedings are vitiated as 


       the respondents have failed to obtain the approval of development 


       of the Leather City Project as a sub-regional plan under Section

Act. The same was published in Hindi and English in two daily 


newspapers   on   4.03.2006   and   24.01.2007,   respectively. 


Subsequently, the State Government had issued the Notification

negligence   on   the   part   of   the   State   Government   to   acquire   the 


said land. He contends that the construction of the Leather City 


Project, in view of the pollution of environment caused by these 


industries as observed by this Court, is an urgent matter requiring 


acquisition of the land by invoking the urgency provisions under 


<a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_125">Section   17(1)</a>   and   <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_126">Section   17(4)</a>,   thereby,   dispensing   with   the

Narain and Ors. v. Union of India</a>, (1996) 1 SCC 9, would argue

indicates   the   existence   of   urgency   in   acquiring   the   land   for

right of the land owner for filing of objections and opportunity of

eliminate delay likely to be caused by an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_131">Section 


5-A</a>   of   the   LA   Act.   The   learned   senior   counsel   further   submits 


that   the   Hapur   Pilkhuwa   Development   Authority   (hereinafter 


referred to as "the HPDA")  vide  its resolution dated 19.04.2005, 


has   authorized   the   National   Capital   Region   Planning   Board 


(hereinafter referred to as "the NCRPB") to prepare master plan 


for   Hapur   containing   the   Leather   City   Project   termed   as   Sub-


regional   plan.   Subsequently,   the   NCRPB   in   June,   2009,   issued 


draft   Sub-regional   plan   but   without   indicating   the   Leather   City 


Project. Thereafter, the HPDA has made series of requests dated 


27.08.2009, 18.08.2010 and 22.04.2011 to the NCRPB to include 


the Leather City Project in its Sub-regional plan. The respondents 


are keenly awaiting reply to these requests and hence, the grant of

"77.  From   the   analysis   of   the   relevant   statutory  

provisions and interpretation thereof by this Court  

in  different   cases,  the  following   principles  can  be  

culled out:
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">(i)   Eminent   domain   is   a   right   inherent   in   every  

sovereign   to   take   and   appropriate   property  

belonging   to   citizens   for   public   use.   To   put   it  

differently,  the sovereign is entitled to reassert its  

dominion over any portion of the soil of the State  

including   private   property   without   its   owner's  

consent provided that such assertion is on account  

of   public   exigency   and   for   public   good   --

Gujarat</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">(ii) The legislations which provide for compulsory  

acquisition of private property by the State fall in  

the category of expropriatory legislation and such  

legislation   must   be   construed   strictly   --  <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_137">DLF

</p><p id="p_39">(iii)   Though,   in   exercise   of   the   power   of   eminent  

domain,   the   Government   can   acquire   the   private  

property   for   public   purpose,   it   must   be  

remembered   that   compulsory   taking   of   one's  

property   is   a   serious   matter.   If   the   property  

belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of  

the   society   or   people   suffering   from   other  

handicaps, then the court is not only entitled but is  

duty-bound to scrutinise the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_140">LA Act</a>ion/decision of  

the   State   with   greater   vigilance,   care   and  

circumspection   keeping   in   view   the   fact   that   the  

landowner   is   likely   to   become   landless   and  

deprived of the only source of his livelihood and/or  

shelter.

<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">(iv) The property of a citizen cannot be acquired by  

the   State   and/or   its   agencies/instrumentalities  

without complying with the mandate of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_141">Sections 4</a>,

right   to   property   without   being   heard.   Only   in   a  

case   of   real   urgency,   the   State   can   invoke   the

mandate   of   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_146">Section   5-A</a>.   These   provisions   can   be  

invoked   only   when   the   purpose   of   acquisition  

cannot   brook   the   delay   of   even   a   few   weeks   or  

months.   Therefore,   before   excluding   the  

application of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_147">Section 5-A</a>, the authority concerned  

must   be   fully   satisfied   that   time   of   few   weeks   or  

months   likely   to   be   taken   in   conducting   inquiry  

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_148">Section 5-A</a> will, in all probability, frustrate  

the public purpose for which land is proposed to be  

acquired.

issue   of   urgency   is   subjective   but   is   a   condition  

precedent   to   the   exercise   of   power   under   <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_149">Section  

17(1)</a>   and   the   same   can   be   challenged   on   the  

ground   that   the   purpose   for   which   the   private  

property   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   not   a   public  

purpose   at   all   or   that   the   exercise   of   power   is  

vitiated   due   to   mala   fides   or   that   the   authorities  

concerned did not apply their mind to the relevant  

factors and the records.

                            The   acquisition   of   land   for   residential,  

                commercial,   industrial   or   institutional   purposes  

                can   be   treated   as   an   acquisition   for   public  

                purposes within the meaning of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_157">Section 4</a> but that,

                commercial,   industrial   or   institutional   areas  

                usually   take   few   years.  Therefore,   the   private

                invoking   the   urgency   provision   contained   in

</p><p id="p_50">15)            In view of the above it is well settled that acquisition of land

</p><p id="p_60">17)           In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is clear 


       that   this   Court,   vide   its   Order   dated   17.08.2004,   has   issued   a 


       direction to the respondents to relocate the bone mills and allied 


       industries   causing   environment   pollution   and   health   hazards   as 


       per   the   recommendations   of   the   CPCB   and,  inter   alia, 


       respondents were also directed to identify the area for relocation. 


       Pursuant to this, respondents have filed an affidavit in the month 


       of   December,   2004   specifying   the   construction   of   the   Leather 


       City   Project   at   Hapur   in   Ghaziabad.   Subsequently,   it   was   only 


       after the lapse of two years, the State Government had issued a 


       Notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_191">Section   4</a>   on   03.07.2006   and   the   same   was 


       published   on   04.7.2006.   Thereafter,   the   State   Government   took 


       more   than   17   months   in   order   to   make   a   declaration   of   the 


       Notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_192">Section 6</a> from the date of publication of the 


       Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_193">Section 4</a> of the LA Act. In view of the above 


       circumstances, it is crystal clear that the government functionary 


       has proceeded at very slow pace at two levels, that is, prior to the 


       issuance of the Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_194">Section 4</a> and post the issuance

       construction of the Leather City Project, which undoubtedly is a 


       public purpose.   Therefore, the above series of the events amply 


       exhibit   the   lethargical   and   lackadaisical   attitude   of   the   State 


       Government.   In   the   light   of   the   above   circumstances,   the 


       respondents are not justified in invoking the urgency provisions 


       under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_196">Section 17</a> of the LA Act, thereby, depriving the appellants 


       of   their   valuable   right   to   raise   objections   and   opportunity   of 


       hearing before the authorities in order to persuade them that their 


       property may not be acquired.

               one and all and it is very difficult to negotiate the  

               traffic   congestion   in   Delhi   and   National   Capital  

               Region.   Therefore,   in   the   present   situation,   it  

               cannot   be   said   that   the   invocation   of   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_217">Section   5-A</a>  

               was for ulterior purpose or was arbitrary exercise  

               of   the   power.  Since   the   master   plan   has   already  

               been   prepared   and   it   has   been   approved   by   the  

               Planning Board and they have sanctioned a sum of  

               Rs   20.65   crores   for   the   development   of   this  

               Transport   Nagar   and   widening   of   National  

               Highway   91   into   four   lanes.   Therefore,   the  

               proposal was approved by the Board and it got the  

               sanction   from   the   National   Capital   Regional  

               Planning   Board   and   ultimately   the   Government  

               invoked   the   power   under   <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_218">Section   17(4)</a>   read   with  

               <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_219">Section   5-A</a>   of   the   LA   Act   dispensing   with   the  

               objections.  In   the   light   of   these   facts   it   cannot   be  

               said   that   invoking   of   power   was   in   any   way   an  

               improper exercise.  There is  need for  decongestion  

               of traffic and it is really the dire need of the hour  

               and   earlier   it   is   implemented,   the   better   for   the

       respondents   had   made   several   requests   to   NCRPB   to   include 


       Leather City Project but no reply granting approval has come in 


       terms   of   Section   19(2)   of   the   NCRPB   Act.   Section   19  of   the 


       NCRPB Act  contemplates the grant of approval by the NRCPB, 


       and   finalization   by   the   State   Government,   of   the   Sub-Regional 


       Plan if it is in consonance and consistent with the Regional Plan 


       for the National Capital Region.   Furthermore,  Section 29 of the 


       NCRPB   Act   contemplates   that   the   State   Government   shall   not 


       undertake   any   development   activity,   which   is   inconsistent   with 


       the   Regional   Plan   for   the   National   Capital   Regional.   Also, 


       Section 27 of the NCRPB Act has overriding effect on any other 


       inconsistent   law   or   instrument.   The   overall   scheme   of   the 


       NCRPB   Act   contemplates   common   plan,   coordination   and 


       harmony   in   the   formulation   of   policy   of   land   uses   and 


       development   of   infrastructure   in   the   National   Capital   Region. 


       Therefore, in our opinion, the acquisition of land in the absence 


       of   express   approval   in   terms   of   <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_220">Section   19</a>   and   operation   of
