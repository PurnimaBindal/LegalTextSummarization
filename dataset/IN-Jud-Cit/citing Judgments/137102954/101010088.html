           In an affidavit-in-rejoinder the Plaintiffs have denied that the defendants
                                 
    domain name is a mere extension of their trading name and contended that the


    website is used for commercial purposes and not merely for information. The
       


    Plaintiffs have further contended that merely because the name 'Raymond' is a
    



    common christian name and because some applications for registration of





    marks are pending, the Plaintiffs cannot be denied protection.         The Plaintiffs


    have contended that many of the websites referred to by the defendants in





    support of their case of common use of the Mark are not of entities in India but


    outside the country. It is reiterated that the Plaintiffs' mark is a well known


    mark and allegations of acquiescence, delay and latches have been denied. The

    Plaintiffs submitted that the mark 'Raymond' is well known trade-mark and a
                                  
    domain name is to be treated as a trade-mark.             He submitted that the
                                 
    Defendants were emboldened by their success in the Notice of Motion in the


    2006 suit and had since adopted the same mark 'Raymond' and incorporated it
       


    in domain name of the Defendants. He submitted that the Order of the learned
    



    Single Judge dated 15.2.2007 had only considered Plaintiffs' action so far as it





    relates to Section 29 Sub-section 5 of the Act. Mr.Tulzapurkar submitted that


    no member of the public who associates the word 'Raymond' with the Plaintiffs'





    trade-mark and in relation to wearing apparel is likely to know that the name


    'Raymond Pharmaceutical Private Limited' appearing on the letter head of the


    Defendants or used elsewhere is not that of the Plaintiffs.

    under <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_7">Section 29(5)</a> because the defendants' corporate name used the Mark


    and not under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_8">Section 29(4)</a>. That action had failed and the order dismissing




                                                        
    the Motion has since attained finality. However, merely because the said Motion




                                            
    was dismissed, it is not as if the Plaintiffs cannot pursue this action under
                                   
    <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_9">Section 29(4)</a> against the Defendants. The present suit is filed essentially to
                                  
    protect Plaintiffs' registered trade-mark in relation to goods and services which


    are not similar to those for which the trade-mark is registered and have a
       


    reputation in India. That the use of the Mark was without due cause, takes
    



    unfair advantage of and is detrimental to the distinctive character or reputation





    of the registered trade-mark. In other words, in respect of dis-similar goods, the


    Plaintiffs continue to have a cause of action against the Defendants and could





    seek reliefs in the present suit under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_10">Section 29(4)</a>, which is a separate class by

    Plaintiffs must show that the Defendants' mark is identical to or similar to that


    of the Plaintiffs' registered trade-mark and the Defendants are using the mark




                                                         
    in relation to goods and services which are dissimilar to the goods in relation to




                                            
    which mark of the Plaintiffs' is registered.      Mr. Tulzapurkar referred to the
                                 
    analysis by the Division Bench of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_12">Section 29</a> and referred to paragraph 9 of the
                                
    judgment. He submitted that the Division Bench had proceeded on the basis


    that the Plaintiffs could not have relied upon the provisions of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_13">Section 29(4)</a>
       


    since there is no dispute that the Defendants are not dealing in goods in respect
    



    of which the Plaintiffs' mark is registered. The Division Bench did not interfere





    with the impugned order as it not consider the Plaintiffs' case as one under


    sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_14">Section 29</a> and did not consider it necessary to refer to the





    material relied upon by the Plaintiffs to contend that the Plaintiffs' mark has


    reputation in India and that the adoption of the mark by the Defendants is


    without due cause.

    the mark as a part of domain name. In fact, the Defendants are now passing off

<p id="p_31">    13.     It will be appropriate to deal with some of the relevant judgments. In the


    case of KSB Aktiengesellschaft (supra), the letters 'KSB' formed an essential




                                            
    part of the corporate name of the first Plaintiff, having been adopted with
                                   
    reference to the surnames of the founders of the first Plaintiff. The Defendants
                                  
    adopted the name of 'KSB' Real Estate and Finance Private Limited as part of its
       

    trading name and corporate style. The defence set up was that the areas of the
    



    activity of the Defendant are restricted to real estate and finance within the


    geographical limits of the Greater Bombay. Hence, there is no possibility of





    deception. This was followed up by the second defence that there are other


    companies which use the mark 'KSB' as a part of their trading style and





    therefore, the Plaintiffs could not object especially since the name was not


    distinctive as sought to be contended by the Plaintiff. This Court observed that

    the first defence overlooked the provisions of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_39">Section 29(4)</a> which entails that




                                                                                 
    their registered mark may be infringed by using the mark in relation to goods




                                                         
    or   services which are not similar to those in relation to which mark is


    registered. As long as registered trade-mark and its reputation in India, use of




                                                        
    the mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or would be




                                               
    detrimental to the distinctive character or reputation of their registered mark.
</p>                                  
<p id="p_32">    The observations in the said judgment are to the effect that the provisions of
                                 
    <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_40">Section 29(4)</a> came to be introduced in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_41">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 in order to


    extend the protection available in an action for infringement and it would not
       


    be a valid defence that the Defendant had used the mark in relation to goods
    



    which are not similar to those in respect of which the Plaintiffs had registered





    mark since such use would be detrimental to the distinctive character and


    repute of the mark of the Plaintiff. Even proceeding on the basis of passing off,





    it was held that it is not necessary for an action in passing off that a common


    field of activity is required to be established.

    contention on behalf of the Defendant that ZARA is a dictionary word and was


    adopted from the name of ZARAGOZA. The word 'ZARA' a well known Spanish
       


    brand was neither generic nor descriptive even in the Spanish language and
    



    the Defendants had not given any plausible explanation for the adoption of the





    mark 'ZARA' and it was found that the name "ZARA TAPAS BAR" was adopted


    by the Defendants from the mark 'ZARA' of the Plaintiffs who had already





    opened stores in 44 countries and therefore adoption of the word 'ZARA' by the


    Defendants was not honest.

    Court observed that a well known trade-mark can be protected even in relation




                                                        
    to dis-similar goods used by the Defendants and to prove a case of infringement

    trade-mark which has been adopted by the Defendants has been taken from the




                                           
    Plaintiff's registered trade-mark.   In order to establish infringement, the
                                   
    Plaintiff's mark must be registered under the Act and the Defendant's mark
                                  
    must be deceptively similar to the registered trade-mark and its use was likely


    to deceive and cause confusion. Once, it is indicated and the Court finds that
       


    the Defendant's mark is closely, visually and phonetically similar then no
    



    further proof is necessary. A reference was also made to the observations of

    off. The learned Single Judge observed that as held in Corn Products (supra),




                                                                                 
    before an Applicant can derive assistance, for the success of his application,




                                                         
    from the presence of a number of marks having one or more common features,


    he has to prove that these marks had acquired a reputation and user in the




                                                        
    market. This was based on the principle that traders and the public would be




                                            
    aware of common elements and characteristics and when they see another
                                   
    mark having the same characteristics, they would immediately associate the
                                  
    same with the series of the marks with which they are already familiar. The


    judgment in Corn Products (supra) required the Defendants to prove that a
       


    mark must not be merely in use but extensively so. Thus, it is not sufficient for
    



    the Defendant to show some user of the mark but he must establish extensive





    use at-least prima-facie.

<p id="p_51">    26.     On behalf of the Defendants, Mr. Khandekar the learned counsel





    submitted that the use of the mark by the Defendant is bonafide and perfectly

    having filed the 2006 Suit there is no question of the Plaintiff now pursuing




                                                                                  
    the present suit. Mr. Khandekar alluded to the fact that the interim Order in the




                                                         
    2006 suit is now final since the Special Leave Petition filed against the order of


    the Division Bench has been dismissed. The Plaintiffs are only attempting a




                                                        
    second innings by filing the present suit. Secondly, the Defendants had adopted




                                            
    the domain name in the year 2009 yet the present suit has been filed only in the
                                 
    year 2014. Acquiescence by the Plaintiffs is thus a defence set up against the
                                
    Plaintiffs and even assuming the Mark is well known mark, injunction need not


    follow since the criteria contemplated by <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_60">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act had not been
       


    met. The criteria were cumulative and not disjunctive and even assuming the
    



    mark to be a well-known mark, the Defendants do not fall foul of the





    provisions of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_61">Section 29(4)</a>. Thirdly, Mr. Khandekar submitted that as far as


    passing off is concerned, the Plaintiffs had failed to establish that there was any





    misrepresentation or likelihood of damage. In view of the material before the


    Court particularly findings of the Single Judge in the 2006 suit, merely because


    Plaintiffs are registered proprietors of the Mark, the Defendants cannot be

    Mark from a prior date as a part of its corporate name. Subsequently, the


    Defendants had also registered their domain name. Mr. Khandekar referred




                                                           
    paragraphs 13 and 14 of the plaint in support of his contention that the prayers




                                              
    in the present suit are wide enough to cover the use of the corporate name
                                   
    despite the fact that the Plaintiffs have failed to obtain injunction in the first suit
                                  
    and thus it is not open for the Plaintiffs to seek further restraint as aforesaid.

<p id="p_52">    27.       The Defendants have been in business since 1983 and are now using a
    



    shorter version of their corporate name as a domain name. According to Mr.





    Khandekar, use of the domain name is tantamount to use of its corporate name


    which has not been prevented. A domain name is a specie of the corporate





    name. He submitted that unlike in entities such as shaadi.com where the entity


    itself is known as Shaadi.com Private Limited, the Defendant's domain name


    uses a part of its corporate name. The registration and use of the domain name

    contention that the Defendant's use of the Mark is not in relation to the goods

    the Plaintiff's trade-mark is likely to think that the word 'Raymond' appearing
       


    in the Defendant's name would refer to the Plaintiff's mark.         Mr. Khandekar
    



    then relied upon the observations of the Division Bench upholding the





    Defendant's contentions that legislation supports the Defendant's contention


    and the use of the Mark in relation to goods of the Defendant would infringe





    the rights of registered owners only if the goods in respect of which the


    Defendant was using the Mark was similar to that of the Plaintiff.

    submitted that although in paragraphs 10 and 12 of the plaint, a bare

    Audi-Med, Mr. Khandekar submitted that use of an impugned Mark by itself is




                                                        
    not sufficient but such use should be viewed with regard to the inherent


    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark. There should be similarity in respect




                                                       
    of the marks, range of the goods or services for which the earlier mark enjoys a




                                            
    reputation and the uniqueness or otherwise of the mark in the market place
                                   
    must be considered. In the case of Audi-Med, the Registry declined to accept
                                  
    the opponent's case that the Applicants Audio Medical Devices Limited were


    attempting to take unfair advantage of the reputation of Audi Motor Cars. It
       


    must also be seen whether the respective goods/services although dis-similar,
    



    are in some way related or likely to be sold through the same outlet and on this





    basis, it would have to be established that the defendant's domain name had


    more than a de minimis effect on the distinctive character of the earlier mark if





    at all.    He submitted that if the Defendants had been permitted to use a


    corporate name, there is no reason as to why he could not use the domain


    name. Ipso facto the use of the corporate name is such as to permit the

    Defendants. He further submitted that although the Defendants had relied upon




                                             
    Annexure 'G' containing a large number of domain names using the word
                                   
    'Raymond', there was no denial of this fact and not having denied extensive and
                                  
    common use of the word 'Raymond' there is no justification whatsoever in the


    Plaintiff's now contending that the Defendants          could not use the word
       


    'raymond' in its domain name.

    attempting to pass off their domain as that of the Plaintiffs.         Mr. Khandekar




                                                                                   
    submitted that the cause of action for passing off would entail three ingredients




                                                           
    viz.     (a) passing off would result from misrepresentation, it would have to be


    made by the trader in the course of trade to a customer. (b) It must be




                                                          
    calculated to injure and (c) must cause actual damage to the trader. In the




                                              
    present case, there was no misrepresentation, nothing was calculated to injure
                                    
    and the plaint was silent on any actual damage or even the probability of such
                                   
    damage.        The Plaintiffs had failed to make out any case, there is no material


    whatsoever to establish an action in passing off. According to Mr. Khandekar,
       


    the Defendants' use of the domain name is at best a use in respect of the Class
    



    44 and, therefore, not actionable. Moreover,         Defendants are using name





    'Raymond' in relation to their business since 1983. The domain name is stated


    to be in use since 31.8.2009 whereas the Plaintiffs have registered their Mark





    in class 5 only as of 23.6.2011 (see Exhibit B-16). He submitted that the web-

    the decision in the case of Kamat Hotels (Supra) Mr. Khandekar submitted that


    the Plaintiffs had not shown any sales as in the case of Kamat Hotels (Supra).

    prejudice to the aforesaid contentions the Defendants have shown sales and
                                 
    the use of www.raymondpharma.com. However, as far as the Plaintiffs are
                                
    concerned, there is no evidence of any use in Class 5. Making reference to the


    case of Raymond v. Ashirbad Electricals (supra) Mr. Khandekar
       


    submitted that the scheme of the mark used by Ashirwad Electricals was almost
    



    identical and dishonesty was apparent. In Raymond v. Sai Balaji (supra) the





    Defendant had blatantly copied the Mark in respect of the very same goods and


    services. In the case of Rediff Communications Ltd. (supra) there was no





    distinction as to use of the trade-mark versus corporate name and the judgment


    did not in any manner hold that use of the domain name does not amount to


    use of a corporate name. Furthermore, the services in the case of Rediff (supra)

    upon the observations that Pizza Hut enjoyed an international reputation
                                  
    whereas the Defendant has no goodwill in India since it had not commenced


    any business in India and that if the Plaintiff's trade-mark enjoy a trans-border

    Kerly's law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, (15th edition) in order to explain


    the mechanics of the internet. He relied upon provisions relating to the link

    registration as such is not an intellectual property right but it is a contract with
                                 
    the registration authority controlling the Top Level Domain concerned,
                                
    allowing communications to reach the domain name owner's computer via


    internet links channeled through the registration authority's server. It does not
       


    create a monopoly or exclusive right and in many ways akin to a company
    



    name registration which is a unique identifier of a certain company but by





    itself does not confer any intellectual property rights. Relying upon the said


    commentary on the Modern Law of Trade Marks (3rd edition) by Christopher





    Morcom, Mr.Khandekar submitted that a domain name is an identifier and


    nothing more. It is akin to a 'shop front' and the domain name acts as shop sign.

    the effect that all conditions set out in <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_79">Section 29(4)</a> must be met. In other
                                
    words, all the criteria in sub-clauses of Sub-section(4) of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_80">Section 29</a> must be


    met otherwise it will not be a case of infringement. These conditions must be
       


    met cumulatively and not disjunctively. To make out a case of infringement
    



    under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_81">Section 29(4)</a> it is not sufficient to say that the case falls within one or





    other clauses of Sub-section (4) but the ingredients of all clauses must be


    satisfied. Therefore, to be actionable a registered trade mark must have





    reputation in India, the Defendant must use the mark without due cause and


    such use must take unfair advantage or detrimental to the distinctive character


    or repute of the mark. Referring to a decision of the Outer House, Court of

    the public mind between the users of a trade mark and the plaintiff's trade

    character or repute of the plaintiff's mark. Not only must this advantage be
                                 
    unfair, but it must be of a sufficiently significant degree so as to warrant an
                                
    injunction. Pebble Beach Company also quotes Neuberger J in Premier


    Brands UK Limited v. Typhoon Europe Limited. [2000] FJR 767
       


    reiterating that <a href="/doc/898172/" id="a_82">Section 10(3)</a> of the English Act was not intended to have a
    



    sweeping effect of preventing the use of any sign which is the same or similar





    to registered trade mark with reputation.        <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_83">Section 10(3)</a> did not enable a


    proprietor of well-known registered trade mark to be able to object as a matter





    of course to the use of a sign which may remind people of his mark. The

    the field of activity being common is not an essential element of passing off, it is
                                   
    a relevant consideration. As observed by Kerly's on trade marks, if there is a
                                  
    common field of activity, possibility of deception is very high and if there is no


    common field of activity, the possibility is lower but it cannot be laid down that
       


    there is no possibility at all. In Pidilite Industries Limited and Ors.

<p id="p_89">    (supra) the Court had found that it must be shown that the Defendant's goods





    have been mistaken for those of the Plaintiffs and that an actual devious or


    malafide malicious intent is unnecessary and there must be evidence of the





    deception of an unwary customer. The Court observed that there must be some


    evidence of confusion in the absence of which it will not be possible to hold


    that the Defendants were guilty of passing off. Mr. Khandekar then submitted

    plaintiff's registration of the word cannot ipso facto confer exclusivity. It is only

    entitled to an order of damages.     Considering these factors, the Court held that


    there was no concrete likelihood of deception or confusion in the minds of the

<p id="p_90">    35.     Mr. Khandekar then referred to the decision of Chancery Division in


    J.C.Penney Company Inc. (supra) and relied upon the observations in the
       


    judgment to the effect that in order to succeed in a passing off action, the
    



    Plaintiff must always establish as sine qua non, that he has reputation whether





    exclusive or joint and he is entitled to sue and protect such reputation. Further


    Mr. Khandekar relied upon the tests laid down in that case as to the extent of

    would be liable to have action taken against him if he started operations ; or (3)


    the date on which the defendant actually started operations; and that the




                                                        
    Plaintiff should have acted with reasonable promptitude as soon as he had




                                            
    learnt of the commencement of the defendant's activities. The plaintiff must be
                                 
    able to contend successfully that his reputation should be judged as early as the
                                
    time when the defendant, being aware of the consequences started operations


    in the plaintiff's area. Mr. Khandekar then relied upon the decision of the
       


    Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division in Cadbury Schweppes
    



    Pty. Limited and Others (supra) passed in Privy Council Appeal No.5 of





    1980 and submitted that the relevant date for determining reputation is the


    date of commencement of the conduct complained of and that in the present





    case although domain name has been registered in 2009, the Plaintiff filed suit

<p id="p_92">    36.     In response to Mr.Khandekar's submission Mr. Tulzapurkar relied upon
                                   
    the decision in the case of Jagdish Gopal Kamath and Ors. (supra) and
                                  
    referred to paragraph 34 and 36 contending that extensive use must be


    established as settled in Corn Products and submitted that the Defendant had
       


    resorted to a casual saunter through the internet to come up with the names
    



    using the mark 'Raymond'             which constitutes poor evidence. It is in fact





    trawling for data without assessment as to accuracy or validity and such


    evidence is of no avail. Mr. Tulzapurkar relied upon paragraph 52 of the case





    of Indian Shaving Products Ltd. &amp; Anr. (supra).                       In that case the

    'Ultra' which were inferior to the batteries sold by the Plaintiff No.2. In that




                                                                                  
    context, the defendant argued that the trade-mark 'Ultra' has been used by




                                                          
    several persons and companies such as Toshiba, National and Sony and


    accordingly, the same has become public and the Plaintiffs could not claim any




                                                         
    exclusive right therein. The Court was called upon to decide dispute in the




                                             
    absence of these parties and none of those parties were claiming relief against
                                 
    the Plaintiffs. The Court was required to see whether the Plaintiff has acquired
                                
    goodwill and reputation for its products. Moreover, the contention that the


    Plaintiff has himself usurped or infringed the trade-mark of a third party was
       


    not to be gone into by the Court while deciding the issue between the parties
    



    before it. Accordingly, Mr. Tulzapurkar had submitted that it is of no avail for





    the Defendants to contend that the Plaintiffs are copying the name 'Raymond'


    from the other parties such as Raymond Weil, etc. Mr. Tulzapurkar then relied





    upon the decision in the case of Medley Pharmaceuticals (supra) and the


    observations of the learned Single Judge of this Court that it is for the Plaintiffs

    under a belief that the Plaintiffs had unjustly targeted the defendants. He,




                                                           
    therefore, submitted that it is open for the Plaintiffs to pursue the suit against


    any infringer and the alleged infringer who is a Defendant in the suit cannot




                                                          
    seek to escape by adopting this rationale. Mr. Tulzapurkar then relied upon the




                                               
    decision in National Bell Co. (supra).           In that case, the Defendants had
                                 
    alleged that there were repeated breaches which went unchallenged. However,
                                
    the Court held that           the evidence did not show that there were repeated


    breaches which went unchallenged though known to the proprietor. Mere
       


    neglect to proceed does not necessarily constitute abandonment if it is in
    



    respect of infringement which are not sufficient to affect the distinctiveness of





    the mark even if the proprietor          is aware of the same. Where neglect to


    challenge infringement is alleged, the character and extent of the trade of the





    infringers and their position have to be reckoned while considering whether


    the registered proprietor is barred by such neglect and, therefore, the plea of


    common use must fail since the evidence must establish that use by other

    in believing that the goods or services belonging to someone else are his or are
    



    associated therewith and it does not matter whether the latter person does so





    fraudulently or otherwise. The Supreme Court further observed that in the


    world of business, basic policies of honesty and fair play ought to be followed

    business or services which already belongs to someone else, it results in

    established their goodwill and reputation in the market and that is sufficient to


    maintain an action in passing off. Furthermore, while determining similarity





    one must establish possibility and not probability of confusion resulting from

<p id="p_121">    46.      Having heard the rival submissions of counsel extensively and since the
    



    cause of action arises out of use of a domain name, I feel it will be appropriate





    to consider the nature of the domain name system before proceeding to decide


    the Motion. Since inception of the domain name system, a domain name has





    been the identifier of an individual or entity operating within the world wide

    airlines and some manufacturers of other products. Multiple trade-mark


    holders across geographical regions claimed use of the name. The registration

    of trigger bad faith requirements. Domain name registration has always been
                                 
    subjected to the first come first serve test and hence a registrant will obtain
                                
    registration on application and subsequent applicants for the same name may


    find themselves in a complex situation where each of them have an interest
       


    corresponding with the domain name in question.             The first applicant's
    



    registration will generally prevail unless there is an agreement      inter se these





    parties claiming the same name. It is always open to all persons to appropriate


    specific domain names in agreement with another. Multiple applicants for the





    same domain name alludes to prospective rivalry. The trade mark system


    allows multiple parties to hold the same mark provided they operate in


    different product categories or geographical areas whereas the domain name

    of the individual, firms and corporates and other entities. Domain names are
    



    registered at first come first serve basis. Domain names once registered allow





    the owners of the domain names to mark their location in cyberspace by


    providing an identity and an exclusive mode of marketing products and

    Panavision Int'l L.P. v/s Toeppen 141 F.3d 1316 [9 th Cir 1998]) had in




                                                                                
    anticipation of making gains from famous marks registered numerous domain




                                                        
    names pertaining to diverse marks some of which were famous. Mr. Toeppen


    proceeded to register three names in the early stages of the internet. As a




                                                       
    result, he traded in the domain names for profit.   Mr. Toeppen registered the




                                           
    domain "panavision.com". Panavision is a well-known trade-mark but having
                                 
    registered this domain name, Mr. Toeppen did not offer any products or
                                
    services on the domain, instead he displayed photographs of a town named


    'Pana' in Illinois. The Court found that this amounted to trade-mark dilution
       


    but did not amount to infringement since it did not result in any confusion at
    



    the consumers end and the persons accessing the domain would be able to view





    images of the town Pana and unlikely to be led to believe that the website


    belonged to Panavision Corporation. A case of blurring would result from the





    defendants causing activity around the plaintiff's mark in a manner to render


    effective functioning of the mark difficult. On the other hand, an act of


    tarnishment would as the term indicates results in detrimental reference to the

    Panavision case(supra). The Court held that the use of the plaintiff's mark for




                                                         
    the purposes which are not related to the plaintiff's products or services results


    in dilution of the mark. Thus Toeppen was found to have diluted the mark of




                                                        
    Panavision Corporation despite the fact that Toeppen was merely showing




                                            
    pictures of the town called Pana. In considering whether the defendant is
                                 
    guilty of any act of dilution the domain name need not be identical to the

    registration of domain name for commercial purposes namely to sell them to
       


    the interested purchasers. Although the defendant was not carrying on any
    



    business through the said site "Panavision.com" he was held to have diluted





    plaintiff's mark Panavision. The US Court of the appeals however rejected


    Toeppen's contention that the domain name is nothing more than an address. It





    held that the significant purpose of a domain name is to identify the owner of


    the website and a customer who is unsure of a company's domain name will


    often guess that the domain name is also the company's name. In the instant

    Singh (supra) to the effect that the path of justice must be kept clear of




                                                       
    obstructions. The various judgments relied upon by the plaintiff's though




                                            
    elaborating different aspects of trade-mark protection do not deal with fact
                                 
    situation we are faced with in this Suit. In the present case I find none of the
                                
    compulsions observed in the above cited cases which led to grant of relief.

<p id="p_174">    Given the facts of the present case I am of the view that the defendants have not
       


    attempted to diminish the value of the Plaintiffs Marks by using the impugned

    Mr. Khandekar. Although trade-marks may be used as domain name(s) unless


    an impugned domain name is identical to a registered mark or the two are so
       


    alike so as to cause initial interest confusion to a man of ordinary intelligence,
    



    the domain name need not result in infringement of the mark or passing off.

<p id="p_178">    Every domain name cannot therefore form subject of trade-mark protection. I


    may add a word of caution here by clarifying that to reach a conclusion on this





    aspect the facts of a case are material.

    taking unfair advantage of the mark. The Plaintiffs' Mark will not be any less





    distinctive than it was prior to the impugned domain name being registered


    and utilised, if the injunction sought is refused.    The Plaintiffs have filed the





    present suit only in 2014 although domain name was stated to have been


    registered in 2009, a fact about which there is no serious dispute.                    In the
