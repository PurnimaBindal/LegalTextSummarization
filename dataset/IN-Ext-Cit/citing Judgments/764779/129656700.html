</pre><p id="p_1">K.T.Sankaran, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Suresh @ Kalpana Suresh @ Vettu Suresh was detained as

per Ext.P1 order (No.CC46/S13/Camp/15 dated 16.5.2015) issued

by the District Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram under Section 3(1) of

the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 2007 (hereinafter

referred to as the 'KAAPA'). The order of detention was executed on

19.5.2015. The detenu is classified as a 'known rowdy' in Ext.P1

order. The order of detention was confirmed by the Government on

23.7.2015 and the period of detention was fixed as one year.



</p><p id="p_3">      2. An order of detention dated 15.6.2007 was issued against

the detenu, which was executed on 17.6.2007.                   The period of

detention was six months. The detenu completed the term of six

months in jail and he was released on 16.12.2007.

<p id="p_5">activities, a second order of detention dated 11.11.2011 was passed

and it was executed on 23.11.2011. The period of detention was six

months. The present order of detention (Ext.P1) was issued on the

ground that the detenu indulged in criminal activities again and

criminal cases were registered against him.       In Ext.P1 order of

detention it is stated that the period of detention as per the second

order of detention dated 11.11.2011 was over on 22.5.2012 and the

detenu suffered the full term covered by the second order of

detention.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">       4. Ext.P1 order of detention as well as the continued detention

are under challenge in this Writ Petition filed by the wife of the

detenu.     Various grounds have been raised in the Writ Petition

challenging the order of detention and the continued detention.



</p><p id="p_8">       5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

second order of detention dated 11.11.2011 was challenged by the

petitioner in W.P.(Crl) No.18 of 2012 and this Court allowed that Writ

Petition by the judgment dated 14.2.2012 on the ground that one of

the documents which was relied upon was not furnished to the

</p>
<p id="p_9">detenu.    It is submitted that the detenu was released from jail

pursuant to the judgment in W.P.(Crl) No.18 of 2012 and he did not

suffer the full term of detention under the second order of detention.

In paragraph 6 of the statement of facts in the Writ Petition as well as

in ground (Q), the petitioner has raised the aforesaid contention and

challenged the order of detention. Paragraph 6 and ground (Q) are

extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "6.    The detainee challenged the 2nd detention

       order before this Hon'ble court in the Writ Petition

       No.18/2012. This Honourable court set aside the 2nd

       detention order and set the detainee at free by the

       judgment dated 14/2/2012. This is against the fact. This

       shows that the sponsoring and detaining authorities are

       not aware of setting aside of the 2nd detention order.

       These authorities are not up-to-date as to the real state

       of affairs at the issuance of the detention order."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "(Q)     It is humbly submitted that there is non-

       application of mind on the sponsoring, detaining and 1st

       respondent in maintaining the detention order."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">       6. The aforesaid contention raised by the petitioner in the Writ

Petition is not answered in the counter affidavit filed by the first

respondent. In the counter affidavit filed by the second respondent

(District Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram), it is stated as follows:

W.P.(Crl) No.364 of 2015 (S)

                                     :: 4 ::
</p>
<p id="p_12">

             "13. The allegation and contention in paragraph 6

      and 7 of the writ petition (Crl) is lack of any merits. It was

      reported by the sponsoring authority while furnishing the

      report for detention stated therein that the 2nd detention

      order issued in 2011 was completed the full term of 6

      months and released thereafter. In the report it is stated

      that the 2nd detention order was confirmed by the

      Government     vide     G.O.(Rt)     409/2012/Home      dated

      13.02.2012. The order of Hon'ble Court if any had not

      been produced before this authority. Hence this authority

      was fully convinced that the term of detention was

      completed in the 2nd detention and hence the order was

      issued invoking the provision in section 13(2)(i) of

      KAAPA."
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">      7. The third respondent, the sponsoring authority, did not file

any counter affidavit in the present Writ Petition.        Ext.P3 report

submitted by the sponsoring authority to the second respondent

states that the detenu suffered the full term of detention as per the

second order of detention dated 11.11.2011, while, in fact, that order

of detention was interfered with and the detenu was directed to be

released forthwith as per the judgment dated 14.2.2012 in W.P.(Crl)

No.18 of 2012.

</p>
<p id="p_16">       8. Thus it is clear that the sponsoring authority was not aware

of the full facts with respect to the second detention as per the order

dated 11.11.2011. Based on the erroneous report submitted by the

sponsoring authority, the detaining authority erroneously took the

view that the detenu suffered the full term of detention under the

second detention order and even thereafter, he indulged in criminal

activities. A perusal of Ext.P1 order of detention shows that though

reference is made to the second order of detention in the second

page of Ext.P1, while discussing the matter at page 3 of Ext.P1, no

reference is made to the second detention order. The discussion at

page 3 of Ext.P1 order reflects the subjective satisfaction arrived at

by the detaining authority and, at that juncture, the detaining authority

ignored the second order of detention dated 11.11.2011 and the

events which took place pursuant to that order.       The report of the

sponsoring authority with respect to the second detention order is

also not seen discussed while arriving at the subjective satisfaction by

the detaining authority.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">       9. The aforesaid facts would clearly indicate that the subjective

satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority was on the basis of

                                     :: 6 ::
</p>
<p id="p_19">erroneous data and insufficient materials. The sponsoring authority

committed an error in stating that the detenu suffered the full term of

detention under the second order of detention and this report was

made the basis for considering the question of issuing an order of

detention as per Ext.P1. However, while making the discussion for

arriving at the subjective satisfaction, the detaining authority did not

refer to the second detention order at all and the report submitted by

the sponsoring authority was really ignored. The resultant position is

that even the judgment passed by the High Court in a Writ Petition

was ignored by the sponsoring authority as well as the detaining

authority. There was absolute non-application of mind which vitiates

the order of detention.

</p><p id="p_21">       10. The aforesaid view taken by us is fortified by the decision

of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/681866/" id="a_1">Deepak Bajaj v. State of Maharashtra and

     contention that the Detaining Authority is not required to

     collect all materials about any court proceedings etc.

     from different Ministries or Departments for the purpose

     of issuance of a detention order.    The Court observed

     that non-consideration of a relevant material will certainly

     invalidate the detention order. We respectfully agree with

     the above view, and reiterate it.</blockquote><p id="p_22">

<p id="p_24">      2000(7) SCC 148, this Court observed that if the

      Detaining Authority has relied on a confessional

      statement then the retraction of that confession should

      also have been placed before the Detaining Authority,

      and should have been considered by it, and failure to do

      so would invalidate the detention order.

<p id="p_27">

      For the aforesaid reasons, the Writ Petition is allowed and the

order of detention is quashed. The detenu shall be released forthwith

unless his detention is required in respect of any other case. The

Registry will communicate the gist of the operative portion of this

judgment to the Superintendent of Central Prison, Viyyoor forthwith.
