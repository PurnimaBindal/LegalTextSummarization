<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

 

 Dalveer Bhandari, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. These appeals are directed against the judgment and decree passed by the learned Single Judge in Suit Nos. 1626 of 1983 and 1627 of 1983. Both the suits were clubbed and evidence was recorded only in Suit No. 1626 of 1983 titled  <a href="/doc/823870/" id="a_1">Holiday Inns Inc. v. Kapoor Holiday Inn</a> and on the strength of the evidence in the said case both the suits were disposed of by a common
judgment and decree dated 21.5.1986. The appellants herein are defendants in suits and the respondent herein is the plaintiff.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2.     The  respondent  company. Holiday Inn Inc  is  a registered  company of the United States of America  and has  acquired global reputation.  The respondent  learnt that  the appellants were using the words "Holiday  Inn" on  its visiting  cards,   menu  cards,  tariff  cards, stationery and other printed materials relating to  its lodgings  and restaurant, towels, crockery, cutlery, key, chains/rings  and diverse goods relating to its lodgings and  restaurant.  The said use was in flagrant violation of  the  respondent's  trade mark  "Holiday  Inn".   The respondent  gave  a  'cease and desist  notice'  to  the appellants,  but  despite  the  service  of  notice  the appellants  neither  replied  to  the  said  notice  nor complied with its requirements.  By the use of the words "Holiday Inn"  as  a  part of its  trading  style,  the appellants   seek  to  represent  to  the  public   some connection with the respondent.   According to the respondent the  appellants are also passing  off  their business  as that of the respondent or as one associated with  it.  In this way, the appellants are trading upon the  good will and reputation enjoyed by the  respondent throughout the world including India. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. Learned Single Judge after carefully weighing
the  entire evidence and documents on record came to the conclusion  that  the use of the words "Holiday Inn"  by the  appellants,  particularly, in relation to the  same business causes deception and confusion in the trade and is  an attempt by the appellants to induce the customers to  believe  that the business of the appellants is  the business of the respondent or that it is associated with the  respondent.   The  Court granted the  respondent  a decree  of  perpetual injunction with costs  restraining the  appellants its proprietors/partners, servants  and agents  from using the words "Holiday Inn" or any  other name  or  expression  deceptively or  otherwise  similar thereto  as its trading style or as a part thereof;  the Court  also  passed  a decree for  permanent  injunction restraining  the  appellants, its  proprietors/partners, servants  and agents from using the words "Holiday  Inn" or any other name or expression deceptively or otherwise similar thereto in relation to Its goods particularly on its visiting cards, menu cards, tariff cards, stationery and other printed materials relating to its lodgings and restaurants, towels, crockery, cutlery, key chains/rings and  diverse goods  relating  to  Its   lodgings  and restaurants.   The appellants have also been directed to render  accounts to the respondent of the profits earned by  them  while  trading  in  the  trading  style  which includes the words "Holiday Inn".
</p> 


<p id="p_5">4. Against that judgments and decree the appellants have filed these appeals before this Court. A Division Bench of this Court admitted the appeals and stayed the execution of the decree. Arguments advanced on behalf of Madhuban Holiday Inn and Kapoor Holiday Inn are identical.   Therefore,  we also deem it appropriate  to dispose of both these appeals by a common judgment.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">5. Mr. J.S. Arora, learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the words "Holiday Inn" are descriptive of the business of a hotel and as per settled law nobody can legitimately monopolise such words for his business.
</p>
 

<p id="p_7">6. It is also submitted by Mr. Arora that in case of a  trade name which consists of descriptive words even a small  difference will be taken to be sufficient enough in between the trade names of the respondent and that of the  appellants.  If any person uses for the name of his business, words which are descriptive of such  business and  Initiates  an action for passing off, he must  show that  such  words have lost their original  meaning  and have  acquired a secondary meaning denoting the business of the respondent only and in such action the respondent must  further  prove that some person had actually  been deceived  by  the  similarity in the names  of  the  two businesses and mere likelihood of confusion would not be enough.   To  strengthen  his  submission  the  learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance on a decision
of  this Court in  <a href="/doc/898867/" id="a_2">Lloyd Insulations (India) Ltd. v.  Punj Lloyd Insulations Pvt. Ltd</a>. [1997 (97) DLT 617]. The Court held in this case as under :
</p>  

<p id="p_8">"(a) In case of a trade name which consists of descriptive words small difference will be taken to be sufficient enough in between the trade names of the plaintiff and that of the defendant, whereas in case of a trade mark a mere similarity in the trade mark is per se actionable.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">(b) In an action for passing off a mere similarity in the two trade names is not sufficient to conclude that it will cause confusion and would mislead the customer to take the one for the other. It has further to be shown that similarity in their names has misled a customer to take one for the other.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">(c) No body can claim property in a mere descriptive word used by him as his trade name unless and until it is shown that the said descriptive word has acquired a secondary meaning and has lost its primary character and is so much associated with the goods of the plaintiff that a mere mention of it brings before his eyes the picture of the goods of the plaintiff.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">(d) In case a fancy word has been shown as part of a name, then the same is distinctive per se and if another trader takes that word as part of his trade name with only a slight variation, then he can be said to have created confusion." 
</p> 

<p id="p_12">7. It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that they are only providing services and they are not trading in goods. Appellants further submitted that a trade mark can be with regard to the goods and not for the services.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">8. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants has drawn our attention to <a href="/doc/1109531/" id="a_3">Section 2(1)(g)</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_4">Merchandise  Marks Act</a>, 1958 (for short "the  Act"). According  to  the said section "goods"  means  anything
which is the subject matter of trade or manufacture. The appellants have also drawn our attention to <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_5">Section 8</a> of the Act which provides that "A trade mark may be registered in respect of any or all of the goods comprised in a particular class of goods".
</p> 

<p id="p_14">9. Mr. Arora submitted that the appellants are not using the name "Holiday Inn" simplicitor. They are using "Madhuban Holiday Inn" and "Kapoor Holiday Inn", therefore, there is no question of infringement of the respondent's registered trade mark because before "Holiday Inn" the prefix "Madhuban" or "Kapoor" has been mentioned. According to the appellants there cannot be any  confusion  and  no action of passing off  would  be maintainable. 
</p> 

<p id="p_15">10. The appellants also contended that there were a number of lodging houses running in Delhi using the words "Holiday Inn" like "Kumar Holiday Inn"  "Anand Holiday Inn", "Bawa Holiday Inn", "Archana Holiday Inn", "Siddharth Holiday Inn" etc. etc. The words "Holiday Inn"  meant  a lodging house and indicate the nature  of such  business  were  descriptive   in  character   and, therefore,  had  not by user, become distinctive of  the business  of  the respondent.  In any event in India  by use   of  these  words  a  large  number  of   concerned institutions have lost their distinctive character.  The appellants submitted that the respondent did not file similar suits against other lodging houses.
</p> 


<p id="p_16">11. Mr. Arora  placed  reliance on   Office Cleaning Services Ltd. v.  Westminster Offices Cleaning Association  (1944(2)  All  ER 617).  In this  case  the plaintiffs, a limited company carried on the business of cleaning  the interiors of offices and windows  cleaning under the name of Office Cleaning Services Limited.  The defendants were engaged since 1894 in a similar kind of business, trading  since  1931   under   the  style "Westminster  Office Cleaning Association".  In 1942 the defendants  omitted  from their advertisements the  word "Westminster"  and  carried on the office cleaning  work under  the style of "Office Cleaning Association".   The plaintiffs sued  for  an  injunction restraining the defendants  from using in connection with their business as  contractors for the cleaning of offices the  trading style  "Office Cleaning Association" or any other  style so  closely resembling the name of the plaintiffs as  to be  calculated to lead to the defendants' business being confused  by  members  of the public with  that  of  the plaintiffs.   The  defendants  denied that  the  trading style  complained of was capable of producing confusion, contending  that the words "Office Cleaning" were merely descriptive  and, when read in conjunction with the word "Association",  were  sufficient  to  distinguish  their title from  the  plaintiffs'   title  "Office Cleaning Services Ltd."
</p> 

<p id="p_17">12.    The  appellants  also  placed  reliance  on  a
judgment of this Court in  <a href="/doc/1706612/" id="a_6">Girnar Food &amp; Beverages Pvt. Ltd. v.  Godfrey Phillips India Ltd</a>. . In this case the Court held that the trade mark "Super Cup" was descriptive and laudatory of goods of the plaintiff and the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">13. The appellants also placed reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in  <a href="/doc/2044127/" id="a_7">J.R. Kapoor v.  Micronix India</a> [1994 (2) Arbitration Law Reporter 274]. In this case it was held that if the goods are not similar and the trade marks, logo and colour scheme of cartons are not likely to cause confusion in the minds of customers, no injunction to restrain the use of the trade mark can be granted to any party.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">14. Reliance has also been placed on a Division Bench judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in  <a href="/doc/324083/" id="a_8">Teju Singh v.  Shanta Devi</a> . It  was  held in this case that where a trader adopts a trading  name including mere descriptive words of common use,  the Court will not readily assume that the use  of the  said  word or name by another is likely  to cause confusion.   In such a case the plaintiff has to further prove  that the name has acquired a distinctive  meaning in  connection with the business so that the use of this name by another is likely to deceive the public. 
</p> 

<p id="p_20">15.    The  appellants  also  placed reliance  on  the judgment  of  the Supreme Court in  <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_9">Kaviraj Pandit  Durga Dutt   Sharma v.  Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a> .  In this case the Court observed that in  an  action for infringement, the plaintiff must,  no doubt,  make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely  to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's  and the defendant's mark is so close either visually,  phonetically  or  otherwise  and  the  Court reaches  the  conclusion that there is an imitation,  no further  evidence  is required to  establish  that  the plaintiff's  rights are violated.  Expressed in another way,  If the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff  have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that  the get up, packing and other writing or marks  on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for  sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade  origin  different  from that  of the  registered proprietor  of the mark would be immaterial, whereas  in the case  of  passing off, the  defendant  may  escape liability  if  he  can  show that the  added  matter  is sufficient  to  distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff."  In this judgment their Lordships of the Supreme  court  held that for deceptive resemblance two factors are necessary - (1 ) Who were the persons to whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse and (2)  What  rules  of  comparison are to  be  adopted  in Judging whether such resemblance exists?
</p> 

<p id="p_21">16.    Reliance  has been placed on  Amritdhara pharmacy v.  Satya Deo Gupta . In this case the Court held that the Act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion within meaning of <a href="/doc/717437/" id="a_10">Section 8(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/707980/" id="a_11">Section 10(1)</a>. Therefore, every case must depend on its own particular facts and the value of authorities lies not so much In the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
</p> 

<p id="p_22">17.    <a href="/doc/486152/" id="a_12">In  Ellora Industries v.  Banarsi Das Goela and Ors</a>. 2nd 1979(2) Delhi 481 this Court had occasion to examine the matter pertaining to passing off.  The Court observed  that the purpose of passing off is to  protect commercial  goodwill;  to ensure that people's  business reputations  are  not  exploited.    This is  based  on economic policy, the need to encourage enterprise and to ensure commercial stability.  The Court observed that in an  action of passing, off the plaintiff has to establish the  existence of business reputation which he seeks  to protect.  The asset that is protected, is the reputation the  plaintiff's  business has In the  relevant market. The Court further observed that in passing off  actions all  that  needs  to be proved is that  the  defendant's goods  are so marked, made up or described by them as to be  calculated to mislead the ordinary purchaser and  to lead them to mistake the defendant's goods for those of the  plaintiff's.   It  is the tendency  to mislead  or
confuse that thus forms the gist of action. The plaintiff need not establish fraud, nor that any one was actually deceived, or that he actually suffered damages. The Court in short described that passing off is an action against an imitator who is reaping without sowing. The Court also observed that the real test is the likely effect on those members of the public who ultimately become the purchasers.
</p> 

<p id="p_23">18. Reliance has been placed on  Aerators Limited v.  Tallitt 1902 (2) Chancery Division 319. In this case the Court held that the plaintiff company had no monopoly of the word 'Aerator' which was a word in common use in the English language and on this ground Injunction was refused.
</p> 

<p id="p_24">19. Reliance has also been placed on  British Vacuum Cleaner Company Limited v.  New Vacuum Company Limited 1907 (2) Chancery Division 312 wherein the Court held that the plaintiff company by allowing subsidiary companies to be formed under names containing the words 'vacuum cleaner' in conjunction, had admitted that another company with a name so containing those words would not necessarily be confused with the plaintiff company.
</p> 

<p id="p_25">20. In  Park Court Hotel Limited v.  Trans-World Hotels Limited (1972) RPC 27 the Court held that the word 'International' was descriptive of both the plaintiffs' and defendants' hotels. In such a case a
heavy  burden  lay  on a plaintiff  to  establish  false representation;   it was not enough to establish some risk of confusion and the Court would accept small differences  as sufficient to avert confusion.  In  that case,  the plaintiffs had not on the facts established a prima  facie  case  for  interlocutory  relief,  and  in addition the balance of convenience was against granting such relief.  Interim injunction was refused.
</p> 

<p id="p_26">21.    Similarly  in  McCain International Limited v.  Country Fair Foods Limited and Anr. (1981) RPC 69 the Court  held that in the beginning of 1979 the plaintiffs introduced onto the U.K.  market a novel product - chips which  could  be cooked in the oven or baked  under  the grill - and sold the product under the name "McCain Oven Chips".   In April 1980 the defendants sought to  launch their  version  of the product under the names  "Country Fair Oven Chips"  and  "Birds Eye Oven Chips".  The plaintiffs  obtained  an  ex  parte  injunction  in  the Queen's  Bench Division to restrain the defendants  from marketing  their  product  under the name  "oven  chips" whether  with or without their own brand names and after hearing  the parties the injunction was continued  until Judgment.   The  defendants  appealed against  the  said Judgment/order.  The defendants contended the name "Oven Chips"  was descriptive of the product, that it had  not subsequently  acquired distinctiveness and that where  a descriptive  name  had been applied to a product by  the
sole supplier of that product that name could not easily acquire distinctiveness. The plaintiffs argued that "oven chips" was not descriptive but was a fancy name being an ungrammatical combination of two words which had not previously been associated together and further that by virtue of the plaintiffs' extensive sales and advertising it had become distinctive of their product. The appeal in this case was allowed by the Court of Appeals .
</p> 

<p id="p_27">22. The Bombay High Court in  <a href="/doc/1496902/" id="a_13">Carew Phipson Limited v.  Deejay Distilleries Pvt. Limited</a>   held  that in the present case, the trade mark  of the  plaintiff  was  "Blue Riband Duet Gin N  Lime"  and "Blue  Riband  Tango N Orange".  The trade mark  of  the defendant  was "English Duet Gin N Lime" and "Duet Gin N Orange".   The customers of both the plaintiffs and the defendants  were normally educated and discerning  type. There, was absence of evidence regarding actual deception or  confusion  in  the  minds  of  the  customers.   On comparison  of the trade mark of the plaintiffs with the defendants' trade mark, it is difficult to hold that the two marks were deceptively similar and were likely  to create any confusion in the minds of the customers.
</p> 

<p id="p_28"> 23.    Mr.  Navin Chawla, learned counsel appearing for the  respondent,  supported the judgment of the  learned Single  Judge  and submitted that  no  interference  is called  for  with  the well reasoned judgment  which  is
based  on evidence and documents on record.  Mr.  Chawla submitted  that Issue No. 1 related to whether the plaint is  signed  by  an authorised  person. The  respondent (plaintiff  in  suit) produced P.Ws 1 &amp; 2, who were  not cross-examined  by  the appellants (defendants in suit) despite  adequate  opportunity  granted  to  him.   The appellants did not care to lead any evidence in rebuttal and this  issue was rightly decided in favor of the plaintiff .
</p> 

<p id="p_29">24.     Mr.   Chawla  submitted that Issue Nos.  2  &amp;  3 related  to  whether the respondent Holiday Inn  is the registered proprietor  of the trade mark "Holiday  Inn" and  whether  the appellants' use of the words  "Holiday Inn"  is  infringing the respondent's  registered  trade mark.   The  learned Single Judge has recorded that the counsel  for  the  appellants have  not  challenged  the Certificate  of  Registration,  but submitted  that  the registration relates, to the specific goods and the hotel business run by the plaintiff cannot be protected under such registration.   The learned Single Judge  rightly considered  the  definition  of goods  as  contained  in <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_14">Section 2(i)(g)</a>  of  the Trade  and  <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_15">Merchandise Marks Act</a> ,1958  and on the basis of settled law that where the Impugned  trade mark or trade name is identical with or deceptively  similar to a registered trade mark, then  a finding of  Infringement must follow as the same  is  a statutory  relief to which the proprietor is entitled by
virtue  of registration.  Mr. Chawla submitted that  no infirmity  can be found in the impugned  judgment  and consequently no interference is called for.
</p> 

<p id="p_30">25.     Mr. Chawla submitted  that  Issues  4  and  5 pertained  to  passing  off and whether  word  "Kapoor" prefixed  to "Holiday Inn" would prevent confusion.   He submitted  that the learned Single Judge on the basis of the entire evidence on record came to specific finding that the appellants used  the words  "Holiday  Inn" prefixed  as "Kapoor Holiday Inn" and "Madhuban Holiday Inn"  with a view to pass off their business as that  of the respondent's.
</p> 

<p id="p_31">26.  Mr.  Chawla urged that the documents filed under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC being the computer print out of the appellant's  and  respondent's page from internet  under the  heading "Holiday Inn Delhi";  "Holiday Inn" and the respondents  and appellant's website.  He submitted that in  the  page  entitled "Holiday Inn  Delhi"  the  first information appearing on the page  is about  "Kapoor Holiday   Inn  Hotel"  in  Delhi  and  thereafter   the information  about  respondent's   "Holiday  Inn"  hotel follows.   He  submitted, that this is likely  to  cause confusion and the customer is likely to believe that the "Kapoor  Holiday  Inn"  is in fact a hotel  run  by  the respondent  and  accordingly do  his bookings  on  the internet with the appellant.  Under the heading "Holiday Inn"  on the internet information about the respondent's
hotels  world  wide is given.  Similarly  the  appellant also  has  a website on the internet under  the  heading "Kapoor Holiday Inn" giving its tariff, location etc and advertising itself as the "most distinguished address in New Delhi, Kapoor Holiday Inn Is located in the heart of South  Delhi".   He submitted that the  learned  Single Judge  has correctly decided Issue Nos.  4 &amp; 5 in favor of the respondent and against the appellants. 
</p> 

<p id="p_32">27.     Issue No. 6 relates to delay.  The learned Single Judge  has  considered the evidence of PW 2  who  stated that  only  in the month of August, 1982  the  respondent learnt  about the misuse of the name Holiday Inn by  the appellants  and thereafter he reported the matter to his head  quarters and  immediately  thereafter  cease and desist notice was issued to the appellants.  Thereafter , the  law  suit  was filed in Court.   According  to  the learned Single Judge the explanation furnished by the respondent  is  convincing and the delay in  filing  the suit  has  been duly explained.  It is submitted by  the respondent  that similar actions have been taken by the respondent   against  others  who  tried  to  ride  on respondent's reputation.
</p> 

<p id="p_33">28. Mr. Chawla learned counsel for the respondent in support of his submissions placed reliance on a number of decided cases. He first referred to a judgment delivered by one of us (Vikramajit Sen, J) reported as  <a href="/doc/1493859/" id="a_16">Rainforest Cafe Inc v.  Rainforest Cafe &amp; Ors</a> .  In this case the plaintiff Rainforest Cafe  Inc has 37 restaurants world wide and is  planning to  open many more restaurants throughout the globe  and particularly  in India.  The plaintiff has advertised in the leading and premier magazines and newspapers.  It is mentioned  in the plaint that the revenues/sales in 1997 and  1998 were to the tune of US $ 108 millions and US $ 213  millions, respectively.  It is also incorporated  in the plaint that because of its success, largely because due  to its particular unusual and novel name,  ambience and  decor of its outlets, its shares are even quoted on the  New York Stock Exchange.  It has its own  web-site. Consequent to its phenomenal progress, the plaintiff has been receiving trade inquiries from all corners of world.   The defendant opened a restaurant with the name of  "Rainforest Cafe" masquerading as one of the outlets of  the  plaintiff.   The  defendant  has  copied  the plaintiff's  name, as also the tagline of "A WILD  PLACE TO  EAT'.   There  is a certainty that because  of  the shoddy  manner  in which the  restaurant  is  presently running,  irreparable  injury  will  be  caused  to  the reputation  and  good will of the plaintiff world  wide, and  will  also  have  adverse  ramifications  on  the impending  enquiries  for its franchise in New Delhi  as well  as other parts of India.  On consideration of  the totality of the facts and circumstances, the Court found the balance  of convenience in favor of the  plaintiff
and observed that the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable  injury,  if the defendant continues to  run its  restaurant in its present name and style which is a poor but blind copy of the plaintiff's cafes world wide. On  consideration of the totality of the facts the Court granted injunction in favor of the plaintiff. 
</p> 

<p id="p_34">29.    Mr.   Chawla  also  placed reliance  on   <a href="/doc/368426/" id="a_17">Simatul Chemical Industries Pvt. Ltd. v.  Cibatul Ltd</a>. . In  this case  the  Court  while upholding  that the plaintiff should be protected,  held that the test to be applied is the test of an average person  with  imperfect recollection.  It would  not  be right to apply the test of a man of extraordinary memory who  remembers the spelling of the name of each  company or  a person who jots down meticulously and methodically the  names of companies in his diary and brings out  his diary  arid  contemplates whether he is dealing with one company or the other .
</p> 

<p id="p_35">30. Reliance has also been placed on  <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_18">Kaviraj Pandit v.  Navratan Pharmaceuticals Laboratories</a> . The Court observed that where the similarity between the plaintiffs and defendant's marks is so close visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches at the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. 
</p> 

<p id="p_36">31. Mr. Chawla also relied on  Polson Ltd. v.
</p><p id="p_37"> Polson Dairy Ltd.  wherein this Court  granted temporary injunction  and  observed that  adoption  of  the word 'Polson' by  the  defendant company  is malafide and defendant has not explained how it  has  come to adopt the said word, particularly  when the said word is an invented word.  The Court held that where  a  mark has been dishonestly usurped by a  party, such  a party cannot have any defense against the  grant of  temporary injunction restraining it from using  said mark it would ultimately result in deceiving the public.
</p> 

<p id="p_38">32.    <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_19">In  Cadila  Health Care  Ltd  v.  Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.   the Court observed that  the passing off action depends upon the  principle that  nobody  has a right to represent his goods as  the goods of somebody else.  In other words, a man is not to sell  his goods or services under the pretence that they are those of another person.
</p> 

<p id="p_39">33. <a href="/doc/461663/" id="a_20">In  Caesar Park Hotels v.  Westinn Hospitality Services Ltd</a>. 1999 PTC (19) 123 the Division Bench of Madras  High  Court while setting aside the judgment  of the  learned  Single  Judge applied  the  principle  of transborder reputation and restrained the defendant from using the word "West inn" for Its business.
</p> 

<p id="p_40">34.    <a href="/doc/51913/" id="a_21">In  Poddar Tyres Ltd  v.  Bedrock Sales Corporation,  Bedrock Ltd.  IPLR</a> 18 (1993) 153 the Court held  that the trading style and name of defendant No. 1 containing the word 'Bedrock' did amount to infringement
and passing off since such adoption of the mark in the business name was neither honest nor bonafide so as to claim valid use under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_22">Section 34</a> of the Act.
</p> 

<p id="p_41">35. In  Sarabhai International Ltd. v.  Sara Exports
International  this Court held that
the use by the defendants of the word/mark 'Sara' in
their trading style was an infringement of plaintiff's
registered trade mark. Further, on account of deceptive
trading style Sara Exports International which includes
the main portion of registered trade mark of the
plaintiff, the defendant was passing off, enabling
others or causing and assisting others to pass off. Defendant was guilty of the tort of passing off.
</p> 

<p id="p_42">36. This Court in  <a href="/doc/1689892/" id="a_23">Virendra Dresses v.  Varindra Garments</a> held that the trade names of plaintiffs and defendants are similar, sufficient to give rise to confusion. Similarity and confusion to be determined from the point of view of a common man. A man in the street will remember the name Varindra he may not be able to make a distinction between the 'Garments' and 'Dresses'. A customer intending to go to the business premises of the plaintiffs is likely to visit the business premises of the defendant when the two trading names are so similar.
</p> 

<p id="p_43">37. In reply to the other submissions of the appellants that so many other people are using the trade name "Holiday Inn", Mr. Chawla cited a Division Bench
judgment of this Court in  Jagan Nath Prem Nath v.
</p><p id="p_44"> Bhartiya Dhoop Karyalaya . In this
case the Court held that the mere fact that the other
manufacturers had the numerals in question in their
trademarks does not furnish a sufficient ground to
discharge the interim injunction because of <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_24">Section 28(3)</a>.  In law, even though the appellant might not  be in a position to enforce any right against the other registered holders of the trademarks using the numerals of 555 yet against every third person (including the respondent) who was not a registered holder of the trademark he was entitled to enforce his rights as registered holder of the trademark.

<p id="p_45">38. <a href="/doc/1674433/" id="a_25">In  Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. v.  Mahavir
Steel and Ors. I.A. Nos</a>. 6215 and 8804 of 1990 dated
February 25, 1992 this Court observed "An imitation
remains an imitation whether it is done by many. It
acquires no legitimacy. A wrong is not righted by the
following it musters . "
</p> 

<p id="p_46">39. Mr. Chawla, learned counsel for the respondent, cited a number of judgments to establish that in cases where the defendant could not offer any explanation for adoption of the name adverse inference should be drawn by the Court against the defendant. He placed reliance on  <a href="/doc/804856/" id="a_26">Ciba Geigy Ltd. v.  Crosslands Research Laboratories Ltd</a> 1996 PTC (16) 1 in which the Court held that "the uncandid statement made by the defendant about
the  selection  of  the word makes me  wonder  that  the defendant  has  done  it with  deliberate  intention  of obtaining pecuniary advantage from the wide reputation of  the plaintiffs business all over the world.  Absence of  categorical  statement on the part of  defendant  to explain  how  he  adopted a  particular  trademark  then adverse  inference under <a href="/doc/473654/" id="a_27">Section 114(g)</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872  can be drawn".  In this case the  Court  also held  that  the proof of fraudulent intention is  not  a necessary element in a case of passing off.
</p> 

<p id="p_47">40.    Similarly in  <a href="/doc/704513/" id="a_28">Ciba Geigy Ltd. v.  Surinder Singh and Ors</a>.   this Court  held  that adoption of the said word by defendants by overlooking thousands of other words in English language shows that it wanted to derive benefit from plaintiffs goodwill. defense of acquiescence pleaded by the defendants not found tenable. In this case the Court also observed that the plaintiff is not required to establish fraudulent intention on the part of the defendant. Even causing of actual confusion amongst the customers is also not to be proved by the plaintiff, what it is required to establish is the likelihood of deception or confusion.
</p> 

<p id="p_48">41. Mr. Chawla also submitted that it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove fraud. It is enough for the plaintiff to prove that the offending trade mark is calculated or likely to invade the right
of     the  plaintiff.     The  Court  observed  in   Prina  Chemical works v.  Sukhdayal &amp; Co 2nd (1974) Vol. I   545   (DB)  that it   is  now  well  settled  that  proof  of  fraud  is unnecessary whether  the  relief asked for  is for  an injunction  or  damages.   It  is  sufficient  that  the offending trademark is calculated or is likely to invade the proprietary right.
</p> 

<p id="p_49">42. <a href="/doc/1795531/" id="a_29">In  Richardson Vicks Inc v.  Vikas Pharmaceuticals</a>  this Court observed that in order a trade mark may be found deceptively similar to another, it is not necessary that it should be intended to deceive or intended to cause confusion. It is the probable effect on the ordinary kind of customer that has to be considered.
</p> 

<p id="p_50">43.     The  question of delay has been examined by this
 court  in the matter of  Glaxo Operations UK Ltd.  v.
</p><pre id="pre_1"> Samrat  Pharmaceuticals    where  this
court  observed  that  the plaintiff  learnt about  the
infringements  in  1980,  Some time was spent in  giving
notices to the defendants. The suit and application for
interim  injunction were filed in 1982,  The Court  held
that there was no inordinate delay and the fact that the
defendants  built  up their sales was  immaterial  while
granting  injunction as they were served with notice  by
the plaintiff.
 

44.  In Rampal Singh v. Rias Ahmad Ansari &amp; Anr. 1990 (Supp. )  SCC 727, their Lordships of  the Supreme
Court observed that If the discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial courts exercise of discretion.
 

45. Similar views are expressed in  Cadila Pharmaceuticals v. torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 1999 PTC (19) 318 wherein the court held that the mere possibility of the Appellate Court coming to different conclusion will not justify interference.
 

46.    We  have carefully perused the pleadings of  the parties  and critically appreciated the submissions made at  the  bar.  We have also carefully  analysed  various decided  cases cited by the learned counsel to buttress their rival submissions.
 

</pre><p id="p_51">47.    The  appellants main submission is that "Holiday Inn"  are descriptive words and they refer  to hotel business  and  the  appellants were fully  justified  in adopting these words.  Apart from that before  "Holiday Inn"  the  appellants  had used  prefix  "Madhuban"  and "Kapoor".   Therefore, no one can legitimately be misled or  deceived.   "Holiday Inn" are not dictionary  words. The words  "Holiday Inn"  had  been coined by  the respondent  and  are descriptive of the business of  the respondent only.  Therefore, we do not find any merit in this contention of the appellants.
</p> 

<p id="p_52">48.    The  other submission of the appellants is  that
apart from the appellants others have also used the words "Holiday Inn" for their hotels. In  Tata Iran &amp; Steal Co. (supra) it has been aptly observed by this Court that an imitation remains an imitation whether it is done by many. It acquires no legitimacy. Moreover, the respondent has taken actions against others also.
</p> 

<p id="p_53">49. There is no substance in the submission of the appellants that there has been a delay in filing the suit. The learned Single Judge was justified in holding that there has been no delay in filing the suit in the instant case. The findings of the learned Single Judge are based on the settled legal position.
</p> 

<p id="p_54">50.    The  respondent  company  Holiday Inn Inc  is  a registered company in the United States of America.  The company has acquired immense global reputation.  It has a  large number of hotels in various parts of the world. The  adoption  of  the  words   "Holiday  Inn"  by  the appellants  from  the  very inception was based  on  the doctrine of bad faith.  The appellants were fully aware of  the  considerable  transborder   reputation  of  the respondent  and they wanted to derive pecuniary benefits from their reputation,  the question that arises is that out  of  the millions of words of English language,  why did  the appellants adopt only the words "Holiday  Inn", The  answer  has to be that the appellants  deliberately adopted  these  words  to  ride on  the  immense  global reputation  of  the  respondent.  The intention  of the
appellants  becomes  absolutely clear after  seeing the computer  print  out of the appellants  and  respondents pages taken from the internet under the heading "Holiday Inn,  Delhi".  These documents were placed before us by the  respondent.  Under the heading "Holiday Inn" in the internet  information about the respondent's hotel world wide  is given.  Similarly the appellants, Kapoor Holiday Inn,  also  has  a web site in the  Internet  under  the heading "Kapoor Holiday Inn" giving its tariff, location etc  and  advertising itself as the "most  distinguished address  in New Delhi". By giving all this description the  appellants in fact wanted to ride on the reputation of  the respondent and derive pecuniary benefit from it. As  observed  in  Simatul Chemicals Industries Pvt. Ltd. (supra) the test to be applied is the test of an average person  with  imperfect recollection.  It would  not  be right to apply the test of a man of extraordinary memory who remembers the spelling of the name of each company or a person who Jots down meticulously and methodically the names of companies in his diary and brings out his diary and contemplates whether he is dealing with one company or the other. The average person is likely to be deceived by or confused with the use of the words "Holiday Inn" by the appellants. 
</p> 

<p id="p_55">51. In our considered opinion, the adoption of the words "Holiday Inn" by the appellants is ex facie fraudulent and mala fide from the very inception. The
words  "Holiday Inn" have been adopted by the  appellant to ride on the global reputation of the respondent.  The appellant was actuated by bad faith and dishonest motive. In  the facts and circumstances, the  learned Single  Judge  was  fully   justified  in granting  the injunction  and decreeing the suits in order to protect the commercial  goodwill and to ensure that the  global business  reputation of the respondent is not  exploited by the appellants In a clandestine manner. 
</p> 

<p id="p_56">52.     Both the appeals are devoid of any merit and are accordingly dismissed with costs.
