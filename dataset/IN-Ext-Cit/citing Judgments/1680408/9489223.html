</pre><p id="p_1">        (Passed on this 28th day of November, 2011)
  (Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
                          India)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   By this petition, the petitioner seeks to quash the

     order dated                  16-4-2005 (Annexure - P/1)

     whereby the appointment of the petitioner has been

     cancelled and the order dated 26-12-2007 (Annexure - P/2)

     whereunder the appeal preferred by the petitioner was

     dismissed and the order dated 16-4-2005 was maintained.

</p><p id="p_3">2.   The facts, in brief, as projected by the petitioner,

     for proper adjudication of the case, are that initially

     the petitioner was appointed as Branch Manager in the

     Chhattisgarh Gramin Bank [earlier known as "Bilaspur

     Raipur Kshetriya Gramin Bank] (for short "the respondent

     Bank") and joined in the month of November, 1984.  While

     the petitioner was working at Korba, he availed medical

     leave for 26 days i.e. for the period from 26-9-2004 to

     21-10-2004.  Thereafter, he took again medical leave for

     21 days i.e. from 5-11-2004 to 25-11-2004 and further for

     31 days from               26-11-2004 to 26-12-2004 in

     total 78 days.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   According to the petitioner, in the meantime,  the

     petitioner  was transferred from Korba to  Patewa,

     Mahasamund and, as such, the petitioner joined at Patewa,

     Mahasamund on 22-1-2005 and applied for medical leave on

     24-1-2005.  On the basis of the said application, the

     respondent authorities by letter dated 29-1-2005 (Annexure

</p><p id="p_5">     - P/4) directed the petitioner to submit the medical

     certificate  in support of his leave  application.

     Subsequently, notices dated 3-2-2005 &amp; 10-2-2005 (Annexure

</p><p id="p_6">     - P/4 pages 22 &amp; 23 in paper book, respectively) were

     served upon the petitioner intimating him that the leave

     application dated 24-1-2005 was not supported by any

     medical certificate and the petitioner was called upon to

     submit his explanation within 7 days, failing which the

     petitioner would be dealt with for disciplinary action

     under Regulation 22 (2) of the Bilaspur Raipur Kshetriya

     Gramin Bank (Officers &amp; Employees) Service Regulations,

     2001 (for short "the Regulations, 2001").  Further, a

     notice dated 17/21-2-2005 (Annexure - P/4 page 24 in paper

     book) was served upon the petitioner informing him that if

     the medical certificate was not produced, it would be

     presumed that the petitioner was not interested to

     continue his services and the same would be deemed that he

     had resigned from the services.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.   The  petitioner submitted his response to the show

     cause notice on 26-2-2005 (Annexure - P/5) stating that he

     was very much interested to serve, but on account of ill

     health he was unable to perform the duty and prayed that

     he may be permitted to avail the medical leave.  In spite

     of the said fact, again by notice dated               12-3-

     2005 (Annexure - P/6) the petitioner was directed to

     produce the medical certificate, period wise, issued by

     the competent Doctor and further he was directed to join

     the duties within 7 days, failing which disciplinary

     action   would   be   taken   against   him.    On

     19/21-3-2005 (Annexure - P/7) the petitioner submitted his

     reply  stating that he would produce  the  medical

     certificate after completing the treatment at Bilaspur.

     Again on 29-3-2005 (Annexure - P/8) a show cause notice

     was issued to the petitioner informing him that he should

     join the services on or before                      11-4-
</p>
<p id="p_8">     2005 with medical certificates for the period, he remained

     absent and explanation therefor, failing which his name

     would be struck of from the list of the employees of the

     Bank.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.   On 10-4-2005 &amp; 12-4-2005 (Annexure - P/9 pages 29 &amp; 

     30 in paper book respectively), the petitioner submitted

     his reply stating that he personally visited the head

     office and tried to submit the medical certificate, but

     they refused to accept the same and advised the petitioner

     to send the same by post.   Thereafter, by the impugned

     order dated 16-4-2005 (Annexure - P/1) the appointment of

     the petitioner was cancelled treating non-response of the

     petitioner to earlier notices, as resignation from

     service.  It was further stated that under Regulation 10

     (1) of the Regulations, 2001 he could submit resignation

     letter with 3 months intimation or on payment of 3 months

     salary in lieu of that.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.   Thereagainst, the petitioner preferred an appeal on

     29-5-2005 (Annexure - P/10).  In the said appeal, the

     authorities directed the petitioner to produce the medical

     fitness certificate from the District Medical Board,

     Mahasamund, to which the petitioner submitted his response

     stating that he will produce the certificate from the

     Medical Board, Bilaspur, as he was taking treatment at

     Bilaspur.  Since the prayer for the petitioner was not

     accepted, the petitioner appeared before the Medical

     Board, Mahasamund and submitted the medical certificate on

     18-4-2006 (Annexure - P/16).  Being dissatisfied with the

     response of the petitioner, the appeal of the petitioner

     was dismissed by order dated 26-12-2007 (Annexure - P/2).

     Thus, this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7.   Shri Kesharwani, learned counsel appearing for the

     petitioner, would submit that the petitioner could not

     join the duties on account of his illness for which he had

     responded to the notices and submitted representations.

     Shri Kesharwani would further submit that under Regulation

     22 (2) without holding proper enquiry, after framing

     charges, the petitioner could not be terminated.  Even

     otherwise, the same is contrary to the provisions of

     Constitution of India, as no termination order can be

     passed without affording an opportunity of hearing to the

     employee concerned in accordance with the procedure laid

     down in the services rules, regulations, etc. In support

     of his contention, Shri Kesharwani relies on the decisions

     of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/268805/" id="a_2">Delhi Transport Corporation v.

     D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress</a> and <a href="/doc/1899400/" id="a_3">Others1 &amp; Major Singh v. State

     of Punjab and Others2</a>.  He also relies on a decision of

     this Court in <a href="/doc/101258473/" id="a_4">Roshan Prasad Sidar v. State of Chhattisgarh

     and Others3</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.   Shri Pramod Verma, learned senior counsel appearing

with Shri Sumit Verma, learned Advocate for the respondent

     Bank, submitted in support of the impugned orders passed

     by the authorities.  Shri Verma would further submit that

     the conduct of the petitioner was such as he remained

     absent from his duties for a long time without complying

     with instructions or notices issued by the respondent Bank

     time and again and the petitioner also failed to produce

     proper medical certificates even before the appellate

     authority.  Thus, there was no other option, but to cancel

     appointment or remove the petitioner.   Shri Verma relies

     on a circular dated               20-2-1989 (Annexure -

     R/2), which provides for removal of Bank employees in case

     of unauthorized absence.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.   I  have  heard learned counsel appearing  for  the

     parties, perused the pleadings and the documents appended

     thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.  Indisputably, several notices were issued  to  the

     petitioner on                  3-2-2005, 10-2-2005, 17/21-

     2-2005, 26-2-2005, 12-3-2005,                    29-3-
</p>
<p id="p_15">     2005, etc.  The petitioner has also submitted his reply

     time to time.  However, the medical certificates of

     competent officer were not produced regularly.  The

     petitioner produced a medical certificate issued by the

     District Medical Board, Mahasamund on 18-4-2006.  The said

     certificate  disclosed over all condition  of  the

     petitioner, but it does not deal with any treatment or any

     requirement for rest, as pleaded by the petitioner.

     However, the service conditions of the petitioner are

     governed by the Regulations, 2001, which was notified on

     26-6-2001                (Annexure - R/1).
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.  Regulation 10 deals with termination of service by

     notice wherein it is provided that no officer or employee

     shall leave or discontinue his service in the Bank without

     first giving notice in writing to the Appointing Authority

     of his intention to leave or discontinue his service or

     resign.  The period of notice shall be 3 months or 3

     months pay for the notice period.  Regulation 10 is not

     relevant and applicable to the facts of the case on hand,

     as this was not a case of leave or discontinuation from

     his service, on the basis of any notice by the petitioner.

<p id="p_18">13.  Regulation 22 of the Regulations, 2001 provides that

     an officer shall not absent himself from his duties

     without having obtained the permission of the Competent

     Authority, nor shall be absent himself in case of sickness

     or accident without submitting proper medical certificate.

     Clause (ii) prescribes that an officer, who absents

     himself from duty without leave or overstays his leave,

     shall not be entitled to draw any pay and allowances for

     the period of such absence or overstayal, and shall be

     liable to such disciplinary measure as the Competent

     Authority may impose.  Proviso to Regulation 22 deals with

     the power of the competent authority to condone the

     absence or overstayal.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.  In the case on hand, the petitioner remained absent

     himself from duty without proper sanction and, as such, he

     will not be entitled to pay and allowances for the period

     of his absence or overstayal, but that cannot be a ground

     for removal from the service.  If the competent authority

     decides to impose penalty for such action, Regulation 38

     would come into force.
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.  Regulation 38 of the Regulations, 2001 deals  with

     penalties.  Clause (1) of Regulation 38 deals with

     penalties  on Officers.  `Removal from service  or

     dismissal' come within the definition of `major penalty'

     under clause 1 (b) of Regulation 38.  Second proviso to

     Regulation 38 mandates that no order imposing any of the

     major penalties specified above shall be made except by an

     order in writing signed by the Competent Authority and no

     such order shall be passed without the charge or charges

     being formulated in writing and given to the officer and

     enquiry held so that he shall have reasonable opportunity

     to answer the charge or charges and defend himself.  Thus,

     before imposition of major penalty of removal from

     service, the competent authority has to frame charge or

     charges and thereafter, enquiry has to be held affording

     reasonable opportunity to the officer to defend himself.

</p><p id="p_21">16.  Admittedly, in the case on hand, no such procedure as

     laid down under the Regulations, 2001 has been followed.

     The petitioner, on the ground of absenting himself without

     permission, was removed from the service on the basis of a

     simplicitor notice.   Thus, the impugned order of removal

     from service is contrary to the Regulations, 2001.

     appearing for the respondent Bank, on a circular dated 20-

     2-1989 (Annexure - R/2), which deals with unauthorized

     absence an officer/employee, is of no relevance, as that

     was a circular, seeking information from all the Managers

     in regard to unauthorized absence of the officers and

     employees.   Even  otherwise, all  the  circulars,

     instructions, service rules and regulations, which were in

     consistent with the provisions of Regulations, 2001 before

     the said regulations was notified, were repealed under the

     provisions of Regulation 73 of the Regulations, 2001.

     Even otherwise, reliance of the abovestated circular is

     without any basis and the same is accordingly rejected.

</p><p id="p_23">18.  In Delhi Transport Corporation (supra), a
constitution bench of the Supreme Court, by majority, held
that the Rule of Law which permeates our Constitution
demands that it has to be observed both substantially and
procedurally.  Rule of law posits that the power is to be
exercised in a manner which is just, fair and reasonable
and not in an unreasonable, capricious or arbitrary manner
leaving room for discrimination.  Further, the `audi
alteram partem' rule which is essence, enforces the
equality clause in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is
applicable not only to quasi judicial orders but to
administrative orders also, which effects prejudicially
the person concerned.

     days came back to the original place and remained absent

     from the duties without permission and particularly

     considering the fact that the money of the respondent Bank

     belongs to the public, the total back wages cannot be paid

     to the petitioner, who had not done any work for a long
