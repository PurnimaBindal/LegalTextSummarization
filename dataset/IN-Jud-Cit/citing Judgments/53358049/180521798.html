                  respondents) may not have phonetic similarity but the overall get
                  up/label/packaging of the appellant has been copied by the respondents
                  and the respondents have tried to come close to the appellant; the
                  appellant being the prior user of the mark/label and an established brand,
                  was entitled to the protection of its label. The learned ADJ has held that
                  the defendants in the suit/respondents herein would be entitled to use the
                  trade mark &#x27;RTC RAMAA&#x27;, but with a label and colour combination
                  which they have adopted for their inner packaging. The respondents have
                  been restrained from use of the outer trade dress/label/colour combination
                  as is being used by the appellant on its products.

                  &#x27;RAMMA MUNAKKA&#x27;.

                  C.M. NO. 3-2022, praying that even the limited temporary injunction has
                  been wrongly granted and should be vacated by this Court.

                  is &#x27;RAMU&#x27; (of the appellant) and &#x27;RAMAA&#x27; (of the respondents), are
                  phonetically similar. He submits that the appellant is admittedly the
                  proprietor and the prior user of the mark, having adopted the same
                  honestly and in a bona fide manner in the year 1995, through her
                  predecessor, the Late Shri Ramavtar Aggarwal. The appellant is also the
                  registered proprietor of the said mark in various forms and for various

                   goods under Class 29. The appellant also has registrations in copyright
                  for artistic works involved in the said trade mark/label/trade-dress, under
                  the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">Copyright Act</a>, 1957. Referring to the plaint filed
                  before the learned ADJ, he submits that the appellant had sales of
                  Rs.33,22,23,091/- (Rupees Thirty-Three Crore Twenty-Two Lakh
                  Twenty-Three Thousand Ninety-One only) in the financial year 2017-18
                  alone. He submits that the respondents have given no explanation for
                  adopting a deceptively-similar mark for identical goods as that of the
                  appellant.
</p><p id="p_6">                  5.        The learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the
                  appellant became aware of the existence of the respondents/defendants in
                  the suit only in the second week of February 2019. On further inquiry, it
                  came to the knowledge of the appellant that the respondents have
                  obtained registration of its mark on a &#x27;proposed to be used&#x27; basis vide
                  application no. 3772367 under Class 29, filed on 07.03.2018.                The
                  appellant has also filed an application seeking rectification of the said
                  mark and the said proceedings are pending. He submits that therefore, not
                  only did the appellant have a good prima facie case in its favour but also
                  had the balance of convenience in its favour and against the respondents,
                  as the respondents have adopted the deceptively-similar mark just prior to
                  the filing of the suit.
</p><p id="p_7">                  6.        He submits that the learned ADJ has made an artificial distinction
                  between the outer packaging and the inner packaging adopted by the
                  respondents. He submits that the trade marks &#x27;RAMU&#x27; and &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;,
                  which form a pre-dominant part of the packaging, being deceptively
                  similar, the other parts of the packaging cannot be sufficient to

                  submits that where there is case of deliberate and intentional
                  misrepresentation, it would amount to a fraud and the plaintiff does not
                  have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action of passing
                  off- as the likelihood of such damage caused is sufficient.

                  even the word mark contained therein is entitled to an equal protection.
                  In support, he places reliance on the judgment dated 12.05.2022 passed

                  phonetic and visual similarity, both being equally important. In support,
                  he places reliance on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court in

                  even though the respondents obtained the registration of its mark, by the

                  submits that this Court, while exercising the power of an Appellate Court
                  against an ad-interim order, cannot substitute its view for that of the
                  learned Trial Court; interference will be warranted only where the view
                  expressed by the learned ADJ is found to be perverse or unsustainable in
                  law. In support of this assertion, he places reliance on the judgment of
                  the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_9">Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>., 1990

</p><p id="p_14">                  12.       He submits that in the present case, the two marks are different and
                  the same has been observed prima facie by the learned ADJ as well. The
                  packaging of the products is also different and therefore, there is
                  absolutely no likelihood of confusion or deception being caused by the
                  adoption of the mark &#x27;RAMAA&#x27; or of the packaging by the respondents.
                  He submits that the source of the goods is clearly mentioned and
                  distinguished in the packaging adopted by the respondents. In support of
                  this claim, he places reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in

                  the appellant is not using the label for which she had obtained
                  registration. In this regard, he submits that while the registration has
                  been obtained by the appellant in the following label, the label used by
                  the appellant is different:

                  is liable to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_19">                  15.       He submits that by the non-use of the registered mark for more
                  than five years, the said mark is also liable to be cancelled under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_11">Section

                  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_12">Section 124</a> of the Act. He submits that this Court, while considering the

                  registration of the mark in favour of the appellant itself is prima facie
                  liable to be cancelled. In support, he places reliance on the judgment of

                   defence that a suit for trade mark infringement does not lie against the
                  said registered proprietor. In this regard, he places reliance on the
                  judgment of <a href="/doc/149416858/" id="a_13">S.Syed Mohideen v. P. Sulochana Bai</a>, (2016) 2 SCC 683.
</p><p id="p_21">                  17.       He further submits that the word &#x27;RAMU&#x27; is a common name in
                  India and therefore, no monopoly can be claimed over the same. This
                  itself, in his submission, is sufficient to cancel the registration of the trade
                  mark granted in favour of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_22">                  18.       The learned senior counsel for the respondents further submits that
                  the appellant is primarily dealing only in almonds and therefore, cannot
                  claim monopoly over the mark for other goods-dry fruits.
</p><p id="p_23">                  19.       He submits that the goods in question being dry fruits, the
                  consumers can easily distinguish the two marks and there is no likelihood
                  of confusion being caused.
</p><p id="p_24">                  20.       The learned senior counsel for the respondents further submits that
                  the adoption of the mark by the respondents is also bona fide inasmuch as
                  the name of the grandmother of the respondents is &#x27;Rama Devi&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_25">                  21.       The learned senior counsel for the respondents finally submits that
                  even the impugned order insofar as it directs the respondents to use only
                  the inner packaging is liable to be set aside. He submits that the learned
                  ADJ cannot issue such a mandatory direction; at best the power of the
                  learned ADJ would be to restrain the use of a particular packaging.

                  mark/label &#x27;RAMU&#x27; in relation to the processing and marketing of dry
                  fruits and other allied and related goods in January 1995, through her
                  predecessor, the Late Sh. Ramavtar Aggarwal (trading as M/s Sabar
                  International). After the death of the Late Sh. Ramavtar Aggarwal on
                  09.11.2013, the appellant became the sole proprietor of M/s Sabar
                  International. The appellant/plaintiff in the suit also gives details of the
                  registration of her trade marks in paragraph 5 of the plaint as under:

                  &#x27;RAMU&#x27; is clearly the most predominant part. In V Guard Industries

                  ex-parte order of injunction was granted in her favour on 10.07.2019,

                  urge that the appellant is primarily dealing in almonds whereas the
                  respondents do not deal in almonds, at least prima facie, the same does
                  not appear to be correct, inasmuch as the respondents itself has produced
                  packaging of the appellant&#x27;s goods, which are khurmani and munakka. In
                  any case, the goods of the appellant and the respondents are related/allied

                  It is imperative to look at the matter from a commercial point of view,
                  and trade channels are an important consideration in the event competing
                  goods are used in the same sector.

                                          clear, beyond pale of doubt, that the principle of
                                          „anti dissection‟ does not impose an absolute
                                          embargo upon the consideration of the constituent
                                          elements of a composite mark. The said elements

                                          Thus, the principle of „anti dissection‟ and
                                          identification of „dominant mark‟ are not
                                          antithetical to one another and if viewed in a
                                          holistic perspective, the said principles rather

                  Anr</a>., 2014 (59) PTC 339 (Del), a learned Single Judge of this Court has
                  held that &quot;in order to prove the case for infringement of trade mark, the
                  plaintiff has to show that the essential features of the registered trade

                   infringed the trade mark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the
                  Court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds of
                  general public and not by merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two
                  marks.&quot;
</p><p id="p_75">                  38.       Applying the above test to the facts of the present appeal, it must
                  be held that the words &#x27;RAMU&#x27; and &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;, are the predominant
                  part of the two label marks; the same closely resemble each other - both
                  structurally as also phonetically; the class of purchasers are those who
                  would not pay much attention to the dissimilarities in the two labels but
                  go by their imperfect recollection of the marks; the goods are sold over-
                  the-counter and through e-commerce websites, therefore, having the
                  same selling point; the use of the prefix &#x27;RTC&#x27; is also not sufficient to
                  distinguish the two marks or the source of the goods. The two marks,
                  therefore, are deceptively similar to each other.
</p><p id="p_76">                  39.           The learned ADJ in his impugned order has held that there is no
                  visual and phonetic similarity between the trade marks &#x27;RAMU&#x27; and
                  &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;. In my opinion, the learned ADJ has erred in law in reaching
                  the above conclusion. It has not only failed to apply the test culled out
                  hereinabove, but also seems to have adopted the test of comparison of the
                  marks side-by-side, which as observed herein above, is not the correct
                  test. Phonetically the two marks, that is, &#x27;RAMU&#x27; and &#x27;RAMAA&#x27; are
                  similar and would cause confusion in the mind of an unwary consumer
                  wanting to purchase goods like dry fruits off-the-shelf. It appears that the
                  test applied by the learned ADJ in the present case is not of an unwary
                  consumer with imperfect recollection but of a person who has an ideal

                  marks.
</p><p id="p_77">                  40.       The learned ADJ has further been guided by the fact that the
                  appellant did not file any opposition against the trade mark &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;
                  when it was advertised for registration in the Journal of Trade Marks.
                  This, in my view, cannot be of much significance as the suit has been
                  filed by the appellant/plaintiff in the suit immediately on coming to know
                  of the use of the mark by the respondents/defendants in the suit. The
                  advertisement of a mark of an opponent can escape one&#x27;s attention and
                  therefore, such mark can proceed to registration. However, on coming to
                  know of the use of the mark, if the proprietor has taken immediate action,
                  it cannot be said that the proprietor has acquiesced the use of such
                  deceptively-similar mark by their opponent. [Ref: <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_28">Midas Hygiene
                  Industries (P) Ltd. v. Sudhir Bhatia</a>, (2004) 3 SCC 90]. It is also well-
                  settled that an injunction can be granted even against a registered
                  proprietor of a mark. Reference in this regard may be made to the
                  judgment of this Court in Clinique Laboratories LLC and Another

                  registration rights under the Act. Registration merely recognises the
                  rights which are pre-existing in common law and does not create any
                  rights and in case of conflict between the two registered proprietors, the
                  evaluation of the better rights in common law is essential as the common
                  law rights would enable the court to determine whose rights between the

                   two registered proprietors are better and superior in common law which
                  have been recognised in the form of the registration by the Act. Applying
                  the said principle, the appellant being the prior adopter of the mark,
                  certainly has a superior right over the respondents in the said mark and is
                  entitled to protection of the same notwithstanding the registration
                  obtained by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_79">                  42.       The learned ADJ has also come to the conclusion that the
                  respondents have used the packaging which is similar to that of the
                  appellant; the kind of packaging material used by the respondent is
                  absolute similar; the colour combination of packaging at serial nos.3,4,6
                  and 9 are deceptively-similar; the adoption of different label for inner and
                  outer packaging shows the dishonesty on the part of the respondents; and
                  that the overall get up/label/packaging has been copied by the
                  respondents, and they have attempted to come close to the appellant,
                  which has been in the market prior to the respondents&#x27; mark and was an
                  established brand. In spite of having reached the above conclusion, the
                  learned ADJ in the impugned order, has allowed the respondents to use
                  the trade mark &#x27;RTC RAMAA&#x27; with the label and colour combination,
                  which they have for their inner packaging.

                  failed to appreciate that once it is held that the adoption and user of a
                  mark by the respondent was not bona fide but was, in fact, intended to
                  deceive, injunction must follow. Reliance in this regard is placed on a

                  features of their general get-up negates the appellant&#x27;s claim of passing

                  different to the one that is being argued before this Court. As presently
                  there is neither an averment in the written statement in the suit by the
                  defendants/respondents that the registration granted in favour of the

                  negative. However, in the present case, the misuser alleged is at best of
                  the registered stylised version and not of the mark &#x27;RAMU&#x27;. The said
                  judgment therefore, cannot have any application to the facts of the
                  present case. For the same reason, the judgment of the Division Bench of
                  this Court in <a href="/doc/224345/" id="a_32">Fedders Llyod Corporation Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Fedders
                  Corporation &amp; Anr</a>., 2005 (30) PTC 353 (Del), also cannot come to the
                  rescue of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_93">                  53.       The submissions of the learned senior counsel for the respondents
                  that no monopoly can be claimed by the appellant in a common name like
                  &#x27;RAMU&#x27; and that no injunction can be granted against the use of the
                  word &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;, which is the name of a Hindu God, is liable to be
                  rejected. The word &#x27;RAMU&#x27; has no association with the goods in
                  question, that is, dry fruits. It is, therefore, arbitrary as far as the goods in
                  question are concerned. Further, the respondents themselves having
                  obtained registration in the mark &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;, are estopped from

                   contending that the said mark is publici juris. By seeking registration
                  thereof, it is the respondents who have sought to obtain monopoly over
                  the said mark.
</p><p id="p_94">                  54.       Though the learned senior counsel for the respondents has rightly
                  submitted that the Appellate Court should not interfere with the exercise
                  of discretion of the Court of the first instance and substitute its own
                  discretion, however, in the facts of the present case, in my opinion, the
                  discretion has been wrongly exercised by the learned ADJ by ignoring
                  the settled principles of law.       As held by the Supreme Court in
                  Laxmikant Patel (supra), a refusal to grant an injunction in spite of the
                  availability of facts, which are prima facie established by overwhelming
                  evidence and material available on record justifying the grant thereof,
                  occasions a failure of justice and such injury to the plaintiff as would not
                  be capable of being undone at a later stage;        it, therefore, becomes
                  obligatory on the part of the Appellate Court to interfere.

                  selling, soliciting, exporting, displaying, advertising or marketing their
                  product under the mark &#x27;RAMAA&#x27;, &#x27;RAMAA MUNAKKA&#x27; label or
                  any other mark, which is deceptively-similar to the appellant&#x27;s trade mark
                  &#x27;RAMU&#x27;, during the pendency of the suit.
