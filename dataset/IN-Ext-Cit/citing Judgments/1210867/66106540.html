<p id="p_3">2.    The appellant is the father of Jamuna, Leela, Aarta,
Savita and Phool Kunwar who, at the time of their untimely
deaths, were aged about 1 year, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years
and 6 years. Amongst these, Jamuna, Leela &amp; Savita were
born through his second wife namely Basanti (PW1) while
he got the other two from his first wife viz. Santo (PW2),
the cousin of Basanti. Appellant's children also include three
sons; Shriram from Basanti and Ajay &amp; Vijay from Santo.
He was tried not only for committing murders of all the five
daughters but also for making an attempt to commit
suicide.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.    Prosecution case may briefly be stated thus -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (i)    At the relevant point of time, the appellant was
      residing in a one-room house situated on forest-land
      in village Kaneria along with his wives and children.
      His elder brother Chhagan and younger brothers
      Jagan (PW3) and Agan (PW8) were also living in the
      same vicinity but in different houses constructed on
      the forest-land only.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (ii)   During the period of nearly a month preceding
      the incident in question, the appellant proposed to sell
      his land in favour of one Ramlal, a co-villager.
      However, his wives as well as brothers were opposed
      to the proposal. They persuaded him not to sell the
                                  :: 3 ::</blockquote>


<p id="p_5">          Cri. Reference No.1/2011 and Cri. Appeal No.503/2011




land saying that 'how would he maintain the children
after doing so'. Against this backdrop, the appellant,
being annoyed with the attitude of his wives and
brothers, did not take meals in the night intervening
10th and 11th of June, 2010. On the following morning,
he again refused to eat food and started moving
around     carrying        an      axe.      However,            ignoring   his
displeasure, Basanti and Santo went to agricultural
field located behind their house to pick up pieces of
stones, leaving all the children playing in the house of
Agan.
</p>
<p id="p_6">(iii)   On 11.06.2010, at about 5 p.m., the appellant
called on his daughters to return home. As the girls
including Jamuna, who was being carried by Phool
Kunwar in her lap, entered into the house, the
appellant       closed        the          door    from          inside     and
exterminated each one of them by cutting her throat
with the axe after causing the same to be placed on a
wooden plank.
</p>
<p id="p_7">(iv) Hearing alarms, Basanti and Santo rushed to the
house; peeped thereinto through the closed door and
found that all the five daughters, stained with blood,
were lying dead and the appellant, wearing only a
pant, was also present there with axe in his hand.
Basanti immediately shouted to Agan and Jagan that
the appellant had cut down the girls but before their
arrival at the scene, the appellant opened the door
and attempted to kill Basanti and Santo, who were
able to run away. At this point of time, the appellant
climbed over nearby Teak Tree and tried to hang
                                     :: 4 ::

<p id="p_8">             Cri. Reference No.1/2011 and Cri. Appeal No.503/2011




himself by tying a rope around his neck. Agan and
Jagan immediately aborted appellant's attempt to
commit suicide by climbing over the tree and bringing
him down after cutting the rope. They then tied up the
appellant with a rope to the tree.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(v)    Agan (PW8) informed Radheshyam (CW1), the
husband of Sarpanch about the incident. Radheshyam,
in turn, apprised V.K. Jain (PW9), the then SHO of
P.S.    Ichhawar            accordingly             on    cell-phone.           After
recording the corresponding information at Serial
No.705 of the Roznamcha (Ex.32-<a href="/doc/1453722/" id="a_3">C and D-2), V.K.
Jain</a> immediately proceeded to the spot where he
scribed Dahati Nalishi (Ex.P-1) upon information given
by Basanti (PW1).
</p>
<p id="p_10">(vi) After inquest proceedings, dead bodies were sent
for post-mortem examinations, that was conducted by
Dr. B.B. Sharma (PW4). He opined that common
cause        of    deaths        was          shock      due    to    excessive
haemorrhage. The medical expert also preserved
bloodstained           clothes       worn           by   each       one    of    the
deceased for forensic examination.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(vii) During           investigation,              SHO   V.K.       Jain    (PW9)
inspected the spot and seized the following articles
therefrom -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (a)        ordinary soil               (b)     bloodstained soil
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       (c)        piece of wood (d)                   rope in four pieces
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (e)        bloodstained axe

       He also seized bloodstained pant worn by the
appellant         at    the     place         of    occurrence       only.       The

</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 Cri. Reference No.1/2011 and Cri. Appeal No.503/2011




     appellant was subjected to medical examination. All
     the seized articles were forwarded to Regional FSL,
     Bhopal for forensic examination. The corresponding
     report (Ex.P-40) indicated that except the ordinary
     soil, all the articles contained human blood and also
     that blood found on the frock and underwear of Phool
     Kunwar and on appellant's pant was of the same
     group i.e. AB.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">4.   The appellant abjured the guilt. In his examination,
under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for
short 'the Code'), he further pleaded that someone else had
killed his daughters. However, the defence did not prefer to
adduce any supportive evidence presumably in view of
categorical admissions made by Basanti (PW1), Santo
(PW2), Jagan (PW3) and Agan (PW8) to the effect that on
being asked about the gruesome incident, the appellant
disclosed   that      some        unknown          persons        had      not    only
murdered his daughters but also tied him to the tree.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.   Let    us     first     deal     with        the   appeal          against   the
convictions, which are apparently based on circumstantial
evidence only.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.   Legality and propriety of the impugned convictions
have been challenged on the following grounds -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     (i)         Chain of circumstances relied upon by learned
                 trial     Judge        was       not     so      complete        and
                 connected with the charges as to establish the
                 guilt of the appellant.

     natural and probable, viz. Basanti, Santo, Jagan and
     Agan,    on     one      hand,            did   not    corroborate   the
     prosecution case and on the other, supported the
     defence that some unknown persons after killing his
     daughters, had tied the appellant to the tree.</blockquote>


<p id="p_15">     In response, learned Government Advocate, while
making reference to the incriminating pieces of evidence,
has contended that the convictions were fully justified.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7.   The sole line of defence suggested that each one of
the deaths in question was homicidal in nature. Further, no
serious dispute was raised questioning veracity of the
medical evidence as to the number, situs and nature of
injuries found on the persons of Jamuna, Leela, Aarta,
Savita and Phool Kunwar and those received by the
appellant. Still, in order to appreciate the rival contentions
in the right perspective, it would be necessary to advert to
testimony of the medical expert.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8.   Evidence of Dr. B.B. Sharma (PW4) relates to the
post-mortem examinations on the dead bodies of Aarta,
Savita, Leela, Jamuna and Phool Kunwar as conducted on
12.06.2010. According to him, he had found the following
ante-mortem injuries -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">     on the body of Aarta (as described in Ex.P-18)

              back to the left side of the neck (oblique).
              External jugular vein, fascia, muscle (underlying)

              scapular region on the back of right side.
</p>

<p id="p_33">      The Autopsy Surgeon categorically opined that all the
abovementioned injuries were caused by hard, sharp and
heavy object and the common cause of deaths was shock
due to excessive haemorrhage. He further deposed that the
injuries received by the deceased could be inflicted by the
axe, referred to him for examination by the SHO on
14.06.2010 by way of memo (Ex.P-25). Corresponding
report (Ex.P-26) was also tendered in evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_34">9.    In the face of all this evidence, learned trial Judge did
not commit any illegality in holding that each one of the
deceased had met with a homicidal death that was caused
by cutting her neck by means of the axe.
</p>
<p id="p_35">10.   Dr. B.B. Sharma also proved existence of the following
injury, as reflected in the report (Ex.P-24), on the neck of
the appellant -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            "A ligature mark all around the neck above
      the thyroid cartilage oblique, 36 cm long 1.5 cm
      wide, ligature mark starting from back of the
      neck to angle to mandible left side. Ligature
      mark is missing on left side back of the neck and
      below left ear".</blockquote>


<p id="p_36">      In the cross-examination, the medical expert ruled out
the possibility that the neck injury could be sustained due
                                          :: 9 ::
</p>

<p id="p_37">                  Cri. Reference No.1/2011 and Cri. Appeal No.503/2011




to tying of rope around the neck. According to him, ligature
mark was caused by hanging only.
</p>

<p id="p_38">11.   Coming to the other evidence on record, it may be
observed that one of the incriminating circumstances relied
on    by    the    prosecution,          that      related      to       extra-judicial
confession said to have been made by the appellant before
Ratan Singh (PW7) was discarded by learned trial Judge as
inadmissible. Moreover, as pointed out already, the mothers
and    uncles     of    the     deceased           had not         supported          the
prosecution version as to involvement of the appellant in
the offences charged with.
</p>
<p id="p_39">12.   Evidence         concerning         remaining          circumstances,           as
highlighted by the prosecution and found proved by learned
trial Judge, may be re-appreciated in the light of the rival
contentions in the following manner: -
</p>

<p id="p_40">(A)   CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO THE OFFENCE OF
      MURDER.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      (1)    The first circumstance held proved is in the form
      of admission made by Basanti (PW1) to the effect that
      seeing dead bodies of the daughters, she had started
      shouting that the appellant had cut down the girls.
      Learned        Senior       Counsel          has   submitted             that   the
      admission,         being       inconsistent          with      a        categorical
      assertion to the effect that she did not know as to who
      had killed the girls, could not be relied upon as an
      incriminating          circumstance.           However,            it    was    not
      possible to reject corresponding part of Basanti's
      deposition on the ground that she was declared hostile
                               :: 10 ::

by the prosecution (<a href="/doc/1594619/" id="a_5">Bhagwan Singh v. State of
Haryana</a> AIR 1976 SC 202 relied on) particularly
when she was not cross-examined by the defence in
respect of this constituent incident of the transaction.
Needless to say, this fact was admissible under
<a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_6">Section 6</a> of the Evidence Act as res gestae.
</p>
<p id="p_43">(2)   The next circumstance found established is that
an entry (Ex.P-32-C as well as D-2) in the Rojnamcha
(Daily Diary) of the police station was made by SHO
V.K. Jain (PW9), upon the cell-phonic information said
to have been given by Radheshyam (CW1) suggesting
that Maganlal Barela viz. the appellant had killed five
daughters in his residence located at village Kaneria
and was also attempting to hang himself. Since the
telephonic information received by the police officer
was not vague or cryptic, but contained precise
particulars of the offending acts committed by the
appellant, it could be treated as an FIR (<a href="/doc/1493983/" id="a_7">Sunil Kumar
v. State of M.P</a>. AIR 1997 SC 940 referred to).
</p>
<p id="p_44">      Learned Senior Counsel, while making reference
to decision of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/418010/" id="a_8">Sankaralinga
Tevan v. Emperor</a> AIR 1930 Madras 632 (2) and
that of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1957933/" id="a_9">State of Bombay v.
Rusy Mistry</a> AIR 1960 SC 391, has still contended
that the entry in the Roznamcha could not be used as
substantive evidence. Attention has also been invited
to the fact that Radheshyam, summoned as a Court
Witness but permitted to be declared as hostile by the
prosecution,      clearly      asserted         that     he    had   only
communicated the information received from Jagan
                               :: 11 ::

(PW3) to the effect that mutilated dead bodies of all
the five daughters were lying in appellant's house and
not that it was the appellant who had murdered them.
Nevertheless, in absence of any prejudice or bias
towards the appellant, statement of V.K. Jain that he
had   made       the     aforesaid         entry      only     upon   the
information conveyed by Radheshyam, could not be
disbelieved simply because he happens to be a police
officer. The information so given immediately after the
commission of the crime so as to form part of the
same transaction was also relevant under <a href="/doc/1536853/" id="a_10">Section 6</a> of
the Evidence Act. The circumstance that investigation
against appellant started on the basis of the aforesaid
information was rightly held to be established.
(3)   The next circumstance on which reliance has
been placed is the appellant's conduct subsequent to
murders of all the five daughters. Learned Senior
Counsel has urged that an indifferent attitude of the
appellant    after     witnessing         the     murders       was   not
unnatural or improbable as no fixed pattern of natural
conduct can be laid down as different witnesses would
react in different manner in the same situation.
According to him, apparently, the appellant, after
seeing the ghastly incident, had become stunned and
therefore, was not in a position to raise alarm. Making
reference to evidence of Basanti, Santo, Jagan and
Agan, he has further pointed out that all of them duly
substantiated the defence by deposing that while
denying his complicity in the murders, the appellant
revealed that someone else had not only killed his
                               :: 12 ::

daughters but also tied him to the tree. Citing the
decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/612149/" id="a_11">Zwinglee Ariel v.
State of M.P</a>. AIR 1954 SC 15, learned Senior
Counsel has also contended that any statement made
by the accused after being apprehended by the police
was also not admissible under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_12">Section 8</a> of the
Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_47">     However, fact of the matter is that evidence of
the relatives suffered from inconsistency regarding
information given by the appellant as to number of
persons involved in killing of his daughters. According
to Basanti, Santo and Jagan, on being asked, the
appellant disclosed that some unknown person, after
killing his daughters, had tied him to the tree whereas
as per statement of Agan, the appellant's explanation
suggested role of as many as four/five persons in the
incident. Besides this, non-explanation on their part as
to why even after knowing about the innocence of the
appellant, they, instead of informing the police about
the incident or untying the rope to set him free, had
waited for police to arrive at the spot. It was,
therefore, apparent that all of them were interested in
screening the appellant from the penal consequences
of the murders of his daughters. Had his plea been
true, the appellant, in the ordinary course of human
affairs, as a father witnessing brutal murders of all the
five daughters by someone else, would certainly have
raised hue and cry and taken steps to apprise the
police of the incident. In this view of the matter, his
conduct of non-reaction even after seeing merciless
                                  :: 13 ::
</p>

<p id="p_48">           Cri. Reference No.1/2011 and Cri. Appeal No.503/2011




killing of his female off-springs was rightly considered
as    an    incriminating          circumstance           relevant   under
<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_13">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act to the fact in issue.
</p>
<p id="p_49">(4)   Another circumstance found established is that
the appellant was found tied to the teak tree by
means of a rope. SHO V.K. Jain (PW9) was emphatic
in stating that when he reached the spot, he had
found the appellant tied to the tree, located near the
place of occurrence, by means of a rope and this fact
was also admitted by the appellant in his examination,
under <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_14">Section 313</a> of the Code. As concluded already,
his non-explanation that he was made to stand tied to
the tree by some unknown person/persons was not
convincing in the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_50">(5)    The fifth circumstance held proved against the
appellant is that blood of same group was found on
his pant and on the frock and underwear worn by
Phool Kunwar. Investigating Officer V.K. Jain clearly
deposed that along with the axe lying near the dead
bodies of appellant's daughters, he had also seized (a)
dust-coloured pant worn by the appellant by way of
memo (Ex.P-30) and (b) bloodstained wooden plank,
ordinary &amp; bloodstained soil and pieces of rope as per
memo (Ex.P-31). Contents of these documents were
not challenged in his cross-examination. They also
drew adequate support from the evidence of panch
witness Ratan Singh (PW7). Further, no dispute was
raised as to statement made by Autopsy Surgeon Dr.
B.B. Sharma (PW4) that he had sealed the clothes
worn by each one of the deceased separately for
                               :: 14 ::

chemical examination. According to V.K. Jain, he had
forwarded all the seized articles along with a memo,
copy of which was placed on record as Ex.P-39, to
Regional FSL, Bhopal. Corresponding report (Ex.P-40)
authored by M.P. Bhaskar, Senior Scientific Officer and
Assistant Chemical Examiner, indicated that wooden
plank, axe, pant &amp; frock and underwear said to have
been worn by Phool Kunwar, were found to contain
same group of blood namely AB.
</p>
<p id="p_52">      Learned Senior Counsel, while placing reliance
on a decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1210867/" id="a_15">Subhash Chand v.
State of Rajasthan</a>                 (2002) 1 SCC 702, has
submitted       that    in    absence           of    evidence        as     to
appellant's     blood      group,         presence         of   Group       AB
bloodstain      on     the        pant     did       not    assume         any
significance.        However,            the     contention          is     not
acceptable in view of the fact that no bleeding injury
corresponding to the bloodstain on the pant was found
on    the     person         of     the        appellant.       In        these
circumstances, matching of blood on the clothes worn
by Phool Kunwar and those found on the pant was
correctly     taken      into       account          as     one      of     the
incriminating circumstances against the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(6)   Presence of human blood on the nail clipping is
yet another circumstance found established against
the appellant. While terming this circumstance as
useless and deceptive, learned Senior Counsel has
invited attention to the decision in <a href="/doc/654477/" id="a_16">Ujagar Singh v.
Emperor</a> AIR 1939 Lahore 149 wherein it was held
that evidence of blood-stained nails is not only of no

medico-legal value but may be extremely dangerous
to the innocent persons. However, as explained by the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1605387/" id="a_17">Dayanidhi Bisoi v. State of
Orissa</a> (2003) 9 SCC 310, presence of blood in the
nail clipping may not be sufficient by itself to fasten
guilt on the accused; but when it is considered with
other evidence and found acceptable can provide
additional weightage to the prosecution case. This
view was re-affirmed in <a href="/doc/1626024/" id="a_18">Vilas Pandurang Patil v.
State of Maharashtra</a> AIR 2004 SC 3562.
</p>
<p id="p_55">(7)   The seventh circumstance found proved is the
falsity of the defence. It is well settled that the false
answers given by the accused with reference to the
charge or questions posed in his examination may
also serve as an additional link in the chain of
circumstance to bring home the charge. However, as
explained by Fazal Ali, J., in <a href="/doc/1505859/" id="a_19">Sharad Biridhichand

      Turning to the facts of the instant case, it may
be observed that there was not even an iota of
evidence to probablise the suggestion made by the
appellant as to involvement of someone else in
causing deaths of his female offsprings. He was not
able to explain as to how the dead bodies, the axe and
bloodstained wooden plank were found in his house.
But, even excluding the circumstance relating to
falsity of the defence, the conclusion would be
irresistible that all other circumstances proved by the
prosecution pointed towards the guilt of the accused
and were inconsistent with his innocence.
</p>
<p id="p_57">(8)   Appellant's annoyance over the disagreement
expressed by his wives viz. Basanti (PW1) and Santo
(PW2) over the proposal to transfer the land in favour
of one Ramlal is the last circumstance projected as
motive of the crime. Jagan (PW3) clearly admitted
that the appellant wanted to sell his land to Ramlal
whereas Basanti, while supporting the aforesaid fact,
further asserted that she and Santo had always
advised the appellant not to sell the land as they were
under an obligation to bring up their children. As
explained by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/967969/" id="a_20">Uday Kumar v. State
of Karnataka</a> AIR 1998 SC 3317, motive though is
one of the circumstances, which assume importance
but it cannot be said that in absence thereof, proved
circumstances would be of no consequence.

</p>

<p id="p_60">      Existence of ligature mark on the neck of the
      appellant is the only circumstance found proved
      against him. As indicated already, Dr. B.B. Sharma
      (PW4) noticed a ligature mark on his neck which,
      according to the medical expert, could ordinarily be
      caused due to hanging and not by tying a rope around
      the neck. But, none of the relatives had supported the
      corresponding version as disclosed in the Dehati
      Nalishi (Ex.P-1). To elucidate, Basanti and Santo did
      not substantiate the recitals to the effect that they
      had seen the appellant climbing over the tree and
      trying to hang himself by means of a rope whereas
      Jagan   and     Agan       also      resiled      from         their   earlier
      statements that they had thwarted the appellant's
      attempt to end his life by cutting the rope and causing
      him to fall down. Moreover, no corresponding external
      injury was found on the appellant's body.

appreciation of circumstantial evidence as laid down by the
Supreme Court in Hanuman Govind Nargundkar v.

time-honoured principle in all subsequent decisions on the

      must be borne in mind. In such cases, it is
      always the danger that conjecture or suspicion
      may take the place of legal proof. In cases
      where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,
      the circumstances from which the conclusion of
      guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance
      be fully established, and all the facts so
      established should be consistent only with the
      hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the
      circumstances should be of a conclusive nature
      and tendency and they should be such as to
      exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed
      to be proved. In other words, there must be a

<p id="p_62">14.   Sir Alfred        Wills, in his work on                     "Circumstantial
Evidence" has highlighted the following rules to be observed
in a case based on circumstantial evidence: (1) the facts
alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly
proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the
factum probandum; (2) the burden of proof is always on
the party who asserts the existence of any fact, which infers
legal accountability; (3) in all cases, whether of direct or
circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced
which the nature of the case admits; (4) in order to justify
the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be
incompatible with the innocence of the accused and
incapable   of      explanation,          upon      any      other      reasonable
hypothesis than that of his guilt, (5) if there be any

      necessary that the crime must be seen to have
      been committed and must, in all circumstances
      be proved by direct ocular evidence by
      examining before the Court those persons who
      had seen its commission. The offence can be
      proved by circumstantial evidence also. The
      principal fact or factum probandum may be
      proved indirectly by means of certain inferences
      drawn from factum probans, that is, the
      evidentiary facts. To put it differently,
      circumstantial evidence is not direct to the point
      in issue but consists of evidence of various other
      facts which are so closely associated with the
      fact in issue that taken together they form a
      chain of circumstances from which the existence
      of the principal fact can be legally inferred or
      presumed. When a case rests squarely on
      circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt
      can be justified only when all the incriminating
      facts and circumstances are found to be

<p id="p_66">16.   Applying these well-settled principles to the facts of
the present case as established from the evidence on
record, we are inclined to hold that on one hand, chain of
circumstances found proved was so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent
with the innocence of the appellant and did show that, in all
                                     :: 20 ::

human probabilities, no one other than the appellant had
committed murders of his own female offsprings and on the
other, the false plea raised by him also lent assurance to
the conclusion as to his guilt. However, in absence of
corroborative direct or other circumstantial evidence, the
appellant was entitled to benefit of doubt in respect of the
offence of attempt to commit suicide for the simple reason
that the only circumstance in the form of existence of
ligature mark was not sufficient to establish the charge.

<p id="p_68">17.   For these reasons, none of the contentions raised
against legality and propriety of the conviction of the
appellant under S.302 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a> (on five counts) deserves
acceptance. It is, therefore, upheld as well-merited.

      constitute a continuing threat to society.

      reformed and rehabilitated.

      domination of another person.

limitation in providing a comprehensive list of extenuating
circumstances in the following terms -

arises;

      relevant circumstances of the crime, and

and answered:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "(a) Is there something uncommon about the
      crime which renders sentence of imprisonment
      for life inadequate and calls for a death
      sentence?

      there is no alternative but to impose death

      conscience of the community is so shocked, that it
      will expect the holders of the judicial power centre
      to inflict death penalty irrespective of their
      personal opinion as regards desirability or
      otherwise of retaining death penalty, death
      sentence can be awarded. The community may
      entertain such sentiment in the following
      circumstances:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">      (1) When the murder is committed in an
      extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting,
      or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and
      extreme indignation of the community.
      (2) When the murder is committed for a motive,
      which evinces total depravity and meanness; e.g.
      murder by hired assassin for money or reward; or
      cold-blooded murder for gains of a person vis-à-
      vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position
      or in a position of trust; or murder is committed
      in the course for betrayal of the motherland.
      (3) When murder of a member of a Scheduled
      Caste or minority community etc., is committed
      not for personal reasons but in circumstances
      which arouse social wrath, or in cases of 'bride
      burning' or 'dowry deaths' or when murder is
      committed in order to remarry for the sake of
      extracting dowry once again or to marry another
      woman on account of infatuation.
      (4) When the crime is enormous in proportion.
      For instance when multiple murders, say of all or
      almost all the members of a family or a large
      number of persons of a particular caste,
      community, or locality, are committed.

       child, or a helpless woman or old or infirm person
       or a person vis-à-vis whom the murderer is in a

opinion that the questions (a) and (b) posed above deserve

falls under the category of 'rarest of rare cases' warranting
death sentence and not even life imprisonment for the rest
of appellant's life. The death reference is, accordingly,
accepted.
