<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                           Page 4 of 44</span>

</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 5 of 44</span>
<p id="p_12"> 10. It is stated that the Plaintiff also filed 23 applications under <a href="/doc/601001/" id="a_2">Section

</p>
<p id="p_13">11. It is stated in para 14 of the plaint that on 13th June 2012, the
Defendant No. 3 through Defendant No. 26, filed a private complaint
against the Plaintiff before the 1st Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Bangalore, under the provisions of <a href="/doc/273571/" id="a_3">Sections 65</a>, <a href="/doc/326206/" id="a_4">66</a> and <a href="/doc/118912881/" id="a_5">66-C</a>
of the Information Technology Act, 2005 ('<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">IT Act</a>') read with <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_7">Section
120(B)</a>, <a href="/doc/1185693/" id="a_8">511</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_9">411</a> of the Indian Penal Code ('<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>') alleging 'stolen
information' and 'illegal hacking'. In two petitions filed by the Plaintiff
seeking quashing of the criminal case, the Karnataka High Court has
passed ex parte interim order staying the proceedings. The Plaintiff on
14th August 2012 is stated to have published a trademark caution notice
in all editions of 'The Economic Times', 'The Hindu' and 'Dainik
Bhaskar'. It is stated that the Defendants had created and were operating
a website at www.bloombergrealty.in. The Plaintiff also found the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 6 of 44</span>
 websites, www.bloombergentertainment.com claiming and advertising
the Defendants' involvement in the entertainment and media industries,
and www.bloomberginfotech.com offering webmail services under the
name 'bloomail'. Dated screen shots of relevant web pages have also
been enclosed with the plaint.
</p>

<p id="p_14">12. The case of the Plaintiff is that Defendants have tried to
misappropriate the BLOOMBERG mark in USA and other jurisdictions.
Some time towards the end of July 2012, the Plaintiff learnt that
Bloomberg Realty (India) Private Limited was advertising and
promoting itself in USA, under the guise of sponsoring a conference to
be hosted by the NGI Foundation in New York in September 2012. The
Defendant No. 4 used slogans such as 'Think Big Think Bloomberg'
and freely referred to itself as part of the 'Bloomberg Group'. The
Plaintiff filed a trademark infringement and cyber squatting suit against
Defendant No. 3 Bloomberg Realty (India) Private Limited et al in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York and
obtained a temporary restraining order.
</p>

<p id="p_15">13. The immediate provocation for filing the present suit is that
Defendant No. 1 through Defendant No. 5, Bloomberg Entertainment
Private Limited, associated himself with a Hindi film 'Deewana Mein
Deewana' on 28th September 2012. It is stated that the association of the
Defendants with cinema and digital media would be detrimental to the
Plaintiff's reputation and goodwill and a film released under the banner


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                     Page 7 of 44</span>
 of a 'Bloomberg' company is bound to mislead the public, giving the
false impression that the Plaintiff is involved in the said film.
</p>

<p id="p_16">14. The Plaintiff states that although the Defendants have openly stated
on their websites and elsewhere that they aim "to be one of the global
business conglomerates" and have in various proceedings claimed a net
worth of one billion dollars, the paid up capital of the Defendant
companies was not commensurate with such claims. A majority of the
Defendant companies have not conducted any real business. The
Plaintiff further states that the Defendants are trying to unfairly
capitalize on the strength and value of the BLOOMBERG mark for their
own financial gain. The Defendants have used the Plaintiff's registered
trademark as their trade name without the authority or consent from the
Plaintiff. It is stated that 'BLOOMBERG' has no meaning other than to
identify Michael R. Bloomberg and his former company. There is no
acceptable explanation put forward by the Defendants for adopting
'Bloomberg' as part of their business name.
</p>

<p id="p_17">15. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendants' use of the impugned
mark/name is aimed at diverting the business of the Plaintiff and is
irreparably damaging the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff by
tarnishing the trademark 'BLOOMBERG'. It is stated that any entity
using the BLOOMBERG trademarks and brand of the Plaintiff without
authorization is bound to confuse and mislead the investors and public.
The Defendants have slavishly adopted the trademark/corporate name of
the Plaintiff and have created 23 paper companies. The Defendants'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 8 of 44</span>
 intention is to disrupt the trademark rights of the Plaintiff and reap
illegal benefits from the Plaintiff's well known BLOOMBERG
trademark and name.
</p>

<p id="p_18">16. It was in the above circumstances, the present suit was filed seeking
inter alia to restrain the Defendants from using the trade mark which is
identical or deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's well known mark
'BLOOMBERG' and which may cause infringement of the Plaintiff's
trademark 'BLOOMBERG', which may constitute passing off their
goods and services of the Defendants as that of the Plaintiff which may
cause dilution of the trademark 'BLOOMBERG' and other damages in
the sum of Rs. 1 crore.
</p>

<p id="p_19">Interim Order in the suit
</p><p id="p_20">17. On 27th September 2012, Defendant Nos. 1 to 36 appeared through
counsel and in their presence the following order was passed by the
Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "There is appearance on behalf of Defendant No. 1 as well

         'DEEWANA MAIN DEEWANA'. The Defendants are
         restrained till further orders, from getting any new company
         registered if the word 'BLOOMBERG' forms a part of the
         name of that company. No new domain name will be got

         forms a part of domain name.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">The averments in the written statement
</p><p id="p_22">18. In the written statement filed by Defendants, it is stated that
Defendant No. 3, which was initially incorporated on 12th January 2006
as 'Smart Developers Pvt. Ltd.' along with its subsidiaries including
Defendant Nos. 4 to 25 are conducting business activities in the fields of
"real estate, housing, infrastructure and logistics, airways, reality
hospitals, cements, foods and beverages, hotels, housing infrastructure
and logistics, oil and gas, power and steel, solar venture, entertainment
and movie productions etc." It is claimed that the promoters have
expended approximately Rs. 100 crore to set up the legal entities and
conduct business in various fields in India. It is stated that the projected
growth of Defendant No. 3 and its subsidiaries is estimated at around
USD 20 billion in the next five years.
</p>

<p id="p_23">19. It is further stated that in 2010, Defendant No. 3 started a brand
building exercise. It is claimed that "most of their building projects
including their promoters were named after the names of flowers and
stood tall as the bills and mountains and the promoters of the Defendant
companies conceived, coined and adopted the distinctive mark

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 10 of 44</span>
 "BLOOMBERG along with an artistic work/label/device depicting a
'flower in bloom' of which the 'flower in bloom' forms leading and
essential feature for and in respect of various goods and/or services with
a view to distinguish it from others. The 'flower in bloom' is an
imaginary depiction in a flower in bloom and does not have any
reference to any quality, character or strength of the goods/services."
</p>

<p id="p_24">20. It is claimed in para 4 of the written statement that the Defendants'
adoption of the mark/word/expression 'Bloomberg' "is honest and in
good faith after combining the English word 'Bloom', which means to
produce flowers and the word Berg which means mountains. Defendants
states that the word BLOOMBERG is a word of Jewish and/or German
and/or Scandinavian origin which means 'flower hills' or 'mountains of
flowers' and/or a common surname in western world." Accordingly,
Defendant No. 3 states that with a view to enhance prominence/
distinctiveness to its trade mark and/or trade name 'Bloomberg',
Defendant No. 3 "has created an artistic work label/device depicting a
'flower in bloom' and along with the letters/word Bloomberg, it forms a
leading and essential feature of their trade mark. Thus, Defendant No. 3
is the owner, proprietor of the trade mark consisting of the
mark/logo/label having word/expression/mark 'Bloomberg' and an
imaginary depiction of 'flower in bloom' as its leading and essential
feature."
</p>

<p id="p_25">21. In para 8 it is stated that Defendant No. 3 has changed its name from
'Smart Developers Pvt. Ltd.' to 'Bloomberg Developers Pvt. Ltd' in or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 11 of 44</span>
 about August 2011 and the Registrar of Companies ('ROC') is stated to
have issued the fresh certificate of incorporation on 24th August 2011. It
is stated that in the action initiated by the Plaintiff under Section 22 CA
for change the name of Defendant No. 3, the RD has passed an ex parte
order dated 3rd October 2012 directing Defendant No. 3 to change its
trade name. The said decision has been challenged by Defendant No. 3
before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore in Writ Petition No.
11184 of 2012 which is stated to be pending.
</p>
<p id="p_26">22. The details of the applications made by Defendants for registration
of the trademark in Class 43 and the grant of registration is set out in
para 9 of the written statement. It is stated that the registration was
granted after expiry of the statutory deadline for filing opposition
proceedings by any third parties. Consequently, it is contended that the
Plaintiff or any other registered proprietor of the identical and/or
deceptively similar trademark are not entitled to file any suit for
infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_27">23. According to the Defendants, the Plaintiff is not the registered
proprietor or subsequent registered proprietor of the trade mark
'BLOOMBERG' under the TM Act, 1999. According to the Plaintiff, as
well as based on the online records of the TM Registry, 'Bloomberg LP'
is the registered proprietor of the trademark 'Bloomberg' in Classes 9,
16, 35, 36, 38, 41 and 42. It is contended that the suit filed by the
Plaintiff is not maintainable. It is stated that the Defendants are initiating
rectification proceedings before the Intellectual Property Appellate


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                         Page 12 of 44</span>
 Board ('IPAB') against the registration granted for the trademark
'BLOOMBERG' in favour of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24. The Defendants claim that the Plaintiff has suppressed material facts
regarding the application filed by it for registration of trademark; the
Plaintiff has failed miserably to define the exact cause of action against
the Defendants; that on the date of institution of the present suit, the said
trade mark of Defendant No. 3 was distinctive and the same had
acquired reputation and goodwill in relation to service of goods for
which it was registered and was being used by the Defendants; that the
Plaintiff does not have exclusive rights under the TM Act 1999 in India
against the Defendants; that the trade mark 'BLOOMBERG' of the
Plaintiff was not common in India; that the Plaintiff is not a legal entity
registered in India; that the business activities of the Plaintiff are
confined to commercial activities relating to financial news and
information; the business activities, goods and/or services for which the
marks are used by the Plaintiff and the Defendants are different and not
related to each other's field of activities; that the Defendants are prior
users of the said mark 'BLOOMBERG;               that the use of the said
trademark is bonafide and honest; that the Defendants have incurred
huge expenditure for advertisement and marketing in relation to their
various business activities under the said trademark and they are entitled
to use the said mark during the course of their trade in India.
</p>
<p id="p_29">Averments in the replication
</p><p id="p_30">25. In the replication filed by the Plaintiff, the averments of the plaint
have been reiterated. It is contended that explanation given by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 13 of 44</span>
 Defendants for adopting the mark 'BLOOMBERG' was "dishonest,
fantastic and highly imaginative tale and exposed the fact that the
Defendants       have     nexus   with   the   adopting   of    the      word
'BLOOMBERG'". It is submitted that the trade mark 'BLOOMBERG'
is the personal name of Mr. Michael R. Bloomberg, but the Defendants
do not have any surname after BLOOMBERG nor does the word
BLOOMBERG find any mention in the dictionary and therefore, they
had to stretch their imagination to find a combination of the Jewish
word 'Berg' with the English word 'Bloom' in order to arrive at the
mark 'BLOOMBEG'. It is pointed out by the Plaintiff that the writ
petition filed by the Defendants challenging the order of the RD (NWR)
in the proceedings initiated by the Plaintiff under Section 22 CA had
been dismissed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore. The
other averments in the plaint have been reiterated in the replication.
</p>
<p id="p_31">Submissions of counsel
</p><p id="p_32">26. During the course of the submissions, Mr. Sudhir Chandra Agarwal,
learned Senior counsel for the Defendants, submitted that since the
Plaintiff's business was confined to television broadcast, financial
news/data and the Defendants were in the business of real estate and
construction since 2011, the Defendants are prepared to give an
undertaking that they would not enter into either the movie business or
TV news or financial data; that they would use 'BLOOMBERG' as part
of the trade name/mark only for the real estate business; that the
Defendants will give up all other corporate names that have been
registered using the word 'BLOOMBERG' and that the Defendants will

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 14 of 44</span>
 issue a disclaimer that they not are associated in any way with the
Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_33">27. Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned counsel for the Plaintiff submitted, on
instructions, that the Defendants continuing the use the word
'BLOOMBERG' for their real estate business would adversely affect
the reputation and the distinctive character of the registered mark of the
Plaintiff. Mr. Sibal referred to certain documents filed by the Plaintiff
which showed that the adverse publicity attracted by the Defendants
activities in the construction industry was tarnishing the goodwill
attached to the Plaintiff's mark. Referring to <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_11">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM
Act, 1999 Mr. Sibal pointed out that the said provision was enacted
precisely to deal with the situation at hand. Mr. Sibal referred to the
statutory provisions and decisions, which will be discussed presently,
and reiterated the case of the Plaintiff as found in the pleadings and
urged that the interim injunction as prayed for should be granted in
favour of the Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_34">28. Mr. Sudhir Chandra Agarwal, contended that the present dispute
was essentially about the adoption of the mark BLOOMBERG as part of
the corporate name of the Defendants group of companies. According to
him, <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_12">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act, 1999 was exhaustive of the issue and
if the Plaintiff was not able to make out a case under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_13">Section 29</a> (5) of
TM Act, 1999 then clearly it was not entitled to any interim injunction.
Reliance was placed by Mr. Agarwal on the decision of the Division
Bench of the High Court of Bombay in <a href="/doc/1191568/" id="a_14">Raymond Limited v. Raymond
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 15 of 44</span>

Products Sa</a> 2010 (42) PTC 572 (Del).
</p>
<p id="p_35">29. Before proceeding to discuss the above contentions this Court
proposes to briefly recapitulate the factual position. The Plaintiff is the
assignee of the registered trademark 'BLOOMBERG' in Classes 9,16,
35, 36,38, 41 and 42 but not Class 43 which relates to construction and
real estate. The Plaintiff's application for recordal of the assignment of
the registered mark, is pending with the TM Registry. The application
by the Plaintiff for cancellation of the registration of the mark
'BLOOMBERG' in Class 43 in favour of Defendant No. 3 is pending.
The interim order passed by this Court on 27th September 2012
restrained Defendant No. 5 from using the name 'BLOOMBERG' in
any manner while releasing the movie 'Deewana Mein Deewana' and
the Defendants from getting any new company registered with the word
'BLOOMBERG' forming part of the name and from getting a new
domain name registered using the word 'BLOOMBERG' as part of the
domain name.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Analysis of the statutory provisions
</p><p id="p_37">30. It is settled law that an applicant for recordal of assignment of a
registered mark in its favour can, pending such application being
granted, assert all rights of the registered proprietor [<a href="/doc/701176/" id="a_16">See Modi Threads
v. Som Soot Gola Factory</a> AIR 1992 Del 4 and <a href="/doc/152682715/" id="a_17">Sun Pharmaceuticals
Ltd. v. Cipla Ltd</a>. 2009 (34) PTC 347 (Del)]. However, the suit present
is both for an injunction against infringement as also against passing off.

<p id="p_38"> Therefore the Court first proposes to deal with the issue of infringement
and thereafter passing off.

<p id="p_39">31. As regards infringement, Section 29 of the TM Act 1999 sets out the
different situations in which infringement of a registered mark can
result. Section 29 of the TM Act 1999 reads as under:

<p id="p_40">32. Section 29 of the TM Act contemplates the owner/proprietor of the
registered trade mark alleging infringement of the said mark by another
person who is neither a registered proprietor in relation to the goods and
services for which the mark is registered, nor has permission to use such
mark in the course of his trade. Under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_18">Section 29</a> (1) infringement
results if the mark is "identical with or deceptively similar to" the
registered trade mark and is in relation to the goods and services for
which the trademark has been registered. The use of infringing or
impugned mark must render it "likely to be taken as being used as a
trade mark".
</p>

<p id="p_41">33. Under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> (2) (a) infringement occurs where the impugned
mark is identical with the registered trademark and the goods or service
for which the impugned mark is being used is similar to the goods and
services covered by the registered mark. Under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_20">Section 29</a> (2) (b)
infringement occurs where the impugned mark is similar to the
registered mark and the goods and the services for which is used is
identical with or similar to the goods and services for which the
registered mark is used. Under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> (2) (c) infringement occurs
where the impugned trade mark is identical to the registered trade mark
and the goods or services for which the impugned mark is used is also
identical to the goods/services covered by the registered trade mark.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 20 of 44</span>
<p id="p_42"> 34. An additional requirement in the above three situations for
infringement to result is that the use of the impugned trademark "is
likely to cause confusion on the part of the public" or "is likely to have
an association with the registered trade mark". Under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_22">Section 29</a> (3)
when the impugned trademark is identical to the registered trademark
and the goods/services for which it is used are also identical to the
goods or services for which the registration has been granted then "the
Court shall presume that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the
public".
</p>

<p id="p_43">35. Therefore, under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_23">Section 29</a> (1), (2) and (3) for infringement to
result (i) the impugned mark has to be either similar to or identical with
the registered mark and (ii) the goods or services for which the
impugned mark is sued has to also either be identical with or similar to
the goods or services for which registration has been granted. The
scenario is different as regards <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_24">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM Act 1999. For
infringement to result under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_25">Section 29</a> (4), the following conditions are
required to be fulfilled:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">         (i) the person using the impugned mark is neither a registered
         proprietor in relation to the goods and services for which the
         mark is registered nor is using it by way of permitted use
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">         (ii) the impugned mark must be used in the course of trade

         with the registered mark

         from those for which registration has been granted;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 21 of 44</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">          (iv) the registered trade mark has a reputation in India;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">         (iv) the use of the impugned mark is without due cause, and
         takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                 (a) the distinctive character of the registered trade mark;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                     or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                 (b) the reputation of the registered trade mark.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">36. The expression 'mark' has been defined in <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_26">Section 2</a> (m) of the TM
Act to include "a device brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature,
word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of
colours or any combination thereof." (emphasis supplied) Therefore,
for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_27">Section 29</a> (4), the use of a mark as part of a corporate
name would also attract infringement. In other words, if the registered
mark is used by a person, who is not the registered proprietor of such
mark or a permitted user, as part of the corporate name under which he
trades then also infringement would also result. What is however
important is that the registered trade mark must be shown to have a
reputation in India and should be shown to have been used by the
infringer 'without due cause". Further, it should be shown that such
adoption or use has resulted in the infringer taking unfair advantage of
the registered mark or is detrimental to the distinctive character or
repute of the registered trade mark.
</p>

<p id="p_45">37. <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_28">Section 29</a> (4) is also distinct from <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_29">Section 29</a> (1) to (3) of the TM
Act in another important aspect. The element of having to demonstrate
the likelihood of confusion is absent. Perhaps to balance out this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                         Page 22 of 44</span>
 element, the legislature has mandated the necessity of showing that (a)
the mark has a reputation in India (b) that the mark has a distinctive
character (c) the use by the infringer is without due cause. In other
words, the legislative intent is to afford a stronger protection to a mark
that has a reputation without the registered proprietor of such mark
having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion arising from the use
of an identical or similar mark in relation to dissimilar goods and
services. The words 'detriment' in the context of the 'distinctive
character' of the mark brings in the concept of 'dilution' and 'blurring'.
In the context of 'repute' they are also relatable to the concept of
'tarnishment' and 'degradation'. The words "takes 'unfair advantage"
refers to 'free-riding' on the goodwill attached to mark which enjoys a
reputation. The disjunctive 'or' between the words 'distinctive
character' and 'repute' is designedly inserted to cater to a situation
where a mark may not have a distinctive character and yet may have a
reputation.
</p>

<p id="p_46">38. <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_30">Section 2</a> (zg) of the TM Act defines a 'well known trade mark' in
relation to any goods or services to mean 'a mark which has become so
to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or
receives such services that the use of such mark in relation to other
goods or service would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection
in the course of trade or rendering of services between those goods or
services and a person using the mark in relation to the first- mentioned
goods or services.' Under <a href="/doc/375524/" id="a_31">Section 11</a> (9) (i) and (v), for the purposes of
registration of a well-known mark it is not necessary for such mark to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 23 of 44</span>
 have been used in India or be well-known to the public at large in India.
It must be well known t a substantial segment of the relevant public.
</p>

<p id="p_47">39. It may not be necessary for the proprietor of a registered mark to
show that it is a 'well-known trademark' as defined in <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_32">Section 2</a> (zg)
although if in fact it is, it makes it easier to satisfy the 'reputation'
requirement of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_33">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM Act. The presumption of
distinctiveness attached to a registered mark is a rebuttable one. At the
interim stage, either of these elements should be shown prima facie to
exist. Whether in fact these elements are satisfied would depend on the
evidence led by the parties at trial.
</p>

<p id="p_48">40. It may be noticed at this stage that even prior to the TM Act 1999
the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_34">N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a> 1996
PTC (16) recognised the concept of cross-border reputation when it
upheld the decision of the Division Bench of this Court which granted a
temporary injunction in favour of a Plaintiff based abroad. The Division
Bench of this Court followed the decision in <a href="/doc/1607318/" id="a_35">Apple Computer Inc. vs.
Apple Leasing &amp; Industries</a> 1992 (1) Arbitration Law Reporter 93,
and held that it was not necessary to insist that a particular plaintiff must
carry on business in a jurisdiction before improper use of its name or
mark can be restrained by the court. The main consideration was "the
likelihood of confusion and consequential injury to the plaintiff and the
need to protect the public from deception. Where such confusion is
prima facie shown to exist, protection should be given by courts to the
name or mark".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                        Page 24 of 44</span>
<p id="p_49"> 41. Turning to <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_36">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act 1999, it is seen that it
relates to a situation where (i) the infringer uses the registered trademark
"as his trade name or part of his trade name, or name of his business
concern or part of the name, of his business concern" and (ii) the
business concern or trade is in the same goods or services in respect of
which the trade mark is registered. If the owner/proprietor of the
registered trade mark is able to show that both the above elements exist
then an injunction restraining order the infringer should straightway
follow. This is in the nature of a per se or a 'no-fault' provision which
offers a higher degree of protection where both the above elements are
shown to exist. For the purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_37">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act 1999,
there is no requirement to show that the mark has a distinctive character
or that any confusion is likely to result from the use by the infringer of
the registered mark as part of its trade name or name of the business
concern.
</p>

<p id="p_50">42. However, in a situation where the first element is present and not the
second then obviously the requirement of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_38">Section 29</a> (5) is not fulfilled.
The question is whether in such a situation the owner or proprietor of
the registered trade mark is precluded from seeking a remedy under
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_39">Section 29</a> (4) of TM Act, 1999 if the conditions attached to <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_40">Section 29</a>
(4) are fulfilled.
</p>

<p id="p_51">43. In the considered view of this Court, given the object and purpose of
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_41">Section 29</a> (1) to (4), <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_42">Section 29</a> (5) cannot be intended to be exhaustive
of all situations of uses of the registered mark as part of the corporate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 25 of 44</span>
 name. <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_43">Section 29</a> (5) cannot be said to render <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_44">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM
Act, 1999 otiose. In other words, the legislature may not be said to have
intended not to provide a remedy where the registered trade mark is
used as part of the corporate name but the business of the infringer is in
goods or services other than those for which the mark is registered.
</p>
<p id="p_52">44. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the TM Act 1999 explain
that sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_45">Section 29</a> "seeks to prevent a person from
adopting someone else's trade mark as part of that person's trade name
or business name by explicitly providing that such action shall also
constitute an infringement under this Act. This provision will bring this
clause in harmony with the proposed amendments to <a href="/doc/1673226/" id="a_46">Sections 20</a> and <a href="/doc/601001/" id="a_47">22</a>
of the Companies Act, 1956." Sections 20 and 22 of the CA have been
amended to provide that where the name of a company resembles a
registered trade mark, then the registration of the company in that name
can be refused. The ROC is expected to gather information from the TM
Registry. Under <a href="/doc/1864010/" id="a_48">Section 22</a> (5) of the CA, the owner of the registered
trade mark can apply to have the name of a company that is purportedly
infringing the mark cancelled. All of this only strengthens the
conclusion that where <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_49">Section 29</a> (5) offers a high degree of protection
where both the elements envisaged in that provision exist, it is not
meant to preclude the owner of a registered mark remediless when only
the first and not the second element exists.
</p>
<p id="p_53">The decision in Raymond Ltd.
</p><p id="p_54">45.1 In this context it is necessary to discuss at some length the
judgment of the Bombay High Court in Raymond Limited on which

had a registration for the word 'Raymond' written in stylized manner
and registered under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_51">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 ('CA 1957'). RPPL
contended that 'Raymond' was a common word and that the business
and product of RL and RPPL are totally different.
</p>
<p id="p_55">45.2 After the learned Single Judge refused the injunction, RL appealed
to the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court which noted that
under the TMM Act, 1958 there was no provision corresponding to
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_52">Section 29</a> (5) of TM Act, 1999. After analysing the provisions it
concluded:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">         "It is clear that <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_53">Section 29</a> deals with different
         situations when an act on the part of the Defendant
         would amount to infringement of the registered trade
         mark. A registered trade mark can be adopted by a
         Defendant as its trade name in two situations, (i) when
         the Defendant is dealing in the goods in respect of
         which the trademark is registered and (ii) when the
         Defendant is not dealing in the goods in respect of
         which the trade mark is registered. The Legislature
         obviously was aware of this situation, still the
         Legislature provided that only when the Defendant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 27 of 44</span>
          adopts the registered trade mark as a part of its trade
         name, and deals in goods in respect of which the trade
         mark is registered, then only it will amount to
         infringement. In other words, by necessary implication
         it is laid down that if the Defendant adopts the
         Plaintiff's trade mark as his trade name, but is not
         dealing in the goods in respect of which the Plaintiff's
         trade mark is registered, then it does not amount to
         infringement."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">45.3 The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court proceeded to hold
that in a situation where the registered mark is used as part of the
corporate name by the infringer who deals in goods or services different
from those for which the mark is registered, if a remedy is provided
under <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_54">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM Act 1999 then <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_55">Section 29</a> (5) would be
rendered otiose.
</p>
<p id="p_57">45.4 In coming to the above conclusion the Bombay High Court had no
occasion to consider an important point of distinction between <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_56">Sections
29</a> (1) to (4) and <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_57">Section 29</a> (5). The latter does not require the
registered proprietor to show that any confusion is likely to result from
the use by the infringer of the registered mark as part of its trade name
or name of the business concern or that the mark has a distinctive
character or that any detriment is likely to be caused to the reputation of
the mark or that the infringer has taken unfair advantage of the mark.
These distinctions make it clear that the purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_58">Section 29</a> (5) of the
TM Act, 1999 was to offer a better protection and not to shut the door of
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_59">Section 29</a> (4) to a registered proprietor who is able to show that the
registered mark enjoying a reputation in India has been used by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 28 of 44</span>
 infringer as part of his corporate name but his business is in goods and
services other than that for which the mark has been registered. In this
way it is possible to harmonise the various sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_60">Section 29</a>
with none of them being rendered otiose.
</p>
<p id="p_58">45.5. A factor that perhaps weighed with the Division Bench in
Raymond Limited was that RPPL were using 'Raymond' as a part of
their corporate name since 1983 whereas the suit was filed in 2006.
Also, it appears that the Court was not called upon to examine whether
the registered mark enjoyed a reputation or whether it had a distinctive
character. For the above reasons, the decision in Raymond Limited
cannot be said to be conclusive of the interpretation to be placed on
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_61">Section 29</a> (5) read with <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_62">Section 29</a> (4) of the TM Act 1999.

the Defendants the one in <a href="/doc/137102954/" id="a_63">ITC Limited v. Philip Morris Products Sa.
The</a> facts were that ITC had launched its hotel business in 1975 and was
since then using the 'WELCOMGROUP' logo. ITC alleged that the
Defendant Philip Morris Products Sa, had been manufacturing and
dealing in tobacco/cigarette by using the 'Marlboro' logo which was
identical or similar to ITC's NAMASTE 'WELCOMGROUP'
mark/logo. Philip Morris contended that registration of the Namaste
logo did not confer any exclusive right in favour of ITC "since the logo
as a stand-alone ingredient of the overall trademark is unregistered". It
pointed out that ITC used the W-NAMASTE logo only for the hotels run
by it under the banner of "WELCOMGROUP". ITC used different logos

 for the hotels run by it under the banners Sheraton, Fortune and
'Welcomeheritage.' Philip Morris argued that their "Roof" device logo
had been used not only for the limited edition festive packs but also for
marketing their products on different occasions.

<p id="p_61">46.2 In the above background, the Court discussed <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_64">Section 29</a> (4) in the
context of 'dilution' and observed:

         envisions. <a href="/doc/1427492/" id="a_66">Section 29(1)</a> - which talks of trademark

         deals with trademark infringement) enacts that the

<p id="p_62">46.3 It was further pointed out "the need to establish 'linkage' or mental
association of the offending mark, with that of the Plaintiff's is one of
the vital essentials for securing relief in any claim for dilution." On the
facts of the case it was concluded that "the two trademarks are neither
identical, nor similar to each other" and that Defendants mark "is quite
different, and has its own artistic elements." Secondly it was held that
the Plaintiffs' W-NAMASTE logo was connected mainly with hotels,
resorts, restaurants and the hospitality sector generally and that "there is
nothing suggestive that such association extends to mid to high priced
cigarette." Thirdly, it was found that the Plaintiffs‟ mark is not a "stand

 alone" mark; it was used with the words WELCOMGROUP, or the
name of the resort or service. Moreover, it was part of the overall marks
and devices in relation to each hotel, restaurant, resort or service it
offers, to the consumer. In the above context, it was held that "there is
no evidence to show how the W-NAMASTE logo is likely to be
affected prejudicially, or that the Defendants' use of their mark would
result in detriment to the Plaintiff's mark."

<p id="p_63">47. The ratio of the decision in ITC Limited, relevant to the instant case
is <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_77">Section 29</a> (4) offers "a wider trademark protection without the
concomitant likelihood of confusion requirement, as it is in respect of
dissimilar or unrelated products and services." The said decision had no
occasion to discuss the interplay between <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_78">Section 29</a> (5) and <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_79">Section 29</a>
(4) or whether the former is exhaustive of all situations of use of the

companies enlisted by the Plaintiffs. The Supreme Court held that by
using the Plaintiff's trademark as a part of its corporate name, the

</p>
<p id="p_66">49. In Kalpataru Properties Private Limited v. Kalpataru Hospitality &amp;

whether an action in passing off was maintainable where the Plaintiff's

the goods and services dealt with by the parties were in different classes.
Following Mahendra and Mahendra, the Court held that a passing off
action was maintainable in the case of a well known mark even if the
goods and services being dealt with by the parties are not similar.

<p id="p_67">50. Recently, in <a href="/doc/11177938/" id="a_81">Red Hat Inc. v. Mr. Hemant Gupta</a> 2013 1 AD (Delhi)
130, this Court, while dealing with a case which involved the use of a
registered trademark as part of its corporate name by the Defendant,
held that the Plaintiff could seek a remedy for an infringement under
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_82">Section 29</a> (4) as well as <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_83">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_68">51. The legal position emerging as a result of the above discussion may
be summarised as under:
</p><p id="p_69">(a) <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_84">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act 1999 relates to a situation where (i) the
infringer uses the registered trademark "as his trade name or part of his
trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of his


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 33 of 44</span>
 business concern" and (ii) the business concern or trade is in the same
goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
</p>
<p id="p_70">(b) This is in the nature of a per se or a 'no-fault' provision which offers
a higher degree of protection where both the above elements are shown
to exist. If the owner/proprietor of the registered trade mark is able to
show that both the above elements exist then an injunction order
restraining order the infringer should straightway follow. For the
purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_85">Section 29</a> (5) of the TM Act 1999 there is no requirement to
show that the mark has a distinctive character or that any confusion is
likely to result from the use by the infringer of the registered mark as
part of its trade name or name of the business concern.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(c) However, in a situation where the first element is present and not
the second then obviously the requirement of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_86">Section 29</a> (5) is not
fulfilled. Where the registered trade mark is used as part of the corporate
name but the business of the infringer is in goods or services other than
those for which the mark is registered, the owner or proprietor of the
registered trade mark is not precluded from seeking a remedy under
<a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_87">Section 29</a> (4) of TM Act 1999 if the conditions attached to <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_88">Section 29</a>
(4) are fulfilled.
</p>
<p id="p_72">(d) Given the object and purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_89">Section 29</a> (1) to (4), <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_90">Section 29</a> (5)
cannot be intended to be exhaustive of all situations of uses of the
registered mark as part of the corporate name. <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_91">Section 29</a> (5) cannot be
said to render <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_92">Section 29</a> (4) otiose. The purpose of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_93">Section 29</a> (5) was

 registered proprietor who is able to show that the registered mark
enjoying a reputation in India has been used by the infringer as part of
his corporate name but his business is in goods and services other than
that for which the mark has been registered.

<p id="p_73">(e) A passing off action is maintainable in the case of a well known
mark even if the goods and services being dealt with by the parties are
not similar.
</p>
<p id="p_74">Prima facie case of infringement
</p><p id="p_75">52. The pleadings in the present case show that the use by Defendants of
the word 'BLOOMBERG' commenced sometime in 2011. Earlier
Defendants 1 and 2 had in 2006 formed a company by a different name
Smart Developers Private Ltd. and all of a sudden in 2011 changed it to
Bloomberg Developers Private Ltd. It is only in August 2012 it obtained
registration of the mark Bloomberg in Class 43 in relation to "services
for providing food and drink; temporary accommodation'. This was
after a cease and desist notice was issued by the Plaintiffs to the
Defendants on 20th January 2012. On the other had the Plaintiff has
shown that Bloomberg UTV, a 24 hour English channel, was launched
in India in 2008. In April 2004 the mark 'BLOOMBERG' was
identified by the Trademark World magazine to be the 19th most well-
known mark in the world. Therefore, prima facie it cannot be said that
the Defendants have been using the mark 'BLOOMBERG' for a long
time and in any event not prior to the Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_76">53. There is material to show that the Plaintiff's name was inspired by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                    Page 35 of 44</span>
 the founder Mr. Michael R. Bloomberg. The documents brought on
record show that 'BLOOMBERG' is well known brand name; the sales
figures of the Plaintiff Group of Bloomberg companies show that they
have a wide range of operations all over the world of which the key
area is providing financial services/data and information. The
broadcasting of the Plaintiff's 24 hour English Bloomberg TV channel
in India since 2008 is an important factor for determining the question
whether it has a presence and reputation in India. Television channels
do offer a high degree of visibility and recognition. There is material to
show prima facie that the Plaintiff's mark is well-known and that it has
both a trans-border reputation as well as a reputation in India. This
aspect will no doubt have to be examined at depth after the trial is
concluded.
</p>
<p id="p_77">54. The explanation offered by the Defendants for adopting
BLOOMBERG as part of the corporate name of their companies is
prima facie not convincing at all. On the one hand the Defendants have
themselves applied for and obtained registration for the said mark and
therefore cannot doubt it distinctiveness. On the other hand, they appear
to suggest that they independently thought of the said mark for their
building     and     construction   business   when   in   fact     the    name
BLOOMBERG can hardly be said to be a common name in India. It is
difficult to accept the case of the Defendants at this stage that their
adoption of the name BLOOMBERG was honest.
</p>
<p id="p_78">55. The fact that within a short span of time the Defendants went on a
spree of registration of companies using BLOOMBERG as part of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                           Page 36 of 44</span>
 corporate name shows that they were trying to encash on the goodwill
and reputation attached that mark. The case of the Plaintiff is that the
name BLOOMBERG adopted for the Plaintiff's corporate group has its
origins in the name of its founder who, from humble beginnings in the
U.S.A, went on to build a large corporate empire with a worldwide
presence. The submission that the tagline 'Think Big, Think
Bloomberg', adopted by the Defendants, evokes that history of the name
is indeed plausible. It does indicate that the Defendants were projecting
themselves as a large conglomerate when prima facie it appears that
many of the Defendant companies were not doing any substantial
business. By projecting that they are a fast growing corporate group
aiming at a turnover of 20 billion dollars in the next five years, the
Defendants appear prima facie to be taking unfair advantage of the
registered mark of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_79">56. The Defendants' adoption of BLOOMBERG as part of the corporate
name in the construction and building industry is also reflective of a
trend where adoption of fancy western names for products and services
offered in that industry is believed to offer a greater attractiveness to
investors. Prima facie there is merit in the Plaintiff's contention that the
name BLOOMBERG can possibly offer a sense of reassurance and
dependability as regards quality of products and services.
</p>
<p id="p_80">57. For a mark that is distinctive and well known worldwide to be
associated with the construction or real estate industry can prima facie
be detrimental to its distinctive character and lead to dilution. As regards
harming the reputation attached to the registered mark, the Plaintiff has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 37 of 44</span>
 placed on record documents that prima facie show that the Defendants
activities have attracted negative publicity. To what extent this has
resulted in tarnishment of the Plaintiff's mark will have to await the
conclusion of the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_81">58. While the Defendants may hold registration for the mark
BLOOMBERG in Class 43, that by itself will not preclude the Plaintiff,
which holds an earlier registration in other classes from seeking to
restrain the Defendants from infringing the Plaintiff's marks. While the
case of the Plaintiff that the registration obtained by the Defendants is of
doubtful validity will require a detailed examination, the manner of the
Defendant obtaining such registration after a cease and desist notice was
issued to it lends prima facie merit to the contention of the Plaintiff. In
support of such submission the Plaintiff has in its written submissions
referred to the decision of the Single Judge in <a href="/doc/99626708/" id="a_95">Clinique Laboratories v.
Gufic Ltd</a>. 2009 (41) PTC 41 (Del) as well as the decision in <a href="/doc/18135822/" id="a_96">Gufic Ltd.
v. Clinique Laboratories</a> 2010 (43) PTC 788 (Del) which did not
interfere with the decision under appeal to the extent it held that where
the Court is prima facie of the view that the registration of the
Defendant was invalid an interim injunction restraining infringement
could be granted.
</p>

<p id="p_82">59. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that the
elements of <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_97">Section 29</a> (4) have prima facie been established and that
the Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of an interim



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                       Page 38 of 44</span>
 injunction restraining the Defendants from infringing the registered
mark of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_83">Passing Off
</p><p id="p_84">60. Independent of the above, the Plaintiff's case of passing off has to
be considered. For this, the test that has to be adopted has been
explained in a large number of decisions. Illustratively, reference may
be made to the decisions in Cadila Health Care v. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals 2001 21 PTC 300 (<a href="/doc/981498/" id="a_98">SC), M/s Smithkine Beecham Pc.
v. M/s Hindustan Lever Limited</a> 2000 PTC 83 and N.R.Dongre v.
Whirlpool Corprn 1996 PTC (16). It has to be prima facie shown by the
Plaintiff that the Defendants have, by adopting BLOOMBERG as part
of their corporate name, deceived the public into thinking that the
services and products offered by the Defendants are that of the Plaintiff
or have originated from or are associated with the Plaintiff and that the
adoption of the impugned mark by the Defendants is likely to create
confusion in the minds of the public that the Defendants are associated
with the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_85">61. Some of the prima facie findings in the earlier part of this judgment
would be relevant for the purpose of passing off as well. The Plaintiff
has been able to prima facie show that the mark BLOOMBERG is a
well-known mark and enjoys both a trans-border reputation as well as a
reputation in India. As regards the elements of deception and confusion,
it requires to be observed that the Defendants have adopted the entire
mark BLOOMBERG which has been used by the Plaintiff worldwide
for many decades prior to its use by the Defendants. The Defendants'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                     Page 39 of 44</span>
 explanation of their use being honest is not convincing at all. The marks
being identical, there is every possibility that there will be confusion in
the minds of the public into thinking that it is the Plaintiff and its group
companies that have entered the realty industry and are offering
residential and commercial built up spaces. It is not inconceivable that
investors in the realty industry, and prospective buyers of residential and
office spaces, which increasingly include non-resident Indians, may
associate the activities of the Defendants with the Plaintiff. This group
of prospective buyers can be said to be 'average consumers who are
reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect."
The name Bloomberg to them should mean something different, in
terms of quality of products and services and reputation, from 'Smart
Developers' and this surely was recognised by the Defendants when
they decided to change their corporate name in 2011. The Plaintiff has
also been able to prima facie show that the continued use of its mark
BLOOMBERG by the Defendants as the prominent part of their
corporate name, with every Defendant company name starting with
'Bloomberg', will severely prejudice and cause damage to the reputation
and goodwill        attached to the Plaintiff's registered mark.
</p>
<p id="p_86">62. The fact that the Plaintiff and the Defendants are operating in
different lines of businesses is not a good defence in an action brought
by the proprietor of a well-known mark. As has been explained in
several decisions (see for e.g., Adidas Solomon and Adidas Benelux
(2003) ECR-I-2357), even if the fields of operation are different, it is
possible that the average consumer makes a link with the prominent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                            Page 40 of 44</span>
 well-known mark. The well-known mark comes to signify certain
qualities that transcend the goods and services for which it is registered.
Increasingly, with the free flow of goods and services offered under
well-known brands internationally, the possibility of confusion being
caused in the minds of the average consumer in countries other than the
country of origin has to be acknowledged.
</p>
<p id="p_87">63. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that the
elements of passing off have prima facie been established and that the
Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of an interim
injunction restraining the Defendants from passing off their goods and
services as that of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_88">Balance of convenience and irreparable hardship
</p><p id="p_89">64. The offer by the Defendants to carry a prominent disclaimer that
they are not associated with the Plaintiff is not likely to diminish the
possible confusion in the minds of the public as the names of the
Defendant companies all begin with Bloomberg. This will be the
prominent feature displayed on advertisement hoardings and other
publicity material. The Defendants have despite the cease and desist
notice continued to register as many as 23 companies with the names all
beginning with Bloomberg. In the circumstances, the balance of
convenience in restraining the continued use of Bloomberg by the
Defendants as the prominent feature of their corporate names is entirely
in favour of the Plaintiff. The denial of the interim injunction as prayed
for is likely to result in irreparable hardship and severe prejudice being
caused to the Plaintiff. The relative hardship that may be caused to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS(OS) No. 2963 of 2012                                      Page 41 of 44</span>
 Defendants can be addressed by granting them reasonable time to make
the consequential changes to their corporate names.
