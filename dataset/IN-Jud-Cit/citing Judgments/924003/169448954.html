CORAM:
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA

I.A. 11755/2019 (under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC)
1.</pre><p id="p_1">       Plaintiffs have filed the present suit against the defendant inter alia
seeking prayer of permanent injunction and restraining the defendant, its
Directors, Partners, agents etc. from telecasting or otherwise communicating
to the public the impugned advertisement which amounts to intentional and
deliberate disparagement of the plaintiffs‟ health food drink HORLICK by
the defendant through its television commercial (TVC).
</p><p id="p_2">2.       Case of the plaintiffs is that the plaintiffs are renowned corporations
and plaintiff No.1 adopted the trademark HORLICKS in the year 1943
which is registered in its favour in various classes. Plaintiff No.2 under


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(COMM) 464/2019                                                     Page 1 of 20</span>
 license from plaintiff No.1 has extensively marketed and sold HORLICKS
in India since the past many decades. Plaintiffs‟ product HORLICKS is
being sold in many countries around the world in different formulation in
order to cater the needs of the varying consumers and its drink HORLICKS
is seen as a complete health drink amongst the consumers. Plaintiffs‟
product HORLICKS has 23 essential nutrients, that is, Protein, Fat,
Carbohydrate, Vitamin B12, Folic Acid, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B6, Vitamin
C, Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, Naicin, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Iodine, Calcium,
Iron, Zinc, Phosphorus, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Selenium and
Copper.    According to the plaintiffs‟ it has carefully selected the said
ingredients for the overall growth and development of the child‟s body and
mind and it has been proven that supplementation of the child‟s nutrient
with HORLICKS improves micronutrient status and promotes physical and
mental development in children.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    The defendant is a company incorporated in India and as a competitor
of the plaintiffs‟ is manufacturing and selling a nutritional drink under the
trademark COMPLAN. There have been frivolous litigations between the
parties with regard to the advertisements relating to the products
HORLICKS and COMPLAN before various forums. Around July, 2019
plaintiffs came to know that the defendant had launched a TV commercial
disparaging the plaintiffs‟ product HORLICKS, the impugned TVC is being
telecasted in various languages including English, Bengali and Tamil in
various television channels. The story board of the impugned TVC (English
version) is as follows:

</pre><p id="p_4">4.    It is the case of the plaintiffs‟ that the manner and storyline of the
impugned TVC clearly shows the intention of the defendant behind the
launch and is telecasting the same to denigrate the plaintiffs‟ product
HORLICKS. Though in law the defendant may be entitled to puff its
product but it is not allowed to denigrate the product of other parties. The
malafide intention of the defendant in telecasting the impugned TVC can be
traced back to a prior litigation between the parties which started in the year
2004 and the latest of it being in the year 2017 when plaintiffs came across a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(COMM) 464/2019                                                      Page 5 of 20</span>
 print advertisement of the defendant published in the newspaper wherein
defendant compared one cup of its product COMPLAN with two cups of the
plaintiffs‟ product HORLICKS. Aggrieved by the action of the defendant,
plaintiffs filed a suit being CS (Comm) No.808/2017 wherein the learned
Single Judge of this Court granted an ex-parte ad-interim order restraining
the defendant from publishing the said advertisement based on the statement
given by the defendant. The application was finally heard and dismissed
however, for the reason the defendant made various amendments in the
aforesaid print advertisement, including addition of a super, that is, „as per
on pack recommended serve size (COMPLAN 33g. HORLICKS 27g)‟.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    Though the plaintiffs never consented to the modified advertisement
however, in view of the undertaking of the defendant not to publish the print
advertisement except the modified advertisement, the defendant was not
restrained from publishing the modified advertisement. An appeal has been
filed by the plaintiffs against the order dated 17 th December, 2018. The
appeal filed by the plaintiffs against the order dated 17th December, 2018
before the Division Bench of this Court is still pending.
</p><p id="p_6">6.    Learned counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the television is a very
powerful medium of communication and the same cannot be compared with
the print media. Though in the impugned TVC the disclaimer as mentioned
in the print media of recommended serve has been given however, the TVC
being of six seconds duration the same is not discernable. Internationally
and nationally comparison between the product is in the same size or the
same measurement and a comparison other than of the same size would be
misleading.   Despite the fact that the serve size of the plaintiffs and
defendant is different, the cup size in the advertisement is made the same


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(COMM) 464/2019                                                    Page 6 of 20</span>
 thereby creating confusion in the mind of the customers. Thus the TVC
advertisement is not true and gives a misleading message to the public in
general. The message given by the advertisement is that the defendant‟s
product is double that of the plaintiffs. Further despite the plaintiffs health
drink having number of other nutrients a misleading advertisement has been
issued only pointing out towards protein content despite the fact that the two
drinks are not protein supplements but total health drinks. The injunction
granted in favour of the plaintiffs vis-a-vis the print media was vacated on
account of the defendant adding to its advertisement "as per on pack
recommended serve size (Complan 33g, Horlicks 27g)". However, in the
broadcast there is no voiceover qua the serve size. The clip being six
seconds there is hardly any time for any person to note this disclaimer
written on the advertisement.      The defendant is violating the general
principles and disparaging the products of the plaintiffs by the advertisement
which is false, misleading, unfair and deceptive. While deciding the interim
injunction application, this Court is required to see the intent of the
commercial besides the medium of advertisement and in case the
advertisement is being done by a malafide intention the same is liable to be
injuncted. Though a comparative advertisement is legal and permissible
however, the comparison cannot be false as the same has the likelihood of
causing confusion in the mind of the consumer who may be mislead.
Reliance is placed on the decisions reported as 167 (2010) DLT 278 <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_1">Dabur

<p id="p_7"> 7.    Learned counsel for the defendant on the other hand contends that an
overall impression of the impugned advertisement is required to be seen.
The intent and effect of the impugned advertisement being to educate the
consumers with respect to the protein content in one cup of COMPLAN as
per the recommended serve size of 33 grams being equal to two cups of
HORLICKS as per the recommended cup size 27 grams as provided in their
respective packages, the impugned advertisement is neither misleading nor
disparaging nor defamatory and is factually correct.
</p><p id="p_8">8.    Comparison of the products "per serve size" is an accepted method of
comparison when both parties choose to recommend the serve size. The
reason why per serving size is provided with the products is due to its
effectiveness and safety and is a prudent industry practice in respect of food
products as lesser quantity than the serve size will not serve the purpose and
an excess quantity of the health drink may be detrimental to health. Learned
counsel for the defendant in this regard relies upon various decisions of
Advertising Standards Council of India.
</p><p id="p_9">9.    It is further stated that contention of learned counsel for the plaintiffs
that the comparison ought to be after inclusion of the milk in the two
product is incorrect for the reason the protein content in the different
varieties of milk may be different and further the plaintiffs own packaging
recommends consumption of their product on a per serve basis along with
either milk or water and admittedly water has no protein. In comparative
advertisement a party is allowed the creative latitude and the plaintiffs
should not be hypersensitive. Further the impugned advertisement cannot be
read as a testamentary provision in a Will or a clause in an agreement but the
overall impact has to be looked into and the overall impact of the TVC is not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(COMM) 464/2019                                                     Page 8 of 20</span>
 disparaging and is based on correct facts. Creative latitude is permissible to
the advertiser and if there is some basis of comparison than this Court will
not interfere. The Court will also not interfere unless it is a grossest case of
abuse.
</p><p id="p_10">10.      Contention of learned counsel for the plaintiffs that plaintiffs‟ product
has 23 nutrients and there should be comparison with all the ingredients is
incorrect for the reason an advertiser can highlight a special feature/
characteristic of its product and there is no requirement in law that
comparison of all the contents should be displayed. Plaintiffs having not
made out either a prima facie case nor the balance of convenience lying in
favour of the plaintiffs as the defendant‟s impugned advertisement is being
broadcasted since May, 2019 no injunction be granted to the plaintiffs.
Reliance is placed on the decisions reported as Havells India Ltd. (supra),

</p><p id="p_11">11.      In Dabur India (supra) The Division of this Court culled out the
principles governing disparagement in the advertisements and held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          14. On the basis of the law laid down by the Supreme Court,
          the guiding principles for us should be the following:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is
               protected by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_6">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading,
               unfair or deceptive.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but
               these need not necessarily be taken as serious


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(COMM) 464/2019                                                       Page 9 of 20</span>
              representations of fact but only as glorifying one's
             product.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       To this extent, in our opinion, the protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_7">Article
       19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution is available. However, if an
       advertisement extends beyond the grey areas and becomes a
       false, misleading, unfair or deceptive advertisement, it
       would certainly not have the benefit of any protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       15. There is one other decision that we think would give
       some guidance and that is <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_8">Pepsi Co. Inc. and Ors. v.
       Hindustan Coca Cola Ltd. and Anr</a>. MANU/DE/0896/2003 :
       2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del.) (DB). In this decision, a Division
       Bench of this Court held that while boasting about one's
       product is permissible, disparaging a rival product is not.
       The fourth guiding principle for us, therefore, is: (iv) While
       glorifying its product, an advertiser may not denigrate or
       disparage a rival product. Similarly, in Halsbury's Laws of
       England (Fourth Edition Reissue, Volume 28) it is stated in
       paragraph 278 that "[It] is actionable when the words go
       beyond a mere puff and constitute untrue statements of fact
       about a rival's product." This view was followed, amongst
       others, in <a href="/doc/1357815/" id="a_9">Dabur India Ltd. v. Wipro Limited, Bangalore</a>
       MANU/DE/1151/2006 : 2006 (32) PTC 677 (Del). "[It] is
       one thing to say that the defendant's product is better than
       that of the plaintiff and it is another thing to say that the
       plaintiff's product is inferior to that of the defendant."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       16. In Pepsi Co. it was also held that certain factors have to
       be kept in mind while deciding the question of
       disparagement. These factors are: (i) Intent of the
       commercial, (ii) Manner of the commercial, and (iii) Story
       line of the commercial and the message sought to be
       conveyed. While we generally agree with these factors, we
       would like to amplify or restate them in the following terms:

             make an unfavourable comparison but that might not
             necessarily affect the story line and message of the
             advertised product or have that as its overall effect.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">             (3) The manner of advertising - is the comparison by

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       17. In our opinion, it is also important to keep in mind the
       medium of the advertisement. An advertisement in the
       electronic media would have a far greater impact than an
       advertisement in the print media. <a href="/doc/115388/" id="a_10">In D.N. Prasad v.
       Principal Secretary</a> MANU/AP/0050/2005:2005 Cri LJ
       1901 the Andhra Pradesh High Court observed that a
       telecast reaches persons of all categories, irrespective of
       age, literacy and their capacity to understand or withstand.
       The Court noted that the impact of a telecast on the society
       is phenomenal. Similarly, it was observed in Pepsi Co. that
       a vast majority of viewers of commercial advertisements on
       the electronic media are influenced by visual advertisements
       "as these have a far reaching influence on the psyche of the
       people ..." Therefore, an advertiser has to virtually walk on
       a tight rope while telecasting a commercial and repeatedly
       ask himself the questions: Can the commercial be
       understood to mean a denigration of the rival product or

        not? What impact would the commercial have on the mind
       of a viewer? No clear-cut answer can be given to these
       questions and it is for this reason that this Court has taken a
       view that each case has to be decided on its own facts. (See
       Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Cavinkare Pvt. Ltd.
       MANU/DE/9840/2007: ILR (2007) Delhi 368, paragraph
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       17). Consequently, this Court has been called upon to
       decide the same issue time and time again resulting in the
       same and very large number of decisions being cited.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       18. On balance, and by way of a conclusion, we feel that
       notwithstanding the impact that a telecast may have, since
       commercial speech is protected and an advertisement is
       commercial speech, an advertiser must be given enough
       room to play around in (the grey areas) in the advertisement
       brought out by it. A plaintiff (such as the Appellant before
       us) ought not to be hyper-sensitive as brought out in Dabur
       India. This is because market forces, the economic climate,
       the nature and quality of a product would ultimately be the
       deciding factors for a consumer to make a choice. It is
       possible that aggressive or catchy advertising may cause a
       partial or temporary damage to the plaintiff, but ultimately
       the consumer would be the final adjudicator to decide what
       is best for him or her.

       have some reasonable factual basis for the assertion made.
       It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to make an off-the-
       cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods are the best in
       the world or falsely state that his goods are better than that
       of a rival.

<p id="p_12"> 12.     The Division Bench of High Court of Madras in Gillette India Ltd.
(supra) besides laying down the principles to ascertain whether an
advertisement is disparaging or not, also noted the distinction between an
advertisement in the electronic audio visual media and the print media. It
was held that the advertisement in the electronic audio visual media leaves
an impression in the minds of the viewer and has a far greater impact. It was
held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">         96. Whether an advertisement is disparaging or not
         would depend on several factors, for which each
         advertisement would have to be judged on its own
         merits, on consideration of the overall impact of the
         picture that is portrayed, the language used, the
         histrionics, the gesticulations, the movements,
         acrobatics, catch phrases, hilarity or other catchy
         screen shots. While humour, hilarity or even ridiculing
         to highlight the advantages of one's own product may be
         permissible, ridiculing services and products of another
         would amount to disparagement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">         97. To decide whether an advertisement is disparaging,
         the Court has to consider (i) the intent of the commercial
         advertisement; (ii) the message sought to be conveyed;
         and (iii) the mode and manner of conveying the message.
         Condemning the goods and services of a competitor or
         ridiculing the same or showing the same as substandard
         would amount to disparagement.

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">         98. Of course, as stated above, mere puffing up of one's
         products or services in comparison to those of others
         would not constitute disparagement. It may be
         permissible for an advertiser to compare the technology
         or the formula of the products of others in an attempt to
         impress upon viewers the superiority of the goods and
         articles advertised over those of others. In the process, an
         advertiser may even brand the technology and/or formula

       modern technology or formula of the advertiser, but

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">       99. A judgment is a precedent for the issue of law which
       is raised and decided and not for what might logically be
       deduced from the decision arrived at in the facts and
       circumstances of a particular case, and that too for the
       purpose of granting interim injunction. Words and
       sentences in a judgment cannot also be read like the
       provisions of a statute enacted by Parliament or even
       statutory Rules and in no case can the same be read out
       of context. Moreover, while the judgments of the Supreme
       Court are binding on this Court and while judicial
       discipline demands that this Court should follow
       judgments of Benches of this Court of co-ordinate
       strength, judgments rendered by other High Courts can
       only have persuasive value.

<p id="p_13">13.    As held in the various decisions, intent of the advertisement is

difference on all the parameters.
</p><p id="p_14">14.   Before adverting to the applicability of the law as noted above on the
facts of this case, it would be appropriate to note about the earlier legal
proceeding between the parties. The plaintiff had earlier filed a suit being
CS (Comm) No.808/2017 when the defendant had brought out an
advertisement in the print media which the plaintiffs herein claim to be
disparaging and an ad-interim ex-parte injunction was granted, however, the
said interim injunction was vacated by this Court on hearing the parties vide
order dated 17th December, 2018 against which the plaintiffs herein have
already preferred an appeal. The said decision was based on the revised
advertisement of the defendant which statement of the learned counsel for
the defendant was noted in para 16 as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">      16. At the outset, Mr. Amit Sibal, learned senior counsel
      for defendant stated that the defendant, on its own
      initiative, had modified the impugned advertisement. He
      undertook that the defendant would publish the modified
      advertisement in future and not the advertisement
      impugned in the present plaint. The undertaking given by
      Mr. Amit Sibal is accepted by this Court and defendant is
      held bound by the same. The modified advertisement is
      reproduced herein below:-

<p id="p_15"> 15.   Since the comparison of the defendant was based on the serve size
recommended by the parties, the modified advertisement clarified that the
comparison was based on the recommended serve size which was noted in
the middle of the print advertisement and though in smaller letters than the
main advertisement but clearly visible. The main grievance of the plaintiff
in respect of the advertisement in the electronic medium is that the TVC is
for six seconds and the voiceover does not clarify the disclaimer added in
the print advertisement, that is, „as per on pack recommended serve size
(COMPLAN 33g. HORLICKS 27g)‟ and six second is too less a time for
anyone to be able to notice this disclaimer on the TVC.

<p id="p_18">18.   There can be no dispute about the fact that comparison based on the
recommended serve size by the parties can be done in a commercial
advertisement, however, the meet of the matter is whether the disclaimer as
put in the print advertisement is visible and audible in the impugned
electronic medium. This Court finds that on playing the TVC, there is no
voiceover with regard to the disclaimer in reference to the serve size nor is
the time sufficient to read the said disclaimer. In view of this fact the present
advertisement in the electronic media would be clearly disparaging as on a
bare looking at the advertisement a viewer only sees a comparison of one
cup of COMPLAN with two cups of HORLICKS with no reference to the
serve size. Further as noted in Gillette India Ltd. (supra) the electronic
medium is a very powerful medium of communication and leaves an
indelible mark on the mind of the viewer this Court finds that prima facie in
view of no voiceover qua the disclaimer qua the serve size being there and
the visual advertisement being for six seconds only giving insufficient time
to note the disclaimer, the plaintiffs have made out a prima face case in their
favour and in case no interim injunction is granted the plaintiffs would
suffer an irreparable loss. Claim of the defendant is that since the TVC is
running since May, 2019, the balance of convenience does not lie in favour
of the plaintiffs. The said argument defies the fact that TV viewership is
continuous and on daily basis and hence every new person who views the
advertisement would be clearly misled. Consequently, till the disposal of
