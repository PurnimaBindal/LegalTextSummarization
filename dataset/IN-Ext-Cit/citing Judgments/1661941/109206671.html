2021 was kept in abeyance.                 The KVS authorities

issued three sets of Transfer and Posting Orders. The

first one was issued on 12.9.20212 itself bearing order

No.      F.N. 11-E -11019/34/2022-Estt-II/ 1798-2430

teachers vide order No.          F.N. 11-E -11019 /34/ 2022-

Estt-II/ 4096-6274. In all these transfer orders, the

following reason was mentioned:-
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       &quot;With the approval of the Competent Authority,
       the following teachers are hereby transferred from

       ground, for the purpose of rationalization and
       redistribution of existing teaching staff, and in

representation            (Annexure-A/2)     dated     13.9.2022

alleging arbitrariness in issuing the transfer order

12.09.2022 and also suspending Clause-6 of the

Transfer Guidelines of 2021. The applicant Association

has alleged that the Respondents have not informed

them        regarding       the     action     taken     on      their

representation.           The     representation   mentioned           a

meeting dated 2.9.2022 between the KVS officials and

the applicant Association in which the applicant

Association pointed out some lacuna in the ongoing

process of collecting data related to teachers prepared

by the respondents. The respondent&#x27;s representative

officials promised to take corrective action regarding

the lacuna as pointed out. However, the applicant

Association alleges that in disregard to norms rules

and guidelines, the respondent KVS has issued the

transfer orders in the middle of the academic session.

Being aggrieved, the applicant-association has come in

this OA before the Tribunal.             The              Applicant

association has sought the following relief in their OA:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       a)   To pass an order by setting aside the
       impugned notice dated 12.9.2022 which is
       against the legitimate expectation of Para 6 of the

       transferred school as per Transfer Guidelines
       2021 with all consequential benefits.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       c)   Any other relief which this Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal

Court No.6 (item No.09)



</p><p id="p_10">4.     The matter was listed on 30.09.2022 for the first

time for admission and after hearing of both sides the

matter was reserved for final orders on 03.03.2023,

and thereafter it was listed on 22.03.2023 along with

others       as      &quot;For   Being   Spoken      To&quot;   for    further

clarification from both the parties and reserved for final

order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">5.     The applicant association has challenged the

impugned orders on the following grounds:-


</p><p id="p_13">(i) The transfer order dated 12.9.2022 and the

suspension of annual transfers vide                   order date

12.9.2022 were issued and uploaded on the same day.

Moreover, the suspension of the annual transfers was

issued after issuance of                the transfer order, which

shows that it was an afterthought to rectify the

technical/legal lacuna in the transfer orders. The

hurried action on the part of Respondents shows non-

application of mind in transferring large number of

teachers relocating to far off places.


</p><p id="p_14">(ii) The Respondents kept Clause-6 of the Transfer

Guidelines, 2021 in abeyance to justify the large scale

transfers. However, the impugned order suspending

Clause 6 was uploaded one day after the transfer order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>

Court No.6 (item No.09)



dated 12.9.2022 was issued and uploaded. This shows

the hurriedness in issuing the transfer orders without

proper application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">(iii) The respondents&#x27; non-application of mind is also

clear from the fact that the transfer order of 13.9.2022

involved the transfer of one Ms Sonia Khetrapal (TGT-

Biology), who has already been expired on 25.8.2022.

This point to non-application of mind and rashness in

issuing the transfer orders without proper application

of mind.

</p><p id="p_18">(iv) The respondents have ignored settled principles of

law ignoring the following judgments:-

<p id="p_19">(v) The impugned suspension of Para 6 of the Transfer

Guidelines were issued in violation by the Education

Code issued the BOG of Kendriya Vidyalay Sangathan

on 28.12.2012. The BOG is competent to modify the

Transfer Guidelines, where as the suspension of Para 6

and annual Transfers was issued by an executive order

without taking approval of the BOG. Hence the

impugned orders are issued without competency.


</p><p id="p_20">(vi) The impugned transfer orders are violating clauses

5 and 7 of the Transfer Guidelines 2021 which are still

existent at the time of issuing the transfers.


</p><p id="p_21">6. The Counsel for the applicant Association argued

that the present OA has been filed by Sh. Narayan Lal,

General Secretary of the Association. The Association,

as representative body of the teachers of the KVS,

espouses the cause of its members. The present OA

has been filed against arbitrariness of a policy matter,

and hence, it is maintainable.

Ahemdabad, Allahabad Bench ( OA No. 834/2022 and

the Principal Bench (OA no.2765/2022 and three other

tagged        OAs          dated       27.9.2022)        of     the      Central

Administrative                 Tribunal         have      considered           the

arbitrariness, non-application of mind in issuing the

said      transfers            in     respect    of     several        individual

applicants ( affected teachers) in a bunch of OAs and

as an interim measure, have stayed operation of the

said transfers in respect of those applicants. Prime

facie,      the      Coordinated              Benches      have         accepted

arbitrariness and non-application of mind on the part

of the Respondents in ordering the transfers in

violation of Clauses 5 and 7 of the Transfer Guidelines

of 2021. He argued that there are sufficient reasons to

conclude          that         the    impugned         orders   suffer       from

arbitrariness, non- application of mind because of the

facts and circumstances already mentioned in the OA.

He further argued that the impugned orders are issued

in    violation           of    the    Education        Code      of    KVS     dt

28.12.2012 and also it violates Clauses 5 and 7 of the

Transfer Guidelines.

</p><p id="p_26">8. The counsel for the Applicant association argued

that the transfers effected redeployment of 717 primary

teachers of KVs to far off places in the country. They

were accustomed in teaching primary students at the

existing locations by adopting the method of mixing the

medium of instruction in vernacular language of the

locality for the benefit of the students. Now, they will

have to face difficulty in communicating to the primary

students in the new KVs as they are not accustomed or

conversant with the local language. The National

Education Policy 2020 states that it is preferable to

teach the primary students in their mother tongue.

Hence, he argued, the impugned transfer order violates

the spirit of the National Education Policy, 2020.


</p><p id="p_27">9. In view of the above reasons, the counsel for the

respondents argued that the impugned orders dated

12.09.2022, 13.9.2022, and 16.9.2022 should be

quashed. The operation of       Clause-6 of the Transfer

Guidelines should be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">10. The counsel for the respondents argued that the

Transfer orders are not merely transfers.     He argued

that the suspension of Clause -6 and the annual

transfers has effectively taken away the provisions

Court No.6 (item No.09)



under clauses 5, 7 and 9. Moreover, the order dated

12.9.2022 has also mentioned that the said orders are

not only transfer orders; these are also redistribution of

the teaching staff for effecting rationalization of the

deployment of teaching staff in various Kendriya

Vidyalayas in the country.               The rationale for the

rationalization           and   redistribution   comes   from       a

detailed exercise undertaken by the KVS authorities to

access the staff strength, existing deployment and

vacancies in various KVs. It was a massive exercise to

ascertain the KVs having less than 50% of sanctioned

strength and the KVs having 80% or more regular

teaching staff. As per station seniority, the staff having

longest stay at a particular station having existing staff

to the tune of 80% or more of regular vacancies were

transferred out to locations having 50% or less regular

staff.    He further stated that the Transfer Guidelines

allow the KVS Authorities to transfer any employee on

administrative exigencies. These transfers are called

Administrative Transfers which are defined as &quot;those

transfers which KVS orders suomotu in the exigencies

of service and administration and public interest.&quot;

representation 13.09.2022 of one Mrs Jaya Purwar of

the applicant in OA No.608/23, which reads as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       Whereas the above transfers have been effected
       recently in KVS for reasons that due to disruption
       in normal schooling for past two years owing to
       the pandemic situation, there has been significant
       learning loss amongst students due to online
       blended mode of teaching. According to the
       mental health and well being of school students
       2022 report published by NCERT in the chapter
       relating to KVS, it has been stated that during
       COVID-19, as classes were taking place in online
       mode, 54% of the students who participated in
       the survey reported facing difficulties in
       understanding and learning of content through
       online mode. Hence the need was felt to address
       on priority, the learning challenges being faced by
       the students for the past two years due to
       pandemic through administrative means. The
       rationalization of teachers &amp; redistribution of the
       existing teaching staff have been effected to
       address the above core challenges after the
       pandemic so that at least 50% of regular teaching
       staff (inclusive of all cadres) are available in all
       KVs.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       Whereas, KVS has identified around 237 KVs
       having less than 50% of regular teaching staff on
       its rolls and about 481 KVs having 80% or more
       regular teaching staff on its rolls in all over India
       on the basis of available vacancy. As per Station
       Seniority (All India /cadre/subject wise), who has
       the longest stay in a station, as per date of joining
       at the station was taken as the criteria for
       transfer. Most of the teachers who have been

       Government servant or employee of Public
       Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at
       any particular place. Transfer from one place to
       other is generally a condition of service and the
       employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer
       from one place to other is necessary in public
       interest     and    efficiency   in     the    Public
       administration. Whenever, a public servant is
       transferred he must comply with the order but if
       there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on
       transfer it is open to him to make representation
       to the competent authority for stay, modification
       or cancellation of the transfer order. If the order of
       transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
       concerned public servant must carry out the
       order of transfer. In the absence of any stay of the
       transfer order a public servant has no
       justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
       merely on the ground of having made a
       representation, or on the ground of his difficulty
       in moving from one place to the other. If he fails
       to proceed on transfer in compliance to the
       transfer order, he would expose himself to
       disciplinary action under the relevant Rules, as
       has happened in the instant case. The respondent
       lost his service as he refused to comply with the
       order of his transfer from one place to the other.&quot;

<p id="p_41">16.     The counsel for the respondents countered the

argument that the Order dated 12.9.2022 suspending

competency. The decision to suspend Clause-6 of the

Transfer Guidelines, 2021 was taken in a meeting

chaired          by the Union Education Minister           (who is

member of BOG) were present . Hence, the assertion

that the order is ultra vires of the Education Code 2012

falls flat.         As the annual transfers were suspended

and the transfers vide order dt. 12.9.2022 effected for

administrative exigencies, other clauses of the Transfer

Guidelines are not attracted in such exigencies.


</p><p id="p_42">17. I have gone through the records of the case

thoroughly and heard the arguments carefully. It has

transferring an employee and reassigning duties and

providing sub-entities and subordinate offices                           with

the required human resources and support they need

to be successful in their roles. This is akin to allocation

of organizational resources to achieve organizational

goals. Modern governments and organizations begin

the     process           prior   to    adopting        transfers      as     a

redeployment tool by assessing the organization&#x27;s

current and future human resources needs. Following

these assessments, the competent authority makes

decisions how best to deploy the human resources to

meet the identified needs. These include the type of

human resources required, the number of human

resources          required,      the        location   of   the     human

resources, and the timing of the deployment. In

Government, generally this task is assigned to an

        The transfer policies are in the form of executive
        guidelines. And hence, these have no statutory

        prerogative of the government to transfer its
        employees to ant place of posting for
        administrative exigencies. The transfer guidelines
        are subservient to public interest.

        may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant

        redress but cannot have the consequence of
        depriving or denying the competent authority to
        transfer a particular officer/servant to any place
        in public interest and as is found necessitated by
        exigencies of service as long as the official status
        is not affected adversely and there is no infraction
        of any career prospects such as seniority, scale of
        pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
        often reiterated that the order of transfer made
        even in transgression of administrative guidelines
        cannot also be interfered with, as they do not
        confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as

        orders, which could assess the niceties of the
        administrative needs and requirements of the

       competent authorities of the State and even

dependant            family   members   are   matters       for

consideration for the competent authority but not for

the courts/ tribunals to decide the matter as an

Appellate Authority. The decision of the Administrative

Authorities after considering these personal difficulties

is considered final. The Apex court in State of MP and

Ors Vs S.S. Kourav &amp; Ors [CA No. 1285 of 1995

decided on 19.1.1995] held that:
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">       &quot;It is further contended that in an unfortunate
       situation the respondent&#x27;s wife committed suicide
       leaving three children and he would suffer
       extreme hardship if he has to work in the tribal
       area. This court cannot go into that question of
       relative hardship. It would be for the
       administration to consider the facts of the given
       case and mitigate the real hardship in the interest
       of good and efficient administration. If there is
       any such hardship, it would be open to make a
       representation to the government and it is for the
       government to consider and take appropriate
       decision in that behalf.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">31. Sometimes, employees or employee groups assail

the transfer policy or suspension of any particular

clause or clauses of the transfer policy as it may create

difficulties for individual or group of employees. As the

transfer policies/circulars are only guidelines for the

administrative Authorities, these cannot be enforceable

by the courts [Punjab and Sind Bank &amp;Ors. Vs.

Durgesh Kuwar, 2020 (supra)]. Whether, the transfer

policy or suspension of particular clause of transfer

policy is good or bad, it is              for the administrative

authorities to consider the grievances of the employees

in respect of a particular issue regarding transfer

policy. In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and others Vs

Sate of UP and Others [1991 AIR 537, 1990 SCR

Supl. (1) 625], the Apex Court held that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">       &quot;The wisdom of the policy or the lack of it or the
       desirability of a better alternative is not within the
       permissible scope of judicial review in such cases.
       It is not for the courts to recast the policy or to
       substitute it with another which is considered to
       be more appropriate, once the attack on the
       ground of arbitrariness is successfully repelled by
       showing that the act which was done, was fair
       and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of
       the case.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">       As indicated by Diplock, L.J., in Council of Civil
       Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service
       [(1984) 3 All ER 935] the power of judicial review
       is limited to the grounds of illegality, irrationality
       and procedural impropriety.&quot;
</blockquote>


<p id="p_70">32. The aforementioned judgments of the Apex Court

have       given          upper   hand   to   the   administrative

authorities or the Government in matters of Transfers.

However, transfers may affect negatively the level of

productivity, motivation, innovation quality, relations,

and participation and communication patterns among

other core human resources activities. When handled

well      and       in     accordance         with     the     employees&#x27;

circumstances,               deployment          increase         employee

performance through increased innovation, creativity,

quality, productivity, profitability, loyalty flexibility,

efficiency, effectiveness, and low levels of discontents,

dysfunctional conflicts. In other words, em[ployee

welfare is also in the interest of the organizations. The

principles of effectiveness, efficiency and economy in

matters of deployment of human resources are sought

to be aligned with organizational mission goals.




</p><p id="p_71">33.      While effecting redeployment through transfers,

the organizations should also treat all such employees

fairly     and        without     any         bias   or      malafide       or

discrimination. Moreover, a model employer like the

government            also    treats    its     employees       far     more

transparently and it is expected that the government

ensures that there is no violation of Articles 14 and 16

Indian Constitution.            Based on the twin objectives of

satisfying organizational goals (public interest and

better governance for delivery of public services ) and

employee            welfare,      growth         and         development,

organizations             including     government           departments

formulate transfer /placement policies. These policies

ensure         transparency           and     also     provide       better

opportunities to officers for excellence and more

planned approach to cadre planning.                      Such transfer

policies develop some sort of reasonable employee

expectations              to   be   treated   fairly    while    effective

redeployment               through      transfers.     Similarly,        the

government                departments       also     have    reasonable

expectations from its employees to cooperate in such

deployment to achieve mission goals of departments

and other entities.
</p>
<p id="p_72">


</p><p id="p_73">34. Redeployment in the form of transfers inter alia

should also satisfy the test of reasonable expectations

of the employees to be treated fairly and such

administrative action should not be based on malafide,

bias and unreasonable factors.                       There are several

judgments of the Apex court which have moderated the

absolute power of the government/ administrative

authorities in the matters of transfer. The earliest of

this genre is the judgment of the Apex court in E.P.

Royappa Vs State Of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr [ 1974 AIR

555, 1974 SCR (2) 348; Dated 23/11/1973]. The

Apex court has held that:

Court No.6 (item No.09)



          &quot;It is an accepted principle that in public service
          transfer is an incident of service. It is also an
          implied condition of service and appointing
          authority has a wide discretion in the matter. The
          Government is the best judge to decide how to
          distribute and utilize the services of its employees.
          However, this power must be exercised honestly,
          bona fide and reasonably. It should be exercised
          in public interest. If the exercise of power is based
          on extraneous considerations or for achieving an
          alien purpose or an oblique motive it would
          amount to mala fide and colorable exercise of
          power. Frequent transfers, without sufficient
          reasons to justify such; transfers, cannot, but be
          held as mala fide. A transfer is mala fide when it
          is made not for professed purpose, such as in
          normal course or in public or administrative
          interest or in the exigencies of service but for
          other purpose, than is to accommodate another
          person for undisclosed reasons. It is the basic
          principle of rule of law and good administration
          that even administrative actions should be just
          and fair.&quot;

review         in         transfer   matters   under     certain

circumstances: It was held that a judicial review of an

administrative action is of course permissible, but

orders of transfer are interfered when:-

failed to assert that the transfer order dt 12.9.2022 is

based on non-application of mind and it suffers from

malafide or bias on the part of the competent authority.

The assertion that the order dated 12.9.2022 suffers

from competency has been squarely rebutted by the

counsel for the respondent. The BOG Chairman, i.e.

the Union Education Minister held meeting of senior

officers of the education department and the KVS , who

are ex-officio Members of the BOG. Hence, it has the

equivalent competency of the BOG. A formal meeting of

BOG would not have taken any different decision as

most of the members of BOG were present in the

meeting        chaired    by   the        Education   minister,      the

chairperson of BOG.

the suspension of the Clause-6 of the Transfer

Guidelines and also ordering the transfer in three

tranches. The transfers are part of rationalization and

redistribution of the human resources following a well-

thought-out exercise to find out KVs having 50% or

less staff compared to their sanctioned strength and

also KVs having 80% or more staff. As it has been

stated in the impugned order dated 13.01.2023, most

of the teachers, who were transferred out, were based

on the seniority roster maintained at each station and

most of the transferred teachers had a stay of more

than 10 years at their respective previous KVs. In view

of this well thought out exercise, the suspension of

Clause-6         of       the   Transfer   guidelines    and       non-

operationaliation of other clauses of the transfer

guidelines applicable for annual transfers and request

transfers cannot be said arbitrary or non-application of

Association that hurriedness in which the transfer

not acceptable. It is mere clerical exercise as to issue

day. The mere sequence of issuing the orders should

not     attract       arbitrariness    on     the    part   of       the

respondents. Moreover, it has been admitted by the

applicant Association that the Association was priory

consulted and there were discussion regarding the

some lacuna regarding the data sets in respect of

teaching staff. The respondents carried out a well-

though-out exercise identifying the KVs having 80% or

more and 50 % less teaching staff vis-à-vis the

sanctioned strength. Hence, effecting the redeployment

of teaching staff as part of                rationalization of their

deployment service well the Public Interest of providing

quality education to the students of the KVs.

Kuwar (supra), Union of India and Others Vs.

Ganesh Dass Singh (supra), has given upper hand to

the administrative authorities or the Government in

matters of Transfers. In all those judgments, the Apex

Court held that the Public Interest is paramount in

such administrative exercises and there is very limited

scope for judicial review in the matters of transfer. As it

has been held in the other set of judgments cited in

paragarph 34 above,                 unless there is malafide, bias,

infringement              of     statutory   provisions,       lack       of

competency, non-application of mind, etc, the courts

and tribunals should not interfere in the administrative

decision in respect of transfers. In the instant case, as

we have already discussed above, we do not find any

such bias or non-application of mind in the present

case.
