incriminating circumstances that appeared against them in the

defence.

       Upon hearing argument of the Public Prosecutor for the

State and legal Aid counsel Kumari Azmathunissa Begum, found

him.

       Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence passed under the

Calendar and Judgment in S.C.No.194 of 2012, dated 29.04.2014,

preferred this appeal under <a href="/doc/1459475/" id="a_16">section 374</a> (2) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>. raising

several contentions. The main grounds urged before the Court are

that the identity of the accused was not established in view of the

discrepancies as to the name of the accused No.1 more particularly

identity of the accused based on his name and that the

prosecution failed to prove the motive for commission of such

offence, committed the grave error in finding him guilty, the trial

Court failed to considered the failure of the prosecution to prove

the important link in the chain of circumstances so as complete

the chain of circumstances un-erringly the pointing out the guilt of

the accused and inconsistent with innocence.         Therefore, the

conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant/accused No.1

is illegal and unsustainable under law, prayed to set aside the
                                   7                              MSM, J &amp; CMR, J

conviction sentence passed against accused No.1 for the grave

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_18">section 302</a> of IPC.

      During    hearing,   the   learned      Legal   Aid   Counsel          Sri

T.S.Rayulu     would   contend   that   the    name    of   the     accused

No.1/appellant is totally different and his name was shown as

Benda Ashok Chakravarthi @ Siva @ Chakravarthi @ Suribabu @

Maddila Suri, but the evidence is totally run counter to the name

mentioned in the cause title. The name of the accused No.1 was

disclosed as Suri Babu in the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 and they

did not identify the accused No.1/appellant as Chakravarthi and

thereby failed to establish the identity of the person who stabbed

Rajani with an intention to kill her knowing that those injuries

found on the body of Rajani are sufficient to cause death in the

ordinary course of event and committed a serious error in finding

the accused guilty and made a sincere effort to demonstrate the

failure of the prosecution to establish identity of Chakravarthi as

Suri Babu to contended that the trial Court committed grave error

in finding the accused guilty for such grave offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">section 302</a> of IPC and requested to set aside the conviction

and sentence passed against appellant/accused No.1 extending

benefit of doubt, finding him not guilty and acquit for the same.

      The Public Prosecutor for the State supported the Judgment

in all respects while contending that the evidence of P.W.2/Merugu

Bhagya Lakshmi and P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa Rao and the name of

the person of accused/appellant mentioned in other documents is

sufficient to establish that the appellant/accused No.1 is the

person who committed the murderer or assault on the body of

Rajani, who succumbed to the injuries and that there is no dispute

as to the identity even according to the material available on record

before the trial Court.      Therefore, there are no grounds to

warranting interference of this Court while exercising jurisdiction

under <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_20">section 374(2)</a> of Cr.P.C., requested to dismiss the appeal,

confirming the conviction and sentence under calendar and

Judgment in Sessions Case No.194 of 2012 passed by I Additional

District &amp; Sessions Judge, FAC/VI Additional District &amp; Sessions

Judge, Krishna, Machilipatnam.

      Considering rival contentions, material available on record

the point was arise for consideration is that:

         &quot;Whether the appellant/accused No.1 caused
         injuries on the body of Rajani who is sister
         of Merugu Naresh (P.W.1) and daughter of
         Merugu Bhagya Lakshmi (P.W.2) with an
         intention to kill her, knowing that those
         injuries are sufficient to cause death in
         ordinary course of events, if not whether
         conviction sentence imposed upon the
         appellant/accused No.1 are liable to be set
         aside finding him not guilty for the offence
         punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_21">section 302</a> of I.P.C.&quot;.


In Re-Point:

      This is an appeal filed under <a href="/doc/81939/" id="a_22">section 372</a> of Cr.P.C. Section

374 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23">Cr.P.C</a>. conferred a substantive right of appeal on the accused

cannot interfere with such fact findings in appeal, while exercising

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_25">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C. It is the sacrosanct duty

proper re-assessment, re-appreciation and re-scrutiny of the

appeal.     This is the quality of exercise which is expected of the

appellate Court to be undertaken and when that is not done, the

should be sent to prison without his fault nor a guilty person

the guilt of accused, all proved facts must lead to inference of guilt

of the accused alone and court has to draw distinction between

<p id="p_14">      Turning to the facts of the present case we would like to

discuss advert to the direct evidence of P.W.1. His testimony in

examination in chief is directly pointing out that the accused

No.1/appellant herein caused stab injuries on the body of his

sister Rajani with whom the appellant herein developed the live-in

relationship and lived together for three (03) months at Polukonda

Village, when he started harassing Rajani suspecting that she is

indulging in prostitution with others, she returned to Rudravaram

Village where P.W.1 is living while working as watchman on the

fish tank of Raguri Srinivasa Rao (P.W.4). Even one day prior to

the incident accused No.1/appellant came to their house by bus

and spent sometime and left the village and again came on the

next day on the motor cycle spend some time and later demand

Rajani to accompany him to Polukonda Village, but she expressed

her disinterest to live with him and after sometime he started to go

to his village on a motor cycle some how he managed Rajani to

accompany him on the pretest to see him off upto cross roads of

Rudravaram Village and accordingly she accompanied him on

motor cycle upto Rudravaram cross roads to see him off, but the

appellant/accused No.1 due to his ill intention, had sexual due

course with her near bushes behind bus shelter and directed

accused No.2 to have sex with her, but she denied. Thereupon he

grew wild and stabbed Rajani and pushed her body into drain so

as to disappear evidence of murder.      Therefore, the consistent

evidence of P.W.1 he is the direct witness to the occurrence of the

incident and he directly witnessed the incident while Accused No.1

inflicting injury on the head and neck of his sister with a small

knife (chaku) accused No.1 pushed aside his sister into the

drainage canal and immediately fled away from the scene of offence

by the motor cycle.    As Merugu Naresh (P.W.1) raised cries for

help, Raguri Srinivasa Rao (P.W.4) who is working with him came

on motor cycle and chased him, but in vain.         In the cross-

examination a suggestion was put to him that Rajani was leading

adulterous life with many people and some one might have killed

Rajani, but the suggestion was denied bluntly by the witness and

similarly a suggestion was put to witness denying commission of

murder by accused No.1/appellant herein and that he was falsely

implicated, but P.W.1 did not accept the suggestion and denied

categorically.   The counsel for the petitioner confronted to the

witness certain parts of the statement marked as Exs.D1 to D3

viz., part of the previous statement recorded under <a href="/doc/357596/" id="a_36">section 161</a> (3)

of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37">Cr.P.C</a>. can be used to contradict witness. Therefore the legal

Aid counsel Kumari Azmathunissa Begum sincerely made an

attempt to disprove the testimony of P.W.1. According to Ex.D1 a

week days ago P.W.1 together with brother-in-law Suri Babu (the
                                  13                          MSM, J &amp; CMR, J

appellant herein) came to Rudravaram Village of Bandar Mandal to

talk to Raguri Srinivasa Rao agreed to engage P.W.1 on monthly

salary of Rs.4,000/-. Ex.D2 also show that on 10.04.2011 during

day time his brother-in-law Suri Babu came to the house and

stayed with them till night and went away and similarly Ex.D.3

and D.4 also.    More curiously, Ex.D.3 shows that P.W.1/Naresh

stated that Inspector of Police during recording his statement

under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_38">section 161</a> of Cr.P.C. that his brother-in-law Suri Babu

stabbed his elder sister with knife on her fore head and neck and

killed her and on seeing he cried loudly, then he kicked his sister

into water in the bode and ran away and the bund of bode which

lead to road and on hearing his cries Suri Babu ran away on the

motor cycle.    This part of previous statement put to the witness

may strengthen the case of the prosecution and it is of no assistant

to the case of the defence set up by the appellant herein. Thus,

the testimony of direct witness Merugu Naresh (P.W.1) who is no

other than brother of deceased Rajani is suffice to conclude that

the accused No.1/appellant stabbed her on various parts of her

body as narrated by him, i.e., on fore head, neck and chest with a

knife with an intention to kill her and pushing the body into

drainage canal after causing grave injuries on the body of Rajani

indicate the intention of the appellant/accused No.1 to kill Rajani.

</p><p id="p_17">      Though P.W.1 is the brother of deceased he is a natural

witness and nothing was elicited to improbabalise his presence at

the scene of offence while causing stab injuries on the body of

Rajani by the appellant/accused No.1.      The last suggestion was

put to the witness that he did not witness the incident of accused

No.1 stabbing his sister, but he denied the same. The consistent

evidence of P.W.1 who is the direct witness is sufficient to prove

that the accused No.1/appellant herein caused injuries on the

body of Rajani with an intention to kill her knowing that those

injuries are sufficient to kill, in the ordinary course of events.

</p><p id="p_19">         Coming to the evidence of P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa Rao the

owner of the fish tank under whom P.W.1 is working. He spoke

about the presence of P.W.1/Merugu Naresh and P.W.4/Raguri

Srinivasa Rao near the scene of offence while attending to repairs

of diesel engine for pumping water and spoke about P.W.1 leaving

the place of P.W.1 as his sister Rajani did not return from bus stop

even after half an hour and P.W.4 heard cries of P.W.1 that

accused No.1 is killing his sister. Immediately went to the bus stop

and found accused No.1 proceeded towards Bandar on a motor

cycle,    he   chased   him,    but     he   could   not     catch         the

appellant/accused No.1. P.W.4 is the circumstantial witness who

did not witness actual causing of stab injuries on the body of

Rajani by accused No.1, but he chased accused No.1/appellant

while leaving the scene of offence on a motor cycle after causing

injuries on the body of Rajani with whom she developed live-in-

relationship for few months.        In the cross-examination P.W.4

admitted that after hearing P.W.1 shouts (cries) he started in the

bus stop on the motor cycle and chased accused No.1. Followed

by a suggestion that accused No.1 is not known as Suri Babu

accompanied P.W.1 for negotiating terms with him and that at the

instance of police he identified accused No.1 in the Court hall.

These two suggestions were denied by him. Even assuming for a

moment that Suri Babu came and approached him and negotiated

the terms to engage Naresh (P.W.1) as watchman on salary at the

rate of Rs.4,000/- per month. This is of no use to disbelieve the

case of the prosecution. If really appellant/accused accompanied

Merugu     Naresh       (P.W.1)    who     negotiated     with   P.W.4/Raguri

Srinivasa Rao it is easy for him to identify the accused

No.1/appellant in the Court itself.                Therefore the evidence of

circumstantial witness P.W.4 who is independent not interested

either in the prosecution or defence case, inspires confidence of

this Court and the circumstance of chasing the accused on a

motor cycle while he was proceeding towards Bandar Road on a

motor cycle, after causing injury on the body of Rajani is directly

pointing out his complicity and involvement in murderous assault

of Rajani (deceased).

<p id="p_21">        P.W.2 is no other than mother of deceased Rajani and

Merugu Naresh (P.W.1), according to her testimony Suri Babu

came to her village for works on tractor and he is also called as

Chakravarthi.       The accused No.1 is the said person with two

names. He used to have tiffin at her hotel and slowly developed

illicit intimacy with Rajani who is the daughter of P.W.2/Merugu

Bhagya Lakshmi and sister of P.W.1/Merugu Naresh.                           Though

P.W.2     being     a    mother      of        Rajani   chastised      both         the

appellant/accused No.1 and her daughter they beat her and left

the house saying that they want to marry and stay elsewhere. In

the cross-examination P.W.2 admitted that she did not disclose the

name of the accused No.1 as Chakravarthi to the police and only

stated that his name is Suri Babu, this omission will not go to root

of the case.      She further testified that two persons came to her

hotel and enquired about accused No.1 on the ground that he took

away their motor cycle.           In the cross-examination she admitted

that two persons told her that Suri Babu committed theft of their

motor cycle and she stated to the police that on the basis of news

report that Suri Babu killed her daughter Rajani. The evidence of

P.W.2 is only for the limited purpose of establishing development of

illicit intimacy by Suri Babu who is also known as Chakravarthi

with   her   daughter   and   elopement   of   her   daughter         with

appellant/accused No.1, beating her on her left hand.

</p><p id="p_23">       The prosecution also examined one Simhadri Venkata Rao

(P.W.5) resident of Gudivada under whom accused No.1/appellant

herein was working as watchman. According to his testimony the

appellant/accused No.1 joined as a watchman on tank along with

his wife Rajani on monthly salary of Rs.6,000/- they used to reside

in the shed on the tank bund provided for watchman and they

used to quarrel frequently, as the appellant/accused No.1 was

suspecting character of Rajani and once he cut his hand and also

at another time he made an attempt to consume poison. After one

month from the date of joining duty P.W.1/Merugu Naresh came

and spent on the tank about 10 days, then he secured employment

as watchman on a fish tank at Rudravaram near Bandar and the

deceased left the tanks went to Rudravaram. Later after one week

at about 9.00 a.m., he went to his tank on his motor cycle Hero

Honda bearing No.0133 and he noticed one auto rickshaw at the

watchman shed, when enquired the auto driver told him that he

was engaged to transport refrigerator, TV provided by P.W.5 in the

shed and personal belongings of accused No.1. Then P.W.5 found

fault with accused No.1 and auto driver claiming that he is the

owner of TV and refrigerator as they were provided for him. In the

meanwhile accused No.1/appellant herein started motor cycle as

P.W.5 and went away and later he came to know that he

committed murder of his wife using the motor cycle for conveyance

and identified motor cycle marked as M.O.4.          In the cross-

examination a suggestion was put to P.W.5 that he did not state to

P.W.12 as in Ex.D.5 and followed by another suggestion that the

appellant/accused No.1 never called as Suri Babu and that he is

speaking false at the instance of police. The evidence of P.W.5 is

helpful to establish commission of theft of his motor cycle used in

commission of murder of Rajani and leave the scene of offence.

Therefore his evidence is not directly connected with the causing

murder of Rajani by the appellant/accused.          Therefore, the

circumstances spoken by P.W.5 is only useful to connect the

accused with commission of theft of his motor cycle used in

commission of murder to escape from the scene of offence after

commission of murder of Rajani.        The consistent evidence of

P.Ws.2, 4 and 5 is that accused No.1 is also known as Suri Babu.

Though P.W.1 stated in his examination in chief that Suri Babu

used to visit their hotel and developed illicit contact with Rajani

daughter of P.W.2, the said Suri Babu is the person known as

Chakravarthi i.e. the appellant/accused No.1 and that fact is also

substantiated by the evidence of P.Ws.4 and 5. Apart from that

the confessional statement recorded by the police leading to

discovery is specific that he is also known as Benda Ashok

Chakravarthi @ Chakravarthi @ Ashok @ Suribabu @ Maddela Suri

@ Siva, S/o.Kantha Raju. The core contention of the counsel for

the appellant/accused No.1 before this Court is that the person

who developed illicit contact with Rajani is Suri Babu not

Chakravarthi and the prosecution failed to establish the identity of

Gadelli Ijaiah (P.W.7) who is an agriculturist and resident of

Rudravaram Village in whose presence the scene of offence was

lying in the drainage with bleeding injuries on the neck and fore

head. One Pamarthi Sai Babu (P.W.7) and Merugu Naresh (P.W.1)

removed the body from drainage and kept the same on the road

margin and also spoke about finding cheppals both male and

female, broken bangle pieces on the canal bund. In his presence,

scene of offence was observed and a report was prepared by

P.W.12 marked as Ex.P4/scene observation report and rough

sketch of the scene of offence marked as Ex.P.5 also prepared. His

evidence is only to prove the apparent cause of death of Rajani, not

substantiate piece of evidence and it is a strong circumstance

which completes the links in the chain of circumstances.

</pre><p id="p_40">      To disprove the presence of P.W.1/Merugu Naresh and

P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa Rao, the defence counsel made honest

attempt that there was no engine on the road near the scene of

offence as in Ex.P.5. P.W.12 the investigating officer in the cross-

examination clearly stated that he did not find motor engine on the

road near the scene of offence. Hence, the same was not covered

in Ex.P5. Taking advantage of this piece of evidence the defence

counsel would contend that the presence of P.W.1/Merugu Naresh

at the scene of offence along with P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa Rao who

is the owner of the tanks under whom P.W.1/Merugu Naresh

working as watchman.       But it is the consistent case of the

prosecution from the beginning that P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa Rao is

the owner of fish tanks and they were attending to repairs of diesel

engine on the bund of the tanks which is by the side of the road.

The counsel failed to elicit the distance between the tanks and the

scene of offence and in the absence of eliciting the distance

between the tanks and the scene of offence failure to find motor

engine (diesel engine) for pumping water as admitted by P.W.12 is

insignificant and inconsequential and is of no assistance. Added

to that if the tanks are nearest to the scene of offence when the

accused No.1/appellant assaulted Rajani, P.W.4/Raguri Srinivasa

Rao ought to have heard those cries, but only P.W.4/Raguri

Srinivasa Rao heard cries of P.W.1/Merugu Naresh from a

distance.   Therefore, failure to cover the motor engine (diesel

engine) used for pumping water in Ex.P.5 as admitted by P.W.12 is

not a ground to improbabalise the presence of P.W.1/Merugu

Naresh and proceeding to scene of offence, witnessing the incident

directly, cannot be accepted.

P.W.12/V.Subrahmanyam, the counsel contended that when a

death was caused by two persons allegedly, test identification

parade the evidence of prosecution witnesses shall be thrown over

filed for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_48">section 304-A</a> of the Indian

Penal Code in paras 55 to 59. However, Their Lordships in paras

56 and 57 observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">           &quot;The whole idea of a Test Identification
           Parade is that witnesses who claim to have
           seen the culprits at the time of occurrence are
           to identify them from the midst of other
           persons without any aid or any other source.
           The test is done to check upon their veracity.
           In other words, the main object of holding an
           identification parade, during the investigation
           stage, is to test the money of the witnesses
           based upon first impression and also to enable
           the prosecution to decide whether all or any of
           them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the
           crime.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">               It is equally correct that the code of
           Criminal procedure does not oblige the
           investigating agency to necessarily hold the
           Test Identification Parade. Failure to hold the
           test identification parade while in police
           custody, does not by itself render the evidence
           of identification in court inadmissible or
           unacceptable.     There have been numerous
           cases where the accused is identified by the
           witnesses in the Court for the first time. One
           of the views taken is that identification in
           Court for the first time alone may not from the
           basis of conviction, but this is not an absolute
           rule. The purpose of the Test Identification
           Parade is to test and strengthen the
           trustworthiness of that evidence.          It is
           accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence
           to generally look for corroboration of the
           sworn testimony of the witnesses in court as to
           the identity of the accused who are strangers
           to them, in the form of earlier identification
           proceedings. This rule of prudence is, however
           subjected to exceptions.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_45">

        accused. Failure of prosecution to offer an
        explanation for not holding Test Identification
        Parade for other witness will not ipse jure

</p><p id="p_48">      Thus, in view of the principles laid down in the above

decisions, Test Identification Parade is a part of investigation and

used primarily to strengthen the case of the prosecution and this

rule of prudence is however subject to exceptions. The fact that a

particular witness has been able to identify the accused at an

identification parade is only a circumstance corroborative of the

identification   in   the   Court.        Thus,   it   is   only     a     relevant

consideration which may be examined by the Court in view of other

attendant circumstances and corroborative evidence with reference

to the facts of a given case.

<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">      In view of law declared by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, failure to

Court held that:
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">            &quot;There is no legal impediment in convicting a
            person on testimony of sole witness. Evidence has
            to be weighed and not counted. Test is whether
            evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible and
            trustworthy. Emphasis is on weight and quality of
            evidence, rather than on quantity, multiplicity or
            plurality of witness.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_55">


</p><p id="p_56">         Merely because witnesses are related, it is not a ground to

discard their evidence. In many cases, only relatives are available

for giving evidence, having regard to trend in the present society,

where other than relations, witnesses are not available. However,

evidence of interested witnesses has to be carefully scrutinized as

held by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1176683/" id="a_50">Birender Poddar vs. State of

Bihar13</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_57">         It is not the contention of counsel for the accused

No.1/appellant that P.W.1 is interested witness, but he is a related

witness. When the incident took place while at a place near to the

house of P.W.1 and the tank where he is working more particularly

his presence at the tank near to the scene of offence is probable.

In the absence of any fact elicited in the cross-examination to

disbelieve or discredit the testimony of P.W.1, the Court can rely

on such sole related witness, if it is inspires confidence to record

conviction the accused. The evidence of P.W.1 is corroborated by

the other circumstances, more particularly seizure of M.Os.4 and 5

on the confession made by accused No.1/appellant after his arrest,

leading to discovery and seizure of M.Os.4 and 5 under the cover of

mediators.        Therefore, the confession of accused leading to

shall not give over much importance to a minor discrepancies as to

the alias names of the accused. Time and again the Apex Court

held that &quot;Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter

and shake the basic version of the witnesses, cannot be annexed

with undue importance.         More so when the all important

with her to see off while proceeding to Bandar, on a motor cycle

clearly establish that he had an intention to put an end to her life

as he was suspecting that she is indulging in prostitution with

others and based on the seat of injuries and nature of weapon the

Court can infer that the accused No.1/appellant had an intention

to kill her that those injuries caused on her body found by the

postmortem Dr.T.Vinay Kumar (P.W.10) and issued postmortem
