                    (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and
                    Commerce, Production, Supply and <a href="/doc/1234174/" id="a_8">Distribution) Act</a>, 20033 and
                    which, according to the petitioners, conferred a right upon them to

                    masala or any other chewing material having tobacco or gutka as one
                    of its ingredients . The writ petitioners also appear to have contended
                    that the Food Safety and <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_9">Standards Act</a>, 20064 was not liable to be
                    considered as an enactment empowering the respondents to pass
                    prohibitory orders impeding or impinging upon the rights conferred
                    upon the petitioners by COTPA. The writ petitioners also questioned
                    the validity of the prohibitory orders in light of the ‗declaration of
                    expediency&#x27; as embodied in COTPA and the expression of public
                    interest of the Union taking under its control the tobacco industry by
                    virtue of Entry-52 falling in List-I of the Seventh Schedule of the

                    reproduce the principal arguments and issues which stood framed in
                    the batch of writ petitions.        The learned Single Judge had, upon

                           Tobacco covered under the term ‗Food Industry&#x27;‖.
                           Second, ―Once COTPA occupies the entire domain- cradle to
                           grave- for tobacco; can FSSA encroach upon an ―Occupied
                           Field‖?
</p><p id="p_13">                           Third, ―the enactment of FSSA (in 2006) does not in any manner
                           impinge upon the enforceability of the COTPA (enacted in 2003)
                           which continues to be applicable and in force. There is no
                           ―express‖ or ―implied‖ repeal of the COTPA by the FSSA‖.
                           Fourth, ―A prior ‗special law&#x27; (COTPA) would prevail over a
                           later ‗general law&#x27; (FSSA)‖.
</p><p id="p_14">                           Fifth, ――Food‖ as defined under the FSSA does not include
                           tobacco within its ambit or scope.‖
                           Sixth, that ―the scope, intent and purpose of the FSSA is to
                           establish and regulate the standards for Food. The power to
                           regulate the standards for Food. The power to regulate does not
                           include in its ambit the power to prohibit. In any case, the power to
                           prohibit does not vest in the Food Commissioner at all. The
                           distribution of powers amongst the: (i) Union; (ii) State; and (iii)
                           the Statutory authorities- Food Safety Authority and Food
                           Commissioner; clearly indicates that the Food Commissioner
                           cannot take the decision to prohibit and that too permanently‖.
                           Seventh, that ―the assessment, analysis, management and
                           communication of ―Risk‖ under and in terms of FSSA and the
                           mandatory procedure in terms of <a href="/doc/165219082/" id="a_10">Section 18</a> has not been followed
                           demonstrating that the same has not even been considered in the
                           present case, let alone be followed‖.
</p><p id="p_15">                           Eighth, ―<a href="/doc/135631154/" id="a_11">Section 30(2)(a)</a> confers a very temporary power to
                           address urgent and emergency circumstances. It cannot be used to
                           ―ban‖ or ―prohibit‖ a product or trade in a product. In any case,
                           temporary power cannot be perpetuated by an unfounded and

</p><p id="p_18">                    5.     On due consideration of the aforenoted submissions, the learned
                    Single Judge proceeded to record the following conclusions: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                           ―238. Considering the submissions made and documents and
                           judgments relied by the parties and in view of the detailed
                           discussion and reasoning mentioned herein above, this Court is of
                           the considered view that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                           (a) The impugned Notifications passed by the Commissioner of
                           Food Safety in view of Regulation 2.3.4 in exercise of powers
                           under <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_14">Section 30(2)(a)</a>, is beyond the scope of powers conferred
                           upon him by the FSSA.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                           (b) The COTPA is a comprehensive legislation dealing with the
                           sale and distribution of scheduled tobacco products and therefore,
                           occupies the entire field relating to tobacco products. Therefore,
                           the COTPA, being a special law, occupies the entire field for
                           tobacco and tobacco products and would prevail over the FSSA
                           which is a general law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                           (c) It has never been the intention of the Parliament to impose an
                           absolute ban on manufacture, sale, distribution and storage of
                           tobacco and/or tobacco products. However, the intention of the
                           Parliament is to regulate the trade and commerce of tobacco and
                           tobacco products in accordance with the COTPA, a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_15">Central Act</a>
                           which deals with tobacco industry.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                           (d) The doctrine of implied repeal has no application to the present
                           case as the FSSA and the COTPA occupy different fields i.e., the
                           former applies to the &quot;food industry&quot; while the latter applies to the
                           &quot;tobacco industry&quot;. Therefore, the FSSA does not impliedly repeal
                           the provisions of the COTPA.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                           (e) Tobacco cannot be construed as &quot;food&quot; within the meaning of
                           the provisions of FSSA.</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">                           (f) Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA has to be read in consonance with
                           Section 18 of the FSSA. The power under <a href="/doc/135631154/" id="a_16">Section 30(2)(a)</a> is
                           transitory in nature and the Commissioner of Food Safety can issue
                           prohibition orders only in emergent circumstances after giving an
                           opportunity of being heard to the concerned food operator(s). The

</p><p id="p_21">                    6.     The learned Single Judge has firstly proceeded to examine the
                    scope of the FSSA. The Court ultimately came to conclude that while
                    the FSSA may empower the food safety authorities to establish
                    standards for quality of food, it would not include within its purview
                    the power to prohibit the manufacture, sale, storage and distribution of
                    tobacco and this more so when tobacco products are enlisted in the
                    Schedule of products to be regulated by COTPA. Dealing with the
                    aforesaid issue, the learned Single Judge has held as follows: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                           ―189. The FSSA is an Act to consolidate all laws relating to ―food‖
                           and to establish the FSSAI for laying down science-based
                           standards for articles of food. As per the Preamble of the FSSA, the
                           purpose of the FSSA is to provide safe, wholesome and
                           unadulterated food to consumers. The Statement of Objects and
                           Reasons of COTPA states that it is an Act for regulation of trade
                           and commerce in, and production, supply and distribution of,
                           cigarettes and ―other tobacco products and for matters connected
                           therewith‖.

                           ―prohibit‖ the ―manufacture, sale, storage and distribution‖ of any
                           goods, moreover, when the goods sought to be prohibited pertain to

                           normally include the power to prohibit. A power to regulate
                           implies the continued existence of that which is to be regulated. In

                           Regulations does not include the power to prohibit manufacture,
                           distribution, storage and sale of a product.‖

</p><p id="p_23">                    7.     Turning then to the provisions of Regulation 2.3.4 of the Food
                    Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales)
                    Regulations, 2011, the learned Single Judge observes that the intent
                    of Regulation 2.3.4 is not to prohibit but to merely restrict the use of
                    tobacco and nicotine as ingredients in food products. According to the
                    learned Single Judge, Regulation 2.3.4 cannot be read as empowering
                    the food safety authorities to regulate tobacco itself. The learned
                    Judge accordingly proceeded to hold that the regulation of tobacco
                    would be governed exclusively by the provisions of COTPA. This is
                    evident from the following extract of the impugned judgment: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                           ―193. On the bare perusal of Regulation 2.3.4, it is apparent that
                           the intention is not to prohibit but restrict the use of tobacco or
                           nicotine as ingredients in any food product. In the considered view
                           of this Court, the language of Regulation 2.3.4 does not suggest
                           regulating manufacture, distribution, storage or sale of tobacco or
                           nicotine but amounts to regulating standards of food within the
                           purview of the FSSA. Therefore, what has to be regulated under
                           Regulation 2.3.4 is food without tobacco and not tobacco itself
                           which is a scheduled item under the COTPA, which has to
                           accordingly be regulated under the provisions of COTPA.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_24">                    8.     Proceeding further on the aforesaid subject, the learned Single
                    Judge came to the following conclusion: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                           ―196. In view of the aforementioned, the impugned Notifications
                           passed by the Commissioner of Food Safety in view of Regulation
                           2.3.4 in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_18">Section 30(2)(a)</a>, in so far as they
                           prohibit the use of tobacco and nicotine with respect to scheduled

                           of powers conferred by the FSSA.‖

                    Union to take under its control the tobacco and food industries, the
                    learned Single Judge held as follows: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                           ―197. Section 2 of FSSA provides that it is expedient in public
                           interest that the Union should take under its control the food
                           industry, whereas Section 2 of COTPA provides that it is expedient
                           in the public interest that the Union should take under its control
                           the tobacco industry. On a comparative reading of the
                           aforementioned provisions, it can be seen that the FSSA concerns
                           ―food industry‖ and the COTPA relates to the ―tobacco industry‖.
                           It is pertinent to note that in view of Entry 52 of List I, the
                           Parliament has assumed to itself the legislative power to legislate
                           upon tobacco and food industry. The declaration under Section 2 of
                           FSSA purporting to take over the ―food industry‖ cannot cover
                           tobacco within its ambit as the same has already been covered
                           under the ―tobacco industry‖ with the enactment of the COTPA.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                           198. The COTPA was enacted by the Parliament under Entry 52
                           of List I to Schedule VII of the Constitution and once the
                           Parliament chooses to exercise its competence in terms of Entry 33
                           of List III, it may take over the entire gamut of activities. The
                           power of State Legislatures to enact laws relating to ‗Trade and
                           Commerce within the State&#x27; and ‗Production, supply and
                           distribution of goods&#x27; under Entry 26 and Entry 27 of List II is
                           subject to Entry 33 of List III, which enables the Parliament to
                           legislate with respect to the aforesaid matters in relation to the
                           tobacco industry amongst others. When the COTPA was enacted
                           under Entry 52 of List I read with Entry 33 of List III, the
                           Parliament took under its control the tobacco industry thereby
                           denuding the States to legislate qua the scheduled tobacco products
                           covered under COTPA. Therefore, once the Parliament has
                           exercised power under Entry 52 of List I in order to take the entire
                           tobacco industry under its control, the State Legislatures are not
                           competent to enact laws on the said subject.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                           199. The COTPA is a comprehensive, self-contained, seamless
                           legislation dealing with the sale and distribution of scheduled
                           tobacco products and therefore, occupies the entire field relating to
                           tobacco products. FSSA, on the other hand, is a general legislation.</blockquote>

                           COTPA which is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_19">Central Act</a> enacted solely for the purposes of
                           regulation of tobacco and its products.
</p><p id="p_27">                           200. The COTPA is a special enactment dealing with tobacco
                           and exclusively and comprehensively deal with tobacco and
                           tobacco products. As held in the case of Godawat Pan Masala
                           (supra), COTPA is a special Act intended to deal with tobacco and
                           tobacco products, while the PFA is a general enactment, therefore,
                           the COTPA overrides the provisions of the PFA with regard to the
                           power to prohibit the sale or manufacture of tobacco products
                           which are listed in the Schedule of the COTPA. In Godawat Pan
                           Masala (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court further held that
                           COTPA is a special Act intended to deal with tobacco and tobacco
                           products and hence it will override Section 7(iv) of the PFA. The
                           relevant portion, inter alia, reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_28">                               ―The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco
                              Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of
                              Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and <a href="/doc/1234174/" id="a_20">Distribution)
                              Act</a>, 2003 are directly in conflict with the provisions of
                              <a href="/doc/147088853/" id="a_21">Section 7(iv)</a> of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act,
                              1954. The former Act is a special Act intended to deal with
                              tobacco and tobacco products particularly, while the latter
                              enactment is a general enactment. Thus, the Act 34 of 2003
                              being a special Act, and of later origin, overrides the
                              provisions of <a href="/doc/147088853/" id="a_22">Section 7(iv)</a> of the Prevention of Food
                              Adulteration Act, 1954 with regard to the power to prohibit
                              the sale or manufacture of tobacco products which are listed
                              in the Schedule to the Act 34 of 2003‖
</p><p id="p_29">                           202. Even the COTPA does not ban the sale and distribution of
                           tobacco and tobacco products except for imposition of certain
                           conditions and various checks and balances to regulate the
                           advertisement and sale thereof. Furthermore, whether an article is
                           to be prohibited as res extra commercium is a matter of legislative
                           policy and must arise out of an Act of the Legislature and not
                           merely by a Notification issued by an executive authority. Thus,
                           the trade, sale and distribution of tobacco is permissible subject to
                           certain restrictions imposed under the COTPA and the same has

                           safe and wholesome food for human consumption and incidental
                           matters. Whereas the COTPA is a comprehensive legislation which
                           deals with advertisement, trade, sale and distribution of tobacco
                           and tobacco products. The Union Government assumed control to
                           legislate with regard to both the food industry and the tobacco
                           industry, therefore, it is certain that at the time of enactment of the
                           FSSA, the Legislature was not only aware and conscious of the
                           existence of the COTPA, which was enacted in 2003 but made
                           various rules under the COTPA and carried out multiple
                           amendments in provisions and rules framed thereunder even after
                           the enactment of the FSSA in 2006.
</p><p id="p_31">                           206. Accordingly, it can be observed that the COTPA, being a
                           ‗special law&#x27;, occupies the field for tobacco and tobacco products
                           and would prevail over the FSSA which is a ‗general law&#x27;.‖

</p><p id="p_32">                    10.    Proceeding further, the learned Single Judge took up for
                    consideration the question of whether FSSA could be said to have
                    impliedly repealed COTPA. It ultimately came to conclude that, since
                    both FSSA and COTPA occupy distinct fields, the former cannot be
                    said to have impliedly repealed the provisions of COTPA.

<p id="p_33">                    11.    One of the principal issues which appears to have been urged
                    for the consideration of the learned Single Judge was whether tobacco
                    products could be termed as ―food‖. Taking note of the divergent
                    views which had been expressed by different High Courts on the said
                    question, the learned Single Judge observed as under: -

                           regulate standards and/or manufacture and sale of tobacco. In fact,
                           the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food
                           Additives) Regulations, 2011, does not define tobacco, because no
                           standards can be possibly laid down for tobacco, which further
                           reinforces the fact that tobacco is not ―food‖. If ―tobacco‖ is

                           then intent/objective with which Regulation 2.3.4 is framed (i.e., to
                           regulate standards of food under the FSSA) would be rendered
                           redundant. Moreover, such an interpretation would be in complete
                           contravention of the provisions of the FSSA, which is a
                           comprehensive legislation dealing with the food industry.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                           219. It is further worthwhile to note that Regulation 2.3.4

                           products thereby regulating the standards for ―food‖ and not
                           standards or trade in ―tobacco‖. Hence, the said Regulation cannot
                           be said to be in conflict with any of the provisions of the COTPA.
                           The said Regulation merely lays down general principle for food
                           safety and cannot in any manner be read to construe that ―tobacco‖
                           is ―food‖ within the meaning of the FSSA.

                           not include tobacco within its ambit or scope and therefore,
                           tobacco cannot be termed as ―food‖ within the meaning of the

                    question of whether Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA could be recognized
                    as empowering the Commissioner (Food Safety) to pass a prohibitory
                    order and which could be extended to operate beyond a period of one
                    year. Proceeding to rule on the aforesaid issue, the learned Single

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                           ―221. In terms of Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA, the power to

                           limited and subjected to the product sought to be prohibited, being

                           In order for a prohibition to be exercised, alternative policies are to
                           be evaluated; interested parties are to be consulted and risk
                           analysis, risk assessment and risk management has to be

                           Section 18 of the FSSA. Moreover, the use of the word ―shall‖ in
                           Section 18 of the FSSA clearly demonstrates its mandatory nature
                           of the procedure to be followed. Accordingly, the powers conferred
                           upon the Commissioner of Food Safety have to be exercised

                           risk assessment or risk management has been made in the present
                           case. Further, there has been no reference to emergent

                              It was further held, in Olga Tellis (supra), that it must further

                              question of complying with the principles of natural justice.
                              The Supreme Court, in Godawat Pan Masala (supra), held
                              that if such arguments were to be accepted, then, every
                              executive act could masquerade as a legislative act and
                              escape the procedural mechanism of fair play and natural
                              justice. In this regard, reliance was placed on the case of
                              State of T.N. v. K. Sabanayagam, (1998) 1 SCC 318, wherein
                              it has been observed that even when exercising a legislative
                              function, the delegate may, in a given, case be required to
                              consider the viewpoint, which may be likely to be affected by
                              the exercise of power.
</p><p id="p_46">                              31. As pointed out, in K. Sabanayagam (supra), a conditional
                              legislation can be broadly classified into three categories:
                              a. when the legislature has completed its task of enacting a
                              statute, the entire superstructure of the legislation is ready
                              but its future applicability to a given area is left to the
                              subjective satisfaction of the delegate.
                              b. where the delegate has to decide whether and under what
                              circumstances a legislation, which has already come into
                              force, is to be partially withdrawn from operation in a given
                              area or in given cases so as not to be applicable to a given
                              class of persons who are otherwise admittedly governed by
                              the Act; and
                              c. where the exercise of conditional legislation would depend
                              upon satisfaction of the delegate on objective facts placed by
                              one class of persons seeking benefit of such an exercise with
                              a view to deprive the rival class of persons, who, otherwise,
                              might have already got statutory benefits under the Act and
                              who are likely to lose the existing benefit, because of exercise
                              of such a power by the delegate.
</p><p id="p_47">                              32. The Supreme Court emphasised, in K. Sabanayagam
                              (supra), that in the third type of cases, the satisfaction of the
                              delegate must necessarily be based on objective
                              considerations and, irrespective of the fact as to whether the
                              exercise of such power involves a judicial or quasi-judicial
                              function, it has to be nonetheless treated a function, which
                              requires objective consideration of relevant factual data
                              pressed into service by one side, which could be rebutted by
                              the other side, who would be adversely affected if such
                              exercise of power is undertaken by the delegate.

                              emerge with respect to the issuance of prohibition orders
                              under <a href="/doc/1620454/" id="a_31">Section 30(a)</a> of the Food Act:--
</p><p id="p_50">                              a. Before passing of the order, there must be emergent
                              circumstances based on objective materials that in the
                              interest of public health, the manufacture, storage,
                              distribution or sale of any article of food, either in the whole
                              of the State or any area or part thereof, be prohibited;
                              b. The tenure of the prohibitory order has to be temporay in
                              nature and must not exceed 1 (one) year in its entirety; now,
                              any extension of the prohibitory order would amount to
                              virtually and effectively making a legislation by executive
                              fiat;

                              and
                              d. Since the prohibition is with reference to a food business
                              operator, the prohibition must indicate the name of food
                              business operator and also the brand name, if any, under
                              which the food business is carried out.‖

                           for which such prohibitory order may be passed is not more than
                           one (1) year. However, it has been noted that the impugned
                           Notifications under challenge in the present case have been issued
                           year after year in a mechanical manner without following the
                           general principles laid down under Section 18 and 30(2)(a) of the
                           FSSA, which is a clear abuse of the powers conferred upon the
                           Commissioner of Food Safety under the FSSA. This clearly
                           amounts to be an act which only the Legislature is entitled to
                           exercise and no such power has been vested in the Commissioner
                           of Food Safety in terms of the provisions of the FSSA. Thus, it is
                           clear that Respondent No.1 has clearly exceeded its power and
                           authority in issuance of the impugned Notifications in
                           contravention of the powers conferred upon him under the FSSA.‖

                    The writ petitioners had essentially asserted that bearing in mind the
                    deleterious effect of both those categories of tobacco products on
                    public health, there existed no justification for a prohibition having
                    been imposed in respect of smokeless tobacco alone. The aforesaid
                    submission found favour with the learned Single Judge who ultimately
                    came to record as under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                           ―228. It has been argued on behalf of the Petitioners that the
                           Respondents are purporting to ban an artificially created sub-
                           category of tobacco, namely, ‗smokeless tobacco&#x27; which includes
                           chewing tobacco, pan masala, gutka, etc.and other scheduled
                           tobacco products listed under the COTPA. However, there appears
                           to be no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the
                           impugned Notifications prohibiting manufacture, storage, sale and
                           distribution of smokeless tobacco products. Admittedly, the object
                           sought to be achieved by the said prohibitory order(s) in the nature
                           of the impugned Notifications, is ―public health‖. However, there
                           is no justification whatsoever for making such a differentiation in
                           smokeless and smoking tobacco, which may be different in their
                           forms but are no different in terms of their impact on public health.
                           It is worthwhile to note that the COTPA, which is the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_34">Central Act</a>
                           governing the tobacco industry, does not make any such distinction
                           between smokeless and smoking tobacco under its Schedule.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                           229. In the light of the aforesaid observations, it is apparent that the
                           said classification/distinction between smokeless and smoking
                           tobacco has no connection with the object sought to be achieved by
                           the impugned Notifications. In fact, the said discrimination which
                           is being promoted by the impugned Notifications encourages
                           smoking tobacco over smokeless tobacco, thereby being not only
                           clearly discriminatory but in violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14</a> of the
                           Constitution.</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">                           230. Further, the impugned Notifications have purportedly being
                           issued in the garb of Regulation 2.3.4 which bars the usage of
                           tobacco and nicotine in any food article. However, admittedly,
                           tobacco and nicotine are not only found in smokeless tobacco but
                           also in smoking tobacco, which has conveniently been excluded
                           from the rigours of the impugned Notifications. Therefore, there is
                           no justification for the classification between smokeless and

                              between smokeless and smoking tobacco does not fall under

                              <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_36">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_56">                              231. It has further been argued on behalf of the Petitioners that the
                              burden of proof rests upon the Respondents to justify that the
                              creation of an artificial sub-classification within tobacco products,
                              i.e., smokeless and smoking tobacco, bears a clear or reasonable
                              nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned

                              Court is of the view that the said burden has not been sufficiently
                              discharged by the Respondents, which makes the said
                              classifications/ distinctions falling short of passing the test of

                           Supreme Court in the matter of Ankur Gutka (supra) and Central
                           Arecanut (supra) that notwithstanding the complete ban imposed
                           on Gutka and Pan Masala with tobacco and/or nicotine in such
                           States, the manufacturers have devised a subterfuge for selling
                           Gutka and Pan Masala in separate pouches and the ban is being
                           flouted in this manner. In view of the interim directions issued by
                           the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, it is clear that compliance of the ban
                           imposed on manufacturing and sale of Gutka and Pan Masala with
                           tobacco and/or nicotine has to be ensured. Even though the main
                           matter(s) is pending adjudication, the aforesaid direction passed by
                           the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court is in line with Regulation 2.3.4 as it
                           directs ―for compliance of the ban imposed on manufacturing and
                           sale of Gutkha and Pan Masala with tobacco and/or nicotine‖. The
                           essence of Regulation 2.3.4 is to prohibit use of tobacco and
                           nicotine as ingredients in any food products and not prohibit the
                           manufacture and sale of tobacco and/or nicotine per se. In view
                           thereof, the present case is distinguishable as it relates to chewing
                           tobacco in itself and not with Gutka and Pan Masala with tobacco
                           and/or nicotine.‖



</blockquote><p id="p_59">                    15.    The writ petitions ultimately came to be allowed with the
                    impugned notifications being quashed and the learned Single Judge
                    coming to conclude that the Commissioner (Food Safety) had not only
                    exceeded the power and the authority conferred upon him under the
                    FSSA but also in contravention thereof. Before proceeding to notice
                    the submissions, which were addressed on these appeals, the Court
                    deems it apposite to notice the relevant statutory provisions as it is in
                    the backdrop of those provisions that the challenge would ultimately
                    have to be evaluated.

                            Food Safety and Standards Bill, 2005. The main objective of the
                            Bill is to bring out a single statute relating to food and to
                            provide for a systematic and scientific development of Food
                            Processing Industries. It is proposed to establish the Food Safety
                            and Standards Authority of India, which will fix food standards
                            and regulate/monitor the manufacturing, import, processing,
                            distribution and sale of food, so as to ensure safe and
                            wholesome food for the people. The Food Authority will be
                            assisted by Committees and Panels in fixing standards and by a
                            Central Advisory Committee in prioritization of the work. The
                            enforcement of the legislation will be through the State
                            Commissioner for Food Safety, his officers and Panchayati
                            Raj/Municipal bodies.

                            Codex Alimentaries Commission (which related to food safety
                            norms). In a nutshell, the Bill takes care of international
                            practices and envisages on overarching policy framework and

                    Act essentially aimed at consolidating laws relating to food and to
                    establish the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India6 for
                    laying down science-based standards for articles of food and to
                    regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import. The
                    principal objective of the Act is to facilitate food safety and to ensure
                    availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption and
                    for matters connected therewith. The FSSA also carries a declaration

</p><p id="p_109">                    31.       While the Court would be dealing with the decision in Godawat
                    in greater detail in the latter parts of this decision, it may, at this stage,
                    only be noted that one of the questions which stood formulated was
                    whether pan masala could be construed as ―food‖. That question was
                    unequivocally answered in the affirmative with the Court rejecting the
                    contention that pan masala could not be said to fall within the ambit of
                    Section 2(v) of the PFA.        The orders issued by the Food Health
                    Authority however came to be set aside with the Supreme Court
                    noting that the notifications issued were ultra vires the Act,
                    unconstitutional and void. The Supreme Court while arriving at that
                    conclusion had held that Section 7(iv) of the PFA was not an
                    independent source of power which could be availed of or invoked by
                    the State authorities. It found that the power of the State Food Health
                    Authority could have been exercised only under the relevant Rules
                    which stood framed. It is also pertinently observed that the powers so
                    conferred on the Food Health Authority was transitory in nature and
                    that the power to prohibit or ban an article of food was one which
                    stood vested exclusively in the Union Government in light of the
                    provisions contained in <a href="/doc/30834104/" id="a_57">Section 23</a>(1-A)(f) of the PFA.

                    Narayan, learned ASC appearing for the GNCTD, addressed the
                    following submissions. Mr. Narayan, at the outset, submitted that the
                    writ petitioners as well as the learned Single Judge clearly erred in
                    construing the Impugned Notifications as being directed towards the
                    manufacture, storage and sale of tobacco. Learned counsel submitted
                    that the Impugned Notifications were never intended to either regulate
                    or prohibit either pure tobacco or raw tobacco. Learned counsel laid

                    emphasis on the fact that the notifications sought to prohibit the sale
                    of tobacco which is flavoured, scented or mixed with other
                    ingredients. It was his submissions that tobacco when mixed with
                    flavoring or scenting agents or other ingredients clearly falls within
                    the definition of food as contemplated under the FSSA. Learned
                    counsel submitted that the primary objective of the Impugned
                    Notifications was to enforce and implement the prohibition on sale of
                    flavoured or scented tobacco and to address the modus adopted by the
                    writ petitioners and other similar manufacturers of making available
                    for sale chewing tobacco in a pouch separated from pan masala and to
                    thereby defeat the ban on gutka. This ban, according to Mr. Narayan,
                    was sought to be circumvented by selling the aforenoted two products
                    in separate sachets/packets and          sometimes    as     a composite
                    combination.
</p>
<p id="p_115">                    35.    Mr. Narayan submitted that the moment tobacco is mixed with
                    pan masala, it would clearly fall foul of Regulation 2.3.4. It was
                    contended that it was the aforesaid fact which weighed upon the
                    appellants to issue the Impugned Notifications. Mr. Narayan further
                    submitted that the Impugned Notifications themselves came to be
                    promulgated in order to effect compliance with the orders passed by
                    the Supreme Court in Ankur Gutka and Central Arecanut. Learned
                    counsel drew the attention of the Court to the order dated 07
                    December 2010 passed in Ankur Gutka where amongst various other
                    directions, the Supreme Court called upon the Solicitor General to

                            Several studies, majority of them from India, have reported a
                            strong association between smokeless tobacco use and oral
                            premalignant/precancerous      lesions     like     leukoplakia,
                            erythroplakia, submucous fibrosis or lichen planus (either alone
                            or in combination) (Annexure 1(d), 39 - 45). The risk of these
                            lesions has been found to increase with the duration and
                            frequency of smokeless tobacco use (Annexure 1 (d), 39, 42).

                            of an increased risk of oral cancer with the use of different
                            forms of smokeless tobacco used in the country (Gutkha, mishri,
                            gudaku, khaini, etc) (Annexure 46 - 55). Similar results are seen
                            in International studies and reviews including the IARC
                            monograph (Annexure 1 (d), 56, 57). There is also good
                            evidence to suggest that the risk of developing oral cancer is
                            directly associated with the duration and frequency of tobacco

</p><p id="p_130">                    38.       It becomes pertinent to note that NIHFW had taken note of the
                    Global Adult Tobacco Survey India13 and which had reported that
                    more than 35% of adults in India use tobacco in some form or the
                    other. That report had further recorded that out of the aforesaid
                    percentage, 21% adults consumed smokeless tobacco, 9% were
                    smokers and 5% were those who used to indulge in smoking as well
                    as in consumption of smokeless tobacco. The number of tobacco
                    users in India were estimated to stand at 274.9 million of which 163.7
                    million were estimated to be users of only smokeless tobacco, 68.9
                    million were smokers and 42.3 million users were those who indulged
                    in the consumption of both. GATS India had further found that the
                    Quit Ratio for the users of smokeless tobacco was around 5%.
                    Proceeding further to account for the harmful effects associated with
                    the use of tobacco, NIHFW found that the consumption of smokeless
                    tobacco was not only the leading cause of various categories of
                    cancers, it had a direct impact on mortality and was also the root cause
                    of       various   non-cancerous     diseases   including      hypertension,
                    cardiovascular       diseases,   nervous   system    diseases,    metabolic
                    abnormalities and poor reproductive health. NIHFW also estimated
                    the economic costs of treating smokeless tobacco as standing at a
                    staggering USD 285 million. It was further observed that the total
                    economic cost of tobacco use was reportedly USD 1.7 million.

                           Most of the relevant studies identified are from India, Sweden and
                           USA with studies from India making the biggest contribution.
                           There is strong and consistent evidence from a number of studies to
                           indicate significant risk of oral cancer and pharyngeal cancer,
                           oesophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer with smokeless tobacco
                           use. The risk of these cancers is found to increase with increasing
                           dosage and frequency of smokeless tobacco use.
                           Results from several studies suggest presence of strong and
                           consistent evidence that smokeless tobacco is significantly
                           associated with poor oro-dental health, risk of hypertension and
                           cardiovascular diseases, and adverse effects on reproductive health
                           (especially during pregnancy with birth complications, fetal loss,
                           low birth weight, prematurity). The evidence available for other
                           diseases/conditions is limited but consistent in reporting increased
                           risk of all-cause mortality and all-cause cancer mortality in female
                           users, and increased risk of cerebrovascular stroke, metabolic
                           abnormalities, oesophageal dieases, and respiratory diseases among
                           all users.
</p><p id="p_133">                           There is also some evidence to suggest that the total healthcare
                           economic cost of tobacco use in India is many times more than the
                           annual government expenditure on tobacco control and about 16%
                           more than the total tax revenue generated from tobacco.‖

</p><p id="p_134">                    40.    The aforesaid report came to be duly placed before the Supreme
                    Court in the proceedings aforenoted. It would be pertinent to note that
                    by this time, FSSA had already come into force. According to the
                    Appellants, the Prohibition Regulations 2011 were enforced with
                    effect from 05 August 2011 and saw the enforcement of Regulation
                    2.3.4. According to Mr. Narayan, the said Regulation was directly
                    correlated to the various findings which had come to be recorded by
                    NIHFW and was clearly aimed at fighting the aforesaid scourge. Mr.
                    Narayan further drew the attention of the Court to a communication of
                    21 November 2012, issued by the Special Secretary in the Ministry of
                    Health of the Union Government which had advised States to consider

                    the passing of necessary orders at the State level to ban the
                    manufacture and sale of gutka, pan masala and other chewable
                    products having tobacco and nicotine. The aforesaid advisory sought
                    to draw sustenance from Regulation 2.3.4 as well as the decision taken
                    by the Government of Mizoram which had proceeded to ban the
                    aforesaid articles.

<p id="p_135">                    41.    Ankur Gutka thereafter came to be called on 03 April 2013
                    before the Supreme Court. In the aforesaid proceedings, the Supreme
                    Court recorded the statement made on behalf of the Union that
                    Governments of 23 States and Administrators of 5 Union Territories
                    had proceeded to issue notifications imposing a complete ban on gutka
                    and pan masala with tobacco. The Additional Solicitor General had
                    also referred to a subterfuge adopted by manufacturers of the aforesaid
                    articles who were stated to be attempting to overcome the ban by
                    selling gutka and pan masala in a convenient twin packet packaged to
                    facilitate mixing of tobacco with spice mixtures by consumers.
                    Taking note of the aforesaid, the Supreme Court proceeded to pass the
                    following directions: -

                    and Union Territories in terms of its letter of 09 October 2017. It was
                    the submission of Mr. Narayan that since the impugned Notifications
                    had been issued principally to give effect to the binding directives of

                    is clearly an article which is intended for human consumption and

                    According to learned counsel, the principal intent of Regulation 2.3.4
                    is to ensure that tobacco and nicotine are not used as ingredients in
                    any food product. Learned counsel laid emphasis upon the fact that
                    pan masala, undisputedly, would constitute food and would fall within
                    the ambit of <a href="/doc/126285711/" id="a_61">Section 3(1)(j)</a>. Mr. Narayan laid emphasis on the subtle
                    and yet significant distinction between the definition of food as
                    contained in the Act in contrast to how the said expression was
                    defined under PFA. Mr. Narayan submitted that PFA had defined
                    food to mean ‗any article used as food or drink for human
                    consumption including any article which ordinarily enters into or is
                    used in the composition or preparation of human food&#x27;. According to
                    Mr. Narayan, the FSSA defines food in a more expansive manner by
                    defining it to mean ‗any substance which is intended for human
                    consumption&#x27;. Emphasis was laid on <a href="/doc/126285711/" id="a_62">Section 3(1)(j)</a> employing the
                    expressions ―means‖, ―includes‖ as well as ―but does not include‖.
                    Mr. Narayan submitted that <a href="/doc/126285711/" id="a_63">Section 3(1)(j)</a> thus not only explicitly
                    defines and describes food as envisioned under the Act, it also and
                    simultaneously includes various articles which would fall within its
                    ambit. It was also stressed that only certain articles such as animal
                    feed, live animals, plants prior to harvesting, drugs and medicinal
                    products, cosmetics, narcotic or psychotropic substances are

                    specifically excluded. Learned counsel sought to highlight the fact
                    that pan masala or gutka have not been placed in the list of excluded
                    items and thus reinforcing their submission that they would fall within
                    the ambit of food as defined.
</p>
<p id="p_144">                    46.       It was submitted that pan masala in any case was a food product
                    which was specifically dealt with both under the PFA as well as the
                    Regulations framed under the Act. This, according to learned counsel,
                    would clearly be evident from a reading of Rule 44J of the 1955 Rules
                    and Clause 2.11.5 of the Food Products Regulations 2011.                           Mr.
                    Narayan then submitted that even prior to the promulgation of the
                    FSSA, the word ‗food&#x27; had consistently been conferred an expansive
                    meaning. Reliance in this regard was placed on the following pertinent
                    observations as appearing in the decision of the Supreme Court in
                    <a href="/doc/1036267/" id="a_64">State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulabchand Shah14</a> which had held
                    turmeric to be food stuff. This is evident from the following passages
                    of this decision:-

                                parties to the earlier decision; Salter, J. was not. He held that
                                though tea had been held in the earlier case not to be a ―food‖
                                for the purpose of the Food Hoarding Order of 1917, it was a

                            of these laws though Darling, J. preferred to adhere to his earlier
                            view. All three Judges also held that the provisions were wide
                            enough to enable the Food Controller to hit at articles which
                            were not food at all, such as sacks and tin containers (Darling,
                            J.) so long as he was able by these means even indirectly to
                            regulate the supply of ―food‖, but that portion of the decision
                            does not concern us here because the laws they were interpreting
                            were more widely phrased.
</p><p id="p_146">                            19. Now the comparison of one Act with another is dangerous,
                            especially when the Act used for comparison is an <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_66">English Act</a>
                            and a wartime measure, and I have no intention of falling into
                            that error. I am concerned here with the Act before me and must
                            interpret its provisions uninfluenced by expressions, however
                            similar, used in other Acts. I have referred to the cases discussed
                            above, not for purposes of comparison but to show that the
                            terms ―food‖ and ―foodstuffs‖ can be used in both a wide and a
                            narrow sense and that the circumstances and background can
                            alone determine which is proper in any given case.
</p><p id="p_147">                            20. Turning to the Act with which we are concerned, it will be
                            necessary again to advert to its history. Rule 81(2) was wide and
                            all-embracing and the Order of 1944 clearly fell within its ambit.
                            It is also relevant to note that one of the purposes of the Order,
                            as disclosed in its Preamble, was to ―maintain
                            supplies essential to the life of the community‖. As turmeric was
                            specifically included with certain other spices, it is clear that
                            turmeric was then considered to be a commodity essential to the
                            life of the community, that is to say, it was considered an
                            essential commodity and not merely a luxury which at a time of
                            austerity could be dispensed with.
</p><p id="p_148">                            21. Then, when we turn to the Ordinance and the Act of 1946,
                            we find from the Preamble that the legislature considered that it
                            was still necessary--
</p><p id="p_149">                               ―... to provide for the continuance ... of powers to control

                              therein.‖
                                                                        (emphasis supplied)
                            The Ordinance is in the same terms.
</p>
<p id="p_150">                            22. Now I have no doubt that had the Central Government re-
                            promulgated the Order of 1944 in 1946 after the passing of
                            either the Ordinance or the Act of 1946, the Order would have
                            been good. As we have seen, turmeric falls within the wider
                            definition of ―food‖ and ―foodstuffs‖ given in a dictionary of
                            international standing as well as in several English decisions. It
                            is, I think, as much a ―foodstuff‖, in its wider meaning, as
                            sausage, skins and baking powder and tea. In the face of all that
                            I would find it difficult to hold that an article like turmeric
                            cannot fall within the wider meaning of the term ―foodstuffs‖.
                            Had the Order of 1944 not specified turmeric and had it merely
                            prohibited forward contracts in ―foodstuffs‖ I would have held,
                            in line with the earlier tea case, that that is not a proper way of
                            penalising a man for trading in an article which would not
                            ordinarily be considered as a foodstuff. But in the face of the
                            Order of 1944, which specifically includes turmeric, no one can
                            complain that his attention was not drawn to the prohibition of
                            trading in this particular commodity and if, in spite of that, he
                            chooses to disregard the Order and test its validity in a court of
                            law, he can hardly complain that he was trapped or taken
                            unawares; whatever he may have thought he was at any rate
                            placed on his guard. As I see it, the test here is whether the
                            Order of 1944 would have been a good order had it been re-
                            promulgated after the Ordinance of 1946. In my opinion, it
                            would, and from that it follows that it is saved by the saving
                            clauses of the Ordinance and the Act.
</p><p id="p_151">                            23. I have already set out <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_68">Section 5</a> of the Ordinance. In my
                            opinion, the Order of 1944 falls within its purview, and if it is
                            saved by that, it is equally saved by <a href="/doc/19802021/" id="a_69">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_153">                                24. In my opinion, the conviction was good and the High Court
                                was wrong in setting it aside, but though the matter has no
                                relevance here because of the undertaking given by the learned
                                Solicitor General not to proceed against the respondent any
                                further in this matter, I think it right to observe that the attitude
                                of the learned English Judges in the first tea case would not be
                                without relevance on the question of sentence in many cases of
                                this kind. There can, I think, be no doubt that businessmen who
                                are not lawyers might well be misled into thinking that the
                                Ordinance and the Act did not intend to keep the Order of 1944
                                alive because the Order related to certain specified spices while
                                the Ordinance and the Act changed the nomenclature and
                                limited themselves to ―foodstuffs‖, a term which, on a narrow
                                view, would not include condiments and spices. However, these
                                observations are not relevant here because we are not asked to
                                restore either the conviction or the sentence. In view of that,
                                there will be no further order and the acquittal will be left as it
                                stands.‖

                              explained the botany of betal nut, drew our attention to Dr
                              Nandkarni&#x27;s Indian Materia Medica, invited us to great Susruta&#x27;s
                              reference to this aromatic stimulant, in a valiant endeavour to
                              persuade us to hold that supari was more medicinal than edible.
                              We are here concerned with a law regulating adulteration of food
                              which affects the common people in their millions and their
                              health. We are dealing with a commodity which is consumed by
                              the ordinary man in houses, hotels, marriage parties and even
                              routinely. In the field of legal interpretation, dictionary
                              scholarship and precedent-based connotations cannot become a
                              universal guide or semantic tyrant, oblivious of the social context
                              subject of legislation and object of the law. The meaning of
                              common words relating to common articles consumed by the
                              common people, available commonly and contained in a statute
                              intended to protect the community generally, must be gathered
                              from the common sense understanding of the word. <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_72">The Act</a>
                              defines ―food‖ very widely as covering any article used as food
                              and every component which enters into it, and even flavouring
                              matter and condiments. It is commonplace knowledge that the
                              word ―food‖ is a very general term and applies to all that is eaten
                              by men for nourishment and takes in subsidiaries. Is supari eaten
                              with relish by men for taste and nourishment? It is. And so it is
                              food. Without tarrying further on this unusual argument we hold
                              that supari is food within the meaning of <a href="/doc/49586224/" id="a_73">Section 2(v)</a> of the Act.‖

                            food or drink for human consumption and any article which
                            ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or
                            preparation of human food is ―food‖. It is not necessary that it is
                            intended for human consumption or for preparation of human
                            food. It is also irrelevant that it is described or exhibited as
                            intended for some other use. It is enough if the article is
                            generally or commonly used for human consumption or in the
                            preparation of human food. It is notorious that there are,
                            unfortunately, in our vast country, large segments of population,
                            who, living as they do, far beneath ordinary subsistence level,
                            are ready to consume that which may otherwise be thought as
                            not fit for human consumption. In order to keep body and soul
                            together, they are often tempted to buy and use as food, articles
                            which are adulterated and even unfit for human consumption but
                            which are sold at inviting prices, under the pretence or without
                            pretence that they are intended to be used for purposes other
                            than human consumption. It is to prevent the exploitation and
                            self-destruction of these poor, ignorant and illiterate persons that
                            the definition of ―food‖ is couched in such terms as not to take
                            into account whether an article is intended for human
                            consumption or not. In order to be ―food‖ for the purposes of the
                            Act, an article need not be ―fit‖ for human consumption; it need
                            not be described or exhibited as intended for human
                            consumption; it may even be otherwise described or exhibited; it
                            need not even be necessarily intended for human consumption;</blockquote>
<p id="p_157">                            it is enough if it is generally or commonly used for human
                            consumption or in the preparation of human food. Where an
                            article is generally or commonly not used for human
                            consumption or in the preparation of human food but for some
                            other purpose, notwithstanding that it may be capable of being
                            used, on rare occasions, for human consumption or in the
                            preparation of human food, it may be said, depending on the
                            facts and circumstances of the case, that it is not ―food‖. In such
                            a case the question whether it is intended for human
                            consumption or in the preparation of human food may become
                            material. But where the article is one which is generally or
                            commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of
                            human food, there can be no question but that the article is
                            ―food‖. Gingelly oil, mixed or not with groundnut oil or some
                            other oil, whether described or exhibited as an article of food for
                            human consumption or as an article for external use only is
                            ―food‖ within the meaning of the definition contained in Section
                            2(v) of the Act.‖

</p><p id="p_158">                    49.       It was submitted that the tests propounded in Pyarli K. Tejani
                    were then reiterated by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/902119/" id="a_75">Krishna Gopal Sharma
                    &amp; Anr. v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi17</a> where the Supreme Court held
                    that both pan masala as well as mouth freshener would undoubtedly
                    fall within the ambit of food as defined under the PFA. The relevant
                    parts of the aforesaid judgment are reproduced hereinbelow: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_125">                              &quot;8. After giving our careful consideration to the facts and circumstances of
                              the case it appears to us that at the relevant time when the samples of the
                              pan masala and the mouth freshner were taken, the saccharin content as
                              found by the public analyst in the said articles of food was in violation of
                              Rule 47 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules. The pan masala and
                              the mouth freshner are undoubtedly within the meaning of ‗food&#x27; under
                              <a href="/doc/181597170/" id="a_76">Section 2(v)</a> of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. ‗Food&#x27; under the
                              said Act has been defined very widely. The validity of Rule 47 prior to its
                              amendment in 1993 restricting the user of saccharin in pan masala cannot
                              be challenged on the ground of arbitrary and capricious exercise of power
                              by the rule-making authority. It has not been demonstrated that despite
                              widely accepted view by the experts about the effect on saccharin on
                              human system on the basis of information flowing from research and
                              analysis, the restriction of user of saccharin in pan masala or mouth
                              freshner as imposed in Rule 47 of the Rules at the relevant time was
                              wholly arbitrary, unjust and capricious. Human knowledge is not static.</blockquote>
<p id="p_159">                              The conception about the harmful effect of saccharin on human system has
                              undergone changes because of information derived from further research
                              and analysis. The knowledge about the effect of saccharin on human
                              system as accepted today may undergo a change in future on the basis of
                              further knowledge flowing from subsequent research and analysis and it
                              may not be unlikely that previous view about saccharin may be found to
                              be correct later on. If the rule-making authority on the basis of human
                              knowledge widely accepted by the expert framed rule by imposing
                              restriction of user of saccharin in pan masala or mouth freshner at a
                              particular point of time, such exercise of power must be held to have been
                              validly made, founded on good reasons; and challenge of the Rule on the
                              score of arbitrary and capricious exercise of power must fail. In this

                           dealer in scented ‗supari&#x27; was charged for the offence of having sold and
                           retained for selling scented ‗supari&#x27; with saccharin and cyclamate, in
                           contravention of <a href="/doc/199096811/" id="a_78">Section 7(i)(ii)</a> and Rule 47 of Prevention of Food
                           Adulteration Rules. In the said case, because of such contravention, the
                           dealer was prosecuted for an offence punished under <a href="/doc/52407393/" id="a_79">Section 16(1)(a)(i)</a> of
                           the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The dealer was convicted by the
                           learned Magistrate by imposing a fine of Rs 100. On revision, the High
                           Court enhanced the punishment to the statutory minimum of six months&#x27;
                           imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1000. At the hearing of the appeal before
                           this Court, there was no dispute that the article in question which was sold
                           contained saccharin and cyclamate. It was however urged that <a href="/doc/155682818/" id="a_80">Section
                           23(i)(b)</a> empowered the framing of Rules regarding the articles of food for
                           which standards were to be prescribed. It was contended that ‗supari&#x27; was
                           not a food. It was further contended that neither saccharin nor cyclamate
                           was a biochemical risk and the blanket ban on the use of those substances
                           was unconstitutional amounting to unreasonable restriction on the freedom
                           of trade guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_81">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. It was also urged
                           that although saccharin was permitted to be used in carbonated water,
                           restriction of user of saccharin in ‗supari&#x27; amounted to hostile
                           discrimination.‖

                                India</a>, (2004) 1 SCC 256] . In our view, this judgment is of no aid
                                to us. In the first place, this judgment arises under the provisions
                                of the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_86">Essential Commodities Act</a>, 1955 read with the Tamil Nadu
                                Scheduled Articles (Prescription of Standards) Order, 1977 and
                                the notification dated 9-6-1978 issued by the Central Government
                                which laid down certain specifications ―in relation to foodstuffs‖.
                                The question that arose before the Court was whether tea is
                                ―foodstuff‖ within the meaning of the said legislation. The
                                Division Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that ―tea‖ is
                                not food as it is not understood as ―food‖ or ―foodstuff‖ either in
                                common parlance or by the opinion of lexicographers. We are
                                unable to derive much help from this judgment for the reason that
                                we are not concerned with tea. It is not possible to extrapolate the
                                reasoning of this judgment pertaining to tea into the realm of pan
                                masala and gutka. In any event, the judgment in Tejani [(1974) 1
                                SCC 167 : 1974 SCC (Cri) 87 : AIR 1974 SC 228, a case arising

                                judgment of the Constitutional Bench which does not seem to
                                have been noticed.
</p><p id="p_162">                                    67. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the contention that
                                pan masala or gutka does not amount to ―food‖ within the
                                meaning of the definition in <a href="/doc/181597170/" id="a_88">Section 2(v)</a> of the Act. However, we

                    of food as defined under the FSSA, the Bombay High Court held as
                    follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">                             &quot;19. While the definition in the 1954 Act excluded drugs and
                            water, the definition in the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_91">Food Safety Act</a>, 2006 excludes
                            animal feed, live animals, plants prior to harvesting, drugs and
                            medicinal products, cosmetic, narcotic and psychotropic
                            substance. Obviously, gutka and pan masala do not fall in any of
                            these excluded categories. The expression &quot;any substance which
                            is intended for human consumption&quot; in FSS Act 2006 is also
                            wider than the expression &quot;any article used as food or drink for
                            human consumption&quot; in PFA Act, 1954. It is also pertinent to
                            note that the definition of food in the Act of 2006 specifically
                            includes &quot;chewing-gum&quot; and any substance used into the food
                            during its manufacture, preparation or treatment. Hence, even if
                            gutka or pan masala were not to be ingested inside the digestive
                            system, any substance which goes into the mouth for human
                            consumption is sufficient to be covered by definition of food
                            just as chewing-gum may be kept in the mouth for some time
                            and thereafter thrown out. Similarly gutka containing tobacco
                            may be chewed for some time and then thrown out. Even if it
                            does not enter into the digestive system, it would be covered by
                            the definition of &quot;food&quot; which is in the widest possible terms.
                            The definition of &quot;food&quot; under section 2(v) of the PFA Act was
                            narrower than the definition of food under <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_92">Food Safety Act</a>, still
                            the Supreme Court in Ghodawat case held that pan masala and
                            gutka were &quot;food&quot; within the meaning of PFA Act. The very fact
                            that the petitioners themselves had obtained licences under the
                            PFA Act and have also obtained licences under the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_93">Food Safety
                            Act</a>, 2006 is sufficient to estop them from raising the contention
                            that gutka and pan masala do not fall within the definition of
                            &quot;food&quot; under the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_94">Food Safety Act</a>, 2006.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_129">                            20. The next question is whether the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_95">Food
                            Safety Act</a>, 2006 make any difference to the legal position
                            which was laid down by the Supreme Court in Ghodawat case.</blockquote>
<p id="p_164">                            Before proceeding further, we must note that even while holding
                            the <a href="/doc/89409193/" id="a_96">Cigarettes Act</a> to be a special Act, the Supreme Court did not
                            accept the contention of the petitioners that the PFA Act had no
                            role to play in the matter of regulation of manufacture and sale
                            of gutka and pan masala. In fact, the Supreme Court in terms
                            held that the power to ban gutka or pan masala under the PFA
                            Act, 1954 was vested in the Central Government under section

                            operators, manufacturers, workers, distributors and sellers. Food

                                     Act, 2006 excludes animal feed, live animals, plants
                                     prior to harvesting, drugs and medicinal products,
                                     cosmetic, narcotic and psychotropic substance.
                                     Obviously, gutka and pan masala do not fall in any
                                     of these excluded categories. The expression ―any
                                     substance which is intended for human
                                     consumption‖ in FSS Act, 2006 is also wider than
                                     the expression ―any article used as food or drink for
                                     human consumption‖ in PFA Act, 1954. It is also
                                     pertinent to note that the definition of food in the
                                     Act of 2006 specifically includes ―chewing-gum‖
                                     and any substance used into the food during its
                                     manufacture, preparation or treatment. Hence, even
                                     if gutka or pan masala were not to be ingested inside
                                     the digestive system, any substance which goes into
                                     the mouth for human consumption is sufficient to be
                                     covered by definition of food just as chewing-gum
                                     may be kept in the mouth for some time and
                                     thereafter thrown out. Similarly gutka containing
                                     tobacco may be chewed for some time and then
                                     thrown out. Even if it does not enter into the
                                     digestive system, it would be covered by the
                                     definition of ―food‖ which is in the widest possible
                                     terms. The definition of ―food‖ under section 2(v) of
                                     the PFA Act was narrower than the definition of
                                     food under <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_122">Food Safety Act</a>, still the Supreme Court
                                     in Ghodawat case held that pan masala and gutka
                                     were ―food‖ within the meaning of PFA Act. The
                                     very fact that the petitioners themselves had
                                     obtained licences under the PFA Act and have also

                                     sufficient to estop them from raising the contention
                                     that gutka and pan masala do not fall within the

                            the meaning of the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_125">Food Safety Act</a>. Gutkha also being a

                             harmonize two Acts seemingly in conflict. Of course, in this
                             case there does not appear to be any conflict between COTA and
                             the <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_127">Food Safety Act</a>. COTA is in addition to and not in
                             derogation of other laws relating to food products. There is no
                             non obstante clause in COTA which excludes the operation of
                             other Acts.

                             cancer, this court cannot shut its eyes to the malaise of illegal
                             manufacture and sale of gutkha within the jurisdiction of this

                    various other High Courts, Mr. Narayan referred to Annexure A to his
                    written submissions and sought to distinguish those judgments along
                    the following lines. While dealing with the decision rendered by the
                    Patna High in <a href="/doc/143823077/" id="a_133">M/s Omkar Agency v. The Food Safety and
                    Standards Authority of India24</a>, it was submitted that the notification
                    which had been impugned in those proceedings had banned all forms
                    of pan masala and the same clearly did not stand restricted to those
                    which contained tobacco or nicotine. It was further pointed out that
                    the aforesaid decision was, in any case, rendered prior to the order
                    passed by the Supreme Court on 23 September 2016 in terms of which
                    the prohibition on chewing tobacco had been reiterated. Learned
                    counsel also the sought to assail the correctness of the view expressed
                    in that decision since it had failed to notice the judgment rendered by
                    a learned Judge of that High Court itself in <a href="/doc/1048895/" id="a_134">Lal Babu Yadav v. State

</p><p id="p_178">                    58.    Turning then to the judgment rendered by the Calcutta High
                    Court in <a href="/doc/100015215/" id="a_135">Sanjay Anjay Stores v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.26, learned
                    counsel submitted that the aforesaid decision proceeds on the premise
                    that tobacco is not food, and that food must be construed as only those
                    products which are a source of nutrition or energy. According to Mr.
                    Narayan, the aforesaid view is clearly contrary to the expansive
                    interpretation as placed upon the said word by the Supreme Court in
                    the decisions aforenoted and which had held that all articles which are
                    usually used for human consumption would be liable to be understood
                    as food and that the said expression could not stand restricted only to
                    those articles which may have a nutritive value or function.
</p>
<p id="p_179">                    59.    Insofar as the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Prabhat
                    Zarda Factory India Pvt. Ltd. v. The LG &amp; Ors.27 is concerned, it
                    was the submission of Mr. Narayan that the same had merely followed
                    the judgment in Sanjay Anjay Stores. Drawing the attention of the
                    Court to the decision rendered by the Gauhati High Court in
                    <a href="/doc/165727199/" id="a_136">Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. State of Assam &amp; Anr</a>.28, Mr.

                    State legislation which sought to regulate chewing tobacco on the
                    ground that COTPA occupied the entire field.           According to Mr.
                    Narayan, the said decision clearly fails to bear in consideration the
                    provisions of Regulations 2.3.4 and the obligation of the State
                    Governments to enforce the same in light of the orders passed by the

                    fact that pan masala had, in any case, been recognized as falling
                    within its ambit by the Supreme Court in Godawat itself. It was Mr.
                    Narayan&#x27;s submission that the judgments which have taken a
                    divergent view have failed to appreciate the intent of Regulation 2.3.4
                    which clearly prohibited the introduction, incorporation or mixing of
                    tobacco or nicotine in any food product. Learned counsel submitted
                    that the moment tobacco or nicotine is introduced in pan masala, a
                    product which is undoubtedly covered under the FSSA, the result
                    would clearly be contrary to the unambiguous statutory injunct
                    comprised in Regulation 2.3.4 of the Prohibition Regulations 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_182">                    62.    According to learned counsel, the learned Single Judge clearly
                    erred in defining the inquiry to be ―Whether tobacco would fall within
                    the definition of food‖. Mr. Narayan submitted that the entire focus of
                    the impugned Notification was on the introduction of tobacco in a
                    food article and thus falling foul of the statutory injunction placed by
                    Regulation 2.3.4. According to learned counsel, the learned Single
                    Judge has clearly embarked on a wholly incorrect path while
                    proceeding to test whether tobacco could be construed or interpreted
                    as ―food‖. This, according to Mr. Narayan, is palpably clear from the
                    findings as recorded in paragraph 218. According to learned counsel,
                    the issue of whether FSSA and the Regulations framed thereunder

                    to have arisen was whether pan masala when mixed along with
                    tobacco or nicotine could be said to be an article which would fall
                    within the ambit of Regulation 2.3.4 and consequently whether the
                    Food Safety Authority could in exercise of powers conferred by
                    <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_140">Section 30(2)(a)</a> have issued an order banning its manufacture,
                    distribution, and sale.

<p id="p_183">                    63.       Mr. Narayan further submitted that the view taken by the
                    learned Judge that the power to prohibit as contained in <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_141">Section
                    30(2)(a)</a> is temporary and fleeting in character is also untenable.
                    According to learned counsel, the reliance placed by the Court on the
                    decision in <a href="/doc/296985/" id="a_142">Himat Lal K. Shah v. Commissioner of Police,
                    Ahmedabad &amp; Anr</a>.33 as well as Omkar Agency was clearly
                    misconceived since those were decisions rendered in a wholly
                    different statutory context. According to learned counsel, the ultimate
                    findings returned on this score failed to bear in mind the undisputed
                    fact that <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_143">Section 30(2)(a)</a> expressly confers a power on the Food
                    Safety Authorities to prohibit and ban the manufacture, storage,
                    distribution or sale of any food article in the interest of public health.

                    fact, it was vehemently contended that the aforesaid findings have
                    come to be returned by the learned Single Judge even though no such
                    submission had been addressed or made by the appellants in that
                    regard.

<p id="p_185">                    65.       Mr. Narayan then submitted that notwithstanding the fact that
                    COTPA does itemise pan masala and gutka in its Schedule, that alone
                    would not justify the prohibition in Regulation 2.3.4 being
                    disregarded. According to Mr. Narayan, on a due consideration of the
                    two legislations, it would be apparent that they clearly operate upon
                    different subject matters and over well-defined fields. According to
                    Mr. Narayan, it would be wholly incorrect to interpret or construe the
                    provisions of COTPA in a manner which would either defeat the
                    intent of the FSSA or render its provisions or the regulations framed
                    thereunder as being otiose.

<p id="p_186">                    66.       It was submitted that the learned Single Judge also failed to
                    appreciate the overriding effect conferred upon the provisions of the
                    FSSA by virtue of <a href="/doc/1189129/" id="a_144">Section 89</a> thereof. It was urged that undisputedly
                    FSSA came to be promulgated later in point of time to COTPA.
                    According to Mr. Narayan, the FSSA being a later special food law
                    would clearly override COTPA. Reliance in this respect was placed on

                    Notifications could be said to be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_146">Article 14</a>, Mr. Narayan
                    addressed the following submissions. It was submitted that the writ
                    petitioners had contended that even though it may be asserted that
                    ―smoking tobacco‖ is a more benign substance and poses lesser
                    dangers to health than smokeless tobacco, the appellants have chosen
                    to ban only the latter and thus offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_147">Article 14.</a> It was submitted
                    that undisputedly both smoking as well as smokeless tobacco have a
                    deleterious effect on health and welfare of individuals. According to
                    Mr. Narayan, if the contentions addressed on this score were to be
                    accepted, it would essentially amount to the principle of negative
                    equality being invoked. It was submitted that the respondents had on
                    due consideration of the Expert Committee Reports taken note of the
                    larger impact which smokeless tobacco had on consumers and,
                    consequently, compelling the respondents to take emergent steps in
                    respect of that category. Mr. Narayan submitted that the appellant had
                    borne in consideration the number of users of smokeless tobacco
                    which were almost double in number compared to those using other
                    smoking products, the Quit Ratio for users of smokeless tobacco being
                    much lower, the GATS survey which was undertaken all of which

                    the nature of regulatory measures which are to be adopted is one
                    which clearly lay within the province of the executive. According to
                    Mr. Narayan, the respondents had taken into consideration the
                    findings and conclusions recorded in various scientific reports and
                    studies and which clearly warranted emergent steps being taken to
                    curb the use of smokeless tobacco. In any case it was his submission
                    that in the absence of the classification suffering from patent or
                    manifest arbitrariness, the Notification clearly did not warrant being
                    set aside on this score.

</p><p id="p_191">                    69.    Mr. Singh, the learned CGSC advanced submissions on the
                    connected appeal on behalf of the Union which too has assailed the
                    correctness of the view expressed by the learned Single Judge in the
                    impugned judgment. According to Mr. Singh, the principal question
                    which formed the subject matter of the present dispute was whether
                    the products which were sought to be prohibited and regulated in
                    terms of the Impugned Notifications could be said to be ―food‖ within
                    the meaning of Section 3(1)(j) of the FSSA. According to Mr. Singh,
                    the learned Single Judge proceeded to frame a question as to whether
                    tobacco and tobacco products could be termed as ―food‖. It was his
                    submission that the question as framed itself loses sight of the
                    fundamental question which arose and which was whether the use of
                    tobacco in any food product could be permitted under the FSSA.

</p><p id="p_193">                    70.    According to Mr. Singh, the definition of food under the FSSA
                    takes within its fold any item which is intended for human
                    consumption. Learned counsel submitted that both under the PFA as
                    well as the FSSA, courts have consistently adopted the aforesaid test.
                    It was also highlighted that Section 3(1)(j) of the FSSA is clearly
                    couched in more expansive terms than the definition of ‗food&#x27; as it
                    appeared in the repealed PFA. Mr. Singh submitted that Section 2(v)
                    of the PFA had defined it to mean any article which ordinarily enters
                    into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food. The
                    FSSA, according to learned counsel, on the other hand, adopts the
                    principle of any substance intended for human consumption to be the
                    primary test for understanding whether any article would constitute
                    food for the purposes of the said enactment. This, according to Mr.
                    Singh, is in tune with the principles which had been enunciated by the
                    Supreme Court in Pyarli K. Tejani and R. Krishnamurthy.
</p>
<p id="p_194">                    71.    Learned counsel further submitted that any doubt which may
                    have existed on the question of whether pan masala would constitute
                    food in any case stands definitively laid to rest in light of the judgment
                    in Godawat.        Mr. Singh then submitted that both in Dhariwal
                    Industries as well as J. Anbazhagan, it was the aforenoted principles
                    which were borne in consideration by the respective High Courts who
                    held that gutka would constitute food. Learned counsel also placed
                    reliance on the decision rendered by the Telangana High Court in Sri
                    Kamadhenu Traders which had categorically concluded that gutka /

                    food as defined under the FSSA. Mr. Singh also sought to draw
                    sustenance from the decision of the Bombay High Court in

                    same line of reasoning and had in clearly and unequivocal terms
                    expressed its dissent from decisions of other High Courts which had
                    held to the contrary.

                    rendered by the learned Single Judge is also liable to be tested bearing
                    in mind the undisputed fact that the validity of Regulation 2.3.4 had
                    neither been questioned nor assailed. It was Mr. Singh&#x27;s contention
                    that once the said Regulation was recognised as constituting the
                    principal plank for examining the validity of the challenge which
                    stood raised, it would be evident that as soon as tobacco or nicotine
                    came to be added to pan masala, it must necessarily be accepted to be
                    food and the statutory prohibition as enshrined in Regulation 2.3.4
                    would be violated.

                    regulate a host of tobacco products. It was his submission that the
                    regulatory measures which constitute the body of COTPA have

                    submitted that as would be apparent from the various provisions of
                    COTPA, the said enactment is clearly aimed at discouraging the
                    public at large from consuming tobacco-based products. That,
                    according to learned counsel, cannot be read conversely to amount to
                    a conferment of a right upon the petitioners to engage in the
                    manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products.

                    of food including those for which standards had been fixed as also
                    those for which no parameters stood prescribed.                 Mr. Singh
                    highlighted the fact that pan masala was identified as a standardized
                    food items in terms of Rule 5 read with A.30 of Appendix-A. This,
                    according to Mr. Singh clearly established that the manufacture and
                    sale of chewing tobacco or pan masala as an item of food always
                    stood regulated even under PFA and was subject to appropriate

                    smoking public aware of the numerous health hazards connected
                    therewith.    According to Mr. Singh, it was the recommendations
                    framed by this committee for promulgation of a broader and more
                    effective legislation which formed the percussor for the enactment of
                    COTPA. Learned counsel submitted that COTPA which came to be
                    promulgated in 2003, adopted a different strategy in order to educate
                    people who consumed tobacco and consequently framed novel and
                    broader regulatory provisions to achieve the stated goal. It was also
                    pointed out that the insertion of Rule 44J of the PFA Rules with effect
                    from 21 August 2006 was a categorical reiteration of the intent of the
                    statute to ensure that the use of tobacco and nicotine as ingredients in
                    food products is prohibited. Mr. Singh submitted that the aforesaid
                    statutory imperative was only reiterated by Regulation 2.3.4.
</p>
<p id="p_199">                    76.    It was then submitted that COTPA was enacted primarily for
                    discouraging the use and consumption of products that contained
                    tobacco. FSSA on the other hand, according to Mr. Singh, is a
                    comprehensive legislation which deals with food and all aspects
                    relating thereto. Assailing the findings returned by the learned Single
                    Judge who had held that COTPA would prevail over FSSA insofar as
                    tobacco is concerned, it was the submission of Mr. Singh that there is,
                    in fact, no conflict whatsoever between the two legislations which
                    operate in separate and distinct fields. Mr. Singh submitted that while
                    FSSA is concerned with matters relating to safe and wholesome food,
                    COTPA introduces regulatory measures which are concerned with the
                    sale, purchase and advertising of various tobacco products specified in

                    the Schedule. According to Mr. Singh, the field of food is to be
                    governed solely by the provisions of the FSSA and the various
                    Regulations framed thereunder and thus it would be wholly incorrect
                    to assume that COTPA would override the provisions of the former or
                    that it would sanction the addition of tobacco or nicotine in a food
                    article.
</p>
<p id="p_200">                    77.    Mr. Singh also questioned the correctness of the conclusions
                    recorded by the learned Judge in light in light of Dhariwal Industries
                    and Mohammad Yamin to submit that gutka and pan masala with
                    tobacco or nicotine would clearly be governed by the FSSA by virtue
                    of being articles of food. Stress was also laid upon the aforenoted two
                    decisions which had also alluded to the overriding effect conferred by
                    <a href="/doc/1189129/" id="a_150">Section 89</a> on the provisions of the FSSA.

<p id="p_201">                    78.    The validity of the impugned notification was also sought to be
                    sustained by Mr. Singh referring to <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_151">Article 144</a> of the Constitution and
                    the obligation of all authorities to act in aid of orders passed by the
                    Supreme Court. According to Mr. Singh, the various orders passed in
                    Ankur Gutka and Central Arecanut were liable to be strictly
                    implemented and enforced by all authorities throughout the territory
                    of India. It was his submission that all States and Union Territories
                    were obliged and in fact placed under a duty to ensure that the ban as
                    imposed by the Supreme Court was effectively enforced and
                    implemented.

</p><p id="p_203">                    79.    Mr. Singh also questioned the conclusions recorded by the
                    learned Judge who had held that tobacco was a subject which would
                    stand governed exclusively by COTPA by virtue of the declaration of
                    expediency as enshrined therein.             Mr. Singh submitted that a
                    declaration in terms of Entry-52 of List I cannot possibly be read as an
                    intent to exercise monopoly over the entire field and of no other
                    legislation being framed in a legitimate exercise of legislative powers.
                    It was his submission that if the aforesaid argument were to be

                    May 2006, it was pointed that the House was informed that the Union
                    Government was proposing an appropriate amendment in the 1955
                    Rules in order to empower the Union Government to effectively
                    introduce a ban. According to Mr. Singh, the introduction of Rule 44J

                              noted that tobacco is responsible for an estimated eight lakh deaths
                              annually in the country, that the treatment of tobacco related
                              diseases and loss of productivity caused therefrom was costing the
                              country almost Rs. 13,500 crores annually, offsetting completely
                              the revenue and employment generated by tobacco industry and
                              described the objective of COTPA as to prevent the sale of tobacco
                              products to minors and to protect them from becoming victims of
                              misleading advertisements, all to achieve a healthier lifestyle and
                              protection of right to life enshrined in the Constitution.

                              I.P. Ltd. (supra) maintained that the legislature/government having

                              trade in tobacco could not be classified as res extra commercium

                               oral cavity cancers. Recently, a number of States in India
                               have banned the manufacture and sale of both products and
                               this should reduce the incidence rate. Similar regulations
                               regarding other health-impairing tobacco products which
                               have been on the market for centuries, together with
                               cigarettes and bidis (an indigenous smoking product),
                               should also be reinforced.

                               interventions to encourage stopping the habit are essential.

                               explored. Retinoids, NSAIDS and green tea are among the
                               promising agents (Garewal, 1994; IUSHNCC, 1997;

                               Although a large percentage of lesions did respond to
                               treatment,     recurrence      after   terminating      the

<p id="p_217">                               Conclusions

                               Gutkha and pan masala have flooded the Indian market as
                               cheap and convenient BQ substitutes and become popular
                               across all age groups wherever this habit is practised. There
                               is sufficient evidence that chewing of tobacco with lime,
                               BQ with tobacco, BQ without tobacco and areca nut are
                               carcinogenic in humans (IARC, 1985, 2004). These
                               evaluations in conjunction with the available evidence on
                               the BQ substitutes gutkha and pan masala implicates them
                               as potent carcinogenic mixtures that can cause oral cancer.
                               Additionally, these products are addictive and enhance the
                               early appearance of OSF, especially so in young users who
                               could be more susceptible to the disease. Although recently
                               some curbs have been put on the manufacture and sale of
                               these products, urgent action needs be taken to permanently
                               ban gutkha and pan masala, together with the other well-
                               established oral cancer-causing tobacco products. Finally,
                               as the consequences of these habits are significant and
                               likely to intensify in the future, an emphasis on education
                               aimed at reducing or eliminating the use of these products
                               as well as home-made preparations should be accelerated.‖

                               populace consuming SLT. Timely intervention among
                               students can prevent the initial experimentations with
                               tobacco from developing into addiction in adulthood.
                               People should be counselled to avoid all habits of tobacco
                               and undergo nicotine replacement therapy along with
                               antioxidants. Knowledge and awareness about systemic
                               and oral ill-effects of tobacco should be spread through
                               tobacco control programs in the pursuit for a tobacco-free

                               companies are advertising PM ostensibly without tobacco,

                           service by the Union of India. We are unable to appreciate as to
                           how the Appellate Bench of the Gauhati High Court finds that
                           withdrawal of exemption in respect of ―pan masala with tobacco‖
                           is not in the public interest. The legislative policy as reflected in
                           <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_174">Section 154</a> of the Finance Act was to withdraw the exemption

                           with tobacco and that too with retrospective effect. Apart from the

                           hazardous, the legislative intent was also unambiguous. In these

                           exemption for tobacco products was not in the public interest, to
                           say the least is shocking. We find that the approach of the
                           Appellate Bench of the High Court was totally unsustainable.

                           As such, the doctrine of promissory estoppel could not have been
                           invoked in the present matter. The State could not be compelled to
                           continue the exemption, though it was satisfied that it was not in
                           the public interest to do so. The larger public interest would
                           outweigh an individual loss, if any. In that view of the matter we
                           find that the appeals deserve to be allowed.‖

</p><p id="p_225">                    86.    In view of the aforesaid, it was Mr. Singh&#x27;s submission that in
                    light of the unanimity of scientific and judicial opinion, the subject
                    products must clearly be recognized as being hazardous, dangerous
                    and harmful to public health and the trade business and commerce in
                    the same cannot be accorded the status of a fundamental right.

</p><p id="p_227">                    87.    Supporting the judgment rendered by the learned Judge and
                    appearing for the writ petitioners, Mr.Vaidyanathan, Mr. Singhvi and
                    Mr. Kohli, learned senior counsels, addressed the following
                    submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_228">                    88.    Mr. Vaidyanathan, learned senior counsel appearing for the writ
                    petitioners had principally addressed submissions relating to the
                    declaration of expediency as embodied in COTPA, the doctrine of
                    occupied field and the contention of the writ petitioners that the entire
                    gamut of activities pertaining to tobacco stand governed exclusively
                    by COTPA. As would be evident from the written submissions which
                    were filed in the writ petition as well as those which have been
                    tendered in these proceedings, the scope and ambit of COTPA and
                    FSSA, the argument of occupied field was principally addressed in the
                    backdrop of Entry 52 falling in List I, Entries 24, 26 and 27 falling in
                    List II and Entry 33 of List III as placed in the Seventh Schedule to
                    the Constitution. The submissions on this aspect proceeded along the
                    following lines.
</p>
<p id="p_229">                    89.    Mr. Vaidyanathan taking the Court through the Statement of
                    Objects and Reasons as well as the Preamble of COTPA submitted
                    that it is a legislation which is aimed at prohibiting the advertisement
                    of cigarettes and other tobacco products as well as for the regulation
                    of trade and commerce in and production, supply and distribution of
                    the aforesaid. Learned senior counsel laid emphasis on the declaration

                    of Parliament as embodied in the Act and evincing its intent to take
                    over the tobacco industry as a whole. Bearing in mind the provisions
                    made by Entries 52 and 33, it was submitted that upon a declaration
                    being made in terms of Entry 52 of List I, it is permissible for
                    Parliament to take over an entire industry and which would include
                    the manufacturing and production activities related thereto as well as
                    trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution activities
                    relating to the said industry.
</p>
<p id="p_230">                    90.    It was in the alternative submitted that in light of the language
                    employed in Entries 52 and 33 falling in Lists I and III respectively,
                    Parliament may choose to exercise the authority conferred by the
                    aforementioned two entries and take over only some facets pertaining
                    to the concerned industry while leaving the rest for the competent
                    Legislature. The interplay between Entry 52 falling in List I read with
                    Entries 26 and 27 falling in List II and Entry 33 comprised in List III,
                    was explained with Mr. Vaidyanathan submitting that while under the
                    constitutional framework the State Legislatures stand empowered to
                    enact laws relating to trade and commerce within the State as well as
                    for production, supply and distribution of goods under Entries 26 and
                    27 of List II, that power becomes subject to Entry 33 of List III, once
                    Parliament has evinced its intent to take over an industry in exercise of
                    the legislative power conferred by Entry 52 in List I.

                    position that upon such a declaration being made and Parliament
                    taking over control of an industry in public interest, the scope of the
                    control would ultimately have to be evaluated based on the provisions
                    of COTPA itself. Mr. Vaidyanathan submitted that a reading of the
                    provisions of COTPA would unerringly establish that Parliament had
                    in fact taken over all matters pertaining to trade and commerce in and
                    production, supply and distribution of cigarettes and other products by
                    virtue of the authority conferred by Entry 33 falling in List III of the
                    Seventh Schedule. It was contended that COTPA being especially
                    enacted with reference to Entry 52 of List I read with Entry 33 of List
                    III, it would be manifest that Parliament not only took under its
                    control the tobacco industry as a whole, it consequently denuded the
                    States of the jurisdiction to legislate with respect to the various
                    products set out in the Schedule to the aforesaid enactment.
</p>
<p id="p_232">                    92.    Mr. Vaidyanathan drew the attention of the Court to the
                    definition of ―tobacco products‖ as contained in <a href="/doc/18778/" id="a_175">Section 3(p)</a> to submit
                    that undisputedly pan masala and gutka are clearly included in the
                    aforesaid expression. Learned senior counsel submitted that COTPA
                    is an all-inclusive and a ―fully occupying seamless‖ statute, regulating
                    the entire field and every aspect relating to the defined tobacco
                    products. Mr. Vaidyanathan referred to the statutory prohibition as
                    contained in Sections 4, 5 and 6 of COTPA, the restrictions introduced
                    in terms of <a href="/doc/1354015/" id="a_176">Section 7</a> and the aspect of regulation which is embodied

                    any regulation or prohibition in respect of a tobacco product or
                    activities relating thereto must be found in COTPA alone. It was
                    submitted that the Impugned Notifications cannot possibly be
                    construed or read as having been promulgated in exercise of any
                    power traceable to the provisions of COTPA. Viewed in that light Mr.
                    Vaidyanathan would submit that the Impugned Notifications have
                    clearly transgressed into an occupied field and consequently the
                    learned Single Judge has correctly come to conclude that the
                    impugned action of the appellants cannot be sustained in law.
</p>
<p id="p_233">                    93.    Mr. Vaidyanathan further submitted that as per the submission
                    of the appellant itself, neither raw tobacco nor pure tobaccos are
                    products which could be regulated by them. According to learned
                    senior counsel, if the aforesaid submission were to be accepted it
                    would be sufficient for the Court to uphold the quashing of the
                    Impugned Notifications since they clearly purport to deal with the
                    aforesaid products. It was contended that the submissions addressed
                    in this regard by the appellants are clearly untenable since they
                    proceed on the incorrect premise that raw tobacco or pure tobacco has
                    been taken over by Parliament under COTPA. Mr. Vaidyanathan
                    sought to highlight the fact that COTPA evidences the intent of
                    Parliament to take over the tobacco industry as a whole. It was
                    submitted that scented tobacco, chewing tobacco, cigarettes and other
                    like products would clearly fall within the expanse of the phrase
                    ―tobacco industry‖.       Learned senior counsel contended that once
                    Parliament had taken over legislative competence with respect to the

                    tobacco industry and COTPA covered the entire field, no authority
                    purporting to exercise powers under the FSSA can possibly legislate
                    in respect of those products.
</p>
<p id="p_234">                    94.       It was the submission of Mr. Vaidyanathan that the term food
                    industry as occurring in the declaration which finds place in Section 2
                    of the FSSA must thus be understood as not including products which
                    are already covered by a separate legislation dealing exclusively with
                    products of the tobacco industry. The submission in essence was that
                    any product of the tobacco industry can neither be regulated nor its
                    production, sale or distribution be prohibited by exercise of powers
                    conferred by FSSA.
</p>
<p id="p_235">                    95.       Turning then to the question of whether tobacco could be said
                    to be food or a food product, learned senior counsel submitted that the
                    aforesaid issue stands conclusively settled in light of the judgment
                    rendered by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1824031/" id="a_180">ITC Ltd.
                    v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee43</a>, where it came to be
                    categorically held that tobacco is not foodstuff and thus would not be
                    governed by Entry 33 of List III. The aforesaid submission was
                    addressed in the backdrop of the following observations as appearing
                    in that decision: -

                                interpretation of Entry 52 in List I of the Seventh Schedule. It
                                requires Parliament to make a declaration by law identifying an
                                industry, the control of which by the Union is expedient in the
                                public interest. Under the said entry only an ―industry‖ can be

                                declared as an industry, the control whereof by the Union is
                                regarded as expedient in public interest. It is, therefore, implicit
                                that if an activity cannot be regarded as industry, Entry 52 will
                                have no applicability to that activity. The question is about the
                                concept of ―industry‖ in Entry 52 of List I. As already stated, the
                                entries in the legislative list have to be construed in the widest
                                sense cannot be disputed but it has also to be borne in mind that
                                such construction should not make other entries totally
                                redundant. The meaning of the word ―industry‖ in various
                                dictionaries, reliance on which was placed by Mr Shanti
                                Bhushan, is not of any assistance while considering the
                                constitutional meaning of the said term. There may not be any
                                embargo or limitation on the power of Parliament to enact the
                                law in respect of activities other than manufacturing activities
                                but that power is non-existent in Entry 52 of List I. It may be
                                elsewhere. Reference in this regard can be made to Entry 33 of
                                List III including in its ambit foodstuff and certain raw
                                materials. Tobacco, however, is admittedly not a foodstuff.

<p id="p_236">                    96.       Mr. Kohli learned senior counsel submitted that the Supreme

                    with ―food‖.            In view of the aforesaid it was contended that the
                    decision of the Supreme Court in ITC Ltd. and the passage extracted
                    above, cannot be understood as the Supreme Court intending foodstuff
                    to be different from food. It was additionally urged that the aforesaid

                    of food to mean a product which is used for nourishment or one which

                    the basic characteristic of food are nutritive, restitutive, and
                    promotive. Tested on the aforesaid factors, it was contended that
                    tobacco cannot possibly be construed as food. While reiterating the
                    aforesaid submissions before us, learned senior counsel submitted that
                    the fundamental understanding of food cannot be expanded to include
                    tobacco.

                    submitted by Mr. Kohli, that the said provision prohibits the usage of
                    tobacco and nicotine as ingredients in any food product.           It was
                    submitted that on a plain reading of the said Regulation, it is manifest
                    that it does not seek to prohibit tobacco or nicotine. Mr. Kohli further
                    contended that pan masala, a product which is covered under the
                    FSSA and chewing tobacco which is governed by COTPA, on their
                    own cannot possibly be viewed as violating Regulation 2.3.4.
                    According to him, the Impugned Notifications are based on a
                    complete misconstruction of Regulation 2.3.4 since tobacco in light of
                    the submissions noted above is not a food product and consequently,
                    the impugned Notifications were liable to be struck down on this
                    fundamental ground itself.

                    contended that <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_182">Section 30(2)(a)</a> only contemplates a pro tem power
                    being exercised. It was in the aforesaid light that the writ petitioners
                    had argued before the learned Single Judge that the Impugned
                    Notifications had been issued in colourable exercise of powers and in
                    manifest violation of the scope and intent of <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_183">Section 30(2)(a)</a>. The

                    submitting that on a reading of the said provision it clearly appears to
                    embody three separate dimensions. According to the writ petitioners,
                    the said aspect is evident from the said statutory provision comprising
                    of the element of territory (either in the whole of the State or any area

                    public health, the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale and an
                    article of food). Mr. Kohli contended that even if it were assumed for

                    therefore the prohibitory order could not have run beyond a period of

                    power on a yearly basis. This, according to Mr. Kohli, is one which

                    petitioners, addressed submissions on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_186">Article 14</a> of the Constitution
                    and in light of the ban being restricted to smokeless tobacco. Dr.

                    smoking tobacco products are equally harmful and deleterious to
                    public health. It was his submission that the Impugned Notifications
                    create an artificial sub-class of products and which classification
                    cannot be sustained on any reasonable or rationale differentia. It was
                    his submission that while Regulation 2.3.4 prohibits the use of tobacco
                    and nicotine as ingredients, the respondents have arbitrarily created an
                    artificial distinction by applying its provisions only to smokeless

                    the burden of proof which stands placed upon the appellant to justify
                    the artificial ―intra tobacco‖ class that stands created. Dr. Singhvi
                    urged that there is no justification or rationale to artificially segregate
                    ingested tobacco from inhaled tobacco for the purposes of banning,
                    especially when both are tobacco products which are consumed by
                    users as mild intoxicants to achieve identical results. It was thus
                    submitted that the impugned action fails the test of a valid
                    classification as enunciated by various precedents rendered on the

                    F.     ENTRY 52 &amp; DECLARATION OF EXPEDIENCY

</p><p id="p_247">                    105. In order to appreciate the arguments addressed and centering
                    around the various entries in the Seventh Schedule and more
                    particularly Entry 52 falling in List I thereof, it would be beneficial to
                    articulate some of the fundamental and well settled principles of
                    interpretation which govern the subject of constitutional entries. As
                    has been repeatedly held, entries in the Seventh Schedule are not a
                    source of legislative power. They merely delineate and broadly
                    indicate the field of legislation. The power to legislate flows
                    essentially from <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_188">Article 246</a> of the Constitution. The entries broadly
                    define the areas or the subjects in respect of which a legislation may
                    be framed. While entries are to be conferred the widest permissible
                    and plausible interpretation, no particular entry should be interpreted
                    in a manner which would deprive any other entry of its content or
                    render it ineffectual or insubstantial. When questions of conflict are
                    raised, it is the bounden duty of the Court to strike a just balance
                    between the scope of legislation falling in respective entries in the
                    Lists ensuring that no entry is rendered meaningless or devoid of
                    substance. Regard must also be had to the fact that Entry 52 erodes the
                    power that may otherwise be exercised by a competent legislature.
                    Courts are thus obliged to carefully discern and identify the extent and
                    scope of the legislation that comes to be consequently framed pursuant
                    to that declaration. This since the Constitution seeks to strike a just
                    balance between Parliament and the individual States and thus

                              subject to the provisions of Entry 33 of List III which gave
                              concurrent powers of legislation to the Union as well as the States
                              in the matter of trade and commerce in, and the production, supply

                              such industries by the Union was declared by Parliament by law to
                              be expedient in the public interest. The controlled industries were
                              relegated to Entry 52 of List I which was the exclusive province of
                              Parliament leaving the other industries within Entry 24 of List II
                              which was the exclusive province of the State Legislature. The
                              products of industries which were comprised in Entry 24 of List II
                              were dealt with by the State Legislatures which had under Entry 27
                              of that List power to legislate in regard to the production, supply
                              and distribution of goods, goods according to the definition
                              contained in <a href="/doc/83773/" id="a_190">Article 366(12)</a> including all raw materials,
                              commodities and articles. When, however it came to the products
                              of the controlled industries comprised in Entry 52 of List I, trade
                              and commerce in, and production, supply and distribution of, these
                              goods became the subject-matter of Entry 33 of List III and both
                              Parliament and the State Legislatures had jurisdiction to legislate in
                              regard thereto. The amendment of Entry 33 of List III by the
                              Constitution Third Amendment Act, 1954, only enlarged the scope
                              of that Entry without in any manner whatever detracting from the

                           Entry 33 of List III. Sugarcane would certainly not have been
                           comprised within Entry 33 of List III as it was not the product of
                           sugar industry which was a controlled industry. It was only after
                           the amendment of Entry 33 of List by the Constitution Third
                           Amendment Act, 1954 that foodstuffs including edible oilseeds
                           and oils came to be included within that List and it was possible to
                           legislate in regard to sugarcane, having recourse to Entry 33 of List
                           III. Save for that, sugarcane, being goods, fell directly within Entry
                           27 of List II and was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State
                           Legislatures. Production, supply and distribution of sugarcane
                           being thus within the exclusive sphere of the State Legislatures, the
                           U.P. State Legislature would be, without anything more, competent
                           to legislate in regard to the same and the impugned Act would be

                           the raw material of the sugar industry, that is sugarcane, and the
                           production, supply and distribution of sugarcane was, by reason of
                           its being the necessary ingredient in the process of manufacture or
                           production of sugar, within the legislative competence of the
                           Central Legislature. Each entry in the Lists which is a category or
                           head of the subject-matter of legislation must be construed not in a
                           narrow or restricted sense but as widely as possible so as to extend
                           to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and
                           reasonably be said to be comprehended in it (Vide The United

                           exercise of such concurrent jurisdiction would not deprive the
                           Provincial Legislatures of similar powers which they had under the
                           Provincial Legislative List and there would, therefore, be no
                           question of legislative incompetence qua the Provincial
                           Legislatures in regard to similar pieces of legislation enacted by the
                           latter. The Provincial Legislatures as well as the Central
                           Legislature would be competent to enact such pieces of legislation
                           and no question of legislative competence would arise. It also
                           follows as a necessary corollary that, even though sugar industry
                           was a controlled industry, none of these Acts enacted by the Centre
                           was in exercise of its jurisdiction under Entry 52 of List I. Industry
                           in the wide sense of the term would be capable of comprising three
                           different aspects : (1) raw materials which are an integral part of
                           the industrial process, (2) the process of manufacture or
                           production, and (3) the distribution of the products of the industry.
                           The raw materials would be goods which would be comprised in
                           Entry 27 of List II. The process of manufacture or production
                           would be comprised in Entry 24 of List II except where the
                           industry was a controlled industry when it would fall within Entry
                           52 of List I and the products of the industry would also be
                           comprised in Entry 27 of List II except where they were the
                           products of the controlled industries when they would fall within
                           Entry 33 of List III. This being the position, it cannot be said that
                           the legislation which was enacted by the Centre in regard to sugar
                           and sugarcane could fall within Entry 52 of List I. Before sugar
                           industry became a controlled industry, both sugar and sugarcane
                           fell within Entry 27 of List II but, after a declaration was made by
                           Parliament in 1951 by Act 65 of 1951, sugar industry became a
                           controlled industry and the product of that industry viz. sugar was
                           comprised in Entry 33 of List III taking it out of Entry 27 of List II.
                           Even so, the Centre as well as the Provincial Legislatures had
                           concurrent jurisdiction in regard to the same. In no event could the
                           legislation in regard to sugar and sugarcane be thus included within
                           Entry 52 of List I. The pith and substance argument also cannot be
                           imported here for the simple reason that, when both the Centre as
                           well as the State Legislatures were operating in the concurrent
                           field, there was no question of any trespass upon the exclusive
                           jurisdiction vested in the Centre under Entry 52 of List I, the only
                           question which survived being whether, putting both the pieces of
                           legislation enacted by the Centre and the State Legislature together,
                           there was any repugnancy, a contention which will be dealt with
                           hereafter.‖

</p><p id="p_250">                    107. While dealing with the issue of the meaning to be ascribed to
                    the word ―industry‖ as appearing in the aforenoted entries comprised
                    in the different Lists placed in the Seventh Schedule to the
                    Constitution, the Supreme Court in Tika Ramji had explained it to be a
                    term which was capable of being understood as comprising of three
                    different aspects, namely, (a) raw materials forming an integral part of
                    the industrial process (b) process of manufacture or production and (c)
                    the distribution of products of that industry. On facts in Tika Ramji,
                    the Constitution Bench had ultimately held that raw materials being
                    goods would fall within the scope of Entry 27 of List II, the process of
                    manufacture would stand comprised in Entry 24 of List II except in a
                    case where the same be a controlled industry in which case it would
                    fall within Entry 52 of List I. Similarly, the Supreme Court had
                    explained that the products of the industry would be comprised in
                    Entry 27 of List II except where it were a controlled industry in which
                    case both Parliament as well as the State Legislatures would have
                    concurrent jurisdiction since those products would fall within Entry 33
                    of List III.

<p id="p_251">                    108. The Constitution Bench went on further to observe that by
                    virtue of the declaration made by Parliament with respect to the sugar
                    industry, it became a controlled industry and the products of that
                    industry would thus fall under the ambit of Entry 33 of List III and
                    consequently be carved out from Entry 27 of List II. However, the
                    Constitution Bench held that sugar and sugarcane which were merely
                    raw products could not be said to fall under Entry 52 of List I and the

                    Legislature to promulgate the enactment, the validity whereof had

                    the essence of the principles which came to be enunciated in that
                    decision, it would be apposite to advert to some of the observations
                    which appear in the judgment of yet another Constitution Bench in
                    ITC Ltd.

                    and Brijesh Kumar, J. constituted the majority. In ITC Ltd., the
                    Constitution Bench was called upon to consider the correctness of the
                    earlier decision rendered in ITC limited versus State of Kartnatka46
                    which had held that the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1960
                    insofar as it levied market fee on the sale of tobacco was ultra vires
                    and beyond the legislative competence of the State in light of the
                    <a href="/doc/847558/" id="a_192">Tobacco Board Act</a>, 1975 and the declaration referable to Entry 52 on

                           ―61. Now, in the Seventh Schedule part of Entry 27 is in Entry 26
                           of the State List; markets and fairs is Entry 28 of List II;
                           moneylending and moneylenders (Entry 30 List II); production,
                           supply and distribution of goods subject to the provisions of Entry
                           33 of List III (Entry 27 List II); industries subject to the provisions
                           of Entries 7 and 52 of List I (Entry 24 List II). It would, thus, be
                           seen that under the 1935 Act, both production, supply and
                           distribution of goods as well as development of industries were
                           subject to the provisions of List I as provided in Entry 29. Our
                           Constitution-makers, however, bifurcated Entry 29 into two parts.
                           Industries were put in Entry 24 of List II subject to the provisions
                           of Entries 7 and 52 of List I. The production, supply and
                           distribution of goods was put in Entry 27 of List II and made
                           subject to Entry 33 of List III. The acceptance of the argument of
                           Mr Shanti Bhushan would mean that no object was sought to be
                           achieved by such a bifurcation. It is clear that the two entries have
                           been separated. One made subject to the provisions of Entry 33 of
                           List III and the other subject to the provisions of Entries 7 and 52
                           of List I. Therefore, to interpret the expression ―industry‖ to
                           include in it the aspect of raw material would mean that by the
                           same analogy the subject-matter of production, supply and
                           distribution of goods should also be included therein and in fact
                           that was the argument of Mr Shanti Bhushan. Would the
                           acceptance of that argument not negate the will of the Constitution-
                           makers? I think it would. Therefore, the argument cannot be
                           accepted. The same argument would equally apply to Entry 14 of
                           List II in respect of agriculture which is not subject to any list. It
                           would so become if we accept the contention of Mr Shanti
                           Bhushan. Further, earlier when Parliament felt the need to control
                           raw material, it included ―raw jute and raw cotton‖ in Entry 33 List
                           III by the Constitution (Third Amendment) Act, 1954. Even <a href="/doc/1915616/" id="a_193">Article
                           369</a> indicates that agricultural raw material is in the State List for it
                           refers to raw cotton, cotton seed and edible oilseeds and seeks to
                           temporarily place it, by fiction, in the Concurrent List to enable
                           Parliament to make laws. The expression ―industries‖ in Entry 24
                           List II or Entry 52 List I, cannot be interpreted in a manner that
                           would make other entries of List II of the Seventh Schedule subject
                           to Union control, which in fact they are not. Wherever it was
                           intended to be made subject to such control, whether of List I or
                           that of List III, it was said so. A perusal of List II shows that
                           whenever a particular entry was intended to be made subject to an
                           entry in List I or III, it has been so stated specifically. Therefore, an
                           interpretation which tends to have the effect of making a particular
                           entry subject to any other entry, though not so stated in the entry,

                           deserves to be avoided unless that be the only possible
                           interpretation. We do not think that such an interpretation on the
                           entries in question, namely, Entry 52 of the Union List and Entry
                           24 of the State List deserves to be placed.
</p>
<p id="p_255">                           62. The principles of interpretation are well settled. There is no
                           doubt that the entries in the lists in the Seventh Schedule do not
                           provide competence or power to legislate on the legislature for
                           which the source of power is contained in <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_194">Article 246</a> of the
                           Constitution. In deciding the question of legislative competence, it
                           has to be kept in view that the Constitution is not required to be
                           considered with a narrow or pedantic approach. It is not to be
                           construed as a mere law but as a machinery by which laws are
                           made. The interpretation should be broad and liberal. The entries
                           only demarcate the legislative field of the respective legislature and
                           do not confer legislative power as such and if it is found that some

                           reconcile such entries and bring about a harmonious construction is
                           the duty of the Court. When, however, reconciliation is not
                           possible, as here, then the Court will have to examine the entries in
                           relation to legislative power in the Constitution.‖

<blockquote id="blockquote_164">                           ―112. The underlying rationale of Tika Ramji&#x27;s [AIR 1956 SC 676 :

                           legislation in the three lists, each field must be given a meaning.
                           Entry 24 of List II cannot be read so as to subsume within itself the
                           other entries in List II. It must be given a meaning which allows
                           the other entries to survive and be defined to that extent with

<p id="p_257">                           113. Thus in Calcutta Gas [AIR 1962 SC 1044 : 1962 Supp (3)
                           SCR 1] it was held that the word ―industry‖ in Entry 24 of List II
                           and Entries 7 and 52 of List I did not include gas and gasworks
                           which was in terms provided for in Entry 25. The argument in that
                           case was that the State was incompetent to enact the <a href="/doc/333275/" id="a_195">Oriental Gas

                           by virtue of Entry 52 of List I. The Central Act in that case had,

                           ‗fuel gas&#x27; (coal gas, natural gas and the like)‖. For the purpose of
                           promoting and regulating these industries, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_198">Central Act</a> enabled
                           the Central Government to investigate into the affairs of an
                           undertaking, to regulate its production, supply and distribution,
                           and, if necessary to take over the management of the undertaking.
                           The Court said that if the word ―industry‖ in Entry 24 of List II
                           and, therefore, Entry 52 of List I were interpreted to include ―gas
                           and gasworks‖ which were expressly covered by Entry 25 List II,
                           Entry 25 may become redundant and it would amount to attributing
                           to the authors of the Constitution ―inaptitude, want of precision and
                           tautology‖. As a result, the challenge to the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_199">State Act</a> was
                           negatived and the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_200">Central Act</a>, insofar as it purported to deal with
                           the gas industry, was held to be beyond the legislative competence
                           of Parliament.

                           decisions which have followed the logic of Tika Ramji [AIR 1956
                           SC 676 : 1956 SCR 393] and accepted its conclusion that for the
                           purposes of Entry 24 of List II and consequently Entry 52 of List I,
                           ―industry‖ means ―manufacture or production‖ and nothing more.
                           It is sufficient to note that Tika Ramji&#x27;s [AIR 1956 SC 676 : 1956
                           SCR 393] definition of industry has been affirmed and applied
                           recently by a Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1058443/" id="a_201">Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v. State
                           of Bihar</a> [(1999) 9 SCC 620] and is still good law. Harakchand
                           Banthia case [(1969) 2 SCC 166 : (1970) 1 SCR 479] does not

                           supply and distribution of goods. Entry 33 of List III deals
                           particularly with the production, supply and distribution of the
                           products of industries where the control of such industry by the
                           Union is declared by law to be expedient in the public interest
                           under Entry 7 or 52 of List I. It would not have been necessary to
                           have especially provided for trade and commerce in, and the
                           production, supply and distribution of the products of a controlled
                           industry in Entry 33 of List III, had the word ―industry‖ in Entries
                           7 and 52 of List I covered the field. Similarly had the word
                           ―industry‖ in Entry 24 of List II been sufficient, why have a
                           separate head under Entry 27 of the same list dealing with the
                           production, supply and distribution of goods unless we concede
                           that the framers of the Constitution were guilty of ―inaptitude, want

                           ―particular‖ term is necessarily relative depending upon the context

                           general entry but only in relation to Entry 33 of List III which deals
                           with trade, commerce etc. in particular kinds of products, namely,
                           the products of a controlled industry. Finally, it is clear from the
                           passage quoted, that Banthia [(1969) 2 SCC 166 : (1970) 1 SCR
                           479] held that the Gold Act was legislatively competent under
                           Entry 52 of List I because it dealt with the process of manufacture
                           or production of gold i.e. it was within the sweep of industry as
                           defined in Tika Ramji [AIR 1956 SC 676 : 1956 SCR 393] .
</p><p id="p_260">                           126. To sum up: the word ―industry‖ for the purposes of Entry 52
                           of List I has been firmly confined by Tika Ramji [AIR 1956 SC
                           676: 1956 SCR 393] to the process of manufacture or production
                           only. Subsequent decisions including those of other Constitution
                           Benches have reaffirmed that Tika Ramji case [AIR 1956 SC 676 :
                           1956 SCR 393] authoritatively defined the word ―industry‖ -- to
                           mean the process of manufacture or production and that it does not
                           include the raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of
                           the products of the industry. Given the constitutional framework,
                           and the weight of judicial authority it is not possible to accept an
                           argument canvassing a wider meaning of the word ―industry‖.
                           Whatever the word may mean in any other context, it must be
                           understood in the constitutional context as meaning ―manufacture
                           or production‖.
</p><p id="p_261">                           127. Applying the negative test as evolved in Tika Ramji [AIR
                           1956 SC 676 : 1956 SCR 393] in this case it would follow that the
                           word ―industry‖ in Entry 24 of List II and consequently Entry 52 of
                           List I does not and cannot be read to include Entries 28 and 66 of
                           List II which have been expressly marked out as fields within the
                           State&#x27;s exclusive legislative powers. As noted earlier, Entry 28
                           deals with markets and fairs and Entry 66 with the right to levy
                           fees in respect of, in the present context, markets and fairs. Entry
                           52 of List I does not override Entry 28 in List II nor has Entry 28 in
                           List II been made subject to Entry 52 unlike Entry 24 of List II.
                           This Court in Belsund Sugar [(1999) 9 SCC 620] has also accepted
                           the argument that Entry 28 of List II operated on its own and
                           cannot be affected by any legislation pertaining to industry as
                           found in Entry 52 of List I.‖

                           competence of the State. If any portion of the market area or the

                           would be to ignore the exclusive powers of the States to legislate in
                           respect of markets and fairs under Entries 28 and 66 of List II. The
                           Markets Act does not seek to regulate either the ―manufacture or
                           production‖ of tobacco (assuming that agricultural produce can be
                           manufactured) and thus does not impinge upon the <a href="/doc/1408110/" id="a_210">Tobacco Act</a>

                           <a href="/doc/299075/" id="a_211">Section 27</a> does not represent a quid pro quo for the services
                           rendered and the facilities afforded in the market area. It follows
                           that Parliament is incompetent to legislate for the setting up or
                           regulation of ―markets and fairs‖ within the meaning of the phrase
                           in Entry 28 of List II, even in respect of tobacco. It may of course
                           incidentally trespass into the State&#x27;s legislative field, provided (1)
                           the trespass is an inseparable part of the provisions validly passed,
                           and (2) the State has not already fully occupied its field with
                           conflicting statutory provisions.‖

                           145] have been found to be not relevant for the decision. It is true,
                           while legislating on any subject covered under an entry of any list,
                           there can always be a possibility of entrenching upon or touching
                           the field of legislation of another entry of the same list or another
                           list for matters which may be incidental or ancillary thereto. In
                           such eventuality, inter alia, a broad and liberal interpretation of an
                           entry in the list may certainly be required. An absolute or
                           watertight compartmentalization of heads of subject for legislation
                           may not be possible but at the same time entrenching into the field
                           of another entry cannot mean its total sweeping off even though it
                           may be in the exclusive list of heads of subjects for legislation by
                           the other legislature. As in the present case the relevant heads of
                           subject in List II, other than Entry 24, cannot be made to
                           practically disappear from List II and assumed to have crossed over
                           in totality to List I by virtue of declaration of the tobacco industry
                           under Entry 52 of List I, in the guise of touching or entrenching
                           upon the subjects of List II.‖

</p><p id="p_266">                    114. The law with respect to a declaration made under Entry 52
                    falling in List I can thus be said to have been conclusively settled to be
                    that a declaration once made under that entry, results in denuding a
                    State legislature of the competence to legislate on the subject of
                    industries to the extent to which its control has been taken over by
                    Parliament. As a consequence of that declaration, the products of that
                    industry which would have otherwise fallen within the scope of
                    production, supply and distribution of goods in Entry 27 of List II,
                    become the subject matter of Entry 33 falling in List III. Similarly, the
                    processes of production and manufacture of such an industry which
                    would have ordinarily been comprised in Entry 24 of List II would
                    then be governed by a legislation framed in terms of Entry 52 of List
                    I. However, the extent of control that Parliament ultimately takes over,
                    be it with respect to the industry as a whole, the aspect of production,
                    supply and distribution of goods or mere facets of it are issues which
                    would ultimately have to be answered on the basis of the actual
                    provisions enacted by Parliament. This would be evident from the
                    discussion which follows.

                    exercising its complete legislative authority that may otherwise flow
                    from Entry 33 falling in List III. Ultimately, the extent of control and
                    the assumption of legislative authority would have to be evaluated

<blockquote id="blockquote_167">                              ―8. Sugar is a declared industry. Is it, however, correct to say that

                              industry as a whole is taken out of Entry 24 List II? In respect of an
                              identical Entry 54 List I in the passage extracted above it is said
                              that to the extent declaration is made and extent of control laid, that
                              much and that much alone is abstracted from the legislative
                              competence of the State Legislature. It is, therefore, not correct to
                              say that once a declaration is made in respect of an industry, that
                              industry as a whole is taken out of Entry 24 List II. Similarly,

                                           ―Moreover, power to acquire for purposes of

                                      legislate on this topic as an incident of exercise of
                                      legislative power on another subject is one thing. Its
                                      actual exercise is another. It is difficult to see how the

                                   Schedule.‖
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_170">                           11. Absence of the expression ―to the extent hereinafter provided‖
                           was pressed into service to point out that while in respect of mines
                           and minerals the Union has assumed control to the extent provided
                           in the Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_219">Minerals Act</a>, in the case of declared industries
                           the control is absolute, unlimited, unfettered or unabridged and,
                           therefore, everything that would fall within the connotation of the
                           word ―control‖ would be within the competence of the Union and
                           to the same extent and degree the State Legislature would be
                           denuded of its power to legislate in respect of that industry. It was
                           said that in respect of declared industries total control is assumed
                           by the Union and, therefore, Entry 24 List II on its import must be
                           read industry minus the declared industry because Entry 24 List II
                           is subject to Entries 7 and 52 List I. Undoubtedly the Union is
                           authorised to assume control in respect of any industry if
                           Parliament by law considers it expedient in the public interest. The
                           declaration has to be made by Parliament, but the declaration has to
                           be by law and not a declaration simpliciter. The words of limitation
                           on the power to make declaration are ―by law‖. Declaration must
                           be an integral part of law enacted pursuant to declaration. The
                           declaration in this case is made in an Act enacted to provide for the
                           development and regulation of certain industries. Therefore, the
                           control was assumed not in abstract but for a specific and avowed
                           object viz. development and regulation of certain industries. The
                           industries in respect of which control was assumed for the purpose
                           of their development and regulation have been set out in the
                           schedule. This control is to be exercised in the manner provided in
                           the statute viz. the IDR Act. The declaration for assuming control
                           is to be found in the same Act which provides for the limit of
                           control. The deducible inference is that Parliament made the
                           declaration for assuming control in respect of declared industries
                           set out in the Schedule to the Act to the extent mentioned in the
                           Act. It is difficult to accept the submission that <a href="/doc/1557058/" id="a_220">Section 2</a> has to be
                           read de hors the Act and not forming part of the Act. This would be
                           doing violence to the art of legislative draftsmanship. It is open to

                           respect of industry or industries to the effect that the Union will
                           assume its control in public interest. It is not to be some abstract
                           control. The control has to be concrete and specific and the manner
                           of its exercise has to be laid down in view of the well established
                           proposition that executive authority must have the support of law
                           for its action. In a country governed by rule of law, if the Union, an
                           instrumentality for the governance of the country, has to exercise
                           control over industries by virtue of a declaration made by
                           Parliament, it must be exercised by law. Such law must prescribe
                           the extent of control, the manner of its exercise and enforcement
                           and consequence of breach. There is no such concept as abstract
                           control. The control has to be concrete and the mode and method
                           of its exercise must be regulated by law. Now, Parliament made the
                           declaration not in abstract but as part of the IDR Act and the
                           control was in respect of industries specified in the First Schedule
                           appended to the Act itself. <a href="/doc/18778/" id="a_221">Sections 3</a> to <a href="/doc/934148/" id="a_222">30</a> set out various modes
                           and methodology, procedure and power to effectuate the control
                           which the Union acquired by virtue of the declaration contained in
                           <a href="/doc/1557058/" id="a_223">Section 2</a>. Industry as a legislative head finds its place in Entry 24
                           List II. The State Legislature can be denied legislative power under
                           Entry 24 to the extent Parliament makes declaration under Entry 52
                           and by such declaration, Parliament acquires power to legislate
                           only in respect of those industries in respect of which declaration is
                           made and to the extent as manifested by legislation incorporating
                           the declaration and no more. <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_224">The Act</a> prescribes the extent of
                           control and specifies it. As the declaration trenches upon the State
                           legislative power it has to be construed strictly. Therefore, even
                           though the Act enacted under Entry 54 which is to some extent in
                           pari materia with Entry 52 and in a parallel and cognate statute
                           while making the declaration Parliament did use the further
                           expression ―to the extent herein provided‖ while assuming control,
                           the absence of such words in the declaration in <a href="/doc/1557058/" id="a_225">Section 2</a> would not
                           lead to the conclusion that the control assumed was to be
                           something in abstract, total and unfettered and not as per various
                           provisions of the IDR Act. The lacuna, if any, is made good by
                           hedging the power of making declaration to be made by law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_269">                           Legislative intention has to be gathered from the Act as a whole
                           and not by piece-meal examination of its provisions. It would,
                           therefore, be reasonable to hold that to the extent Union acquired
                           control by virtue of declaration in Section 2 of the IDR Act as
                           amended from time to time, the power of the State Legislature
                           under Entry 24 List II to enact any legislation in respect of declared
                           industry so as to encroach upon the field of control occupied by the
                           IDR Act would be taken away. This is clearly borne out not only

                           848 : AIR 1970 SC 1436 : (1970) 2 SCR 100, 113] where
                           undoubtedly while referring to the control assumed by the Union
                           by a declaration made in <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_226">Section 2</a> of the Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_227">Minerals Act</a>,
                           it was said that to what extent such a declaration would go is for
                           Parliament to determine and this must be commensurate with
                           public interest, and once this declaration is made and the extent
                           laid down, the subject of legislation to the extent laid down
                           becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by Parliament. It is not
                           merely some abstract control but the extent of the control assumed
                           by the Union by the provisions of the IDR Act pursuant to
                           declaration made by Parliament that the State Legislature to that
                           extent, that is, to the extent the provisions of the IDR Act occupies
                           this field, is denuded of its power to legislate in respect of such
                           declared industry.

                           proposition that the control assumed by the Union pursuant to
                           declaration to the extent indicated in the statute, making the
                           declaration does not comprehend the power of acquisition if it is

                           (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971, was challenged on the ground of
                           legislative competence of Kerala State Legislature to enact the
                           legislation. It was urged that in view of the declaration made in
                           <a href="/doc/43938/" id="a_229">Section 2</a> of the Tea Act, 1953, tea was a controlled industry and,
                           therefore, the State Legislature was denuded of any power to deal
                           with the industry. It was further contended that tea plantation
                           required extensive land and that resumption of land by the
                           impugned legislation would directly and adversely affect the
                           control taken over by the Union and, therefore, the State
                           Legislature was incompetent to enact the impugned legislation.
                           This contention was repelled holding that the impugned legislation
                           was in pith and substance one under Entry 18 of List II read with
                           Entry 42, List III. In reaching this conclusion the Court held as
                           under : (SCC p. 229, para 28)

</p><p id="p_271">                           24. It can, therefore, be said with a measure of confidence that
                           legislative power of the States under Entry 24 List II is eroded only
                           to the extent control is assumed by the Union pursuant to a
                           declaration made by the Parliament in respect of declared industry
                           as spelt out by legislative enactment and the field occupied by such
                           enactment is the measure of erosion. Subject to such erosion, on
                           the remainder the State Legislature will have power to legislate in
                           respect of declared industry without in any way trenching upon the
                           occupied field. State Legislature which is otherwise competent to
                           deal with industry under Entry 24, List II, can deal with that
                           industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under
                           different heads set out in Lists II and III and this power cannot be
                           denied to the State. In this connection it would be advantageous to
                           refer to Chanan Mal case [(1977) 1 SCC 340, 351 : AIR 1976 SC
                           1654 : (1976) 3 SCR 688, 700] . In that case constitutional validity
                           of Haryana Minerals (Vesting of Rights) Act, 1973, and the two
                           notifications issued thereunder was challenged on the ground that
                           the Act and the notifications issued thereunder were repugnant to
                           the Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_234">Minerals Act</a> made by Parliament after making a
                           declaration as contemplated by Entry 54 List I. The challenge was
                           that the State Legislature was incompetent to legislate on the topic
                           of mines and minerals under Entry 23, List II in view of the
                           declaration made under Entry 54 List I and the enactment of Act 67
                           of 1957 (Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_235">Minerals Act</a>) by the Parliament. By the
                           impugned Act and the notifications issued thereunder the State
                           Government of Haryana purported to acquire rights to salt petre, a
                           minor mineral in the land described in the schedule appended to
                           the notification and by the second impugned notification the State
                           Government announced to the general public that certain salt petre-
                           bearing areas in the State of Haryana mentioned therein would be
                           auctioned on the dates given there. Repelling the contention
                           regarding legislative incompetence it was observed that it is
                           difficult to see how the field of acquisition could become occupied
                           by a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_236">Central Act</a> in the same way as it had been in West Bengal

                           have done by the statute considered by this Court in the case from

                           (1964) 1 SCR 371] the field is free for State legislation falling
                           under the express provisions of Entry 42 of List III. It was further
                           observed as under : (SCC p. 355, para 36)
                                       ―It seems difficult to sustain the case that the
                                   provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_239">Central Act</a> would be really
                                   unworkable by mere change of ownership of land in
                                   which mineral deposits are found. We have to judge
                                   the character of the Haryana Act by the substance
                                   and effect of its provisions and not merely by the
                                   purpose given in the Statement of Reasons and
                                   Objects behind it. Such statements of reasons are
                                   relevant when the object or purpose of an enactment
                                   is in dispute or uncertain. They can never override
                                   the effect which follows logically from the explicit
                                   and unmistakable language of its substantive
                                   provisions. Such effect is the best evidence of
                                   intention. A Statement of Objects and Reasons is
                                   not a part of the statute, and, therefore, not even
                                   relevant in a case in which the language of the
                                   operative parts of the Act leaves no room
                                   whatsoever, as it does not in the Haryana Act, to
                                   doubt what was meant by the legislators. It is not
                                   disputed here that the object and effect of the
                                   Haryana Act was to acquire proprietary right to
                                   mineral deposits in ‗land&#x27;.‖
</p><p id="p_272">                               25. There is thus a long line of decisions which clearly
                           establishes the proposition that power to legislate for acquisition of
                           property is an independent and separate power and is exercisable
                           only under Entry 42 List III and not as an incident of the power to
                           legislate in respect of a specific head of legislation in any of the
                           three lists. This power of the State Legislature to legislate for
                           acquisition of property remains intact and untrammelled except to
                           the extent where on assumption of control of an industry by a
                           declaration as envisaged in Entry 52 List I, a further power of
                           acquisition is taken over by a specific legislation.‖

                    may otherwise be claimed under an entry which becomes subject to
                    Entry 52. The Constitution Bench explains the constitutional position
                    to be that the power to legislate under Entry 24 would stand eroded
                    and effaced only to the extent that the statutory provisions enacted
                    occupy the field. The principles adumbrated in Ishwari Khetan thus
                    command us not to be boggled by a declaration made by virtue of

                    concerned with food and the laying down of scientific standards for
                    articles of food and to regulate manufacture, storage, distribution, sale
                    and import thereof. The intent of the statute is aimed at ensuring
                    availability of safe and wholesome food in the market for human
                    consumption and for matters connected therewith. FSSA thus clearly
                    comes across as a statute which seeks to comprehensively regulate
                    food and food products. The arguments which were addressed based
                    on an asserted and perceived conflict between COTPA and FSSA

                    repeal and one, which according to the appellants, was not even urged
                    before the learned Single Judge but has been answered, neither arose
                    nor was germane for the purposes of considering the issues which had
                    arisen for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_279">                    122.    For the purposes of examining the question of the interplay
                    between legislations and conflicts arising therefrom, it is imperative to
                    firstly understand the scope of the respective legislations. While
                    COTPA does and evidently purport to regulate trade, commerce,
                    production, supply and distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco
                    products, in order to examine the extent of the regulatory measures
                    that came to be adopted and the areas which they cover, one would
                    necessarily have to bear in mind the provisions that ultimately came to
                    be engrafted in that legislation and the extent to which they ultimately
                    operate. As was eloquently explained by the Constitution Bench in
                    Ishwari Khetan, a mere declaration under Entry 52 is not liable to be
                    understood as being sufficient to deprive a competent legislature from
                    exercising its legislative powers conferred by the Constitution. As the
                    Supreme Court explained in Ishwari Khetan, the control has to be
                    concrete and specific as opposed to being abstract. It was then
                    pertinently observed that a State Legislature would stand denuded of
                    the authority only to the extent of the power which Parliament may
                    ultimately acquire.

</p><p id="p_281">                    123. The key to answering the questions that stood raised in the writ
                    petitions was principally the extent of control which had been
                    ultimately acquired by the Parliament. Examined in the aforesaid
                    light, we find that the assumption of control by Parliament under
                    COTPA extends to the prohibitions imposed with respect to smoking
                    in public places, advertisements in connection therewith, the sale of
                    cigarettes and tobacco products to minors and the prohibition in
                    respect of certain areas where those products should not be available
                    for sale or distribution. COTPA also proceeds to prescribe the nature
                    and the content of statutory warnings, graphic images on packets and
                    issues relating thereto. The regulation of trade, commerce, production,
                    supply and distribution of cigarettes and tobacco products is thus
                    limited to the aforesaid extent only. It would thus be wholly incorrect
                    for it to be contended that aspects unconnected with the aforesaid and
                    pertaining to the products specified in the Schedule could not possibly
                    be regulated by legislation promulgated by a competent and
                    constitutionally empowered law-making body independent of
                    COTPA.

                    subjects and activities relating to the tobacco industry. In our

                    appreciate the degree and scope of the coverage of the statutory
                    provisions engrafted therein. The ―extent of erosion‖ test as was

                    provisions of COTPA subjected to that scrutiny. The extent of control
                    which COTPA purported to exercise and the field that it sought to
                    cover in respect of scheduled products would have to be perceived and
                    determined upon a due consideration of the provisions ultimately
                    embodied in that legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_283">                    125.    What needs to be emphasized is that while COTPA does adopt
                    measures regulating smoking of cigarettes and consumption of
                    tobacco products in public places, in and around the vicinity of
                    educational institutions, the nature of written and pictorial warnings to
                    be displayed on packages, its provisions neither comprehensively
                    control nor regulate all aspects relating to those scheduled products.
                    The extent of the regulation, the aspects that are governed are to be
                    ultimately discerned from the language and the scope of the individual
                    sections of COTPA. No statute can be construed or understood as
                    legislating upon a subject or conferring a right which is neither spoken
                    of nor engraved therein. Tested on the aforesaid precepts, it is
                    manifest that while scheduled products falling under COTPA are
                    regulated and controlled by its individual provisions, it would be
                    wholly incorrect to understand the said enactment as being an all-
                    encompassing and comprehensive legislation pertaining thereto.

                    proceeds is also evident from the following facts. As we read paras
                    197 and 198 of the impugned judgment, we find that the learned
                    Single Judge has observed that upon promulgation of COTPA,

                    denuding the States to legislate qua the scheduled tobacco
                    products.....‖. The learned Single Judge has clearly erred in failing to
                    notice and appreciate the nature and the extent of the control which
                    was taken over by COTPA. The incorrect premise on which the
                    judgment proceeds is further evident when the learned Judge observes
                    that ―.... once the Parliament has exercised power under Entry 52 of
                    List I in order to take the entire tobacco industry under its control, the
                    State Legislatures are not competent to enact laws on the said
                    subject.‖ The said observation clearly appear to lose sight of the fact
                    that the subject matter of the writ petitions was a perceived conflict
                    between two Parliamentary statutes, namely, COTPA and FSSA as
                    opposed to a legislation framed by a State. Secondly, the learned
                    Judge also appears to have ignored the indubitable fact that the
                    Impugned Notifications, albeit issued by a State authority, had in fact
                    been promulgated in exercise of powers conferred under FSSA, a
                    Parliamentary legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_285">                    127. The learned Single Judge while dealing with the question of a
                    perceived conflict between COTPA and FSSA clearly appears to have
                    trodden down an incorrect path while holding that FSSA constitutes a
                    general legislation and therefore must yield to COTPA. We find that
                    the aforesaid conclusion proceeds on the fallacious premise that the
                    respondents sought to regulate and prohibit tobacco per se. As would
                    be manifest from a reading of the Impugned Notifications what was

                    pan masala and tobacco sold as a mixture or in a combination
                    package. The question which thus principally arose was whether the
                    aforesaid articles could be termed as food and thus regulated under
                    FSSA. Rather than conferring attention and restricting its unerring
                    scrutiny on the aforesaid aspect, the learned Single Judge appears to
                    have comprehended the principal question to be whether tobacco
                    could be labelled as food. We are of the considered view that the same
                    was not a question which even remotely arose for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_286">                    128. In any case, and this we do deem necessary to observe, that
                    while COTPA undoubtedly is a special statute regulating and
                    controlling certain aspects of scheduled products, it is special by
                    virtue of the individual and specific provisions contained therein.
                    Similarly, FSSA is special in its own right in light of the detailed
                    provisions that it adopts and engrafts relating to food safety and other
                    allied issues. As long as the regulatory power is exercised under the
                    FSSA in respect of a food article, it would not be invalidated or
                    discredited merely because it is viewed as incidentally entrenching
                    upon a provision contained in another competing statute. In the
                    present matters, we have not been shown any provision in the COTPA
                    which may be viewed as covering matters falling under the FSSA or
                    the Regulations framed thereunder.

                    working of two statutes dealing with the same article. However, and
                    as is evident from the aforesaid discussion, FSSA was neither
                    understood nor asserted to be a legislation which seeks to regulate
                    tobacco or any other tobacco products specified in a Schedule
                    covering issues falling under COTPA. Even if one were to consider
                    the article of pan masala which is covered both under the COTPA as
                    well as FSSA, the former would be liable to be construed as regulating
                    that article only to the extent of the specific provisions contained
                    therein. Those provisions would also have to be construed bearing in
                    mind that pan masala is an article which is also regulated under the
                    FSSA. We find that the aspects of that article which are covered and
                    regulated by FSSA are not regulated by the provisions of COTPA at
                    all. In fact, the two statutes do not even construct or erect parallel or
                    competing regimes of regulation.

                           inconsistency that a special law will remain wholly unaffected by a later
                           general law. See in this connection, Maxwell on the Interpretation of
                           Statutes, Twelfth Edn., pp. 196-198.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_289">                    131. The Court also deems it apposite to note the following
                    observations as were made by the Supreme Court in Ashoka
                    Marketing: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_172">                           ―50. One such principle of statutory interpretation which is applied
                           is contained in the latin maxim : leges posteriores priores
                           conterarias abrogant (later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws).
                           This principle is subject to the exception embodied in the maxim
                           : generalia specialibus non derogant (a general provision does not
                           derogate from a special one.) This means that where the literal
                           meaning of the general enactment covers a situation for which
                           specific provision is made by another enactment contained in the
                           earlier Act, it is presumed that the situation was intended to
                           continue to be dealt with by the specific provision rather than the
                           later general one (Bennion, Statutory Interpretation pp. 433-34).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_173">                           51. The rationale of this rule is thus explained by this Court in
                           the <a href="/doc/790887/" id="a_249">J.K. Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Uttar

                           540] : (SCR p. 194)
                               ―The rule that general provisions should yield to specific
                               provisions is not an arbitrary principle made by lawyers
                               and judges but springs from the common understanding of
                               men and women that when the same person gives two
                               directions one covering a large number of matters in
                               general and another to only some of them his intention is
                               that these latter directions should prevail as regards these
                               while as regards all the rest the earlier directions should
                               have effect.‖
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_174">                           56. We arrive at the same conclusion by applying the principle
                           which is followed for resolving a conflict between the provisions of
                           two special enactments made by the same legislature. We may in
                           this context refer to some of the cases which have come before this
                           Court where the provisions of two enactments made by the same
                           legislature were found to be inconsistent and each enactment was
                           claimed to be a special enactment and had a non-obstante clause
                           giving overriding effect to its provisions.

                           280] this Court was considering the provisions contained in the
                           <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_251">Banking Companies Act</a>, 1949 and the <a href="/doc/1690572/" id="a_252">Displaced Persons (Debts

                           giving overriding effect to the provisions of the enactment over any
                           other law. This Court has observed : (SCR pp. 613 and 615)
                                ―Each enactment being a special Act, the ordinary
                                principle that a special law overrides a general law does
                                not afford any clear solution in this case.‖
                                ―It is, therefore, desirable to determine the overriding
                                effect of one or the other of the relevant provisions in
                                these two Acts, in a given case, on much broader
                                considerations of the purpose and policy underlying the
                                two Acts and the clear intendment conveyed by the
                                language of the relevant provisions therein.‖

</p><p id="p_292">                    132. What emerges upon a consideration of the legal principles
                    propounded in the aforenoted two decisions, is the imperative of
                    understanding the scope of the respective legislations, the subjects
                    which are sought to be regulated, the nature of the inconsistency and
                    whether it is wholly irreconcilable. The question of conflict is not
                    liable to be answered on a facile examination of the provisions of the
                    respective statutes but on a more meaningful consideration of the
                    provisions themselves, the situations that they seek to remedy and
                    provision and the measures that are ultimately adopted. Courts would
                    also bear in mind the objects of the two legislations and the purposes
                    that they seek to achieve. Tested on those principles, we find
                    ourselves unable to recognize any element of incompatibility in the
                    operation and implementation of the two legislations in question.

                    Regulation 2.11.5 of the Food Products Regulations 2011. The
                    question of conflict thus clearly did not arise at all. We are also of the
                    considered opinion that the conclusions which have come to be
                    recorded by the learned Judge in Para 198 of the impugned judgment
                    are legally unsustainable bearing in mind that the writ petitions did not
                    raise an issue of a conflict between a Parliamentary and a State
                    legislation. It is pertinent to recall that the State food authorities were
                    not exercising powers while issuing the impugned notifications under
                    a State enactment. Those notifications had been issued in purported
                    exercise of powers conferred by Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA read
                    with Regulation 2.3.4 of the Food Product Regulations 2011.

                    it expedient to advert to Godawat on the strength of which it was
                    contended that COTPA is a special statute and would thus override the
                    provisions of the FSSA. It would be pertinent to note the following
                    passages from the decision in Godawat:-

                           suggests that it is a special law intended to deal with tobacco and

                           prevention of adulteration. In case of conflict between a special law
                           and a general law, even if both are enacted by the same legislative
                           authority, the special law must displace the general law to the
                           extent of inconsistency. The operation of the maxim generalia

                           Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The former Act is a

                    hereinabove, the validity of the aforesaid provisions was neither
                    questioned nor assailed in the writ petitions. The writ petitioners also
                    did not assert that the aforenoted two provisions were liable to be
                    struck down on that score. The decision in Godawat must also be
                    appreciated in the backdrop of COTPA constituting a latter legislation
                    having been brought onto the statute book long after PFA. It was in
                    this factual setting that Godawat came to be rendered. However, and
                    undisputedly FSSA, on the other hand, was promulgated thereafter in
                    2006 and in any case post the enforcement of COTPA. The statutory
                    regime which prevailed at the time when the judgment in Godawat
                    came to be handed down has undergone a paradigm shift as is
                    manifest from the introduction of statutory measures which
                    specifically prohibit the addition of tobacco and nicotine to food
                    products.

</p><p id="p_301">                    137. We are of the firm view that the fundamental question which
                    the writ petitions raised was itself confined to whether the Impugned
                    Notifications could have prohibited the addition of tobacco or nicotine
                    in a food product. Pan Masala, indubitably, is a food product which is
                    regulated under the FSSA. The fundamental question which therefore
                    arose was whether tobacco or nicotine for that matter could be
                    permitted to be added to that food product.

                    The writ petitioners, however, clearly appear to have proceeded on the
                    mistaken assumption that the impugned notifications sought to ban or
                    prohibit tobacco. The prohibition which was sought to be enforced
                    was of the addition of tobacco or tobacco products to a food product,
                    namely, Pan Masala.
</p>
<p id="p_304">                    139. The impugned notifications essentially sought to regulate a food
                    article. The learned Single Judge clearly appears to have misconstrued
                    the scope and intent of those notifications as being one directly aimed
                    at regulating tobacco. As would be manifest and evident from a
                    reading of the various provisions of the FSSA including the impugned
                    notifications, the respondents never evinced an intent to regulate
                    tobacco or tobacco products. In fact, and as per the appellants
                    themselves, FSSA does not even deal with raw tobacco or pure
                    tobacco.
</p>
<p id="p_305">                    140. The conclusions of the Court recorded hereinabove are further
                    buttressed from the following facts. As would be evident from a
                    reading of the Impugned Notifications, the GNCTD Food Authority
                    firstly records its conclusion that gutka, pan masala and other like
                    products containing tobacco are injurious to health. It then proceeds to
                    proclaim that tobacco when mixed with other ingredients and
                    additives mentioned therein, is ―food‖ as defined under the FSSA. It
                    then proceeds to take cognizance of the prohibition placed by
                    Regulation 2.3.4 of tobacco or nicotine being added to a food article.

                    have on public health, it proceeds to ban the manufacture, storage,
                    distribution or sale of tobacco which is either flavoured, scented or
                    mixed with any additive. The articles to which the ban is proposed to
                    be extended       have been     mentioned as      gutka, pan masala,
                    flavoured/scented tobacco, kharra and other like products by whatever
                    name called.
</p>
<p id="p_306">                    141. A careful reading of the Impugned Notifications would
                    establish that what was proposed to be banned was not raw or pure
                    tobacco. The subject matter of the prohibitory order was tobacco when
                    mixed with other ingredients and additives. Those articles were
                    specified to be gutka, pan masala, flavoured/scented tobacco and other
                    like products. It would thus be wholly incorrect to assume that the
                    notifications sought to ban tobacco per se.
</p>
<p id="p_307">                    142. Undisputedly, food as defined under the FSSA would mean any
                    substance which is intended to be used for human consumption. As
                    has been noticed hereinabove, the nutritive or restitutive properties of
                    a substance being a sin qua non for it to be termed as food is a
                    principle which has been consistently and stoutly negatived both
                    under the PFA as well as the FSSA. What needs to be underlined is
                    that when tobacco is mixed or used as an ingredient or additive to a
                    food article, it is then that it becomes subject to the regulatory regime
                    constructed by the FSSA. It would be pertinent to recall that a food
                    additive is defined under the FSSA to mean ―any substance which is
                    not normally consumed as a food by itself or used as a typical

                    ingredient of the food, whether or not it has nutritive value....‖. It is
                    thus apparent that an additive could be one which is neither a
                    substance which is normally consumed as food nor one which may
                    have a nutritive value. Similarly, Regulation 2.11.5 of the Food
                    Products Regulations 2011 while prescribing the standards for pan
                    masala, proscribes the addition of any substance which may be
                    injurious to health. The aforenoted prohibition is in addition to that
                    contained in Regulation 2.3.4 of the Prohibition Regulations 2011.
                    The Impugned Notifications were thus clearly not an attempt to
                    regulate tobacco or nicotine but to regulate food containing those
                    substances. We thus find ourselves unable to countenance the
                    conclusions to the contrary that the Learned Judge proceeded to record
                    in para 193 of the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_308">                    I.     THE „TOBACCO AS FOOD&quot; QUESTION

</p><p id="p_309">                    143. That takes the Court to consider whether the impugned articles
                    which form subject matter of the Impugned Notifications could be
                    held to be food as defined under the FSSA. While on the question of
                    food and foodstuff, it would be relevant to briefly notice some of the
                    decisions which were commended for our consideration by the writ
                    petitioners. It becomes pertinent to note that S. Samuel was dealing
                    with an order made under the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_265">Essential Commodities Act</a>, 1955 and
                    which did not define foodstuff specifically. It was in the aforesaid
                    backdrop that the Supreme Court employed the common parlance test
                    for the purposes of ascribing the meaning to be assigned to that word.

                    Similar was the position in Gulati &amp; Co. where in the context of a
                    fiscal statute, the Supreme Court held that the word food must be
                    interpreted bearing in mind how that expression is commonly
                    understood.
</p>
<p id="p_311">                    144. In contrast to the above, we are called upon to consider a
                    legislation, namely the FSSA, which defines food specifically. It
                    would be apposite to note that the nutritive element test as was
                    advocated had been rejected by the Constitution Bench of the
                    Supreme Court as far back as in Virkumar Gulabchand Shah as would
                    be evident from the following extracts from that decision: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_180">                            &quot;11. So far as ―food‖ is concerned, it can be used in a wide as
                            well as a narrow sense and, in my opinion, much must depend
                            upon the context and background. Even in a popular sense,
                            when one asks another, ―Have you had your food? ‖, one means
                            the composite preparations which normally go to constitute a
                            meal--curry and rice, sweetmeats, pudding, cooked vegetables
                            and so forth. One does not usually think separately of the
                            different preparations which enter into their making, of the
                            various condiments and spices and vitamins, any more than one
                            would think of separating in his mind the purely nutritive
                            elements of what is eaten from their non-nutritive adjuncts.</blockquote>
<p id="p_312">                            12. So also, looked at from another point of view, the various
                            adjuncts of what I may term food proper which enter into its
                            preparation for human consumption in order to make it palatable
                            and nutritive, can hardly be separated from the purely nutritive
                            elements if the effect of their absence would be to render the
                            particular commodity in its finished state unsavoury and
                            indigestible to a whole class of persons whose stomachs are
                            accustomed to a more spicily prepared product. The proof of the
                            pudding is, as it were, in the eating, and if the effect of eating
                            what would otherwise be palatable and digestible and therefore
                            nutritive is to bring on indigestion to a stomach unaccustomed to
                            such unspiced fare, the answer must, I think, be that however
                            nutritive a product may be in one form it can scarcely be classed

                            as nutritive if the only result of eating it is to produce the
                            opposite effect; and if the essence of the definition is the
                            nutritive element, then the commodity in question must cease to
                            be food, within the strict meaning of the definition, to that
                            particular class of persons, without the addition of the spices
                            which make it nutritive. Put more colloquially, ―one man&#x27;s food
                            is another man&#x27;s poison‖. I refer to this not for the sake of
                            splitting hairs but to show the undesirability of such a mode of
                            approach. The problem must, I think, be solved in a common
                            sense way.
</p><p id="p_313">                            22. Now I have no doubt that had the Central Government re-
                            promulgated the Order of 1944 in 1946 after the passing of
                            either the Ordinance or the Act of 1946, the Order would have
                            been good. As we have seen, turmeric falls within the wider
                            definition of ―food‖ and ―foodstuffs‖ given in a dictionary of
                            international standing as well as in several English decisions. It
                            is, I think, as much a ―foodstuff‖, in its wider meaning, as
                            sausage, skins and baking powder and tea. In the face of all that
                            I would find it difficult to hold that an article like turmeric
                            cannot fall within the wider meaning of the term ―foodstuffs‖.
                            Had the Order of 1944 not specified turmeric and had it merely
                            prohibited forward contracts in ―foodstuffs‖ I would have held,
                            in line with the earlier tea case, that that is not a proper way of
                            penalising a man for trading in an article which would not
                            ordinarily be considered as a foodstuff. But in the face of the
                            Order of 1944, which specifically includes turmeric, no one can
                            complain that his attention was not drawn to the prohibition of
                            trading in this particular commodity and if, in spite of that, he
                            chooses to disregard the Order and test its validity in a court of
                            law, he can hardly complain that he was trapped or taken
                            unawares; whatever he may have thought he was at any rate
                            placed on his guard. As I see it, the test here is whether the
                            Order of 1944 would have been a good order had it been re-
                            promulgated after the Ordinance of 1946. In my opinion, it
                            would, and from that it follows that it is saved by the saving
                            clauses of the Ordinance and the Act.‖

                    that all that may be ingested by humans would be food. This was a
                    case which was considering whether supari could be termed as food.

                            ―14. We now proceed to consider the bold bid made by the
                           appellant to convince the Court that supari is not an article of food
                           and, as such, the admixture of any sweetener cannot attract the
                           penal provisions at all. He who runs and reads the definition in
                           <a href="/doc/1557058/" id="a_266">Section 2(v)</a> of the Act will answer back that supari is food. The
                           lexicographic learning, pharmacopic erudition, the ancient medical
                           literature and extracts of encyclopaedias pressed before us with
                           great industry are worthy of a more substantial submission. Indeed,
                           learned Counsel treated us to an extensive study to make out that
                           supari was not a food but a drug. He explained the botany of
                           bettlenut, drew our attention to Dr Nandkarni&#x27;s Indian Materia
                           Medica, invited us to great Susruta&#x27;s reference to this aromatic
                           stimulant, in a valiant endeavour to persuade us to hold that supari
                           was more medicinal than edible. We are here concerned with a law
                           regulating adulteration of food which affects the common people in
                           their millions and their health. We are dealing with a commodity
                           which is consumed by the ordinary man in houses, hotels, marriage
                           parties and even routinely. In the field of legal interpretation,
                           dictionary scholarship and precedent-based connotations cannot
                           become a universal guide or semantic tyrant, oblivious of the social
                           context subject of legislation and object of the law. The meaning of
                           common words relating to common articles consumed by the
                           common people, available commonly and contained in a statute
                           intended to protect the community generally, must be gathered
                           from the common sense understanding of the word. <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_267">The Act</a>
                           defines ―food‖ very widely as covering any article used as food
                           and every component which enters into it, and even flavouring
                           matter and condiments. It is commonplace knowledge that the
                           word ‗food&#x27; is a very general term and applies to all that is eaten by
                           men for nourishment and takes in subsidiaries. Is supari eaten with
                           relish by men for taste and nourishment? It is. And so it is food.
                           Without tarrying further on this unusual argument we hold that
                           supari is food within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1557058/" id="a_268">Section 2(v)</a> of the Act.

                           faith that there was no cyclamate in the substance sold induced by

                           frequently and recently. It is trite law that in food offences strict

                               The distribution of impure or adulterated food for
                               consumption is an act perilous to human life and health,
                               hence, a dangerous act, and cannot be made innocent and
                               harmless by the want of knowledge or by the good faith of
                               the seller: it is the act itself, not the intent, that determines
                               the guilt, and the actual harm to the public is the same in
                               one case as in the other. Thus, the seller of food is under
                               the duty of ascertaining at his peril whether the article of
                               food conforms to the standard fixed by statute or
                               ordinance, unless such statutes or ordinances, expressly or
                               by implication, make intent an element of the offence.&quot;
                               Nothing more than the actus reus is needed where
                               regulation of private activity in vulnerable areas like
                               public health is intended. In the words of Lord Wright in
                               McLeod v. Buchanan &quot;intention to commit a breach of
                               statute need not be shown. The breach in fact is enough.&quot;
                               Social defence reasonably overpowers individual freedom
                               to injure, in special situations of strict liability. <a href="/doc/1354015/" id="a_270">Section 7</a>
                               casts an absolute obligation regardless of scienter, bad
                               faith and mens rea. If you have sold any article of food
                               contrary to any of the sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1354015/" id="a_271">Section 7</a>, you are
                               guilty. There is no more argument about it. The law denies
                               the right of a dealer to rob the health of a supari consumer.
                               We may merely refer to a similar plea overruled in the
                               case <a href="/doc/1606231/" id="a_272">Andhra Pradesh Grain &amp; Seed Merchants&#x27; Asso-

                    further to hold that as long as an article is ―generally or commonly

                           consumption or for preparation of human food. It is also irrelevant
                           that it is described or exhibited as intended for some other use. It is
                           enough if the article is generally or commonly used for human
                           consumption or in the preparation of human food. It is notorious
                           that there are, unfortunately, in our vast country, large segments of
                           population, who, living as they do, far beneath ordinary subsistence
                           level, are ready to consume that which may otherwise be thought as
                           not fit for human consumption. In order to keep body and soul
                           together, they are often tempted to buy and use as food, articles
                           which are adulterated and even unfit for human consumption but
                           which are sold at inviting prices, under the pretence or without
                           pretence that they are intended to be used for purposes other than
                           human consumption. It is to prevent the exploitation and self-
                           destruction of these poor, ignorant and illiterate persons that the
                           definition of ―food‖ is couched in such terms as not to take into
                           account whether an article is intended for human consumption or
                           not. In order to be ―food‖ for the purposes of the Act, an article
                           need not be ―fit‖ for human consumption; it need not be described
                           or exhibited as intended for human consumption; it may even be
                           otherwise described or exhibited; it need not even be necessarily
                           intended for human consumption; it is enough if it is generally or
                           commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of
                           human food. Where an article is generally or commonly not used
                           for human consumption or in the preparation of human food but for
                           some other purpose, notwithstanding that it may be capable of
                           being used, on rare occasions, for human consumption or in the
                           preparation of human food, it may be said, depending on the facts
                           and circumstances of the case, that it is not ―food‖. In such a case
                           the question whether it is intended for human consumption or in the
                           preparation of human food may become material. But where the
                           article is one which is generally or commonly used for human
                           consumption or in the preparation of human food, there can be no
                           question but that the article is ―food‖. Gingelly oil, mixed or not
                           with groundnut oil or some other oil, whether described or
                           exhibited as an article of food for human consumption or as an
                           article for external use only is ―food‖ within the meaning of the

                    ambit of that expression. This Court also bears in mind the plethora of
                    authorities starting from Khedan Lal, Manohar Lal, Dhariwal
                    Industries, J. Anbazhagan and Sri Kamdhenu Traders which have
                    held that chewing tobacco, pan masala and gutka are food. The Court
                    finds no justification to differ from the views expressed therein.
</p>
<p id="p_321">                    148. While arriving at this conclusion, the Court also bears in mind
                    the definition of food under the FSSA. It would be pertinent to recall
                    that <a href="/doc/1088799/" id="a_274">Section 3(1)(j)</a> not only embodies an inclusive element it also
                    specifically excludes certain articles. We also bear in mind the
                    admitted position that while the PFA defined food to mean ―any
                    article used as food or drink for human consumption‖, the FSSAI
                    clearly attempts to confer an expansive meaning upon that expression
                    by providing that any substance meant for human consumption would
                    stand included. We thus find no justification to hold that pan masala,
                    gutka or any other form of chewing tobacco which is meant for human
                    consumption would stand excluded from the ambit of <a href="/doc/1088799/" id="a_275">Section 3(1)(j)</a>.
                    We are further fortified in the view that we take noting that neither
                    pan masala, nor chewing tobacco or gutka stand excluded from
                    Section 3(1)(j) of the FSSA. This too clearly appears to be evidence of
                    the intent of the enactment to include not only those articles but also
                    all others.

                    tobacco. In view thereof, the learned Judge concluded that tobacco
                    could not be considered as food. We find ourselves unable to adopt
                    this line of reasoning since it clearly fails to consider that what the
                    appellants sought to regulate and prohibit was not tobacco itself but its
                    introduction and addition in a food article. It becomes pertinent to
                    highlight that FSSA does not even attempt to lay down standards for
                    tobacco. It is concerned solely with substances which are meant for
                    human consumption. Tobacco or nicotine are noticed in that
                    legislation only to the extent of being identified as substances which
                    cannot be added to an article of food. It is our respectful view that the
                    learned Judge clearly erred in this regard and completely misconstrued
                    the principal question which arose for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_323">                    150. We similarly find that the learned Judge has clearly erred in
                    proceeding on the premise that the Appellants sought to prohibit
                    tobacco in terms of Regulation 2.3.4. That does not appear to have
                    been their case at all. The Appellants had consistently taken the
                    position that what Regulation 2.3.4 proscribes is the addition of
                    tobacco or nicotine to food.
</p>
<p id="p_324">                    151. Significantly, while holding so the learned Judge observes in
                    para 219 of the judgment that there is no conflict between Regulation
                    2.3.4 and COTPA. We note that this was exactly the argument of the
                    Appellants before us. The judgment thus clearly appears to suffer
                    from inherent and apparent inconsistencies.

                    J.     POWER TO PROHIBIT UNDER FSSA

</p><p id="p_326">                    152. Proceeding to deal with the issues which arise out of Section
                    30(2)(a) of the FSSA and Regulation 2.3.4, the learned Judge has
                    proceeded to hold that the power to establish standards for food under
                    the FSSA would not include within its purview the power to prohibit
                    the manufacture, sale, storage and distribution of goods more so when
                    those which are sought to be prohibited pertain to scheduled tobacco
                    products. The learned Judge has sought to draw sustenance for the
                    aforesaid findings from the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in
                    Himat Lal K. Shah. While ruling on this issue, it has been additionally
                    observed by the learned Judge that on a consideration of the entire
                    scheme of the FSSA, it is apparent that the power to frame
                    Regulations would not include the power to prohibit manufacture,
                    distribution, storage and sale of a product.
</p>
<p id="p_327">                    153. We are constrained to observe that the aforesaid findings have
                    come to be returned with the learned Judge significantly ignoring the
                    admitted position that no challenge to Regulation 2.3.4 stood raised.
                    The reliance which was sought to be placed on the observations as
                    appearing in Himat Lal K. Shah was also clearly misplaced since the
                    said decision observes that the power to regulate would not
                    ―normally‖ include the power to prohibit. Himat Lal K. Shah thus
                    could not have been viewed as an authority laying down an absolute
                    proposition that the power to regulate would not include the power to
                    prohibit.

</p><p id="p_329">                    154. More fundamentally, we note that the power to prohibit stands
                    specifically conferred upon the food safety authorities by virtue of
                    Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA. The learned Judge thus clearly appears
                    to have overlooked the fact that the principal enactment itself had
                    conferred a power to prohibit and therefore the said power need not
                    have been additionally spelt out in the Regulations which came to be
                    framed under the FSSA.
</p>
<p id="p_330">                    155.    In any case, Regulation 2.3.4 on its plain language prohibits the
                    use of tobacco or nicotine in a food product. That prohibition is
                    neither temporary nor one which is stipulated to operate for a
                    particular period of time. The statutory prohibition is permanent and
                    would thus apply to all food articles during the entire period that
                    FSSA and Regulation 2.3.4 operates. The question therefore of the
                    power being temporary or pro tem did not arise. As long as Regulation
                    2.3.4 remained on the statute book, it was incumbent upon the
                    appellant to implement and enforce that provision and the statutory
                    injunct which stood engrafted therein.
</p>
<p id="p_331">                    156. Insofar as the findings returned by the learned Judge with
                    respect to Regulation 2.3.4 not prohibiting the use of tobacco or
                    nicotine, this Court in the preceding parts of this decision has already
                    found that the said observations have clearly been rendered upon the
                    learned Judge having lost sight of the principal question which arose,
                    namely, whether tobacco and nicotine could be permitted to be used as
                    additives in a food article.

</p><p id="p_333">                    157. On an overall consideration of the aforesaid discussion, we find
                    that both <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_276">Section 30(2)(a)</a> as well as Regulation 2.3.4 embody a power
                    to prohibit a particular food article as well as regulate the nature of
                    additives which may be permitted to be added in food articles. We
                    also find that neither <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_277">Section 30(2)(a)</a> nor the validity of Regulation
                    2.3.4 had been questioned by the writ petitioners. Since the restraint
                    embodied in Regulation 2.3.4 was permanent in character, the
                    prohibitory orders could not have been held to be bound by
                    prescriptions of time.

<p id="p_334">                    158. In light of our conclusions recorded hereinabove, we find
                    ourselves unable to accept the view taken by the Madras High Court
                    in Designated Officer and which had in any case followed the

                    only aid us in enunciating the correct legal position. Dwarapudi
                    Sivarama Reddy proceeds on the premise that the entire controversy
                    stands conclusively settled in light of Godawat. While proceeding to
                    deal with the impact of the special provisions made in the FSSA and
                    the Regulations framed thereunder, the said High Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_182">                           ―29. The respondents have tried to convince this Court by referring
                           to the FSSA Regulations, 2011 and the FPSFA Regulations, 2011,
                           by submitting that food products should not contain any substance
                           which may be injurious to health and Tobacco and Nicotine shall
                           not be used as ingredients in any food products generally taken as
                           such or in conjunction with pan. Clause 2.11.5 of the FPSFA
                           Regulations, 2011 provides that Pan Masala may contain betelnut,
                           lime, coconut, catechu, saffron, cardamom, dry fruits, mulethi,
                           sabnermusa, other aromatic herbs and spices, sugar, glycerine,
                           glucose, permitted natural colours, menthol and non prohibited
                           flavours; it should be free from added coaltar colouring matter and
                           any other ingredient injurious to health. However, it is not legally
                           permissible to accept the submission of the respondents for the
                           reason that even if Pan Masala is taken to be ―food‖ under the
                           FPSFA Regulations, 2011 though not defined as such under
                           Section 3(j) of the FSSA, 2006, the same would remain ―food‖ till
                           it does not contain Tobacco and Nicotine and the moment Tobacco
                           and Tobacco products are mixed with pan masala, the same would
                           become ―food‖, which would be covered by COTPA, 2003, as
                           defined under the schedule of the COTPA, 2003. Therefore, the
                           moment Pan Masala or Gutka is included in the schedule of the
                           COTPA, 2003, the law laid down in Godawat Pan Masala Products
                           I.P. Ltd. (supra) would operate the field and the provisions of the
                           FSSA Regulations, 2011, framed under the FSSA, 2006, would be
                           in direct conflict with the provisions of the COTPA, 2003.</blockquote>
<p id="p_336">                           30. It is significant to mention that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in
                           Godawat Pan Masala Products I.P. Ltd. (supra) has already held
                           that COTPA, 2003 is a special Act intended to deal with Tobacco
                           and Tobacco products, while <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_278">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a>,
                           1954, is a general Act. In the same analogy, the FSSA, 2006 being
                           a general Act, would yield to the provisions of the COTPA, 2003,
                           which is a special Act. It is settled law that when a general Act is
                           specifically passed, it is logical to presume that Parliament has not
                           repealed or modified the former special Act, unless anything to the

                           contrary appears from the subsequent general Act. For this
                           proposition, we may profitably refer to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble
                           Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/914491/" id="a_279">U.P. State Electricity Board v. Hari Shanker Jain
                           and others</a> - (1978) 4 SCC 16.‖

</p><p id="p_337">                    160. We however find ourselves unable to approve or adopt the view
                    expressed in Dwarapudi Sivarama Reddy since it clearly fails to
                    appreciate the backdrop in which Godawat had come to be rendered
                    and which aspects have been duly underlined by us in the preceding
                    parts of this decision. Significantly, in para 34 of that decision, the
                    said High Court seeks to sustain its conclusion that pan masala and
                    gutka cannot be construed as food on Godawat. The said observation
                    cannot possibly be accepted to be the correct position in law since,
                    and as was noticed hereinabove, Godawat had categorically held pan
                    masala to be food. The said decision in any case follows the judgment
                    which is impugned before us in these appeals. We for all the aforesaid
                    reasons thus find ourselves unable to agree with the decision in
                    Dwarapudi Sivarama Reddy.

</p><p id="p_339">                    161. That takes us then to consider the challenge to the successive
                    notifications which came to be issued by the appellant/GNCTD in
                    purported exercise of powers conferred by <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_280">Section 30(2)(a)</a>. As is
                    apparent from a reading of that provision, the power to prohibit as
                    vested in the Commissioner of Food Safety is stipulated to not exceed
                    a period of one year. The prohibition itself is further conditioned upon
                    the Commissioner of Food Safety being satisfied that such a

                    prohibition is liable to be imposed in the interest of public health. It is
                    in the aforesaid backdrop that the writ petitioners had contended that
                    the power to prohibit was clearly temporary in character and did not
                    warrant the repetitive issuance of prohibitory orders.
</p>
<p id="p_340">                    162. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid submission would have
                    held good provided the power to prohibit stood conferred and
                    governed by <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_281">Section 30(2)(a)</a> alone. However, and as was noticed in
                    the preceding paragraphs of this decision, Regulation 2.3.4 proscribes
                    the use of tobacco and nicotine as ingredients in any food product.
                    That prohibition is clearly neither provisional nor impermanent. Thus,
                    as long as the Commissioner of Food Safety finds that food articles
                    containing tobacco or nicotine are being manufactured, distributed or
                    sold, it would be fully justified in issuing a prohibitory order.
</p>
<p id="p_341">                    163. That prohibition would clearly be sustainable on a conjoint
                    reading of <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_282">Section 30(2)(a)</a> read with Regulation 2.3.4. The
                    prohibition this Court finds is principally aimed at giving effect to the
                    statutory injunct contained in Regulation 2.3.4. As noticed
                    hereinbefore, as long as that Regulation remains on the statute book,
                    there would be a ban which would operate on gutka, pan masala with
                    tobacco or other like commodity.

                           of this provision. In our opinion it is not necessary to go into this
                           question as counsel for the respondents conceded that this is one of
                           the requirements of the provision and if the power has to be
                           exercised it should be exercised in the manner provided on pain of
                           invalidating for non-compliance. There is currently in force a
                           prohibitory order in the same terms and hence the question cannot
                           be said to be academic. The other aspect viz. the propriety of
                           repetitive prohibitory orders is, however, to our mind a serious
                           matter and since long arguments have been advanced, we propose
                           to deal with it. In this case as a fact from October 1979 till 1982 at
                           the interval of almost two months orders under <a href="/doc/606905/" id="a_295">Section 144(1)</a> of
                           the Code have been made from time to time. It is not disputed
                           before us that the power conferred under this section is intended
                           for immediate prevention of breach of peace or speedy remedy. An
                           order made under this section is to remain valid for two months
                           from the date of its making as provided in sub-section (4) of
                           <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_296">Section 144</a>. The proviso to sub-section (4) authorises the State
                           Government in case it considers it necessary so to do for
                           preventing danger to human life, health or safety, or for preventing
                           a riot or any affray, to direct by notification that an order made by
                           a Magistrate may remain in force for a further period not exceeding
                           six months from the date on which the order made by the
                           Magistrate would have, but for such order, expired. The effect of
                           the proviso, therefore, is that the State Government would be
                           entitled to give the prohibitory order an additional term of life but
                           that would be limited to six months beyond the two months&#x27; period
                           in terms of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_297">Section 144</a> of the Code. Several
                           decisions of different High Courts have rightly taken the view that
                           it is not legitimate to go on making successive orders after earlier
                           orders have lapsed by efflux of time. A Full Bench consisting of

                           action was beyond the Magistrate&#x27;s powers. Making of successive
                           orders was disapproved by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High

                           represents a correct statement of the legal position. The proviso to
                           sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_305">Section 144</a> which gives the State Government
                           jurisdiction to extend the prohibitory order for a maximum period
                           of six months beyond the life of the order made by the Magistrate
                           is clearly indicative of the position that Parliament never intended
                           the life of an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_306">Section 144</a> of the Code to remain in
                           force beyond two months when made by a Magistrate. The scheme
                           of that section does not contemplate repetitive orders and in case
                           the situation so warrants steps have to be taken under other
                           provisions of the law such as <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_307">Section 107</a> or <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_308">Section 145</a> of the

                           such as here, there are provisions to be found in the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_309">Police Act</a>. If
                           repetitive orders are made it would clearly amount to abuse of the
                           power conferred by <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_310">Section 144</a> of the Code. It is relevant to advert
                           to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/749305/" id="a_311">Babulal Parate v. State of

                           challenged. Upholding the provision, this Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_184">                                  ―Public order has to be maintained in advance in
                                  order to ensure it and, therefore, it is competent to a
                                  legislature to pass a law permitting an appropriate
                                  authority to take anticipatory action or place
                                  anticipatory restrictions upon particular kinds of
                                  acts in an emergency for the purpose of maintaining
                                  public order....‖
                           It was again emphasized:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_185">                                  ―But it is difficult to say that an anticipatory action
                                  taken by such an authority in an emergency where
                                  danger to public order is genuinely apprehended is
                                  anything other than an action done in the discharge
                                  of the duty to maintain order....‖
                           This Court had, therefore, appropriately stressed upon the feature
                           that the provision of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_313">Section 144</a> of the Code was intended to meet
                           an emergency. This postulates a situation temporary in character
                           and, therefore, the duration of an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_314">Section 144</a> of the
                           Code could never have been intended to be semi-permanent in

                              agree that the nature of the order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_318">Section 144</a> of the Code is
                              intended to meet emergent situation. Thus the clear and definite
                              view of his Court is that an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_319">Section 144</a> of the Code is
                              not intended to be either permanent or semi-permanent in
                              character. The consensus of judicial opinion in the High Courts of
                              the country is thus in accord with the view expressed by this Court.
                              It is not necessary on that ground to quash the impugned order of
                              March 1982 as by efflux of time it has already ceased to be
                              effective.
</p><p id="p_346">                              18. It is appropriate to take note of the fact that the impugned order
                              under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_320">Section 144</a> of the Code did not ban processions or
                              gatherings at public places even by Ananda Margis. The
                              prohibition was with reference to the carrying of daggers, trishuls
                              and skulls. Even performance of Tandava dance in public places,
                              which we have held is not an essential part of religious rites to be
                              observed by Ananda Margis, without these, has not been
                              prohibited.‖

                              jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_322">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
                              of India has called in question the legal substantiality and
                              tenability of the order dated 6th July, 2010 passed by the
                              Deputy Commissioner of Police whereby he has, in exercise
                              of powers conferred on him under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_323">Section 144</a> of the

                              with Notification No. 11036/1/08-UTL dated 31.10.2008
                              issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs,
                              New Delhi passed an order prohibiting certain activities.
</p><p id="p_350">                              2. It is urged in the petition that the Delhi Police has been
                              issuing such prohibitory orders from time to time as a result
                              of which the fundamental right to assemble peacefully under
                              <a href="/doc/1248826/" id="a_324">Article 19(1)(b)</a> of the Constitution which includes holding
                              peaceful dharna, demonstration, etc. has been destroyed. It is
                              contended that the impugned order does not indicate any
                              criteria for granting or refusing permission. It is completely
                              left to the discretion of Delhi Police as a consequence of
                              which the permission to hold dharna, public meetings in the
                              entire prohibited area which is the centre of power and best
                              suited for political dharna is denied.

                              had come along with other activists to Delhi to raise a protest
                              because of the failure of the Government of India to set up an
                              empowered commission to look into the problems of the
                              victims of toxic gases leak from the plant of Union Carbide in
                              1984, but the same has become unfruitful because of the order
                              passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police. Reference has
                              been made to <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_325">Section 144</a> to show that in total violation of the
                              said provision, the Delhi Police have been issuing orders
                              under <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_326">Section 144</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_327">Cr.PC</a> in a routine manner without there
                              being any emergent situation. It is the case of the petitioner
                              that the said orders create unreasonable restriction which
                              affects the fundamental right of the petitioner. It is urged that
                              the prohibitory orders are in total violation of Article 19(1)(a)
                              and (b) and the same have been issued without any basis and
                              thereby tantamounts to abuse of the process of the mandate

                              respondent No. 2 on the question of admission. It is submitted
                              by Mr. Bhushan that the orders have been passed one after the
                              other in a routine manner without the authority addressing to
                              the emergent nature and taking recourse to power conferred

                              propounded by him that the prohibitions that have been
                              stipulated in the order are violative of fundamental rights and
                              the right to protest is totally extinguished. To buttress the
                              submission, he has placed reliance on the decision in <a href="/doc/296985/" id="a_329">Himmat

                              across    a    decision     in <a href="/doc/798012/" id="a_331">Acharya     Jagdishwaranand
                              Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta</a>, (1983) 4 SCC
                              522 : AIR 1984 SC 51, wherein it has been held as follows:
                               ―The other aspect, viz., the propriety of repetitive
                               prohibitory orders is, however, to our mind a serious
                               matter and since long arguments have been advanced, we
                               propose to deal with it. In this case as a fact from October
                               1979 till 1982 at the interval of almost two months orders
                               under <a href="/doc/606905/" id="a_332">Section 144(1)</a> of the Code have been made from
                               time to time. It is not disputed before us that the power
                               conferred under this section is intended for immediate
                               prevention of breach of peace or speedy remedy. An order
                               made under this section is to remain valid for two months
                               from the date of its making as provided in sub-section (4)
                               of <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_333">Section 144</a>. The proviso to sub-section (4) authorises
                               the State Government in case it considers it necessary so to
                               do for preventing danger to human life, health or safety, or
                               for preventing a riot or any affray, to direct by notification
                               that an order made by a Magistrate may remain in force for
                               a further period not exceeding six months from the date on
                               which the order made by the Magistrate would have, but
                               for such order, expired. The effect of the proviso,
                               therefore, is that the State Government would be entitled to
                               give the prohibitory order an additional term of life but that
                               would be limited to six months beyond the two months?
                               period in terms of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_334">Section 144</a> of the
                               Code. Several decisions of different High Courts have
                               rightly taken the view that it is not legitimate to go on

                               by efflux of time. A Full Bench consisting of the entire

                               took the view that such an action was beyond the
                               Magistrate&#x27;s powers. Making of successive orders was
                               disapproved by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High
                               Court in <a href="/doc/1219630/" id="a_338">Bishessur Chuckerbutty v. Emperor</a>. Similar view

                               the legal position. The proviso to sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_342">Section
                               144</a> which gives the State Government jurisdiction to
                               extend the prohibitory order for a maximum period of six
                               months beyond the life of the order made by the Magistrate
                               is clearly indicative of the position that Parliament never
                               intended the life of an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_343">Section 144</a> of the Code
                               to remain in force beyond two months when made by a
                               Magistrate. The scheme of that section does not
                               contemplate repetitive orders and in case the situation so
                               warrants steps have to be taken under other provisions of
                               the law such as <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_344">Section 107</a> or <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_345">Section 145</a> of the Code

                               such as here, there are provisions to be found in the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_346">Police

                               to abuse of the power conferred by <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_347">Section 144</a> of the
                               Code. It is relevant to advert to the decision of this Court

                               intended to meet an emergency. This postulates a situation
                               temporary in character and, therefore, the duration of an

                    of <a href="/doc/1584248/" id="a_355">Section 30(2)(a)</a> and Regulation 2.3.4 is clearly distinguishable
                    from the scheme which informs <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_356">Section 144</a> of the CrPC. <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_357">Section 144</a>
                    is liable to be invoked in an emergent situation and when immediate
                    prevention is to be ordered. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that courts
                    have taken the view that an order once made under <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_358">Section 144</a> cannot
                    be revived and renewed for time immemorial.

                    se. Consequently, as long as the interest of public health requires a
                    prohibition being imposed with respect to the addition of tobacco or
                    nicotine in food articles, the appellant would clearly be justified in

                    orders passed by the Supreme Court in Ankur Gutka and Central
                    Arecanut. As was noted in the preceding parts of this decision, we find
                    that in Ankur Gutka, the Supreme Court in its order of 03 April 2013
                    had taken note of the contention of the Solicitor General of various
                    States and Union Territories having imposed a complete ban on the
                    sale of gutka and pan masala with tobacco and/or nicotine. The

                    Solicitor General had also apprised the Supreme Court of the
                    malicious tactics adopted by some of the manufacturers, of selling
                    gutka and pan masala in two separate pouches.
</p>
<p id="p_365">                    170. Taking note of the aforesaid as well as the communication
                    issued by the Union Government addressed to all State Governments
                    on 27 August 2012, the Supreme Court issued notice to all State
                    Governments and Union Territories which had so far not issued
                    notifications banning the sale of gutka and pan masala with tobacco in
                    terms of the FSSA to apprise the Court why they had failed to take
                    action pursuant to the letter issued by the Union Government and
                    noticed hereinabove. It was the aforesaid order which appears to have
                    prompted the issuance of the first of the prohibitory orders in 2015.

<p id="p_366">                    171. The prohibition with respect to sale of gutka and pan masala
                    with tobacco was again noticed by the Supreme Court in Central
                    Arecanut and more particularly the order of 23 September 2016
                    passed therein where the aforenoted order passed in Ankur Gutka was
                    noticed yet again. The Supreme Court also took note of Regulation
                    2.3.4 and consequently, the obligation placed upon all to enforce the
                    said Regulation. It, accordingly, directed all concerned statutory
                    authorities to comply with Regulation 2.3.4. It also called upon all
                    State Governments and Union Territories to file affidavits with respect
                    to ―total compliance of the ban imposed on manufacturing and sale of

                    set up in the writ petition is distinguishable since it relates to chewing
                    tobacco and not gutka and pan masala with tobacco and/or nicotine.

                    Notifications clearly related to gutka and pan masala with tobacco or
                    nicotine. The peremptory direction issued by the Supreme Court in the
                    aforenoted two matters was an ambiguous command to all State
                    Governments and Union Territories to enforce the prohibition in
                    respect thereof and to ensure compliance with the diktat of Regulation

                    evident from the conclusions which came to be recorded by the Expert
                    Committee, it was found that 163.7 million people in the country are
                    users of only smokeless tobacco. Compared to the above, the number
                    of persons smoking was pegged at 68.9 million. The Quit Ratio for
                    users of smokeless tobacco was placed at 5%. That report had also
                    taken note of the exponential increase in the total number of users of
                    smokeless tobacco over the years. As the GATS Report 2016-2017
                    would establish, the total number of adult smokeless tobacco users
                    was found to be 199.4 million and thus almost double that of current
                    tobacco smokers which was placed in the earlier survey at 99.5
                    million. It becomes pertinent to note that in GATS 1 [2009-2010], the
                    number of smokeless tobacco users was found to be 163.7 million. By
                    the time the GATS 2 [2016-17] Report came to be published, these
                    users had increased to 199.4 million thus evidencing the exponential
                    increase in the number of users of smokeless tobacco.

                    once it was found and conceded that both categories of tobacco

                    not issue to perpetuate an illegality or cause serious prejudice to larger
                    public interest. The acceptance of the submission addressed in this
                    regard would amount to the Court sanctioning the distribution and sale
                    of smokeless tobacco in addition to smoking tobacco. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_362">Article 14</a>
                    cannot possibly be invoked on the ground that since a particular genre
                    of tobacco has not been banned, there should be no prohibition in
                    respect of an equally harmful article. In any case, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_363">Article 14</a> does not
                    contemplate of a negative equality. It is, as has been repeatedly held, a
                    positive constitutional right. The guarantee and protection conferred
                    by that Article cannot be invoked to assert a right to manufacture, sell
                    or distribute a harmful substance merely because the appellant has
                    failed to take identical steps in respect of an equally injurious article.
                    We thus find ourselves unable to either appreciate or countenance the
                    submissions addressed on this score.

                    views and perceptions of what would have been a more efficacious
                    measure. Ultimately the balancing of imperatives, evaluation of
                    competing factors, exigencies of the time are all factors which must be
                    left for the executive to weigh while formulating an appropriate
                    policy. Courts are ultimately concerned not with the efficacy of the
                    policy but its legality.

<p id="p_375">                    177. Though the principles which must be borne in mind with
                    respect to the extent of judicial review in relation to policy decisions is
                    well settled, the Court deems it apposite to notice the following
                    decisions. <a href="/doc/1014138/" id="a_364">In Directorate of Film Festivals vs. Gaurav Ashwin
                    Jain53</a>, while holding that the Courts cannot be called upon to examine
                    the correctness of a policy, the Supreme Court held as follows: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_189">                              ―16. The scope of judicial review of governmental policy is now
                              well defined. Courts do not and cannot act as Appellate Authorities
                              examining the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a
                              policy, nor are courts advisors to the executive on matters of policy
                              which the executive is entitled to formulate. The scope of judicial
                              review when examining a policy of the Government is to check
                              whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is
                              opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any
                              statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere
                              with policy either on the ground that it is erroneous or on the
                              ground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is available. Legality

                           ―57. Judicial review is not concerned with matters of economic
                           policy. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the
                           legislature or its agents as to matters within the province of either.
                           The court does not supplant the ―feel of the expert‖ by its own
                           views. When the legislature acts within the sphere of its authority
                           and delegates power to an agent, it may empower the agent to
                           make findings of fact which are conclusive provided such findings
                           satisfy the test of reasonableness. In all such cases, judicial inquiry
                           is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are
                           reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are
                           consistent with the laws of the land. As stated by Jagannatha
                           Shetty, J. in Gupta Sugar Works [1987 Supp SCC 476, 481] : (SCC
                           p. 479, para 4)
                                   ―... the court does not act like a chartered accountant
                                   nor acts like an income tax officer. The court is not
                                   concerned with any individual case or any particular
                                   problem. The court only examines whether the price
                                   determined was with due regard to considerations
                                   provided by the statute. And whether extraneous
                                   matters have been excluded from determination.‖
                            ―59. It is a matter of policy and planning for the Central
                           Government to decide whether it would be, on adoption of a
                           system of partial control, in the best economic interest of the sugar
                           industry and the general public that the sugar factories are grouped
                           together with reference to geographical-cum-agro-economic factors
                           for the purpose of determining the price of levy sugar. Sufficient
                           power has been delegated to the Central Government to formulate
                           and implement its policy decision by means of statutory
                           instruments and executive orders. Whether the policy should be
                           altered to divide the sugar industry into groups of units with similar
                           cost characteristics with particular reference to recovery, duration,
                           size and age of the units and capital cost per tonne of output,
                           without regard to their location, as recommended by the BICP, is
                           again a matter for the Central Government to decide. What is best
                           for the sugar industry and in what manner the policy should be
                           formulated and implemented, bearing in mind the fundamental
                           object of the statute, viz., supply and equitable distribution of
                           essential commodity at fair prices in the best interest of the general
                           public, is a matter for decision exclusively within the province of
                           the Central Government. Such matters do not ordinarily attract the
                           power of judicial review.‖

                              instead of another is not a matter of concern in judicial review and
                              the Court is not the appropriate forum for such investigation.

                              infringement of fundamental right is not shown the courts will have

                           Order 2021, by which it was determined that work carried out by
                           certain police and defence force personnel could only be
                           undertaken by workers who have been vaccinated. Three police
                           and defence force workers who did not wish to be vaccinated
                           sought judicial review of the said order before the High Court of
                           New Zealand (hereinafter, the ―NZ High Court‖). While
                           adjudicating the dispute, the NZ High Court in Ryan Yardley
                           (supra) expressed its opinion that the choices made by
                           governments on their response to COVID-19 involve wide policy
                           questions, including decisions on the use of border closures,
                           lockdowns, isolation requirements, vaccine mandates and many
                           other measures, which are decisions for the elected representatives
                           to make. The NZ High Court made it clear that the Court addresses
                           narrower legal questions and the Court&#x27;s function is not to address
                           the wider policy questions. While referring to the evidence of
                           experts, the NZ High Court stressed on the institutional limitations
                           on the Court&#x27;s ability to reach definitive conclusions but clarified
                           that the Court must exercise its constitutional responsibility to
                           ensure that decisions are made lawfully. While relying upon a
                           judgment of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in Ministry of
                           Health v. Atkinson15, the NZ High Court held that the Crown has
                           the burden to demonstrate that a limitation of a fundamental right
                           is demonstrably justified. We have come to know that in the time
                           since the judgment in this matter was reserved, the decision of the
                           NZ High Court in Ryan Yardley (supra) has been appealed by the
                           Government of New Zealand before the New Zealand Court of

<p id="p_381">                           It is well settled that the Courts, in exercise of their power of
                           judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with the policy decisions
                           of the executive unless the policy can be faulted on grounds of
                           mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or unfairness etc. Indeed,
                           arbitrariness, irrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the
                           policy unconstitutional. It is neither within the domain of the courts
                           nor the scope of judicial review to embark upon an enquiry as to
                           whether a particular public policy is wise or whether better public
                           policy can be evolved. Nor are the courts inclined to strike down a
                           policy at the behest of a petitioner merely because it has been
                           urged that a different policy would have been fairer or wiser or
                           more scientific or more logical. Courts do not and cannot act as
                           appellate authorities examining the correctness, suitability and
                           appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the executive

                           on matters of policy which the executive is entitled to formulate.
                           The scope of judicial review when examining a policy of the
                           Government is to check whether it violates the fundamental rights
                           of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution,
                           or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary18.
</p><p id="p_382">                           22. This Court in a series of decisions has reiterated that courts
                           should not rush in where even scientists and medical experts are
                           careful to tread. The rule of prudence is that courts will be reluctant
                           to interfere with policy decisions taken by the Government, in
                           matters of public health, after collecting and analysing inputs from
                           surveys and research. Nor will courts attempt to substitute their
                           own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper, in relation to
                           technical issues relating to public health in preference to those
                           formulated by persons said to possess technical expertise and rich
                           experience. Where expertise of a complex nature is expected of the
                           State in framing rules, the exercise of that power not demonstrated
                           as arbitrary must be presumed to be valid as a reasonable
                           restriction on the fundamental right of the citizen and judicial
                           review must halt at the frontiers. The Court cannot re-weigh and
                           substitute its notion of expedient solution. Within the wide judge-
                           proof areas of policy and judgment open to the government, if they
                           make mistakes, correction is not in court but elsewhere. That is the
                           comity of constitutional jurisdictions in our jurisprudence. We
                           cannot evolve a judicial policy on medical issues. All judicial
                           thought, Indian and Anglo-American, on the judicial review power
                           where rules under challenge relate to a specialised field and
                           involve sensitive facets of public welfare, has warned courts of
                           easy assumption of unreasonableness of subordinate legislation on
                           the strength of half-baked studies of judicial generalists aided by
                           the adhoc learning of counsel. However, the Court certainly is the
                           constitutional invigilator and must act to defend the citizen in the
                           assertion of his fundamental rights against executive tyranny
                           draped in disciplinary power.
</p><p id="p_383">                           23. There is no doubt that this Court has held in more than one
                           judgment that where the decision of the authority is in regard to a
                           policy matter, this Court will not ordinarily interfere since
                           decisions on policy matters are taken based on expert knowledge of
                           the persons concerned and courts are normally not equipped to
                           question the correctness of a policy decision. However, this does
                           not mean that courts have to abdicate their right to scrutinise
                           whether the policy in question is formulated keeping in mind all
                           the relevant facts and the said policy can be held to be beyond the
                           pale of discrimination or unreasonableness, bearing in mind the

                           material on record. In Delhi Development Authority (supra), this
                           Court held that an executive order termed as a policy decision is
                           not beyond the pale of judicial review. Whereas the superior courts
                           may not interfere with the nitty-gritty of the policy, or substitute
                           one by the other but it will not be correct to contend that the court
                           shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is raised that the
                           impugned decision is a policy decision. Interference therewith on
                           the part of the superior court would not be without jurisdiction as it
                           is subject to judicial review. It was further held therein that the
                           policy decision is subject to judicial review on the following
                           grounds:

                    opinion that there existed no justification for the Impugned
                    Notifications being quashed on grounds which have found acceptance
                    with the learned Judge. In any case, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_374">Article 14</a> clearly did not warrant

                    that COTPA stood impliedly repealed upon promulgation of FSSA.
                    There was thus no necessity of the said observations being rendered.
                    In any case, in light of the conclusions recorded hereinabove, we find
                    no ground to interfere with the ultimate conclusion recorded by the
                    learned Judge in this respect.
</p>
<p id="p_392">                    185. Mr. Kirtiman Singh, learned CGSC had additionally sought to
                    contend that trade and commerce in tobacco is liable to be viewed as
                    res extra commercium. Mr. Singh had in this connection referred to
                    certain observations as entered in Nava Bans Sar Vyapar Association
                    as well as Health for Millions Trust and Unicorn Industries. However,
                    we find ourselves unable to enter such a declaration bearing in mind
                    the categorical observations as were made by the Supreme Court in
                    Godawat. The relevant passages of Godawat in this respect are
                    extracted hereinbelow: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_198">                                &quot;53. Is the consumption of pan masala or gutka (containing
                           tobacco), or for that matter tobacco itself, considered so
                           inherently or viciously dangerous to health, and, if so, is there any
                           legislative policy to totally ban its use in the country? In the face
                           of Act 34 of 2003, the answer must be in the negative. It is
                           difficult to accept the contention that the substance banned by the
                           impugned notification is treated as res extra commercium. In the
                           first place, the gamut of legislation enacted in this country which
                           deals with tobacco does not suggest that Parliament has ever
                           treated it as an article res extra commercium, nor has Parliament
                           attempted to ban its use absolutely. The Industries (Development

                           listed in the Schedule except to minors. Further, we find that in
                           the Tariff Schedule of the Central Sales Tax Act there are several
                           entries which deal with tobacco and also pan masala. In the face
                           of these legislative measures seeking to levy restrictions and
                           control the manufacture and sale of tobacco and its allied products
                           as well as pan masala, it is not possible to accept that the article
                           itself has been treated as res extra commercium. The legislative
                           policy, if any, seems to be to the contrary. In any event, whether
                           an article is to be prohibited as res extra commercium is a matter
                           of legislative policy and must arise out of an Act of legislature
                           and not by a mere notification issued by an executive authority.‖
