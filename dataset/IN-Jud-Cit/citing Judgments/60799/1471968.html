for each State. <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_4">Article 154</a> vests the executive power of the state in the

Governor. <a href="/doc/686327/" id="a_5">Article 155</a> provides that the Governor of a State shall be

Submissions of Petitioner



</blockquote><p id="p_8">4.    The petitioner submits that a Governor, as the Head of the State, holds

a high constitutional office which carries with it important constitutional

functions and duties; that the fact that the Governor is appointed by the

President and that he holds office during the pleasure of the President does

not make the Governor an employee or a servant or agent of the Union

Government; and that his independent constitutional office is not

subordinate or subservient to the Union Government and he is not

accountable to them for the manner in which he carries out his functions and

duties as Governor. It is contended that a Governor should ordinarily be

permitted to continue in office for the full term of five years; and though he

holds office during the pleasure of the President, he could be removed before

the expiry of the term of five years, only in rare and exceptional

circumstances, by observing the following constitutional norms and

requirements :
</p>
<p id="p_9">(a) The withdrawal of presidential pleasure under <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_7">Article 156</a>, cannot be
an unfettered discretion, nor can it be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or
malafide. The power of removal should be used only if there is material to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>


demonstrate misbehaviour, impropriety or incapacity. In other words, that
removal should be only on existence of grounds which are similar to those
prescribed for impeachment in the case of other constitutional functionaries.


</p><p id="p_10">(b) Before a Governor is removed in exercise of power under clause (1)
of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_8">Article 156</a>, principles of natural justice will have to be followed. He
should be issued a show cause notice setting out the reasons for the proposed
removal and be given an opportunity of being heard in respect of those
reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(c) The removal should be by a speaking order so as to apprise him and
the public, of the reasons for considering him unfit to be continued as a
Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
It is also contended that the withdrawal of presidential pleasure resulting in

removal of a Governor is justiciable, by way of judicial review.



</p><p id="p_13">5.      During the hearing, the petitioner slightly shifted his stand. Mr. Soli

J. Sorabjee, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner,

submitted that to ensure the independence and effective functioning of

Governors, certain safeguards will have to be read as limitations upon the

power of removal of Governors under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_9">Article 156(1)</a> having regard to the

basic structure of the Constitution. He clarified that the petitioner's

submission is not that a Governor has a fixed irremovable tenure of five

years, but that there should be some certainty of tenure so that he can

discharge the duties and functions of his constitutional office effectively and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>


independently. Certainty of tenure will be achieved by fixing the norms for

removal. On the other hand, recognizing an unfettered discretion will subject

a Governor to a constant threat of removal and make him subservient to the

Union Government, apart from demoralizing him. Therefore, the removal

should conform to the following constitutional norms :


Norm 1 - Removal of Governor to be in rare and exceptional circumstances,

for compelling reasons which make him unfit to continue in office: The

tenure of a Governor is five years under clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_10">Article 156.</a> But clause

(3) is subject to clause (1) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_11">Article 156</a> which provides that a Governor

holds office during the pleasure of the President. This only means that he

could be removed any time during the said period of five years, for

compelling reasons which are germane to, and having a nexus with, the

nature of his office and functions performed by him, as for example, (a)

physical or mental disability; (b) corruption; (c) violation of Constitution;

and (d) misbehaviour or behaviour unbecoming of a Governor rendering him

unfit to hold the office (that is indulging in active politics or regularly

addressing political rallies, or having links with anti-national or subversive

elements, etc.). The removal of a Governor under <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_12">Article 156</a> cannot be with

reference to the ideology or personal preferences of the Governor. Nor can

such removal be with any ulterior motives, as for example, to make place for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>


another person who is perceived to be more amenable to the central

government's wishes and directions, or to make room for a politician who

could not be accommodated or continued in the Council of Ministers.


Norm 2 - A Governor should be apprised of the reasons for removal :

Though there is no need for a formal show cause notice or an enquiry,

principles of fair play requires that when a high constitutional functionary

like the Governor is sought to be removed, he should be apprised of the

reasons therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
Norm 3 - The order of removal is subject to judicial review: In a democracy

based on Rule of Law, no authority has any unfettered and unreviewable

discretion. All powers vested in all public authorities, are intended to be

used only for public good. Therefore, any order of premature removal of a

Governor will be open to judicial review.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
Submissions of respondents


</p><p id="p_16">6.    The respondents in their counter affidavit have contended that the

power of the President to remove a Governor under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_13">Article 156(1)</a> is

absolute and unfettered. The term of five years provided in <a href="/doc/49698/" id="a_14">Article 156(3)</a> is

subject to the doctrine of pleasure contained in <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_15">Article 156(1).</a> The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>


Constitution does not place any restrictions or limitations upon the doctrine

of pleasure. Therefore, it is impermissible to read any kind of limitations

into the power under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_16">Article 156(1).</a> The power of removal is exercised by

the President on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The advice tendered

by the Council of Ministers cannot be inquired into by any court, having

regard to the bar contained in <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_17">Article 74(2).</a> It was therefore urged that on

both these grounds, the removal of Governor is not justiciable.



</p><p id="p_17">7.    The learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondents

raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition. He

submitted that if the four Governors who were removed, do not wish to seek

any relief and have accepted their removal without protest, no member of the

public can bring a public interest litigation for grant of relief to them. On

merits, he submitted that the provision that the Governor shall hold office

during the pleasure of the Government meant that the President's pleasure

can be withdrawn at any time resulting in the removal of the Governor,

without assigning any reason. He submitted that the founding fathers had

specifically provided that Governors will hold office during the pleasure of

the President, so as to provide to the Union Government, the flexibility of

removal if it lost confidence in a Governor or if he was unfit to continue as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>


Governor. He shifted from the stand in the counter that the power under

<a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_18">Article 156(1)</a> is an unfettered discretion. He submitted that a provision that

the Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, is not a

licence to act arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously. The Union

Government did not claim any right to do what it pleases, as Constitution

abhors arbitrariness and unfettered discretion. He stated that the removal

should be for a reason, but such reason need not be communicated. He also

submitted that removal by applying the doctrine of pleasure need not

necessarily relate to any act or omission or fault on the part of the Governor.

He submitted that in essence, the object of providing that the Governor shall

hold office during the pleasure of the President was that if the President lost

faith in the Governor or found him unfit for whatever reason, he can

withdraw the presidential pleasure resulting in removal. He submitted that

the pleasure doctrine cannot be denuded of its width, by restricting its

applications to specific instances of fault or misbehaviour on the part of the

Governor, or by implying an obligation to assign or communicate any reason

for the removal.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">8.    The learned Attorney General submitted that in a democracy, political

parties are formed on shared beliefs and they contest election with a declared
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                        9</span>


agenda. If a party which comes to power with a particular social and

economic agenda, finds that a Governor is out of sync with its policies, then

it should be able to remove such a Governor. The learned Attorney General

was categorical in his submission that the Union Government will have the

right to remove a Governor without attributing any fault to him, if the

President loses confidence in a Governor or finds that the Governor is out of

sync with democratic and electoral mandate.

<p id="p_20">
Questions for consideration


</p><p id="p_21">9.      The contentions raised give rise to the following questions:

</p><pre id="pre_2">(i)     Whether the petition is maintainable?

(ii)    What is the scope of "doctrine of pleasure"?

</pre><p id="p_22">(iii)   What is the position of a Governor under the Constitution?

</p><p id="p_23">(iv)    Whether there are any express or implied limitations/restrictions upon
        the power under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_19">Article 156(1)</a> of the Constitution of India?

</p><p id="p_24">(v)     Whether the removal of Governors in exercise of the doctrine of
        pleasure is open to judicial review?
</p>
<p id="p_25">
We will consider each of these issues separately.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           10</span><p id="p_26">



</p><p id="p_27">(i)   Maintainability of the writ petition


</p><p id="p_28">10.   The respondents submitted that a writ petition by way of PIL, to

secure relief for the Governors who have been removed from office, is not

maintainable as none of the aggrieved persons had approached the court for

relief and the writ petitioner has no locus to maintain a petition seeking relief

on their behalf. It is pointed out that Governors do not belong to a helpless

section of society which by reason of poverty, ignorance, disability or other

disadvantage, is not capable of seeking relief. Reliance is placed on the

following observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_20">S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India</a> - 1981

(Supp) SCC 87 :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      " .....cases may arise where there is undoubtedly public injury by the act
      or omission of the State or a public authority but such act or omission also
      causes a specific legal injury to an individual or to a specific class or
      group of individuals. In such cases, a member of the public having
      sufficient interest can certainly maintain an action challenging the legality
      of such act or omission, but if the person on specific class or group of
      persons who are primarily injured as a result of such act or omission, do
      not wish to claim any relief and accept such act or omission willingly and
      without protect, the member of the public who complains of a secondary
      public injury cannot maintain the action, for the effect of entertaining the
      action at the instance of such member of the public would be to foist a
      relief on the person or specific class or group of persons primarily injured,
      which they do not want."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_29">The petitioner, by way of reply, merely pointed out another observation in

S.P. Gupta :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                            11</span><p id="p_30">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "But there may be cases where the State or a public authority may act in
      violation of a constitutional or statutory obligation or fail to carry out such
      obligation, resulting in injury to public interest or what may conveniently
      be termed as public injury as distinguished from private injury. Who
      would have standing to complain against such act or omission of the State
      or public authority? Can any member of the public sue for judicial
      redress? Or is the standing limited only to a certain class of persons? Or
      there is no one who can complain and the public injury must go
      unredressed........
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      If the State or any public authority acts beyond the scope of its power and
      thereby causes a specific legal injury to a person or to a determinate class
      or group of persons, it would be a case of private injury actionable in the
      manner discussed in the preceding paragraphs. So also if the duty is owed
      by the State or any public authority to a person or to a determinate class or
      group of persons, it would give rise to a corresponding right in such
      person or determinate class or group of persons and they would be entitled
      to maintain an action for judicial redress. But if no specific legal injury is
      caused to a person or to a determinate class or group of persons by the act
      or omission of the State or any public authority and the injury is caused
      only to public interest, the question arises as to who can maintain an action
      for vindicating the rule of law and setting aside the unlawful action or
      enforcing the performance of the public duty. If no one can maintain an
      action for redress of such public wrong or public injury, it would be
      disastrous for the rule of law, for it would be open to the State or a public
      authority to act with impunity beyond the scope of its power or in breach
      of a public duty owed by it. The Courts cannot countenance such a
      situation where the observance of the law is left to the sweet will of the
      authority bound by it, without any redress if the law is contravened. The
      view has therefore been taken by the Courts in many decisions that
      whenever there is a public wrong or public injury caused by an act or
      omission of the State or a public authority which is contrary to the
      Constitution or the law, any member of the public acting bona fide and
      having sufficient interest can maintain an action for redressal of such
      public wrong or public injury. The strict rule of standing which insists that
      only a person who has suffered a specific legal injury can maintain an
      action for judicial redress is relaxed and a broad rule is evolved which
      gives standing to any member of the public who is not a mere busy-body
      or a meddlesome interloper but who has sufficient interest in the
      proceeding."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">11.   A similar public interest litigation came up before a Constitution

Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1748865/" id="a_21">Ranji Thomas v. Union of India</a> - 2000 (2) SCC 81,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                            12</span>


seeking intervention of this court to restrain the President of India from

"forcibly" extracting resignations from various Governors and Lt.

Governors. Prayer (a) therein sought quashing of the resignations of certain

Governors and Lt. Governors and prayer (b) sought a direction restraining

the President from accepting the "involuntary and forced" resignation of

Governors and Lt. Governors. Prayer (c) was a general prayer for a

declaration that communication of the President seeking the resignation of

Governors and Lt. Governors was ultra vires the Constitution. Dealing with

the contention that such a petition was not maintainable this Court observed:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "The learned Attorney General appearing for the Union of India submits
      that this public interest litigation is not maintainable at the instance of the
      petitioner, since none of the Governors or Lt. Governors have approached
      this Court or protested against their being asked to resign and that the
      petitioner cannot challenge an act which the party affected does not wish
      to nor intend to challenge. He relies upon the observations made by this
      Court in the case of <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_22">S.P. Gupta v. Union of India</a> [1981 (Supp) SCC 87].
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      Insofar as prayers (a) and (b) in the writ petition are concerned, we find
      force in the submission of the learned Attorney General. But, insofar as
      prayer (c) of the writ petition is concerned, it raises an important public
      issue and involves the interpretation of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_23">Article 156</a> of the Constitution of
      India. As at present advised, we do not think that we can deny locus to the
      petitioner for raising that issue."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_32">The petitioner has no locus to maintain the petition in regard to the prayers

claiming relief for the benefit of the individual Governors. At all events,

such prayers no longer survive on account of passage of time. However,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                            13</span>


with regard to the general question of public importance referred to the

Constitution Bench, touching upon the scope of <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_24">Article 156 (1)</a> and the

limitations upon the doctrine of pleasure, the petitioner has necessary locus.



</p><p id="p_33">(ii)   Scope of doctrine of pleasure


</p><p id="p_34">12.    The Pleasure Doctrine has its origin in English law, with reference to

the tenure of public servants under the Crown. In Dunn v. Queen - 1896 (1)

QB 116, the Court of Appeal referred to the old common law rule that a

public servant under the British Crown had no tenure but held his position at

the absolute discretion of the Crown. It was observed:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "I take it that persons employed as the petitioner was in the service of the
       Crown, except in cases where there is some statutory provision for a
       higher tenure of office, are ordinarily engaged on the understanding that
       they hold their employment at the pleasure of the Crown. So I think that
       there must be imported into the contract for the employment of the
       petitioner, the term which is applicable to civil servants in general,
       namely, that the Crown may put an end to the employment at its pleasure.
       It seems to me that it is the public interest which has led to the term which
       I have mentioned being imported into contracts for employment in the
       service of the Crown. The cases cited show that, such employment being
       for the good of the public, it is essential for the public good that it should
       be capable of being determined at the pleasure of the Crown, except in
       certain exceptional cases where it has been deemed to be more for the
       public good that some restrictions should be imposed on the power of the
       Crown to dismiss its servants."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                                                 (emphasis supplied)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                         14</span>


12.1) In Shenton v. Smith [1895 AC 229], the Privy Council

explained that the pleasure doctrine was a necessity because, the

difficulty of dismissing those servants whose continuance in office

was detrimental to the State would, if it were necessary to prove some

offence to the satisfaction of a jury (or court) be such, as to seriously

impede the working of the public service.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_35">12.2) A Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1134697/" id="a_25">Union of India v. Tulsiram

Patel</a> - (1985) 3 SCC 398 explained the origin of the doctrine thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "In England, except where otherwise provided by statute, all public
      officers and servants of the Crown hold their appointments at the pleasure
      of the Crown or durante bene placito ("during good pleasure" or "during
      the pleasure of the appointor") as opposed to an office held dum bene se
      gesserit ("during good conduct"), also called quadiu se bene gesserit ("as
      long as he shall behave himself well"). When a person holds office during
      the pleasure of the Crown, his appointment can be terminated at any time
      without assigning cause. The exercise of pleasure by the Crown can,
      however, be restricted by legislation enacted by Parliament because in the
      United Kingdom Parliament is sovereign. ......"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                                        (emphasis supplied)



12.3) <a href="/doc/480602/" id="a_26">In State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid</a> - 1954 SCR 786, another

Constitution Bench explained the doctrine of pleasure thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "The rule that a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the Crown
      has its origin in the latin phrase "durante bene placito" ("during
      pleasure") meaning that the tenure of office of a civil servant, except
      where it is otherwise provided by statute, can be terminated at any time
      without cause assigned. The true scope and effect of this expression is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                            15</span>

      that even if a special contract has been made with the civil servant the
      Crown is not bound thereby. In other words, civil servants are liable to
      dismissal without notice and there is no right of action for wrongful
      dismissal, that is, that they cannot claim damages for premature
      termination of their services."

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">12.4) H.M. Seervai, in his treatise `Constitutional law of India' (4th Ed.,

Vol. 3, pp.2989-90) explains this English Crown's power to dismiss at

pleasure in the following terms:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "In a contract for service under the Crown, civil as well as military, there
      is, except in certain cases where it is otherwise provided by law, imported
      into the contract a condition that the Crown has the power to dismiss at
      pleasure....Where the general rule prevails, the Crown is not bound to
      show good cause for dismissal, and if a servant has a grievance that he has
      been dismissed unjustly, his remedy is not by a law suit but by an appeal
      of an official or political kind......If any authority representing the Crown
      were to exclude the power of the Crown to dismiss at pleasure by express
      stipulation, that would be a violation of public policy and the stipulation
      cannot derogate from the power of the Crown to dismiss at pleasure, and
      this would apply to a stipulation that the service was to be terminated by a
      notice of a specified period of time. Where, however, the law authorizes
      the making of a fixed term contract, or subjects the pleasure of the Crown
      to certain restrictions, the pleasure is pro tanto curtailed and effect must be
      given to such law."

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">12.5) Black's Dictionary defines `Pleasure Appointment' as the assignment

<p id="p_36">13.   There is a distinction between the doctrine of pleasure as it existed in

a feudal set-up and the doctrine of pleasure in a democracy governed by rule

of law. In a nineteenth century feudal set-up unfettered power and discretion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                          16</span>


of the Crown was not an alien concept. However, in a democracy governed

by Rule of Law, where arbitrariness in any form is eschewed, no

Government or Authority has the right to do what it pleases. The doctrine of

pleasure does not mean a licence to act arbitrarily, capriciously or

whimsically. It is presumed that discretionary powers conferred in absolute

and unfettered terms on any public authority will necessarily and obviously

be exercised reasonably and for public good.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">14.   The following classic statement from Administrative Law (HWR

Wade &amp; CF Forsyth - 9th Ed. - Pages 354-355) is relevant in this context :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      "The common theme of all the authorities so far mentioned is that the
      notion of absolute or unfettered discretion is rejected. Statutory power
      conferred for public purposes is conferred as it were upon trust, not
      absolutely - that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and
      proper way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have
      intended. Although the Crown's lawyers have argued in numerous cases
      that unrestricted permissive language confers unfettered discretion, the
      truth is that, in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered government
      discretion is a contradiction in terms. The real question is whether the
      discretion is wide or narrow, and where the legal line is to be drawn. For
      this purpose everything depends upon the true intent and meaning of the
      empowering Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      The powers of public authorities are therefore essentially different from
      those of private persons. A man making his will may, subject to any rights
      of his dependants, dispose of his property just as he may wish. He may act
      out of malice or a spirit of revenge, but in law this does not affect his
      exercise of his power. In the same way a private person has an absolute
      power to allow whom he likes to use his land, to release a debtor, or where
      the law permits, to evict a tenant, regardless of his motive. This is
      unfettered discretion. But a public authority may do none of these things
      unless it acts reasonably and in good faith and upon lawful and relevant
      grounds of public interest...... The whole conception of unfettered
      discretion is inappropriate to a public authority, which possesses powers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                            17</span>

      solely in order that it may use them for the public good. There is nothing
      paradoxical in the imposition of such legal limits. It would indeed be
      paradoxical if they were not imposed."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">15.   It is of some relevance to note that the `Doctrine of Pleasure' in its

absolute unrestricted application does not exist in India. The said doctrine is

severely curtailed in the case of government employment, as will be evident

from clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_27">Article 310</a> and clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_28">Article 311.</a> Even in

regard to cases falling within the proviso to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_29">Article 311</a>, the

application of the doctrine is not unrestricted, but moderately restricted in

the sense that the circumstances mentioned therein should exist for its

operation. The Canadian Supreme Court in Wells v. Newfound land [1999

(177) DL (4th) 73(SCC)] has concluded that "at pleasure" doctrine is no

longer justifiable in the context of modern employment relationship.

<p id="p_39">16.   In Abdul Majid (supra), this Court considered the scope of the

doctrine of pleasure, when examining whether the rule of English Law that a

civil servant cannot maintain a suit against the State or against the Crown for

the recovery of arrears of salary as he held office during the pleasure of the

crown, applied in India. This Court held that the English principle did not

apply in India. This Court observed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      "It was suggested that the true view to take is that when the statute says
      that the office is to be held at pleasure, it means "at pleasure", and no rules
      or regulations can alter or modify that; nor can section 60 of the Code of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                           18</span>

      Civil Procedure, enacted by a subordinate legislature be used to construe
      an Act of a superior legislature. It was further suggested that some
      meaning must be given to the words "holds office during His Majesty's
      pleasure" as these words cannot be ignored and that they bear the meaning
      given to them by the Privy Council in I.M. Lall's case. [75 I.A.225]

      In our judgment, these suggestions are based on a misconception of the
      scope of this expression. The expression concerns itself with the tenure of
      office of the civil servant and it is not implicit in it that a civil servant
      serves the Crown ex gratia or that his salary is in the nature of a bounty. It
      has again no relation or connection with the question whether an action
      can be filed to recover arrears of salary against the Crown. The origin of
      the two rules is different and they operate on two different fields."

</blockquote>

<p id="p_45">20.   The Constitution of India also refers to other offices whose holders do

not hold office during the pleasure of the President or any other authority.

They are: President under <a href="/doc/1408921/" id="a_53">Article 56;</a> Judges of the Supreme Court under

<a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_54">Article 124;</a> Comptroller &amp; Auditor General of India under <a href="/doc/1422498/" id="a_55">Article 148;</a> High

Court Judges under <a href="/doc/1923298/" id="a_56">Article 218;</a> and Election Commissioners under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_57">Article

functionaries, it is specifically provided that they shall not be removed from

office except by impeachment, as provided in the respective provisions.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                     21</span>




</p><p id="p_46">21.   Constitution of India thus provides for three different types of tenure:

</p><p id="p_47">(i) Those who hold office during the pleasure of the President (or Governor);

</p><p id="p_48">(ii) Those who hold office during the pleasure of the President (or Governor),

subject to restrictions; (iii) Those who hold office for specified terms with

immunity against removal, except by impeachment, who are not subject to the

doctrine of pleasure. Constitutional Assembly debates clearly show that after

elaborate discussions, varying levels of protection against removal were

adopted in relation to different kinds of offices. We may conveniently

enumerate them: (i) Offices to which the doctrine of pleasure applied

absolutely without any restrictions (Ministers, Governors, Attorney General

and Advocate General); (ii) Offices to which doctrine of pleasure applied with

restrictions (Members of defence service, Members of civil service of the

Union, Member of an All-India service, holders of posts connected with

defence or any civil post under the Union, Member of a civil service of a State

and holders of civil posts under the State); and (iii) Offices to which the

doctrine of pleasure does not apply at all (President, Judges of Supreme Court,

Comptroller &amp; Auditor General of India, Judges of the High Court, and

Election Commissioners). Having regard to the constitutional scheme, it is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                      22</span>


possible to mix up or extend the type of protection against removal, granted to

one category of offices, to another category.
</p>
<p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">22.   The doctrine of pleasure as originally envisaged in England was a

prerogative power which was unfettered. It meant that the holder of an office

under pleasure could be removed at any time, without notice, without

assigning cause, and without there being a need for any cause. But where

rule of law prevails, there is nothing like unfettered discretion or

unaccountable action. The degree of need for reason may vary. The degree

of scrutiny during judicial review may vary. But the need for reason exists.

As a result when the Constitution of India provides that some offices will be

held during the pleasure of the President, without any express limitations or

restrictions, it should however necessarily be read as being subject to the

"fundamentals of constitutionalism". Therefore in a constitutional set up,

when an office is held during the pleasure of any Authority, and if no

limitations or restrictions are placed on the "at pleasure" doctrine, it means

that the holder of the office can be removed by the authority at whose

pleasure he holds office, at any time, without notice and without assigning

any cause. The doctrine of pleasure, however, is not a licence to act with

unfettered discretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously. It does
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                      23</span>


not dispense with the need for a cause for withdrawal of the pleasure. In

other words, "at pleasure" doctrine enables the removal of a person holding

office at the pleasure of an Authority, summarily, without any obligation to

give any notice or hearing to the person removed, and without any obligation

to assign any reasons or disclose any cause for the removal, or withdrawal of

pleasure. The withdrawal of pleasure cannot be at the sweet will, whim and

fancy of the Authority, but can only be for valid reasons.



</p><p id="p_51">(iii) Position of a Governor under the Constitution


</p><p id="p_52">23.   The Governor constitutes an integral part of the legislature of a State.

He is vested with the legislative power to promulgate ordinances while the

Houses of the legislature are not in session. The executive power of the State

is vested in him and every executive action of the Government is taken in his

name. He exercises the sovereign power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites

or remissions of punishment. He is vested with the power to summon each

House of the Legislature or to prorogue either House or to dissolve the

legislative assembly. No Bill passed by the Houses of the Legislature can

become law unless it is assented to by him. He has to make a report where

he finds that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                          24</span>


cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution. He thus occupies a

high constitutional office with important constitutional functions and duties.



</p><p id="p_53">24.   <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_58">In State of Rajasthan vs. Union of India</a> - 1977 (3) SCC 592, a

Constitution Bench of this Court described the position of Governor thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "67. The position of the Governor as the Constitutional head of State as a
      unit of the Indian Union as well as the formal channel of communication
      between the Union and the State Government, who is appointed under
      <a href="/doc/686327/" id="a_59">Article 155</a> of the Constitution "by the President by Warrant under his
      hand and seal," was also touched in the course of arguments before us. On
      the one hand, as the Constitutional head of the State, he is ordinarily
      bound, by reason of a constitutional convention, by the advice of his
      Council of Ministers conveyed to him through the Chief Minister barring
      very exceptional circumstances among which may be as pointed out by
      my learned brothers Bhagwati and Iyer, JJ., in Shamsher Singh's case,
      (1974 (2) SCC 31), a situation in which an appeal to the electorate by a
      dissolution is called for. On the other hand, as the defender of "the
      Constitution and the law" and the watch-dog of the interests of the whole
      country and well-being of the people of his State in particular, the
      Governor is vested with certain discretionary powers in the exercise of
      which he can act independently. One of his independent functions is the
      making of the report to the Union Government on the strength of which
      Presidential power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_60">Article 356(1)</a> of the Constitution could be
      exercised. In so far as he acts in the larger interests of the people,
      appointed by the President "to defend the constitution and the Law" he
      acts as an observer on behalf of the Union and has to keep a watch on
      how the administrative machinery and each organ of constitutional
      government is working in the state. Unless he keeps such a watch over all
      governmental activities and the state of public feelings about them, he
      cannot satisfactorily discharge his function of making the report which
      may form the basis of the Presidential satisfaction under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_61">Article 356(1)</a> of
      the Constitution."

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">      "It will be seen from this enumeration of the constitutional powers and
      functions of the Governor that he is not an employee or servant in any
      sense of the term. It is no doubt true that the Governor is appointed by the
      President which means in effect and substance the Government of India,
      but that is only a mode of appointment and it does not make the Governor
      an employee or servant of the Government of India. Every person
      appointed by the President is not necessarily an employee of the
      Government of India. So also it is not material that the Governor holds
      office during the pleasure of the President : it is a constitutional provision
      for determination of the term of office of the Governor and it does not
      make the Government of India an employer of the Governor. The
      Governor is the head of the State and holds a high constitutional office
      which carries with it important constitutional functions and duties and he
      cannot, therefore, even by stretching the language to a breaking point, be
      regarded as an employee or servant of the Government of India. He is not
      amenable to the directions of the Government of India, nor is he
      accountable for them for the manner in which he carries out his functions
      and duties. He is an independent constitutional office which is not subject
      to the control of the Government of India. He is constitutionally the head
      of the State in whom is vested the executive power of the State and
      without whose assent there can be no legislation in exercise of the
      legislative power of the State. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the
      office of Governor is not an employment under the Government of India
      and it does not come within the prohibition of clause (d) of <a href="/doc/1977659/" id="a_64">Article 319.</a> ...

      "It is clear from our Constitution that the Governor is not the agent of
      the President, because when it was intended to make the Governor an
      agent of the President it was expressly provided - as in Para 18(2),
      Schedule VI (repealed in 1972). It is equally clear from our
      Constitution that the Governor is entrusted with the discharge of his
      constitutional duties. In matters on which he must act on the advice of
      his Ministers - and they constitute an overwhelming part of his
      executive power - the question of his being the President's agent
      cannot arise."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_54">25.   It is thus evident that a Governor has a dual role. The first is that of a

constitutional Head of the State, bound by the advice of his Council of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                          27</span>


Ministers. The second is to function as a vital link between the Union

Government and the State Government. In certain special/emergent situations,

he may also act as a special representative of the Union Government. He is

required to discharge the functions related to his different roles harmoniously,

assessing the scope and ambit of each role properly. He is not an employee of

the Union Government, nor the agent of the party in power nor required to act

under the dictates of political parties. There may be occasions when he may

have to be an impartial or neutral Umpire where the views of the Union

Government and State Governments are in conflict. His peculiar position

arises from the fact that the Indian Constitution is quasi-federal in character.

In State of Karnataka (supra), this Court observed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">             "Strictly speaking, our Constitution is not of a federal character
             where separate, independent and sovereign States could be said to
             have joined to form a nation as in the United States of America or
             as may be the position in some other countries of the world. It is
             because of that reason that sometimes it has been characterized as
             quasi-federal in nature. Leaving the functions of the judiciary
             apart, by and large the legislative and the executive functions of
             the Centre and the States have been defined and distributed, but,
             even so, through it all runs an overall thread or rein in the hands of
             the Centre in both the fields."

<p id="p_55"><a href="/doc/139734870/" id="a_66">In S.R.Bommai v. Union of India</a> [1994 (3) SCC 1], a nine-Judge Bench of this

Court described the Constitution of India as quasi-federal, being a mixture of

federal and unitary elements leaning more towards the latter.

</p><p id="p_56">26.   In the early days of Indian democracy, the same political party was in

power both at the Centre and the States. The position has changed with

passage of time. Now different political parties, some national and some

regional, are in power in the States. Further one single party may not be in

power either in the Centre or in the State. Different parties with distinct

ideologies may constitute a front, to form a Government. On account of

emergence of coalition politics, many regional parties have started sharing

power in the Centre. Many a time there may not even be a common

programme, manifesto or agenda among the parties sharing power. As a

result, the agenda or ideology of a political party in power in the State may

not be in sync with the agenda or ideology of the political parties in the

ruling coalition at the Centre, or may not be in sync with the agenda or

ideology of some of the political parties in the ruling coalition at the Centre,

but may be in sync with some other political parties forming part of the

ruling coalition at the Centre. Further the compulsions of coalition politics

may require the parties sharing power, to frequently change their policies

and agendas. In such a scenario of myriad policies, ideologies, agendas in

the shifting sands of political coalitions, there is no question of the Union

Government having Governors who are in sync with its mandate and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                     29</span>


policies. Governors are not expected or required to implement the policies of

the government or popular mandates. Their constitutional role is clearly

defined and bears very limited political overtones. We have already noted

that the Governor is not the agent or the employee of the Union

Government. As the constitutional head of the State, many a time he may be

expressing views of the State Government, which may be neither his own

nor that of the Centre (for example, when he delivers the special address

under <a href="/doc/1093471/" id="a_67">Article 176</a> of the Constitution). Reputed elder statesmen, able

administrators and eminent personalities, with maturity and experience are

expected to be appointed as Governors. While some of them may come from

a political background, once they are appointed as Governors, they owe their

allegiance and loyalty to the Constitution and not to any political party and

are required to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution (see the terms

of oath or affirmation by the Governor, under <a href="/doc/586056/" id="a_68">Article 159</a> of the

Constitution). Like the President, Governors are expected to be apolitical,

discharging purely constitutional functions, irrespective of their earlier

political background. Governors cannot be politically active. We therefore

reject the contention of the respondents that Governors should be in "sync"

with the policies of the Union Government or should subscribe to the

ideology of the party in power at the Centre. As the Governor is neither the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                     30</span>


employee nor the agent of the Union Government, we also reject the

contention that a Governor can be removed if the Union Government or

party in power loses `confidence' in him.

Nehru and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar expressed during the Constituent Assembly

Debates, in regard to the office of Governor (Volume III Pages 455 and 469).

Sri Nehru said :
</p>
<p id="p_59">

      people from outside - eminent people, sometimes people who

      the party and thereby, in fact, help that government more than if
      he was considered as part of the party machine."

<p id="p_60">Dr. B. R. Ambedkar stated :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      "If the Constitution remains in principle the same as we intend

<p id="p_61">(iv) Limitations/restrictions upon the power under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_69">Article 156(1)</a> of
the Constitution of India


</p><p id="p_62">28.   We may now examine whether there are any express or implied

limitations or restrictions on the power of removal of Governors under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_70">Article

156(1).</a> We do so keeping in mind the following words of Justice Holmes :
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                       31</span>


"the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their

Gompers vs. United States - 233 US 603).

<p id="p_63">

Effect of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_71">Article 156</a>



</p><p id="p_64">29.   It was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the doctrine of

pleasure under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_72">Article 156(1)</a> is subject to the express restriction under clause

(3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_73">Article 156.</a> It was submitted that there is a significant difference

between Articles 75(2) and 76 (4) which provide for an unrestricted

application of the doctrine, and <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_74">Article 156(1)</a> which provided for application

of the doctrine subject to a restriction under <a href="/doc/49698/" id="a_75">Article 156(3).</a> It is pointed out

that in the case of Ministers and the Attorney General, Articles 75 and 76 do

not provide any period of tenure, whereas clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_76">Article 156</a> provides

that in the case of Governors, the term of office will be five years. It is

submitted that Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_77">Article 156</a> providing that the Governor shall

hold office during the pleasure of the President, should be read in consonance

with Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_78">Article 156</a> which provides that subject to clause (1) and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                      32</span>


subject to the Governor's right to resign from his office, a Governor shall hold

office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters office. The

petitioner interprets these two clauses of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_79">Article 156</a> thus: The tenure of

office of the Governor is five years. However, before the expiry of that period

the Governor may resign from office, or the President may, for good and valid

reasons relating to his physical/mental inability, integrity, and behaviour,

withdraw his pleasure thereby removing him from office.



</p><p id="p_65">30.   A plain reading of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_80">Article 156</a> shows that when a Governor is

appointed, he holds the office during the pleasure of the President, which

means that the Governor can be removed from office at any time without

notice and without assigning any cause. It is also open to the Governor to

resign from office at any time. If the President does not remove him from

office and if the Governor does not resign, the term of the Governor will come

to an end on the expiry of five years from the date on which he enters office.

Clause (3) is not intended to be a restriction or limitation upon the power to

remove the Governor at any time, under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_81">Article 156.</a> Clause (3)

of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_82">Article 156</a> only indicates the tenure which is subjected to the President's

pleasure. In contrast, we can refer to Articles 310 and 311 where the doctrine

of pleasure is clearly and indisputably subjected to restriction. Clause (1) of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                       33</span>


<a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_83">Article 310</a> provides that a person serving the Union Government holds office

during the pleasure of the President and a person serving a state government

holds office during the pleasure of the Governor. The `doctrine of pleasure' is

subjected to a restriction in <a href="/doc/1582763/" id="a_84">Article 310(2)</a> and the restrictions in <a href="/doc/1140464/" id="a_85">Article

311(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_86">(2).</a> The most significant restriction is contained in clause (2) of

<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_87">Article 311</a> which provides that no such employee shall be dismissed or

removed from service except after an inquiry in which he has been informed

of the charges levelled against him and given a reasonable opportunity of

being heard in respect of those charges. Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_88">Article 310</a> begins with

the words "Except as expressly provided by the Constitution". Therefore,

<a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_89">Article 310</a> itself makes it clear that though a person serves the Union or a

State during the pleasure of the President/Governor, the power of removal at

pleasure is subject to the other express provisions of the Constitution; and

<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_90">Article 311</a> contains such express provision which places limitations upon the

power of removal at pleasure. By contrast, clause (1) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_91">Article 156</a> is not

made subject to any other provision of the Constitution nor subjected to any

exception. Clause (3) prescribing a tenure of five years for the office of a

Governor, is made subject to clause (1) which provides that the Governor shall

hold office during the pleasure of the President. Therefore, it is not possible to

accept the contention that clause (1) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_92">Article 156</a> is subjected to an express
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                          34</span>


restriction or limitation under Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_93">Article 156.</a>



Reports of Commissions



</p><p id="p_66">31.   The petitioner relied upon the Report of the Sarkaria Commission on

Centre-State Relations and the Report of the National Commission to Review

the working of the Constitution in support of his contention that removal of a

Governor should be by an order disclosing reasons, that the Governor should

be given an opportunity to explain his position and that the removal should be

only for compelling reasons, thereby stressing the need to provide security of

tenure for the Governors.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">32.   The Report of the Sarkaria Commission on Centre State Relations

(Vol.1 Chapter IV) dealt with the role of a Governor and made the following

recommendations with regard to his term of office:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      "4.7.08......... We recommend that the Governors tenure of office of five
      years in a State should not be disturbed except very rarely and that too for
      some extremely compelling reason. It is indeed very necessary to assure a
      measure of security of tenure to the Governor's office."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_69">The reason assigned by the Commission for the said recommendation was as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">      "Further, the ever-present possibility of the tenure being terminated before
      the full term of 5 years, can create considerable insecurity in the mind of
      the Governor and impair his capacity to withstand pressures, resist
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                              35</span>

       extraneous influences and act impartially in the discharge of his
       discretionary functions. Repeated shifting of Governors from one State to
       another can lower the prestige of this office to the detriment of both the
       Union and the State concerned. As a few State Governments have pointed
       out. Governors should not be shifted or transferred from one State to
       another by the Union as if they were civil servants. The five year term of
       Governor's office prescribed by the Constitution in that case loses much of
       its significance."

<p id="p_70">The Commission also noted the following suggestions received in favour of

and against the suggestion for providing security of tenure (para 4.8.01):

Council.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
The Commission after considering the matter in detail, made the following

recommendations regarding security of tenure:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                           36</span><p id="p_80">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">      "4.8.07. While it is not advisable to give the same security of tenure to a
      Governor as has been assured to a Judge of the Supreme Court, some
      safeguard has to be devised against arbitrary withdrawal of President's
      pleasure, putting a premature end to the Governor's tenure. The intention
      of the Constitution makers in prescribing a five-year term for this office
      appears to be that the President's pleasure on which the Governor's tenure
      is dependent, will not be withdrawn without cause shown. Any other
      inference would render clause (3) of <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_94">Article 156</a> largely otiose. It will be
      but fair that the Governor's removal is based on procedure which affords
      him an opportunity of explaining his conduct in question and ensures fair
      consideration of his explanation, if any.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      4.8.08. Save where the President is satisfied that, in the interest of the
      security of the State, is it not expedient to do so, as a matter of healthy
      practice, whenever it is proposed to terminate the tenure of a Governor
      before the expiry of the normal terms of five years, he should be
      informally apprised of the grounds of the proposed action and afforded a
      reasonable opportunity for showing cause against it. It is desirable that the
      President (which, in effect, means the Union Council of Ministers) should
      get the explanation, if any, submitted by the Governor against his
      proposed removal from office, examined by an Advisory Group consisting
      of the Vice-President of India and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or a
      retired Chief Justice of India. After receiving the recommendations of this
      Group, the President may pass such orders in the case as he may deem fit.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      4.8.09. We recommend that when a Governor, before the expiry of the
      normal term of five years, resigns or is appointed Governor in another
      State, or his tenure is terminated, the Union Government may lay a
      statement before both Houses of Parliament explaining the circumstances
      leading to the ending of his tenure. Where a Governor has been given an
      opportunity to show cause against the premature termination of his tenure,
      the statement may also include the explanation given by him in reply. This
      procedure would strengthen the control of Parliament and the Union
      Executive's accountability to it."

that the founding fathers proceeded on the assumption that the removal will

only be on the ground of bribery and corruption, violation of the

proposed an amendment that "the Governor shall hold office for a term of

five years from the date on which he enters upon his office, and shall during

that term be irremovable from his office." He moved another amendment for

addition of a clause that a Governor may be removed from office by reason

of physical or mental incapacity duly certified, or if found guilty of bribery

or corruption. He stated :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">      "This is, as I conceive it, different fundamentally from the appointment
      during the pleasure of the President. The House, I am aware, has just
      passed a proposition by which the Governor is to be appointed by the
      President and it would be now impossible for any one to question that
      proposition. I would like, however to point out, that having regard to the
      appointment as against the elective principle, we must not leave the
      Governor to be entirely at the mercy or the pleasure of the President. We
      should see to it, at any rate that if he is to be a constitutional head of the
      province, if he is to be acting in accordance with the advice of his
      ministers, if we desire to remove any objection that might possibly be

      there to the principle of nomination, we should see to it that at least while
      he is acting correctly, in accordance with the Constitution following the
      advice of his ministers, he should not be at the mercy of the President who
      is away from the Province and who is a national and not a local authority.
      This is all the more important pending the evolution of a convention, such
      as was suggested by one of the previous speakers, that the appointment,
      even if agreed to, should be on the advice of the local Ministry. I do not
      know if such a convention can grow up in India, but even if it grows up,
      and particularly if it grows up, it would be of the utmost importance that
      no non-provincial authority from the Centre should have the power to say
      that the Governor should be removable by that authority; So long as he
      acts in accordance with the advice of the constitutional advisers of the
      province, he should I think be irremovable during his term of office, that
      is, five years according to this article.

<blockquote id="blockquote_59">      There is of course a certain provision with regard to resignation

<p id="p_90">Prof. Shibban Lal Saksena also objected to the proposed <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_99">Article (in the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">      "Just now we have accepted a provision whereby the Governor shall be
      nominated by the President. Already we feel that there democracy has
      been abandoned. Now, Sir, comes this provision whereby the Governor
      shall hold office only at the pleasure of the President. Even in the case of
      the Supreme Court, we have provided that once the Judges of the Supreme
      Court has been appointed, they will be removable only after an address
      presented by both the Houses of Parliament, and by two-thirds majority of
      the members present and voting. In the case of the Governor, you want to
      make a different provision. It seems to me, Sir, to be an extraordinary
      procedure and it completely takes away the independence of the Governor.
      He will be purely a creature of the President, that is to say, the Prime
      Minister and the party in power at the Centre. When once a Governor has
      been appointed, I do not see why he should not continue in office for his
      full term of five years and why you should make him removable by the
      President at his whim. It only means that he must look to the President for
      continuing in office and so continue to be subservient to him. He cannot
      be independent. He will then have no respect. Sir, Dr. Ambedkar has not
      given any reasons why he has made this change. Of course, the election of
      the Governors has been done away with, but why makes him removable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                           41</span>

      by the President at his pleasure? The original article says: "A governor
      may, for violation of the Constitution, be removed from office by
      impeachment ........ It means that a Governor can only be removed by
      impeachment by both the Houses. Now, he will be there only at the
      pleasure of the President. Such a Governor will have no independence and
      my point is that the Centre might try to do some mischief through that
      man. Even if he is nominated, he can at least be independent if after he is
      appointed he is irremovable. Now, by making him continue in office at the
      pleasure of the President, you are taking away his independence
      altogether. This is a serious deviation and I hope the House will consider it
      very carefully. Unless he is able to give strong reasons for making this
      change, I hope Dr. Ambedkar will withdraw his amendment."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">Sri Lokanath Misra expressed a slightly different point of view:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">      "Mr. President, Sir, after having made the decision that Governors shall be
      appointed by the President, it naturally follows that the connected
      provisions in the Draft Constitution should accordingly be amended, and
      in that view, I accept the amendment that has now been moved by Dr.
      Ambedkar. That amendment suggests that the Governor shall be
      removable as the President pleases, that is, a Governor shall hold office
      during the pleasure of the President and that whenever he incurs the
      displeasure of the President, he will be out. When the President has
      appointed a man, in the fitness of things the President must have the right
      to remove him when he is displeased, but to remove the evil that has now
      crept in by doing away with election for the office of the Governor, it
      would have been much better if the State legislature too had been given
      the power to impeach him not only for violation of the Constitution but
      also for misbehaviour. I use the word `misbehaviour' deliberately because,
      when a Governor who is not necessarily a man of that province is
      appointed to his office, it is but natural that the people of the province
      should have at least the power to watch him, to criticize him, through their
      chosen representatives. If that right had been given, in other words, if the
      provision for the impeachment of the Governors by the State legislatures
      had been there, it would have been a safeguard against improper
      appointment of Governor by the President. One of the main objections to
      the appointment of the Governor by the President has been that he will be
      a man who has no roots in the province and no stake, that he will be a man
      who will have no connection with the people, that he will be a man
      beyond their reach and therefore can go on merrily so long as he pleases
      the President, the Prime Minister of the Union and the Premier of the
      Province. But they are not all. It would have been much better if the
      Governor's removal had been made dependent not only on the displeasure
      of the President but on the displeasure of the State legislature also which
      represents the people and that would have been a safeguard against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                           42</span>

      evil that has been caused by the provision for the appointment of Governor
      by the President."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_92">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar replied thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">      "Sir, the position is this: this power of removal is given to the President in
      general terms. What Professor Shah wants is that certain grounds should
      be stated in the Constitution itself for the removal of the Governor. It
      seems to me that when you have given the general power, you also give
      the power to the President to remove a Governor for corruption, for
      bribery, for violation of the Constitution or for any other reason which the
      President no doubt feels is legitimate ground for the removal of the
      Governor. It seems, therefore, quite unnecessary to burden the
      Constitution with all these limitations stated in express terms when it is
      perfectly possible for the President to act upon the very same ground
      under the formula that the Governor shall hold office during his pleasure.
      I, therefore, think that it is unnecessary to categorize the conditions under
      which the President may undertake the removal of the Governor."

suggestions/amendments proposed by Mr. K.T. Shah, Prof. Shibban Lal

The debates however disclose the following:
</p>
<p id="p_94">

Seervai refers to the scope of <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_100">Article 156(1)</a> thus:
</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">        "A difficulty, however, arises from the fact that the Governor holds
        office during the pleasure of the President and can be removed by him.
        As the President acts on the advice of his ministry, it may be contended
        that if the Governor takes action contrary to the policy of the Union
        Ministry he would risk being removed from his post as Governor, and,
        therefore, he is likely to follow the advice of the Union Govt. Whilst not
        denying the force of this contention, it is submitted that <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_101">Article 156(1)</a>
        has a very different purpose. It is submitted that a responsible Union
        Ministry would not advise, and would not be justified in advising the
        removal of a Governor because in the honest discharge of his duty, the
        Governor takes action which does not fall in line with the policy of the
        Union Ministry. To hold otherwise would mean that the Union executive
        would effectively control the State executive which is opposed to the
        basic scheme of our federal Constitution. <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_102">Article 156(1)</a> is designed to
        secure that if the Governor is pursuing courses which are detrimental to
        the State or to India, the President can remove the Governor from his
        office and appoint another Governor. This power takes the place of an
        impeachment which clearly is a power to be exercised in rare and
        exceptional circumstances."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_101">39.    The provision for removal at the pleasure of an authority without any

restriction, as noticed above, applies to Ministers as also the Attorney

General apart from Governors. Persons of calibre, experience, and

distinction are chosen to fill these posts. Such persons are chosen not to

enable them to earn their livelihood but to serve the society. It is wrong to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                      44</span>


assume that such persons having been chosen on account of their stature,

maturity and experience will be demoralized or be in constant fear of

removal, unless there is security of tenure. They know when they accept

these offices that they will be holding the office during the pleasure of the

President.
</p>
<p id="p_102">
Need for reasons


</p><p id="p_103">40. The petitioner contends that the removal of a Governor can only be for

compelling reasons which is something to do with his capacity to function as

a Governor. According to the petitioner, physical or mental disability, acts of

corruption or moral turpitude or behaviour unbecoming of a Governor like

being involved in active politics, or indulging in subversive activities are

valid reasons for removal. In other words, it is contended that there should

be some fault or draw back in the Governor or in his actions before he could

be removed from office. On the other hand, it is contended by the

respondents that removal need not only be for the reasons mentioned by the

petitioner but can also be on two other grounds, namely, loss of confidence

in the Governor or the Governor being out of sync with the policies and

ideologies of the Union Government. There is thus a consensus to the extent

that a Governor can be removed only for a valid reason, and that physical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                      45</span>


and mental incapacity, corruption and behaviour unbecoming of a Governor

are valid grounds for removal. There is however disagreement as to what

else can be grounds for removal. We are of the view that there can be other

grounds also. It is not possible to put the reasons under any specific heads.

The only limitation on the exercise of the power is that it should be for valid

reasons. What constitute valid reasons would depend upon the facts and

circumstances of each case.
</p>
<p id="p_104">

</p><p id="p_105">41.   We have however already rejected the contention that the Governor

should be in sync with the ideologies of the Union Government. Therefore, a

Governor cannot be removed on the ground that he is not sync or refuses to

act as an agent of the party in power at the Centre. Though the Governors,

Ministers and Attorney General, all hold office during the pleasure of the

President, there is an intrinsic difference between the office of a Governor

and the offices of Ministers and Attorney General.           Governor is the

Constitutional Head of the State. He is not an employee or an agent of the

Union Government nor a part of any political team. On the other hand, a

Minister is hand-picked member of the Prime Minister's team. The

relationship between the Prime Minister and a Minister is purely political.

Though the Attorney General holds a public office, there is an element of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                     46</span>


lawyer-client relationship between the Union Government and the Attorney

General. Loss of confidence will therefore be very relevant criterion for

withdrawal of pleasure, in the case of a Minister or the Attorney General, but

not a relevant ground in the case of a Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_106">

</p><p id="p_107">(v)   Judicial review of withdrawal of President's pleasure


</p><p id="p_108">42.   When a Governor holds office during the pleasure of the Government

and the power to remove at the pleasure of the President is not circumscribed

by any conditions or restrictions, it follows that the power is exercisable at

any time, without assigning any cause. However, there is a distinction

between the need for a cause for the removal, and the need to disclose the

cause for removal. While the President need not disclose or inform the cause

for his removal to the Governor, it is imperative that a cause must exist. If

we do not proceed on that premise, it would mean that the President on the

advice of the Council of Ministers, may make any order which may be

manifestly arbitrary or whimsical or mala fide. Therefore, while no cause or

reason be disclosed or assigned for removal by exercise of such prerogative

power, some valid cause should exist for the removal. Therefore, while we

do not accept the contention that an order under <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_103">Article 156</a> is not

justiciable, we accept the contention that no reason need be assigned and no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                            47</span>


cause need be shown and no notice need be issued to the Governor before

removing a Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_109">

</p><p id="p_110">43.     The traditional English view was that prerogative powers of the

Crown conferred unfettered discretion which could not be questioned in

courts. Lord Ruskill attempted to enumerate such prerogative powers in

Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service - 1985 AC

374 :
</p>
<p id="p_111">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">        "Prerogative powers such as those relating to the making of treaties, the
        defence of the realm, the prerogative of mercy, the grant of honours, the
        dissolution of Parliament and the appointment of ministers as well as
        others are not, I think susceptible to judicial review because their nature
        and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to the judicial process.
        The courts are not the place wherein to determine whether a treaty should
        be concluded or the armed forces disposed in a particular manner or
        Parliament dissolved on one date rather than another."

<p id="p_112">However, the contemporary English view is that in principle even such

`political questions' and exercise of prerogative power will be subject to

judicial review on principles of legality, rationality or procedural

impropriety. (See decision of House of Lords in : <a href="/doc/123554449/" id="a_104">R (Bancoult) vs. Foreign

Secretary</a> - 2009 (1) AC 453). In fact, De Smith's Judicial Review (6th Ed.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">      "Judicial review has developed to the point where it is possible to say that
      no power -- whether statutory or under the prerogative -- is any longer
      inherently unreviewable. Courts are charged with the responsibility of
      adjudicating upon the manner of the exercise of public power, its scope
      and its substance. As we shall see, even when discretionary powers are
      engaged, they are not immune from judicial review."

        Indeed it would be its constitutional obligation to do so. ...This Court is the
        ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate

        the constitutional values and to enforce the constitutional limitations. That is
        the essence of the rule of law. ... Where there is manifestly unauthorized
        exercise of power under the Constitution, it is the duty of the Court to
        intervene. Let it not be forgotten, that to this Court as much as to other

      power of finding whether the reasons bear the necessary nexus or are

the terms and conditions of the admission of a new territory into the Union

<p id="p_118">While the President or the Governor may be the sole Judge of the sufficiency

an enumerated power in the Constitution, its limitations must be found in the

204] etc.]. <a href="/doc/758562/" id="a_114">In Epuru Sudhakar v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> [2006 (8)

SCC 161], one of us (Kapadia J.) balanced the exercise of prerogative power

and judicial review of such exercise thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_72">      "The controlling factor in determining whether the exercise of prerogative
      power is subject to judicial review is not its source but its subject matter. It
      can no longer be said that prerogative power is ipso facto immune from
      judicial review. ......Rule of Law is the basis for evaluation of all
      decisions. The supreme quality of the Rule of Law is fairness and legal
      certainty. The principle of legality occupies a central plan in the Rule of
      Law. Every prerogative has to be the subject to the Rule of Law. That rule
      cannot be compromised on the grounds of political expediency. To go by
      such considerations would be subversive of the fundamental principles of
      the Rule of Law and it would amount to setting a dangerous precedent.
      The Rule of Law principle comprises a requirement of "Government
      according to law". The ethos of "Government according to law" requires
      the prerogative to be exercised in a manner which is consistent with the
      basic principle of fairness and certainty."

exercised on the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers, the question is

whether the bar contained in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_116">Article 74</a> will apply. The said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                     52</span>


clause provides that the question whether any, and if so what, advice was

tendered, shall not be enquired into by any court. This clause has been the

subject- matter of a nine-Judge Bench decision in <a href="/doc/60799/" id="a_117">S.R. Bommai v. Union of

India</a> [1994 (3) SCC 1]. This Court has held that <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_118">Article 74(2)</a> merely bars

an inquiry into the question whether any, and if so what, advice was

tendered by the Council of Ministers to the President but does not bar the

scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the President has made the

order. This Court also held that while an order issued in the name of the

President could not be challenged on the ground that it was contrary to the

advice tendered by the Council of Ministers or was issued without obtaining

the advice from the Ministers, it does not bar the court from calling upon the

Union of India to disclose to the court the material on which the President

has formed the requisite satisfaction. The bar contained in <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_119">Article 74(2)</a> will

not come in the way of the court inquiring whether there was any material

on the basis of which such advice was given, whether such material was

relevant for such advice and whether the material was such that a reasonable

man could have come to the conclusion which was under challenge.

Therefore, though the sufficiency of the material could not be questioned,

legitimacy of the inference drawn from such material was open to judicial

review.

</p><p id="p_121">48.   The extent and depth of judicial review will depend upon and vary

with reference to the matter under review. As observed by Lord Steyn in Ex

parte Daly [2001 (3) All ER 433], in law, context is everything, and

intensity of review will depend on the subject-matter of review. For

example, judicial review is permissible in regard to administrative action,

legislations and constitutional amendments. But the extent or scope of

judicial review for one will be different from the scope of judicial review for

other. Mala fides may be a ground for judicial review of administrative

action but is not a ground for judicial review of legislations or constitutional

amendments. For withdrawal of pleasure in the case of a Minister or an

Attorney General, loss of confidence may be a relevant ground. The

ideology of the Minister or Attorney General being out of sync with the

policies or ideologies of the Government may also be a ground. On the other

hand, for withdrawal of pleasure in the case of a Governor, loss of

confidence or the Governor's views being out of sync with that the Union

Government will not be grounds for withdrawal of the pleasure. The reasons

for withdrawal are wider in the case of Ministers and Attorney-General,

when compared to Governors. As a result, the judicial review of withdrawal

of pleasure, is limited in the case of a Governor whereas virtually nil in the

case of a Minister or an Attorney General.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                      54</span><p id="p_122">



</p><p id="p_123">49.   <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_120">Article 156(1)</a> provides that a Governor shall hold office during the

pleasure of the President. Having regard to <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_121">Article 74</a>, the President is bound

to act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers. Therefore,

even though under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_122">Article 156(1)</a> the removal is at the pleasure of the

President, the exercise of such pleasure is restricted by the requirement that

it should be on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Whether the removal

of Governor is open to judicial review? What <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_123">Article 156(1)</a> dispenses with

is the need to assign reasons or the need to give notice but the need to act

fairly and reasonably cannot be dispensed with by <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_124">Article 156(1).</a> The

President in exercising power under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_125">Article 156(1)</a> should act in a manner

which is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. In the event of challenge

of withdrawal of the pleasure, the court will necessarily assume that it is for

compelling reasons. Consequently, where the aggrieved person is not able to

establish a prima facie instance of arbitrariness or malafides, in his removal,

the court will refuse to interfere. However, where a prima facie case of

arbitrariness or malafides is made out, the Court can require the Union

Government to produce records/materials to satisfy itself that the withdrawal

of pleasure was for good and compelling reasons. What will constitute good

and compelling reasons would depend upon the facts of the case. Having

regard to the nature of functions of the Governor in maintaining centre-state
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                       55</span>


relations, and the flexibility available to the Government in such matters, it

is needless to say that there will be no interference unless a very strong case

is made out. The position, therefore, is that the decision is open to judicial

review but in a very limited extent.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">50.     We summarise our conclusions as under :
</p>
<p id="p_126">
</p><p id="p_127">(i)     Under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_126">Article 156(1</a>), the Governor holds office during the pleasure of

the President. Therefore, the President can remove the Governor from office

at any time without assigning any reason and without giving any opportunity

to show cause.
</p>
<p id="p_128">

</p><p id="p_129">(ii)    Though no reason need be assigned for discontinuance of the pleasure

resulting in removal, the power under <a href="/doc/1540188/" id="a_127">Article 156(1)</a> cannot be exercised in

an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable manner. The power will have to be

exercised in rare and exceptional circumstances for valid and compelling

reasons. The compelling reasons are not restricted to those enumerated by

the petitioner (that is physical/mental disability, corruption and behaviour

unbecoming of a Governor) but are of a wider amplitude. What would be

compelling reasons would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each

case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                        56</span><p id="p_130">



</p><p id="p_131">(iii)   A Governor cannot be removed on the ground that he is out of sync

with the policies and ideologies of the Union Government or the party in

power at the Centre. Nor can he be removed on the ground that the Union

Government has lost confidence in him. It follows therefore that change in

government at Centre is not a ground for removal of Governors holding

office to make way for others favoured by the new government.


</p><p id="p_132">(iv)    As there is no need to assign reasons, any removal as a consequence

of withdrawal of the pleasure will be assumed to be valid and will be open to

only a limited judicial review. If the aggrieved person is able to demonstrate

prima facie that his removal was either arbitrary, malafide, capricious or

whimsical, the court will call upon the Union Government to disclose to the

court, the material upon which the President had taken the decision to

withdraw the pleasure. If the Union Government does not disclose any

reason, or if the reasons disclosed are found to be irrelevant, arbitrary,

whimsical, or malafide, the court will interfere. However, the court will not

interfere merely on the ground that a different view is possible or that the

material or reasons are insufficient.
