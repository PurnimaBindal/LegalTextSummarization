<p id="p_1">                 3.       It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner&#x27;s predecessor-in-
                 title coined and adopted the trade marks &#x27;NIRMA&#x27; and &#x27;NIMA&#x27; in the
                 years 1969 and 1982, respectively. The trade mark &#x27;NIRMA&#x27; was coined
                 and adopted from the name of the petitioner-company&#x27;s founder-
                 promoter&#x27;s daughter &#x27;Nirupama‟ and the trade mark &#x27;NIMA&#x27; was coined
                 and adopted by dropping the letter &#x27;R&#x27; from the trade mark &#x27;NIRMA&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_2">                 4.       The petitioner-company has been using the trade marks &#x27;NIRMA&#x27;

                 liquid blue, scouring bar, shampoo, toothpaste and other chemicals, tea,
                 salt, spices and other food supplements. The business activities of the
                 petitioner also extend to cleaning preparations or chemicals, tea, salt,
                 spices and other food supplements. The petitioner is also involved in
                 business activities such as packing, marketing and distributing a variety

                 falling under Class 14, match boxes, garments like T-shirts, caps and
                 other products. The petitioner claims that it has also started the expansion
                 of its articles into various other industries such as buildings materials,
                 various chemicals et cetera.          The petitioner gives a list of group
                 companies registered and a Trust created with mark &#x27;NIRMA&#x27; and
                 &#x27;NIMA&#x27;, in paragraph 6 of the present rectification petition.

                 the present rectification petition in paragraph 9 of the petition. The
                 petitioner further provides details of year-wise sales and advertisement

                 19.04.2005 and onwards. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits
                 that on the respondent no.1&#x27;s own evidence, the respondent no.1
                 commenced the use of an identical trade mark in the year 2005, and its
                 user claim of the year 2000 in its trade mark application no. 934534 is

                 &#x27;NIMA&#x27; by at least twenty-two years. Under such circumstances, he
                 reiterates that it is only just and proper to expunge the respondent no.1&#x27;s

                 respondent no.1. Though registered as a device mark, the word &#x27;NIMA&#x27;
                 is the only and pre-dominant part of the mark of the respondent no. 1,
                 excepting that it is in a stylized version.

                 similar.

                  which is widely known to the relevant general public and enjoys a
                 comparatively high reputation amongst them. It further held that when a
                 person uses another person&#x27;s &#x27;well-known trade mark&#x27;, he tries to take
                 advantage of the goodwill that such a &#x27;well-known trade mark&#x27; enjoys.
                 Such an act constitutes as unfair competition. It also causes dilution of a
                 &#x27;well-known trade mark&#x27; as it loses its ability to be unique and
                 distinctively identified and distinguish as one source and consequent
                 change in perception which reduces the market value or selling power of
                 the product bearing the well-known mark.

                 registration holder of the marks &#x27;NIRMA&#x27; and &#x27;NIMA&#x27;. There is an
                 element of deceptive similarity that exists between the registered marks
                 of the petitioner and the respondent no.1. The petitioner has been able to
                 establish its goodwill and reputation in its marks.

                 no.1 is not only likely to cause deception in the mind of unwary
                 consumer of its association with the petitioner but would also hamper any
                 future plan of the petitioner to expand its business to other goods,
                 especially the goods being manufactured or marketed by the respondent
                 no.1. It will also lead to dilution of the mark of the petitioner. The same,
                 therefore, cannot be allowed to the registered and the registration is liable
