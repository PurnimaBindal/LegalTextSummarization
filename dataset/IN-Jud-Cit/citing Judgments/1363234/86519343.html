</p>
<p id="p_8">                          7.     The Appellant attempted to submit the renewed Certificate dated
                          07.12.2021 to the Recruitment Cell on 27.12.2021, however, the

                          rejected candidates. The reason assigned for rejection was that her OBC
                          (NCL) Certificates were dated 21.08.2020 and 29.12.2015, whereas, the

                          was between 01.04.2018 and 31.03.2020. The Appellant being aggrieved by

                          clarification to the Medical Superintendent of Respondent No. 4. The
                          Appellant once again submitted a representation on 17.01.2022 to the
                          Medical Superintendent of Respondent No. 4 praying for reconsideration of
                          her candidature. However, the Appellant was informed vide reply letter No.
                          5-80/ 2019-RMLH/ NS/ 1914 dated 13.04.2022, that her request cannot be
                          acceded to.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          10.    The Appellant&#x27;s contention is that the first caste certificate issued in
                          her favor was issued on 29.12.2015 and for the period thereafter, she again
                          submitted her caste certificate issued from time to time as desired by the
                          Respondents. Her father being a government servant, at no point of time has
                          the income of her father has exceeded INR 8 Lacs per annum and she
                          therefore she belongs to OBC (NCL) category. Hence, by no stretch of
                          imagination her candidature should have been rejected.

<p id="p_12">                          11.    The learned Single Judge has dismissed the Writ Petition and the
                          operative paragraphs of the order passed by the learned Single Judge reads
                          as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                 &quot;15. Admittedly, the first advertisement was issued on
                                 01.08.2021 and certificate was to be filed on or before
                                 31.08.2021, hence a clear period 21 days were given to the
                                 petitioner to file such certificate issued not earlier than one
                                 year from the last date of online registration. She again
                                 failed to submit certificate issued between 01.04.2018 to
                                 31.03.2020 (both dates inclusive) in the time given.</blockquote>

                                  cannot be ignored. The petitioner cannot claim the
                                 relaxation to her because of her lapse, per
                                 W.P.(C)1543/2015 (supra) and LPA No. 488/2019 (supra).
                                 Thus, I find no ground for interference. The petition is
                                 hereby dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, also stands
                                 disposed of.&quot;
</p><p id="p_14">                          12.    Learned counsel appearing for the Appellant has vehemently argued
                          before this Court that the learned Single Judge has committed an error in law
                          and fact in wrongly dismissing the Writ Petition preferred by the Appellant,
                          without even seeking a reply from the Respondents on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                          13.    The learned counsel for the Appellant has argued that the action of the
                          Respondents has violated the principle mandate and duties enshrined in the
                          Constitution and has denied the Appellant equity and justice. It has been
                          further argued that the Respondents have violated the concept of equality of
                          opportunity in public employment and grave miscarriage of justice would be
                          meted out to the Appellant in case she is not appointed. It has been further

                          category, specifically for the Financial Year 01.04.2018 to 31.03.2020 and
                          on this ground, the Impugned Order deserves to be set aside.

                          proceedings i.e., the action of the Respondents arbitrarily and unjustifiably
                          calling for OBC (NCL) certificates pertaining only to Financial Years
                          starting from 01.04.2018 to 31.03.2020 and not through Financial Years

                          certificates dated 17.12.2021 and 21.08.2020 were issued on the basis of
                          Income Tax Return of the year 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021 of her
                          father, substantiating that she does not belong to creamy layer of OBCs well
                          before the cut-off date, keeping in view the Office Memorandum of DOP&amp;T
                          dated 31.03.2016. It was submitted that Paragraph 1(b) of the Office
                          Memorandum of DOP&amp;T dated 31.03.2016 relied upon by the government
                          for validating OBC (NCL) Certificates, states that the same can be issued

<p id="p_19">                          16.    The learned counsel for the Appellant has further submitted that the
                          OBC (NCL) Certificate of the Appellant submitted pursuant to Recruitment
                          Notification No. 1/2019, was issued in the same year as the Recruitment
                          Notification.   Thus, it was an unjust practice and action taken without
                          application of mind by the Respondents, to reject the Appellant&#x27;s OBC
                          (NCL) Certificate. It has been further argued that the recruiting
                          governmental authority did not apply its mind while issuing &#x27;Important
                          Notice&#x27; dated 24.12.2021 and just 6 days before the cut-off date of

<p id="p_21">                          18.    Lastly, it has been argued that the Appellant belongs to OBC category
                          since birth. Her father is a government servant and falls within the Non-
                          Creamy layer. The OBC (NCL) Certificates were on record right from 2015
                          till date and therefore, by no stretch of imagination the Appellant could have
                          been denied her legitimate right of appointment by not treating her as an
                          OBC belonging to the Non-Creamy Layer. Hence, the action of Respondents
                          is against the settled principle of law that if a person is an OBC, they are so
                          by birth and not by acquisition of this category due to any other events
                          happening at a later stage.

<p id="p_22">                          19.    The learned counsel for the Appellant has prayed for quashing of the
                          Order dated 11.01.2022 passed by the Respondents by which the Appellant
                          has been placed in the list of selected candidates and a prayer has been made
                          for issuance of a direction to the Respondents to grant an appointment
                          keeping in view the merit/ position of the Appellant in the examination
                          which has taken place.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                          20.    The Respondents on the other hand, have prayed for dismissal of the
                          Writ Petition as being devoid of merits and substance. It was submitted
                          before this Court that the order passed by the learned Single Judge does not
                          warrant any interference and the Office Memorandum of the DOP&amp;T dated
                          31.03.2016 is of no help to the Appellant. The Respondents have placed
                          heavy reliance upon &#x27;Important Notice&#x27; dated 24.12.2021 and Office
                          Memorandum of DOP&amp;T dated 31.03.2016 to contend that the Appellant

                           have stated that the Appellant was given clear period of 21 days to get her
                          OBC (NCL) certificate to comply with the conditions of the &#x27;Important
                          Notice&#x27; dated 24.12.2021 and the Appellant failed to bring her OBC (NCL)
                          certificate within the stipulated timeline i.e. between 01.04.2018 to
                          31.03.2020 as required under &#x27;Important Notice&#x27; dated 24.12.2021.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                          21.    The Respondents&#x27; contention is that the OBC (NCL) Certificates are
                          issued every financial year and a person applying for a government job
                          ought to be vigilant enough to get such certificates issued every financial
                          year. The Respondents have contended that the Appellant cannot claim
                          relaxation because of her own lapse and relaxation to any candidate at this
                          stage would be contrary to the mandate of equality as envisaged under
                          Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                          22.    The Respondents have further contended that the last candidate
                          selected under unreserved category for recruitment to the post of &#x27;Nursing
                          Officer&#x27; had secured an All-India Rank of 1103 whereas the Appellant had
                          secured 1138.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                          23.    The Respondents further contend that the representation of the
                          Appellant dated 17.01.2022 against her rejection was considered by a
                          committee of 4 CGHS Hospitals and cogent reasons have been assigned as
                          to why she cannot be appointed on the post of Nursing Officer.            The
                          Respondents have submitted that the process of recruitment has already been
                          concluded and 15 Nursing Officers have already joined and, therefore, the
                          question of allowing the present LPA does not arise.

                          mandatory that the OBC candidates should not belong to the creamy layer.

                          format, on 12.01.2022 when the Appellant noticed that her name was
                          included in the list of rejected candidates, she approached the authorities and
                          submitted representations. However, the same was rejected and she was
                          forced to file a Writ Petition before this Court.

                          fact remains that the Appellant did submit an OBC (NCL) certificate while
                          applying for the post in question, in the prescribed format as provided vide
                          O.M. of DOP&amp;T dated 30.05.2014 and the Respondents, as the wisdom
                          prevailed upon them, issued &#x27;Important Notice&#x27; dated 24.12.2021 directing
                          all the candidates to furnish OBC (NCL) Certificate in the prescribed
                          format. The Important Notice further stated that the OBC (NCL) Certificate
                          should have been issued between 01.04.2018 and 31.03.2020.
</p>
<p id="p_48">                          39.    The certificate issued in favour of the Appellant dated 21.08.2020 was
                          a certificate issued on the basis of the annual income of 3 years of her father
                          and the fact is that the father of the Appellant is a government servant and
                          right from 2015 till date, there is no increase in his income. His income is
                          still less than Rs.8 Lacs per annum. Thus, the same entitles the Appellant to

                          also she belongs to the OBC (NCL) category.

<p id="p_50">                          41.    This Court, keeping in view the totality of the circumstances of the
                          case, is of the opinion that the respondents have taken a hyper-technical
                          approach by denying the right of appointment to the petitioner especially
                          when undisputedly, right from 2015 till date she is a member of OBC (NCL)
                          category.
</p>
<p id="p_51">                          42.    The Appellant has placed reliance upon the case of <a href="/doc/111652019/" id="a_1">Ms. Pushpa v.
                          Govt. of NCT of Delhi &amp; Ors</a>., 2009 SCC OnLine Del 281. The case of
                          Pushpa (supra) is one which has a factually similar matrix to the instant
                          case. In the case of Pushpa (supra) the Petitioner had approached this
                          Hon&#x27;ble Court in Writ Jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution,
                          seeking directions against the Respondents to consider her appointment as a
                          staff nurse under the category of OBC. She was unable to submit her caste
                          certificate before the cut-off date as the same took time to be obtained from
                          the office of the concerned SDM. This Hon&#x27;ble Court in the case of Pushpa
                          (supra) rightly held that if a person is an OBC, she is so by birth and not by
                          acquisition of this category at a later stage. A certificate issued by competent
                          authority is only an affirmation of fact which is already in existence. This

                                 public employment, as embodied in <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_5">Article 10</a> of the draft
                                 Constitution, which finally emerged as <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_6">Article 16</a> of the
                                 Constitution, and the conflicting claims of various communities
                                 for representation in public administration, Dr Ambedkar
                                 emphatically declared that reservation should be confined to „a
                                 minority of seats‟, lest the very concept of equality should be
                                 destroyed. In view of its great importance, the full text of his
                                 speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly on the point is
                                 appended to this judgment. But I shall now read a few passages
                                 from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
</p><p id="p_53">                                 &quot;... firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly,
                                 that there shall be reservations in favour of certain
                                 communities which have not so far had a „proper look-in‟ so to
                                 say into the administration... Supposing, for instance, we were
                                 to concede in full the demand of those communities who have
                                 not been so far employed in the public services to the fullest
                                 extent, what would really happen is, we shall be completely
                                 destroying the first proposition upon which we are all agreed,
                                 namely,     that     there    shall    be     an   equality     of
                                 opportunity...Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the
                                 reservation is to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_7">Article 10</a>,
                                 must be confined to a minority of seats. It is then only that the
                                 first principle could find its place in the Constitution and
                                 effective in operation ... we have to safeguard two things,
                                 namely, the principle of equality of opportunity and at the same
                                 time satisfy the demand of communities which have not had so

                                 limitations. Reservation is one of the measures adopted by the
                                 Constitution to remedy the continuing evil effects of prior
                                 inequities stemming from discriminatory practices against
                                 various classes of people which have resulted in their social,
                                 educational and economic backwardness. Reservation is meant
                                 to be addressed to the present social, educational and economic
                                 backwardness caused by purposeful societal discrimination. To

                                 injustice, the Constitution permits and empowers the State to

                                 and exclusionary effects. Any such measure, in so far as one
                                 group is preferred to the exclusion of another, must necessarily
                                 be narrowly tailored to the achievement of the fundamental
                                 constitutional goal.&quot;
</p><p id="p_55">                                 10. Keeping this in mind and considering that the petitioner
                                 applied for the OBC certificate to the concerned office of SDM
                                 much before January 2008, when the advertisement was made
                                 by DSSSB and since the certificate was made available to the
                                 petitioner on 13/5/2008, the petitioner cannot be made to suffer
                                 for the lapse on the part of the SDM office. But at the same time
                                 it is made clear that in all such cases caste certificate should
                                 reach the Board prior to their making provisional selection as
                                 while making provisional selection, the Board verifies &amp;

                                 per the recruitment rules. Herein, the petitioner had sent the

                                  other event happening at a later stage. A certificate issued by
                                 competent authority to this effect is only an affirmation of fact
                                 which is already in existence. The purpose of such certificate is
                                 to enable the authorities to believe in the assertion of the
                                 candidate that he belongs to „SC‟ category and act thereon by
                                 giving the benefit to such candidate for his belonging to „SC‟
                                 category. It is not that petitioners did not belong to „SC‟
                                 category prior to 30th June, 1998 or that acquired the status of
                                 being „SC‟ only on the date of issuance of the certificate. In
                                 view of this position, necessitating upon a certificate dated
                                 prior to 30th June, 1998 would be clearly arbitrary and it has
                                 no rationale objective sought to be achieved.

                                 and ST categories. Articles 14(4) and 16(4), therefore, intend to

                                 petitioner against the „OBC‟ category. I do not find any merit
                                 in the submission of the counsel for the respondent. The
                                 petitioner cannot be denied the right to be considered for

                                 there is no dispute that she belongs to OBC Category.
                                 Admittedly, there was no lapse on the part of the petitioner who
                                 had applied to obtain the said certificate in the OBC Category
                                 much prior to the date of the advertisement and she cannot be
                                 made to suffer simply on account of the fact that the authorities
                                 have taken considerable time in making available the OBC

                                 from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
</p><p id="p_66">                                 &quot;... firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly,
                                 that there shall be reservations in favour of certain
                                 communities which have not so far had a „proper look-in‟ so to
                                 say into the administration. ... Supposing, for instance, we were
                                 to concede in full the demand of those communities who have
                                 not been so far employed in the public services to the fullest
                                 extent, what would really happen is, we shall be completely
                                 destroying the first proposition upon which we are all agreed,
                                 namely, that there shall be an equality of opportunity. ...
                                 Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the reservation is to be
                                 consistent with sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_16">Article 10</a>, [Ed.: The matter

                                 It is then only that the first principle could find its place in the

                                 limitations. Reservation is one of the measures adopted by the

                                 &quot;11. ... „15. The matter can be looked into from another angle
                                 also. As per the advertisement dated 11-6-1999 issued by the
                                 Board, vacancies are reserved for various categories including
                                 SC category. Thus in order to be considered for the post
                                 reserved for SC category, the requirement is that a person
                                 should belong to SC category. If a person is SC he is so by birth
                                 and not by acquisition of this category because of any other
                                 event happening at a later stage. A certificate issued by
                                 competent authority to this effect is only an affirmation of fact
                                 which is already in existence. The purpose of such certificate is
                                 to enable the authorities to believe in the assertion of the
                                 candidate that he belongs to SC category and act thereon by
                                 giving the benefit to such candidate for his belonging to SC
                                 category. It is not that petitioners did not belong to SC category
                                 prior to 30-6-1998 or that acquired the status of being SC only
                                 on the date of issuance of the certificate. In view of this
                                 position, necessitating upon a certificate dated prior to 30-6-
                                 1998 would be clearly arbitrary and it has no rationale
                                 objective sought to be achieved.

                                 categories as per constitutional mandate prescribed in Articles
                                 15(4) and 16(4) which are enabling provisions authorising the

                                 and ST categories. Articles 14(4) and 16(4), therefore, intend to

                                 socially backward classes of the society is to remove inequality

                                 oppression and deprivation of opportunity. The constitutional
                                 concept of reservation envisaged in the Preamble of the
                                 Constitution as well as Articles 14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the
