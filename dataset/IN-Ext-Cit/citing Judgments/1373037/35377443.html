 Petition No.26/B/88/L, confirming the order of Deputy Collector,

 Land Reforms, Latur, dated 8.3.1988 in File No.87/TNC/A/ 45

 and the order dated 31.7.1987, passed by the Additional

 Tahsildar, Latur in File No.1985/TLC-WS-8-6 CR under Section 8

 (hereinafter referred as the Hyderabad Tenancy Act for short).


</p><p id="p_2"> 2.               The learned counsel for respondent No. 1 submitted

 that the appeal itself is not maintainable in view of clause 15 of

 Letters Patent and in view of the fact that the writ petition was

 filed by the present appellants against the decision of M.R.T.,

 Tribunal, over which this Court has power of superintendence.

 The learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the

 observations made by this Court (Division Bench) in the case

 reported as Jagannath Vs. Gulabrao [1965 Mh.L.J. 426] and

 also subsequent orders made by this Court in various matters.

 The learned counsel for respondent submitted that right from the

 year 1965, this Court has consistently held that writ petition filed

 against the order of M.R.T. needs to be treated as petition under

 <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of Constitution of India and when learned Single

 Judge decides such petition, it needs to be presumed that the

 order was made by the learned Single Judge in exercise of power

 of superintendence and so, letters patent appeal does not lie. The

 learned        counsel         for   appellants    placed     reliance        on     the

 observations made by full bench of this Court in two cases

 reported as Jagdish Balwantrao Abhyankar and Ors. Vs.

 State of Maharashtra and Ors. [AIR 1994 Bombay 141]

 and Advani Oerlikon Ltd. Vs. Machindra Govind Makasare

 supra) has laid down that when a proceeding is filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article

 226</a> of the Constitution of India against the order of Court or

 Tribunal, this Court cannot treat it as one under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a>,

 merely because                Court or Tribunal, whose order is assailed, is

 subject to the power of superintendence of this Court. It is laid

 down that in some cases same subject can be considered under

 Articles 226 and 227 of Constitution of India. In second case, of

 Adwani (cited supra), the Full Bench of this Court has made

<p id="p_6"> 4.               In view of the answers given by the Full Bench of this

 Court quoted above and also law laid down by Apex Court which

 is referred by the Full Bench, this Court is expected to ascertain

 the nature of controversy, the averments in petition which was

 pending before the learned Single Judge of this Court. The

 proceeding         before      M.R.T.   was       filed     under       section      91     of

 Hyderabad Tendency Act. The provision of section 91 which is

 about the availability of revision runs as under :-

               jurisdiction under this Act shall pass such order

               just."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_9"> 5.               The provisions of Hyderabad Tenancy Act show that

 the revisional jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 91 is

 limited by the section itself. The finding of the fact of the

 authorities like Tahsildar and Collector is not expected to be

 interfered with. It can be said that if some material was not

 considered, error is committed in law, if there was error on the

 face of the record, then the M.R.T. could have interfered in the

 decision of the Collector given in the appeal.

 execute Batai Patra dated 13.4.1970 on behalf of all co-sharers.

 He placed reliance on Dwarkanath and another Vs. Narayan

 Dhond [1989 Mh.L.J. 689], wherein it is held that, "Wife

 having undivided two third share in the suit land could not create

 lease in respect of entire suit land unless she had authority from

 her step sons to create lease."

<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12"> 7.               At the outset, we must observe that, the above

 authority is distinguishable on facts for the simple reason that in

 the case hand, Vishwanath being Karta of the joint family, had

 every legal right to create lease of the entire land as a Manager

 of the joint family.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14"> 8.               Next objection raised by learned counsel for the

 appellant is that, the document of lease dated 13.4.1970 styled

 as "Batai Patra" is not lease deed but it is unregistered mortgage

 deed. He placed reliance on Santa Kumari Vs. Laxmi reported

 in    [AIR 2000 SC 3009].              However,     this    case      is   also

 distinguishable for the reason that in the case before Apex Court,

 on the date of execution of sale deed of the disputed land,

 separate agreement for reconveyance was executed.                      In the

 circumstances, the document was stated as 'mortgage' by

 conditional sale.

 "Batai Patra", Vishwanath Bandu Gurav received amount of

 Rs.1000/- and for that consideration, he delivered the possession

 of disputed land to respondent No.1 and respondent No.1 was

 allowed to cultivate that land for the period of next five years and

 the expenditure for cultivation were to be equally shared by

 Vishwanath and respondent No.1. The note below this document

 indicates that, if this amount of Rs.1000/- is not refunded by

 Vishwanath within five years, then the respondent No.1 would be

 allowed to continue with cultivating possession for the next five

 years.        Thus, it can be said that, there are two probable

 interpretations of this document, first indicating that it is lease

 deed and second, it is unregistered mortgage deed.                       While

 deciding Writ Petition, this Court is not expected to disturb the

 concurrent findings of three authorities i.e. Additional Tahsildar,

 Deputy Collector, Land Reforms and Member, MRT that this

 document is deed of tenancy. Therefore, in view of law settled

 by Full Bench of this Court and Apex Court, Batai Patra cannot be

 interpreted as document of mortgage deed.

 only on the basis of pencil entry in record of rights, tenancy

 rights cannot be created.            He placed reliance on Vaijnath &amp;

 others Vs. ahadeo Mote reported in [2010(5) Bom.C.R.

 860], wherein learned Single Judge of this Court held that,

 "Tenancy cannot be proved by mere entry in revenue record".


</p><p id="p_21"> 12.              However, this authority is distinguishable on facts for

 the simple reason that in the case at hand, the respondent No.1

 has filed original Batai Patra, entry in the revenue record since

 1970 till 1980 showing possession of respondent No.1 as tenant

 over the suit land before Tahsildar.                     In addition to this,

 respondent No.1 has led his oral evidence as well as examined

 attesting       witnesses     on   Batai   Patra.        Considering         this     all

 documentary as well as oral evidence on record, learned

 Additional Tahsildar recorded finding of fact that, respondent

 No.1 is in possession of the suit land as tenant.                      Accordingly,

 the Member, MRT did not consider the documents placed on

 record, the order of Member, MRT indicates that the Batai Patra

 was seen by learned Member of the MRT at page No.189 in the

 file of Tahsil Office. The learned Single Judge also considered the

 Batai Patra, the entries in revenue record in cultivation column of

 7/12 extract covering for the year 1970-71, which continued till

 the year 1980. In the year 1980-81, the concerned Talathi has

 entered name of legal representatives of Vishwanath Gurav in

 the column of cultivation without any order from competent

 authority, which made the respondent No.1 to file an appeal

 before the Deputy Collector for correction of entry made in the

 column of cultivation and he got stay to the entry in the name of

 land owner. Thereafter there is no entry recorded to as to who is

 in possession of the said property.

 learned Single Judge of this Court, the decision of MRT was

 challenged and the decision was given within scope of provisions

 of Section 91 of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act.                       There was no

 jurisdictional error and there is nothing on record to show that

 some material was not considered either by Tahsildar or by first

 appellate authority. The facts do not justify invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article

 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In view of these circumstances,

 in the present matter, it needs to be presumed that, the learned

 Single Judge has considered the matter under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_31">Article 227</a> of the

 Constitution of India though in the petition appellants have

 mentioned Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.

 Patent Appeal itself is not tenable.             In the result, the appeal

 stands dismissed.             In view of dismissal of the Letters Patent

 Appeal, pending Civil Applications are disposed of.

 continued for a period of six weeks from the date of this order.
