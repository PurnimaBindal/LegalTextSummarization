</pre><p id="p_1">                                      DATE :- 26th October, 2018
       Per Court:
</p>
<p id="p_2">       1                 The learned AGP points out that the impugned order can be

       assailed by a second revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land

       Revenue   Code,   1966   before   the   State,   in   view   of   the   judgment   of   the

       Honourable   Supreme   Court   in   the   matter   of  <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing   Nawoosing

       Panjwani vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a>, 2016 (2) SCC 213.

       2                 In view of the above, this Writ Petition is disposed of.

       3                 If   the   Petitioners   prefer   their   second   revision   within   four

       weeks from today, the time spent by them in this Court from 30.10.2017

       till the filing of the revision, would be a good ground for condonation of

       delay.
