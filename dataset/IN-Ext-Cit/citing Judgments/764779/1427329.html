<p id="p_1">1.           The appellant is aggrieved by order of the learned Single Judge

dismissing the writ petition against the order of detention dated 5.3.2004

under Section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_1">Prevention

of Smuggling Activities Act</a>, 1974 ( for short, "the Act").

</p><p id="p_2">2.           Writ petition challenging the said order was filed on 13.8.2007

at pre-detention stage. It was mentioned that investigation was conducted by

the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Ahmedabad (DRI)            as to   the

allegation of duty evasion by various 100% Export Oriented Units (EOU)

by indulging in clandestine removal of duty free imported and indigenous

raw materials without payment of duty. Statement was made by one

Roopchand Jain on 4.12.2000 indicating involvement of the petitioner in

illegal activities in        supplying forged Advance Licences/AROs         on

commission basis. Statement was also made by one Hastimal Jeevraj Jain
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> L.P.A.No. 117 of 2008                                                    -2-</span>



on 4.1.2001 that he was introduced to the petitioner by Roopchand Jain for

doing this illegal business. Statement of the petitioner was recorded by

DRI on 11.5.2001, wherein he was said to have admitted his role in the

racket. Notice was issued to the petitioner proposing           to arrest him.

Thereafter, the matter of preventive detention of the petitioner was taken up

on a proposal from the DRI. The petitioner was arrested by the custom

officials on 30.9.2003 and was produced before the Court of Additional

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad.          Thereafter, the impugned

order of detention was passed, which was never executed.

</p><p id="p_3">3.           The petition was contested, inter alia, on the ground that the

detention order was passed at Gandhinagar, Gujarat. As the petitioner has

failed to surrender, there was no delay in executing the detention order.

The order of detention was justified to prevent the petitioner from indulging

in illegal activities of evasion of customs and central excise duties.

</p><p id="p_4">4.           Contention raised on behalf of the petitioner was that since he

apprehended execution order of detention at Ludhiana, the petition was

maintainable in this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           Learned Single Judge held that this Court had the territorial

jurisdiction to entertain the petition as violation of right to life and liberty

was alleged in the jurisdiction of this Court, as held in <a href="/doc/738867/" id="a_2">Mrs.Arvind

Shergill v. Union of India</a> 1999(4) R.C.R. (Crl.) 781. It was further held

that in absence of order dated 5.3.2004 and any material to indicate as to

what happened after 4.6.2004, when the petitioner was declared a

proclaimed offender, it was improper to quash the order which was not on

record. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in

Surrender Singh v. Central Government and others, AIR 1986 SC 2166.

<p id="p_7">7.          Vide interim order dated 27.5.2008, operation of the impugned

order was stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.          Learned counsel for the appellant relies upon a judgment of

this Court in <a href="/doc/1850200/" id="a_3">Abhey Ram Jain v. Union of India and another</a> (in Crl.

Writ Petition No. 143 of 2003) dated 20.2.2003 quashing the order of

detention on the ground that 7- 1/2 years had elapsed and the order had not

been executed which was upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP

(Crl.) No. 3986 of 2003 decided on 13.7.2007. It was, however, made

clear that if the circumstances so warranted, fresh order can be passed.

Reliance has also been placed on judgment of this Court dated 21.3.2007 in

C.W.P.No. 1181 of 2006 (Narinder singh Lottye v. State of Punjab and

others), wherein following the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1785615/" id="a_4">Rajinder Arora V. Union of India</a> [2006] 4 SCC 796, order of

detention was quashed. Reliance has also been made on the judgment of

the Hon'ble Suprme Court in <a href="/doc/1880398/" id="a_5">Alpesh Navinchandra Shah v. State of

Maharashtra (SC</a>) 2007(2) R.C.R.(Crl.) 180. Reliance has also been

placed on the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/764779/" id="a_6">Adishwar Jain v. Union of India

and another</a> [2006] 2 R.C.R.(Criminal) 561 holding that LPA will lie

appellant was avoiding service of the order of detention.

</p><p id="p_10">10.             Mr.Thiara appearing for the Central Government, states that

liberty should be left to the appropriate Government to pass a fresh order in

case order of detention is to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.             Having regard to the fact that the order of detention was passed

five years ago and was for a period of one year and neither the order has

been executed nor any satisfactory explanation given for not executing the

same and also keeping in view the judgments relied upon by the appellant,

we are of the view that the order of detention is liable to be quashed.

</p><p id="p_12">12.             Accordingly, the impugned order is quashed with liberty to the

concerned authorities to pass a fresh order if and when warranted.</p><pre id="pre_2">
