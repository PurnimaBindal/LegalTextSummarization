                loan documents and verification of the the borrowers credit worthiness has to be

                done by the loan officer who is PW-1 in this case. The procedure to be followed

                before sanctioning loan is deposed by PW-1 to PW-3. They all admit that the loan

                was sanctioned by the appellant on the recommendation of PW-1,the loan officer

                and it was well within his pecuniary limits. Further, PW-3 admits that pre-

                sanction field inspection by the Manager was made mandatory only after the Head

                Office Circular dated 20/03/2003. Therefore, the omission to verify whether the

                documents given by the borrower is genuine or fake is not the responsibility of the

                Manager, it is is the duty of the loan officer and the panel lawyer who gave the

                opinion about the title found in the documents or omission to make pre-sanction

                inspection by him may not even be a negligence or wilful negligence. Certainly, the

                material evidence does not bring home the charges of conspiracy or intentional and

                dishonesty to commit any of the crime mentioned in the charges.

                                  instrumentality or agency is none the less a juridical person having a
                                  separate legal entity. Therefore, such instrumentality must be held to
                                  have an independent status distinct from the State and cannot be
                                  treated as a government department for all purposes. Therefore,
                                  even if an officer of such instrumentality or agency takes or
                                  receives, keeps or expends any property or executes any contract,
                                  such acts even though in ultimate analysis may be held to have been
                                  done in the interest of the State, such action cannot be construed, as
                                  of rule, an action of the Government by its employees or by an
                                  authority empowered by the Government. It may be indicated here
                                  that it is not necessary that persons falling under any of the

                                  to be appointed by the Government. If such person falls under any

                                  appointed by the Government or not. Explanation 2 indicates that
                                  wherever the words “public servant” occur, they shall be understood
                                  of every person who is in actual possession of the situation of a

                                  under several special and local acts. If the legislature had intended to

                N.K.Ravindran that he gone by the Panel Lawyer opinion is also not correct. The

                before creating EM. The fourth accused Govind Prasad Tiwari had been with the

                absconding accused from starting of the bank account, applying for the loan and

                after availing loan, major portion of the loan money been diverted to his firm

                account M/s Mahalakshmi Traders. It is not only the money diverted to his firm,

                the business address of M/s Steelex Impex India itself is the address of his business

                premises. The borrower has not produced the original rental agreement deed with

                the owner of the building bearing No.4, Sembudoss Street. During the inspection,

                PW-2 had noted that original rental agreement from the building owner has to be

                obtained. Neither A-1 took steps to get the original rental agreement nor the

                absconding accused (A-2) or the guarantor (A-4) produced it, even after PW-2

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                                          11. Firstly, the Valuer is not associated with the
                                  business transaction when the application for loan is
                                  submitted by the borrower. Therefore, there is no occasion
                                  for the Valuer to see the persons who appear before the
                                  bank. Some of the properties might have been Government
                                  properties. It is not the duty of the Valuer to go to the
                                  Registrar&#x27;s Office to verify whether the lands belong to the
                                  Government or private individuals.

                                  guidelines of the bank and submitted valuation reports of
                                  properties which do not exist. The prosecution has not
                                  produced any documents to show that there are specific

                the valuer had some extraneous interest in the loan transaction, except to value the

                property and when there is no apparent error or dishonest in the valuation report,
