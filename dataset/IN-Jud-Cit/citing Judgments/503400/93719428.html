<p id="p_22">                          II.       ARGUMENTS BY THE PLAINTIFFS (IN BRIEF)

</p><p id="p_23">                          13.      Mr. Amit Sibal, Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs, advanced the
                          following submissions:
</p><p id="p_24">                          A.     Novelty of Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design: Unlike traditional hip flasks
                                 which are broad and short, the Hipster is modelled on the shape and
                                 proportions of a smartphone. Its essential features reside in its: (a) tall,
                                 lean and sleek look, (b) rectangular shape inspired from the shape and
                                 proportion of a smartphone; (c) smooth rounded shoulders and
                                 symmetrical edges; (d) protruding V-shaped neck situated at the middle
                                 of both shoulders; (e) symmetrically raised and plateau-like front and
                                 rear walls; (f)two-toned rimmed and rounded cap; and (g) dimpled
                                 bottom. The said essential features form the &#x27;shape and configuration&#x27;
                                 of its distinctive design, compositely creating a visual impression that is
                                 &#x27;appealing to the eye&#x27;. No third-party has ever adopted a 180 ml

                           B.     Marketing expenses: Considerable amount has been spent to promote
                                 the Hipster through advertising and social media marketing.
                          C.     Profits and goodwill: The Hipster has proved to be a runaway success,
                                 with almost 95000 cases (of 48 bottles each) worth Rs. 100 crores sold
                                 in just 1.5 years in India. As evident from its sales turnovers, media and
                                 social media coverage and awards received, the Plaintiffs have extensive
                                 goodwill and reputation in their product.2 The Defendant&#x27;s imitation
                                 itself is a testament to the Plaintiffs&#x27; reputation and goodwill.3
                          D.     Common law rights in trade dress: A shape can also be protected as a
                                 trade mark, if it is used as a source identifier. Plaintiffs have common
                                 law rights in the trade dress and get-up in their Bottles comprising of
                                 unique and distinctive non-functional visual features, such as the
                                 monochromatic colour scheme, two-toned rimmed and rounded cap
                                 bearing a different colour, manner of depiction of text and label,
                                 indentations and embellishments. Such a cumulative combination of
                                 visual features results in a distinctive trade dress, which creates a strong
                                 visual impression in the mind of the consumer, and thus, Plaintiffs&#x27;
                                 unique trade dress acts as a source identifier.

                           A.   The present suit has been filed with mala fide intentions and is an
                               attempt to drive out legitimate competition.
</p><p id="p_32">                          B.   Defendant is a reputed liquor manufacturer and has sold more than 35
                               lakh cases of &#x27;GOA&#x27; branded products in the last 3 years, with over INR
                               100 crores in sales for FY 2019-2020. The &#x27;GOA&#x27; mark of Defendant
                               has no resemblance to the Plaintiffs&#x27; brands viz. &#x27;VAT 69&#x27;, &#x27;BLACK
                               DOG&#x27; and &#x27;BLACK &amp; WHITE&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_33">                          C.   Defendant prominently displays its mark &#x27;GOA&#x27; on all its products and
                               the same is widely recognised by customers. The presence of such
                               apparently different brands completely eliminates any chances of
                               confusion between them.
</p><p id="p_34">                          D.   The Plaintiffs are not the creators or proprietors of the design: Plaintiffs
                               admitted in Interrogatory No. 1 that the &#x27;creator&#x27; of the Hipster design
                               is an agency named Love Creative. There is no pleading relating to Love
                               Creative, as only website pages of Love Creative have been shown in
                               the plaint, which cannot fulfil the requirement of <a href="/doc/1550009/" id="a_6">Section 2(j)</a> of the
                               Designs Act. Since there is no pleading that the said author has executed
                               the work for Plaintiffs for good consideration, or has assigned the same
                               to the Plaintiffs, and no documentation has been shown to this effect
                               either, the mandate of <a href="/doc/1550009/" id="a_7">Section 2(j)</a> of the Designs Act has not been met.
                               Thus, prima facie the registration is liable to be cancelled.
                          E.   Invalid Designs under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_8">Designs Act</a>: Unlike trademarks and
                               copyrights, patents and designs laws are strictly based upon validity of

                                facie evidence of validity. In cases where there is a serious challenge to
                                a design, or where a design is new and has not been tested, injunctions
                                should not be granted.5 The test, under designs law, is not from a
                                consumer&#x27;s point of view, but of an instructed person having knowledge
                                of the state-of-the-art and common-to-trade aspects of the design.
                          F.    Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design No. 306577 is liable to be cancelled under

</p><p id="p_35">                                (i)     The design stands disclosed through prior art: The shape and
                                        configuration of Plaintiffs&#x27; Bottles, is &quot;inspired&quot; from hip flasks,
                                        and is extremely common to the liquor trade, being already in use
                                        by other brands, as is evident from the visual representation below:

<p id="p_36">                                        In fact, both the Plaintiffs&#x27; and Defendant&#x27;s bottles are mere trade-
                                        variants of the hip flask, and hence not registrable. Moreover, an
                                        admission to this effect is filed by Plaintiffs in the form of a
                                        newspaper interview filed as annexure-10, where they admit to
                                        such inspiration.

                                          liable to be cancelled as the design is not new, novel or original.
                                          The introduction of ordinary trade variants into an old design
                                          cannot make it new or original.6 Some of the pre-existing designs

<p id="p_41">                                          The term &quot;new and useful&quot; is a recognised term used in relation to
                                          a primarily utilitarian function, and hence, would be the subject
                                          matter of a patent; whereas, under designs law, &#x27;novelty&#x27; means
                                          &quot;new and original&quot;. The moment the creator says a design is not
                                          &#x27;novel&#x27;, in effect, what is being stated is that it is not new and
                                          original. Further, the Plaintiffs had claimed that the design was
                                          &quot;new and useful&quot; in their response to the interrogatories; and now

                                       designs of a smartphone and hip flask are similar to each other to

                                  the same height if they have the same bottom circumference.11
                          H.      No injunction is liable to be granted as the Defendant has raised a
                                  credible challenge to Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design. Moreover, it is a
                                  well-settled principle that injunction does not follow as a matter of
                                  routine in cases when serious disputed questions arise, such as prior
                                  publication of the design, lack of originality, trade variation, etc.12
                          I.      There can be no restrain qua passing off in a registered design.13
                                  Plaintiffs&#x27; Bottles are constituted of common-to-trade elements, and
                                  therefore, no distinctiveness can be claimed in the overall get-up. No
                                  case for passing off can be made by merely showing imitation of parts
                                  of the get-up of goods which are common-to-the-trade.14 Hence, the
                                  shape of a bottle which is a registered design is to be disregarded for
                                  the purpose of passing off.

                                  itself, does not constitute either infringement or passing off.

                           a new design is also useful, it does not imply that the design is dictated solely
                          by function, and is thereby, not registrable under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_22">Designs Act</a>.

                          Defendant&#x27;s official had claimed that several of the design/ trade dress
                          elements were already being used by the Defendant for more than a decade.

<p id="p_58">                          17.      As the trade channels of the Plaintiffs and Defendant&#x27;s bottles are

                          Considering its similar design and identical trade dress, the Defendant&#x27;s
                          product has diluted the registered design, distinctiveness get-up, and unique

                          hand, Defendant has taken the plea that the registration should be cancelled
                          for the reasons, inter alia, that: (i) the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design is neither
                          &#x27;new&#x27;, nor &#x27;original&#x27;, (ii) both parties drink16 from the same pool of prior art

<p id="p_64">                          21.        In order to succeed, at the interim stage, Plaintiffs must prima facie

                          imitation of Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design. On the other hand, to deny the
                          injunction, notwithstanding the fact that a registered design remains open to
                          challenge, the Defendant must, on a prima facie basis, discharge the burden

                          Creative. It has been pleaded that Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design was created
                          upon payment of approximately 1.5 million GBP. A screenshot of the
                          agency&#x27;s website has been shown [annexed as Annexure P-22], wherein it is
                          stated as follows:

                                 &quot;Moving from initial design concepts to final production, we managed every
                                 stage of the journey until the Pocket arrived in the consumer&#x27;s hand. This
                                 ground-breaking format was created for use across the entire Diageo
                                 portfolio, spanning 20 brands in total. And that&#x27;s just for Scotch.&quot;

<p id="p_77">                          This clearly shows that Plaintiff No. 1 had indeed outsourced the creation of

                                   DECIDING THE RELIEF OF GRANT OF INJUNCTION?
</p>

<p id="p_84">                          28.      Plaintiff No. 1&#x27;s design registration is valid for an initial period of 10
                          years (till 2029), which is extendable for a further period of five years
                          therefrom (till 2034). Despite subsisting validity of registration, Mr. Lall
                          argued that since the registration is of a recent date; its validity is strongly
                          disputed by the Defendant, and a cancellation application before the
                          concerned authority is still pending,19 the Plaintiffs should not be granted any
                          injunction.20 He further argued that the registration of a design is, at best, a
                          rebuttable presumption of its novelty; it merely endorses proprietor&#x27;s claim

                          Patents, Designs and Trade Marks), and nothing more.
</p>

<p id="p_89">                          29.   On the issue of effect of registration, as prima facie evidence of
                          validity, a juxtaposition is drawn between the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_32">Designs Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_33">Trade
                          Marks Act</a>, 1999. <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_34">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act specifically notes that
                          &quot;Registration shall be prima facie evidence of validity&quot;. Curiously, there is
                          no such corresponding section in the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_35">Designs Act</a>, which is a later statute.
                          This, by necessary corollary, means that the drafters intended that no such
                          implication is to be drawn for registration of designs. The reason for this
                          difference in treatment of a registered design vis-a-vis a registered trade
                          mark, lies in the registration process. While both applications invite
                          objections before the Examiner/ Controller, only trade mark applications are
                          advertised for &#x27;opposition&#x27; in terms of <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_36">Section 21</a> of the Trade Marks Act.
                          Oppositions, if any, are then adjudicated by the Registrar of Trade Marks on
                          the basis of statement(s) and counter-statement(s), after duly hearing the
                          applicant and opponent. These steps are undertaken prior to the grant of
                          registration. In contrast, public opposition stage is wholly missing in the
                          design registration process. Under <a href="/doc/796325/" id="a_37">Section 5(1)</a> of the Designs Act, for
                          registering a design, the Controller is essentially to consider whether (or not)
                          the design applied for has previously been published in another country, and
                          whether it is contrary to public order or morality. Thereafter, such design is
                          made open to public inspection by way of publication only post-registration,
                          in terms of <a href="/doc/481799/" id="a_38">Section 7</a> of the Designs Act. Hence, the only remedy available
                          to an aggrieved person qua registration of a design, is to apply for
                          cancellation after the grant. This is the reason <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_39">Section 22(3)</a> allows a

                          under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_40">Section 19</a> in respect of cancellation of design. Unsurprisingly, there
                          is no corresponding section in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_41">Trade Marks Act</a> to <a href="/doc/1480292/" id="a_42">Section 22(3)</a> of the

</p>

<p id="p_90">                          30.        The lowdown of the above discussion is that registration is not prima
                          facie evidence of validity of a design, and to that extent, there is merit in Mr.
                          Lall&#x27;s submissions. That said, there cannot be any hard and fast rule that
                          merely because a design registration is of a recent date, Plaintiffs would not
                          be entitled to an injunction. Given the lack of statutory distinction between
                          the initial and later years of registration, the effect of registration must prevail
                          uniformly over the course of the entire life of the registration.
</p>

<p id="p_91">                          31.        <a href="/doc/1725358/" id="a_43">Section 11</a> read with <a href="/doc/1321789/" id="a_44">Section 2(c)</a> of the Designs Act grants the
                          proprietor ten years from the date of registration to exercise its exclusive right
                          to apply its design to any article in the class in which it is registered. 21 The
                          same is extendable to a further period of five years. Further, <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_45">Section 22</a> deals
                          with piracy of a design and affords protection to the registered proprietors.

<p id="p_92">                          32.        Thus, if a design appears to be prima facie validly registered, having
                          all the necessary attributes for registration, and Plaintiffs are able to
                          demonstrate a strong prima facie case of infringement/ passing off/ imitation,
                          injunction should follow. Under such circumstances, the recency in
                          registration of a design would not be a matter of consequence. Nonetheless,

                           keeping in mind the above-discussed statutory scheme of registration process
                          of a design, even at the interim stage, the Court will have to necessarily
                          venture into the grounds for cancellation of the registered design, if urged by
                          the Defendant. This exercise, of course, would to be done on a prima facie
                          basis only. Hence, the Defendant must with reasonable certainty demonstrate
                          grounds, which would render the design susceptible to cancellation. Whether
                          the Defendant has been successful in such endeavour, would be analysed in
                          the succeeding paragraphs.

                          designs, the yardstick is &#x27;visual effect&#x27;, &#x27;appeal to the eye&#x27; of the customer&#x27;
                          and &#x27;ocular impression&#x27; of design, as a whole. The test is not to look out for
                          subtle dissimilarities, but rather, to see if there is substantial and overall
                          similarity in the two designs.22 The test has been aptly elucidated by this Court
                          in <a href="/doc/63948356/" id="a_47">Symphony Ltd. v. Life Plus Appliances</a>,23 as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                  &quot;Under the law of designs, it is the settled principle that the overall look of the

                                  examination of the design is not to be done.&quot;

<p id="p_100">                          37.     A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court held in Carlsberg Breweries-
                          2017,24 that apart from the overall resemblance in design, the Court is
                          required to see, as to whether the essential part or the basis of a plaintiff&#x27;s
                          claim for novelty forms part of the impugned mark, in the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                  &quot;153. Thus, to see whether the imitation is obvious, the same should strike at
                                  once on a visual comparison of the article containing the registered design and the
                                  article containing the design which is said to be infringing the registered design.
                                  The impugned design should be very close to the original design - the resemblance
                                  of the original design being immediately apparent to the eye while looking at the
                                  two designs. Fraudulent imitation is one which is deliberately based upon the
                                  registered design. The imitation may be less apparent than an obvious imitation.
                                  There may be subtle distinction between the registered design and the alleged
                                  fraudulent imitation, and yet the fraudulent imitation although different in some
                                  respects from the original, renders it as a perceptible imitation when the two
                                  designs are closely scanned.&quot;

                                 plaintiff could not be viewed in isolation to determine as to what are its striking
                                features.&quot;                                               [Emphasis Supplied]

</p><p id="p_105">                          38.   The Court now proceeds to apply the afore-noted test to determine if
                          there is prima facie deceptive similarity in the impugned bottles when
                          compared to the Hipster. While applying this test, the Court is also conscious
                          that not every resemblance between the two designs would amount to
                          infringement. The comparison by the eye has been done by physically
                          holding in hand the Defendant&#x27;s impugned bottle alongside the Plaintiffs&#x27;.
                          Unequivocally, at first blush, the Defendant&#x27;s impugned bottles bear a
                          remarkable similarity to the Hipster. All the unique, essential and novel
                          features of the Hipster: long, lean and sleek design, curved shoulders, &#x27;v&#x27;
                          element on the neck, etc. are found on the impugned bottle as well. In terms
                          of shape, the bottles have identical necks, shoulders, joints and edges. Both
                          are identically rectangular in shape, and have a dimpled bottom, which,
                          indeed is nearly-identical and has sufficient similarity to make it difficult for
                          the consumer to distinguish one from the other. In fact, even upon
                          undertaking a microscopically detailed examination, or applying the
                          instructed eye test, only three points of difference emerge: firstly, the
                          Defendant&#x27;s bottle has a crest-shaped logo of the Defendant&#x27;s company
                          embossed on the upper portion at the front, whereas the Hipster is plain.
                          Secondly, the Defendant&#x27;s bottle is a few millimetres shorter and very
                          slightly more bulbous than the Hipster. Thirdly, and lastly, the neck of the
                          impugned product is about one millimetre shorter. However, when examined
                          from a distance of three to five yards, which is a reasonable distance between
                          a potential consumer and the shelf of a liquor store where the bottles may be

                           displayed together, the differences vaporise.25 Besides, the impugned design
                          need not be an exact replica to constitute infringement. Minor changes in size
                          are insignificant as the overall and substantial similarity is glaring and
                          undeniably apparent to the naked eye. The Court is, thus, satisfied that
                          Defendant&#x27;s product is deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered
                          Design.
</p>

<p id="p_106">                          39.     Further, the Court is also persuaded by the response given by the
                          Defendant&#x27;s officer in response to the Plaintiffs&#x27; interrogatories, whereby it
                          has been admitted that: (i) Defendant has neither designed the impugned
                          bottles, nor done any research and development before adopting the shape
                          and trade-dress of the impugned product; (ii) Defendant was well aware of
                          the existence of the Hipster in the market; and (iii) Plaintiffs&#x27; products were
                          inspected by the Defendant before manufacturing the impugned bottles. This
                          is corroborated by the fact that Hipster bottles were found at the Defendant&#x27;s
                          premises by the court-appointed Local Commissioner. All of the above points
                          drive home the Plaintiffs&#x27; allegation that the Defendant deliberately and
                          fraudulently imitated the Hipster.

<p id="p_107">                          40.     Also, before using the impugned bottles, Defendant was selling its
                          product in a different packaging, which was distinct from the Plaintiffs&#x27;
                          Registered Design and trade dress. In fact, it is the admitted case of <a href="/doc/792062/" id="a_52">Defendant

                          High Court noted that unlike at a bar, alcohol is bought in the market not by brand name, but by eyeing the
                          bottle. Further, in Wallpaper Manufacturers Ltd. v. Derby Paper Staining Co., (1925) 42 RPC 443, the
                          English Court compared the impugned and original wallpaper designs by hanging up respective strips and
                          examining from a distance of 4-5 yards to see if the two were &quot;impossible to distinguish&quot; from one another.

                           that it launched the impugned design only in 2021, which undoubtedly,
                          makes the Plaintiffs the prior user of the design (since 2018 in the global
                          market and since May, 2019 in India).
</p>

<p id="p_109">                          41.   From the above, it is conclusive that the Plaintiffs have established a
                          prima facie case in their favour and have successfully substantiated their case
                          that the Defendant&#x27;s impugned product is an obvious and slavish imitation of
                          Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design.
</p>

<p id="p_110">                          42.   The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiffs. The
                          Defendant was admittedly selling its products only in a limited geographical
                          space viz. in Madhya Pradesh. It is an admitted position that Defendant&#x27;s
                          Bottles were being marketed for only a few weeks, before the ad-interim
                          injunction was granted to the Plaintiffs on 23rd February, 2021, and the
                          impugned design has not been sold since. Mr. Lall, upon being queried by
                          the Court, stated that since the injunction, the Defendant has been selling its
                          product in another bottle which is dissimilar in design to the Hipster, and an
                          application to this effect had also been filed before the Court seeking to
                          modify the design of its bottle. It is also noted that there is no pleading by the
                          Defendant that its entire business would shut down as a consequence of the
                          injunction. Hence, as such, it cannot be said that the Defendant&#x27;s business has
                          been severely impacted by the injunction.

                          Plaintiffs, as the Defendant seems to be attempting to ride on the coattails of
                          the Plaintiffs&#x27; goodwill, brand value, success, marketing, and efforts to build

                           a market standing. Plaintiffs claim to have spent approximately 1.5 million
                          GBP on conceptualization, design and commercial development of the
                          Hipster, and have spent an additional 1.9 million GBP to set up a supply
                          distribution chain globally; whereas the Defendant had to incur no such
                          expenses. Sales figures submitted with the plaint, too, show that from May,
                          2019 to September, 2020, as per the Chartered Accountant&#x27;s certificate
                          presented by the Plaintiffs, net sales were recorded as INR 100.73 crore
                          against 95623 cases of Plaintiffs&#x27; goods; whereas the Defendant has
                          admittedly sold inventory only worth INR 24 lakhs. Therefore, the Plaintiffs
                          will suffer irreparable harm as Defendant&#x27;s Bottles are diluting the
                          distinctiveness of the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design and defeating the very
                          purpose of protection. There would be a cascading effect in the market if such
                          use is continued to be allowed.
</p>

<p id="p_112">                          44.   In light of the foregoing, it emerges that Plaintiffs have indeed
                          established all the three ingredients that warrant an injunction against the
                          Defendant.

                          established in favour of the Plaintiffs, can be shown to be false, by the

                          drive home this point, he attached a chart showing comparisons with existing
                          designs, which, he claimed, amounted to prior publication in India and abroad.

                          account of numerous prior publications which disclose the same features,
                          making the design very much in public domain, which disentitled the

                          shown 2D pictures of 3D objects, which in reality are vastly dissimilar from
                          the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design; (iii) the Defendant has merely filed images
                          of flasks which have been used as accessory to alcohol, but no hipflasks that
                          have been used for packaging liquor; (iv) Defendant has not highlighted the
                          existence of any other manufacturer/distributor in the market which pre-fills
                          and sells their product in a bottle of the same look and feel as that of the

                          drawings relied upon by Defendant must at least provide a perspective view
                          for clarity. It is also to be remembered that 2D illustrations do not depict the
                          application of the design with the same visual effect as a 3D model. For
                          judging by the eye, the prior art or publication relied upon must exhibit clarity
                          of application to a specific article which is capable of being judged.
                          Understanding of a 3D design can be perceived only if the prior publication
                          is lucid and is shown from several angles to gauge depth/perception. Reliance
                          on a two-dimensional view can, in fact, be quite misleading, as can be seen
                          from the following depictions:

                           reply, negating each comparison on various grounds. The Court has examined
                          each of these individually. It would not be apt to write a separate analysis for
                          each; but it is fitting to say that the Court has observed that indeed, the
                          pictures, as shown, differed from the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design in terms of
                          rounded/drooping shoulders; bulbous/curved walls, shorter/longer neck;
                          length; and existence of a false bottom instead of a dimpled bottom. It must
                          also be mentioned that, since the prior arts so filed were 3D articles, but
                          depicted in 2D images, the pictorial illustrations were unclear so as to
                          visualise the &#x27;appeal to eye&#x27; factor.

<p id="p_132">                          56.    The court thus finds that, upon a conspectus of the prior art shown by
                          the Defendants, the uniqueness of the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design which
                          resides in its striking features, i.e. (a) tall, lean and sleek look; (b) rectangular
                          shape inspired from the shape and proportion of a smartphone; (c) smooth
                          rounded shoulders and symmetrical edges; (d) protruding V-shaped neck
                          situated at the middle of both the shoulders; (e) symmetrically raised and
                          plateau like front and rear walls; two-toned rimmed and rounded cap; and (f)
                          dimpled bottom, are missing in all the cited the prior arts.

                                     If a design is not new or original, then, the same cannot be registered. The

                                     time the expression &quot;original&quot; had to be designed because &quot;original&quot; design may

                                     yet there is newness or originality in applying the existing design to a particular
                                     article which no one thought of before which amounts to newness in creation and
                                     hence it is given protection as an intellectual property right. Elaborating further,
                                     what is new is quite obvious in that it comes into existence for the first time,
                                     however, a design may not be new in the sense it may already be available in the
                                     public domain, however, in its application for a particular purpose it may be
                                     totally original in the application which was not otherwise conceived of and
                                     therefore can amount to a new creation for commercial application thus entitling

                                     was completely new in itself and on the other hand &quot;original&quot; referred to cases
                                     where though old in itself, it was new in its application to the article in question.
                                     The word &quot;original&quot; contemplates that the person has originated something, that
                                     by the exercise of intellectual activity he has started an idea which had not
                                     occurred to anyone before, that a particular pattern or shape or ornament may be
                                     rendered applicable to the particular article to which he suggest that it shall be
                                     applied.&quot;

<p id="p_141">                          62.        As an aside, it must also be noted that it was argued by the Defendant
                          that &quot;novelty&quot; is not a concept of designs law and has been misappropriated
                          by the Plaintiffs from the patents regime. Petitioner, on the other hand, insists
                          that under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_75">Designs Act</a>, novelty equals new plus original.
</p>

<p id="p_142">                          63.        In this regard, it must be noted that while the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_76">Designs Act</a>, 2000 indeed
                          uses the words &quot;new&quot; and &quot;original&quot; and not the word &quot;novelty&quot;, there is
                          indeed a statutory reference to &quot;novelty&quot; found the designs regime, in Rule
                          12 of the Design Rules, which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                                     &quot;12.    Statement of novelty. - The applicant may, and shall, if required by the
                                     Controller in any case so to do, endorse on the application and each of the

</p><p id="p_145">                           65.        To the Court, there does not seem to be any difference between
                          &quot;novelty&quot; as mentioned in the Rules, and &quot;new and original&quot; as mentioned in
                          the Act, apart from a grammatical one. The argument of the Defendant does
                          not sway the Court, as the rules of construction applicable to patent law
                          cannot be applied stricto sensu to the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_77">Designs Act</a>. &quot;Novelty&quot; in the patent
                          regime corresponds to new inventions and existence of an &quot;inventive step&quot;
                          which cannot be appropriated to the designs regime. The Court is thus
                          inclined to agree with the Plaintiff that in the context of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_78">Designs Act</a>, the
                          word &quot;novelty&quot; would simply mean &quot;new and original&quot;.
</p>

<p id="p_146">                          66.        Coming back to the concept of &#x27;new and original&#x27;, which now stands
                          clarified, the Court turns its eye to criteria for determining the same. The test
                          for determining novelty under designs law is no longer res integra, and has
                          been observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/99670896/" id="a_79">Steelbird Hi-Tech India Ltd. v. S.P.S.
                          Gambhir &amp; Ors</a>.,30 as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">                                     &quot;It is rightly held in the cases decided that in the matter of novelty the eye is to be
                                     the ultimate test and the determination has to be on the normal ocular impression.
                                     In order to know its newness or originality it is necessary that a design identical
                                     with or even materially similar to the relevant design should not have been
                                     published or registered previously. A slight trivial or infinitesimal variation, from
                                     a pre-existing design will not qualify it for registration. Taking into account the
                                     nature of the article involved, the change introduced should be substantial. It is
                                     not necessary to justify registration that the whole of the design should be new, the
                                     newness may be confined to only a part of it but that part must be a significant one
                                     and it should be potent enough to impart to the whole design a distinct identity,
                                     unless registration is sought for the said part alone.&quot;

                                     &quot;The test of novelty is the eye of the judge who must place the two designs side by
                                    side and see whether the one for which novelty is claimed is in fact new. It is a matter
                                    of first impression. <a href="/doc/1299373/" id="a_80">In The Wimco Ltd. v. Meena Match Industries</a>, AIR 1983 Del 537,
                                    the Court held that &quot;in the matter of novelty the eye has to be the ultimate arbiter
                                    and the determination has to rest on the general ocular impression. The court has to
                                    consider and look at the two designs in question with an instructed eye and say
                                    whether there is or there is not such a substantial difference between them that which
                                    has been published previously and the registered design to say that at the date of
                                    registration that was not published in India previously.&quot;.&quot;
</p><p id="p_148">                                                                                                 [Emphasis Supplied]

</p><p id="p_149">                          68.      Courts have regularly held that new and original has to be seen as a
                          whole.31 Little variation in pre-existing well recognized shape of an article of
                          common use in the market, such as adding a curve here or there, would not
                          make it a new or original design.32


</p><p id="p_150">                          69.      It merits noting that, in fact, what is protected under designs law is not
                          the article itself, but the idea/conceptualization which has been applied upon
                          it, that is to say, the physical manifestation of such idea. This was elucidated
                          by the Supreme Court in Bharat Glass (supra), in the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">                                   &quot;36. (...) Therefore, the concept of design is that a particular figure conceived
                                   by its designer in his mind and it is reproduced in some identifiable manner and it
                                   is sought to be applied to an article. Therefore, whenever registration is required
                                   then those configuration has to be chosen for registration to be reproduced in any
                                   article. The idea is that the design has to be registered which is sought to be
                                   reproduced on any article. Therefore, both the things are required to go together,
                                   i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article.

<p id="p_154">                          70.   Needless to say, a bottle/hip flask is not a new or novel invention by
                          itself; they have been used for the purpose of carrying liquid since time
                          immemorial and their design certainly lies in the public domain. The
                          innovation and novelty of the design, as conceptualised in the mind of its
                          author, lies not in the bottle/flask design, but in the &quot;shape and configuration&quot;
                          as applied to a bottle. Plaintiffs&#x27; claim is that no one has applied a shape
                          inspired by smartphones to liquor bottles prior to the Plaintiffs. Mr. Sibal had
                          elaborated on this creative idea of converting the 180 ml bottle into the
                          portable Hipster flask, in a deliberately smaller format, to say that the aim
                          was to attract young aspirational drinkers who may have lower disposable
                          incomes and are not be able to afford the expense of larger 750 ml bottles.
                          Indeed, the design has the ubiquity; it is travel-sized slim, glossy, angular,
                          and has fit-in-the-pocket characteristics of the smartphone. To that effect, it
                          is also not the Defendant&#x27;s case that there exists a prior-publication which is
                          based upon the lean and thin design of a smartphone. The Plaintiffs&#x27; product
                          is the first in the market to take the visually-appealing features of a
                          smartphone and apply it to pre-packaged alcohol. None of the third-party
                          products shown by the Defendant are pre-filled flasks which have the striking
                          ocular attraction of the Hipster bottles. The Defendant has shown no other

                           manufacturer/ distributor of alcohol that prefills and sells their product in a
                          bottle that look and feel like that of the Plaintiffs&#x27;. It also weighs on the mind
                          of the Court, as further evidence of originality, that Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered
                          Design had been conceptualised and designed after undertaking extensive
                          research and development. The mental activity that has gone into conceiving
                          the design is exhibited in this novel concept in the bottling industry which
                          has been in existence for quite some time. The aesthetic appeal (or in other
                          words, the pleasing, attractive appearance) which is the sum total of the
                          configuration of the unique features discussed above (rounded shoulders, V
                          neck, symmetrical design, raised front and back etc.) is the novelty that needs
                          protection. It is not just a trade variant of previous design, as sought to be
                          trivialised by the Defendant. A bottle is undoubtedly a common article which
                          has common features, such as neck, shoulders, etc. It is an article that offers
                          limited artistic freedom to innovate. Yet, it has been significantly transformed
                          in the Hipster, with distinguishable features, giving it an aesthetic appeal that
                          had not been conceived hereinbefore. This clearly meets the threshold of
                          &#x27;new and original&#x27; as it creates an altogether different impression on an
                          informed user, entitling the Plaintiff to exclusivity. Undoubtedly, a
                          transformed bottle will still remain a bottle, but that is not the test to be
                          applied. Accepting this argument would only mean that for common articles,
                          there can be no &#x27;new or original&#x27; product. That would hinder innovation,
                          creativity and inspiration which can never be the intent or theme of laws
                          relating to intellectual properties.

                                    CANCELLED ON THE GROUND OF MOSAICING.
</p>


<p id="p_157">                          72.       Mr. Lall took great pains to take the Court through a plethora of prior
                          art, in furtherance of his submission that the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design is
                          a mix and match of existing and known designs, and hence not registrable
                          under the Act. Mr. Sibal strongly objected to the same, stating that there
                          cannot be any innovation if mosaicing is not allowed.
</p>

<p id="p_158">                          73.       In Cello v. Modware (supra), which also relates to infringement of the
                          design of bottles, the Bombay High Court has called &#x27;mosaicing&#x27; a &quot;cobbling
                          together (of) several pre-existing known designs&quot;. It made the following
                          observation with respect to mosaicing:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">                                    28. I must reject too Mr. Tolia&#x27;s argument of mosaicing. I believe it to be misapplied
                                    to this case. It is not a requirement of the law in infringement or passing off in
                                    relation to a design that every single aspect must be entirely newly concocted and
                                    unknown to the history of mankind. If that were so, we should never see any new or
                                    original design at all. It is a general rule that &quot;mosaicing&quot; of prior art, i.e.,
                                    combining selected features in different prior art publications, is not permissible
                                    when assessing whether an invention is new. Conversely, mosaicing is also no
                                    defence to a charge of infringement of a registered design. Mosaicing contemplates
                                    taking known integers or combinations and simply re-arranging them. In a situation
                                    like ours, it might for example apply if Cello laid claim to a very similar bottle with
                                    a similar shape, configuration and ornamentation but merely repositioned the
                                    ornamentation by setting it horizontally rather than vertically and doing not much
                                    else besides. That is not the case here.                   [Emphasis Supplied]

</blockquote><p id="p_159">                          74.       The Defendant&#x27;s argument of mosaicing being inadmissible, has also
                          been shunned by the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/105734429/" id="a_83">Selvel Industries and Ors. v. Om

                                 &quot;36. Mr. Khandekar then troubles me to go through several pages of illustrations
                                annexed to the Affidavit in Reply. These are all images of various types of cylindrical
                                containers. All of them have some sort of lid or the other. Some of them have airtight
                                lids. Some are fixed with clasps, others have rubber rings, some have both. I am
                                unable to see the purpose of this exercise. If the argument is that we can, or should,
                                de-construct any article into its constituent elements and then, on showing that there
                                are other similar constituent parts, even if not applied in this fashion, and therefore
                                no question of novelty remains, then that argument is without substance. I have not
                                understood Dr. Saraf to claim design copyright in the cylindrical or round-bottom
                                shape of the container.
</p>
<p id="p_162">                                37.     (...) It may often happen, and I think both counsel in fairness agree on this
                                as a matter of law, that two previously known components or integers may be
                                combined or applied in such a way so as to result in a completely novel design.
                                Therefore, to suggest that there is no novelty in the shape, that the wave itself is not
                                novel and, therefore, the addition of the wave to the container cannot possibly be
                                novel and is necessarily only a trade variant is not an acceptable argument. What
                                the Defendant must show is that there is such a design, or one very similar to it, that
                                preceded the Plaintiffs&#x27; design; that would rob the Plaintiffs&#x27; design of the necessary
                                newness and originality.
</p><p id="p_163">                                                               xx       ...       xx     ...        xx
</p><p id="p_164">                                42.     (...) It is entirely possible to take two old or known integers and combine
                                them in a new way, one that is purely aesthetic and appeals to the eye, by a process
                                contemplated by the statutory definition, and to yet receive a result that qualifies as
                                a design, both entirely new and entirely original. We see many such examples. From
                                lead pencils to match boxes, there is no limit to human imagination or innovation.&quot;
</p><p id="p_165">                                                                                    [Emphasis Supplied]

</p><p id="p_166">                          75.   What follows from the foregoing is that: (i) The Court should not
                          dissect individual features of a design and try to find them individually in each
                          prior art; instead, a conspectus of features as a whole should be seen. (ii) It is
                          well within the realm of possibilities that existing features of known designs
                          can be combined in a hitherto unseen manner which can result in a new and
                          original design. (iii) Mosaicing of pre-existing designs is not a defence to seek
                          cancellation of registration. (iv) Defendant will have to show one single prior
                          art to claim prior publication.

</p><p id="p_168">                           76. Applying the above test, the Court is unconvinced of the Defendant&#x27;s
                          argument that the Plaintiffs have merely &#x27;cobbled together&#x27; known integers.
                          The element of originality in the aesthetics and style of the Hipster certainly
                          bears out in the Court&#x27;s prima facie vision, as discussed above. Defendant has
                          also failed to point out which particular known designs have been allegedly
                          combined to get the Plaintiffs Registered Design. The images filed by the
                          Defendant does not provide the perspective/3D view of the claimed/alleged
                          known designs. The Court cannot take the neck of one bottle and the shoulder
                          of another and attempt to stitch together such known features to see whether
                          the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design is disclosed. The burden was on the
                          Defendant to show any one prior art which would be an exact match to qualify
                          for a prior publication. That said, the Plaintiffs are free to pick and choose
                          elements and take inspiration from multiple pre-existing designs, as long as
                          they are able to apply the same to create a new or original design. Certainly
                          not all designs can be made avant garde, completely bereft of any inspiration
                          from existing designs. True novelty lies in the originality of application of
                          existing ideas in a hitherto unknown fashion. Any rule stricter than this would
                          amount to stifling human creativity and enterprise, and would be counter-
                          productive to the intent of novelty and innovation in design.

                                CANCELLED ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS FUNCTIONAL IN NATURE.
</p>


<p id="p_172">                          79.   A Design which is purely functional cannot be protected, as the same
                          lies in the domain of patent laws. Functionality, ipso facto, does not render a
                          design liable to be cancelled. For the ground of functionality to succeed, the
                          Defendant must establish that the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design is the only
                          way possible to manufacture/create a given article, considering the functional
                          requirements of the product. To put it in another manner, the design
                          protection so afforded to the proprietor must become a hindrance to the
                          manufacture/creation of such an article by any other person, thereby stifling
                          innovation - which goes against the tenets of designs law - only then must
                          such defence succeed. Merely because form has relevance to function does
                          not disentitle a proprietor from registering its design.
</p>

<p id="p_173">                          80.   It was thus urged by Mr. Lall that if indeed the shape of the Plaintiffs&#x27;
                          Bottle is designed to fit into the pocket akin to a smartphone - then it is a
                          functional innovation, and should have been registered as a patent, but
                          certainly cannot be registered as a &#x27;design&#x27; as defined under <a href="/doc/618466/" id="a_86">Section 2(d)</a> of
                          the Act. After all, he said, a bottle is a bottle, and any innovation which assists
                          its function is bound to be a patentable invention instead of a design
                          registration one.

                           distinguishable from traditional flasks. He submitted that 180 ml flasks can be
                          designed in any way possible, not only in the same shape and configuration
                          as claimed by the Plaintiffs under its Registered Design, and what makes the
                          Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design distinctive is it unique shape and configuration
                          which has strikingly attractive &#x27;appeal to the eye&#x27; factor.
</p>

<p id="p_175">                          82.   The Court is unable to agree with the Defendant. Notably, in Cello v.
                          Modware (supra), which also relates to infringement of the design of bottles,
                          the Bombay High Court had rejected the approach of &quot;a bottle is a bottle&quot;, in
                          the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                                &quot;15. Mr. Tolia&#x27;s defences are these. He says, first, that there is prior publication. He
                                says this on the basis that Modware also manufactures bottles. His case is that a
                                bottle is a bottle, by whatever name called. It is a container of liquid. Generally, it
                                is taller than wider. Modware makes very many bottles. So do others. He shows me
                                images of Modware&#x27;s various bottles and those of other manufacturers. All these are
                                just bottles, he says. Therefore, according to him, there is neither novelty nor
                                originality in Cello&#x27;s claim as to &#x27;shape&#x27; or &#x27;configuration&#x27;. Others have also made
                                tall cylinders with screw top or flip top lids. Cello can claim no originality in these.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                                                      xx         ...       xx       ...       xx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                19. The a-bottle-is-a-bottle argument must be rejected. It is not possible to accept
                                this submission that no vertical cylindrical fluid container can have either originality
                                or novelty because it is, after all, vertical and cylindrical. That is an unacceptable
                                oversimplification of the requirements of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_87">Designs Act</a> and of the law on the

                                     through a number of different forms, then a defense of functionality must fail. For
                                     the defence of functionality to succeed, it is essential for the Defendant to establish
                                     that the design applied for is the only mode/option which was possible considering
                                     the functional requirements of the products. Even otherwise, as submitted by the

                                     serves the purpose which the treads on any tyre serve. However, if the same
                                     function can be achieved through numerous different forms of tread patterns, then
                                     the defence of functionality must fail. It was essential for the defendant to, at least,

                          to carry liquid, as the shape of a hipster. However, the Defendant has failed
                          to establish that the alleged functionality can only be performed by shape and
                          configuration of the Plaintiffs&#x27; Registered Design. Rather, Defendant itself
                          was manufacturing/selling another 180 ml bottle for its product, which
                          performs the same function - of storing alcohol - as that of the Plaintiffs&#x27;
                          Registered Design. The fact that the Plaintiffs have innovated upon the pre-
                          existing shape of a hip-flask and applied it to a 180 ml bottle, inspired by
                          smartphones, is the novel and unique design, and cannot prima facie be said
                          to be dictated by function. Novelty is therefore not inhabiting in the

                           Distilleries &amp; Breweries Ltd. is entirely misconceived. In fact, the holding of
                          the afore-noted judgement is altogether contrary to his submission. The bench
                          therein found a composite suit (for infringement of registered design and for
                          passing off of the said design) to be maintainable, relying on principles of
                          joinder of two causes of action as enshrined in the Code of Civil Procedure,
                          1908.
</p>

<p id="p_187">                          91.        That said, let&#x27;s now examine the passing off claim of the Plaintiff. As
                          noted above, it is based essentially on &#x27;trade dress&#x27;. A trade dress is a
                          combination of various elements that together create a strong visual
                          impression. <a href="/doc/1306228/" id="a_94">In Colgate Palmolive Company v. Anchor Health and Beauty
                          Care Pvt. Ltd</a>.,38 a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court explained the concept in
                          the following words: &quot;trade dress involves the total image of a product and
                          may include features such as size, shape, colour combinations, texture, or
                          graphics&quot;, and further observed that the trade dress is a single source of origin
                          for consumers to recognize a company&#x27;s goods.
</p>



<p id="p_188">                          92.        The distinctiveness of a trade dress is not to be perceived by its
                          individual elements in isolation, but has to be seen as a whole, to determine
                          whether its essential features are distinctive enough to become a source
                          identifier. In this regard, the view taken by Calcutta High Court in LA Opala
                          RG. Ltd. (supra) is also noteworthy. Therein, the Court had noted that
                          individual elements of a trade dress cannot be segregated. The test, therefore,

                           is whether all the elements as a whole are creating a distinctive visual
                          impression. The necessary corollary being that, in order to defend the
                          allegation of imitation of a trade dress, the Defendant cannot cherry pick parts
                          of the trade dress to carve out an artificial distinction.
</p>

<p id="p_190">                          93.        Before analysing the similarities in the two trade dresses presented to
                          the Court, reiteration of the ingredients that are essential to sustain the tort of
                          passing off, would be apposite. Passing off action is founded on: (i) the use
                          of a mark in the trade for sale of the Plaintiffs&#x27; goods; (ii) the generation of
                          reputation and goodwill as a consequences of trade; and (iii) the association
                          of the mark with the Plaintiffs&#x27; goods, and (iv) the misrepresentation sought
                          to be created by the Defendant by its use of such mark, so as to deceptively
                          portray that its goods originate from the Plaintiffs. On this issue, one
                          immediately recalls the classical trinity test laid down in the Jiff Lemon
                          case,39 which has been recently revisited by a coordinate bench of this Court
                          in <a href="/doc/64878627/" id="a_95">RB Health (US) LLC &amp; Anr. v. Dabur India Ltd</a>.,40 as follows:

                                17.3. Therefore, in a case, where a plaintiff institutes a passing off action, it is
                                incumbent upon him to demonstrate that he has inter alia goodwill in the
                                jurisdiction over which the concerned Court has sway.
</p>
<p id="p_192">                                17.4. The very same parameters have been adopted by this Court as well. In this
                                behalf, see the following observations in <a href="/doc/172757974/" id="a_96">Rich Products Corporation &amp; Anr. vs.
                                Indo Nippon Food Ltd</a>., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 734 [which were sustained by the
                                Division Bench of this Court, vide judgement dated 20.09.2010, passed in RFA
                                (OS) No. 37/2010].
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">                                        &quot;39. Consequently, this brings me to the submission of the plaintiffs that
                                        the defendant&#x27;s use of the infringed mark constitutes passing off. In this
                                        connection, let me reiterate the well known parameters of what constitutes
                                        passing off. Passing off as is ubiquitously held in most jurisdictions subject
                                        to usual turn of phrase or change of phraseology, a tort of false
                                        representation, whether intentional or unintentional whereby, one person
                                        attempts to sell his goods or services as those manufactured or rendered
                                        by another which is &quot;calculated&quot; to damage the goodwill of that other
                                        person. Thus, the necessary ingredients which a plaintiff in an action of
                                        passing off is required to prove, is the:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_52">                                           (i) employment of deception. Mere confusion will not suffice;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">                                           (ii) intent is not a necessary as long as the unwary consumer is
                                                 deceived; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_54">                                           (iii) the act of the tort should injure the goodwill not just his
                                                 reputation.(...)&quot;&quot;                          [Emphasis Supplied]


</blockquote><p id="p_193">                          94.   In light of the foregoing discussion, the Court now proceeds to make a
                          comparison of the trade-dress of the products in question. Immediately, it is
                          noticed that the Hipster is marketed in three colour variants: white, golden and
                          black. The Defendant&#x27;s bottles are in the colour variants red and black. Whilst
                          all the bottles are in a dual-chromatic scheme, there is indeed some grain of
                          truth in the Defendant&#x27;s submission that the black-and-gold combination is
                          common to trade, and has been used by a plethora of alcohol manufacturers.
                          Mr. Lall had produced various such trade dresses, which are extracted below:

                           Similarly, a two-toned rimmed and rounded cap, too, has been widely used in
                          the said industry and is not unique to the Plaintiffs. Hence, upon a comparison
                          of the trade dress as a whole, the Court cannot prima facie agree that the
                          essential features are distinctive enough to become a source identifier. Apart
                          from the black &amp; gold colour scheme, there is hardly any similarity in the
                          labels, trade dress, and get-up. Thus, the Court is not entirely convinced that
                          the same is being imitated by the Defendant to deceive unwary customers. The
                          Court is further prima facie unconvinced that the purported imitation of the
                          Hipster&#x27;s trade dress by the Defendant has resulted in some tangible confusion
                          with regard to the origin or source of the goods, considering that the &#x27;GOA&#x27;
                          brand is boldly displayed on the bottle, the labels are largely dissimilar, and
                          the price points of the goods are vastly different.

                           to be at fault as discussed above. This claim of the Plaintiff is analysed
                          squarely on the aspect of passing off of the trade dress, overall get-up, and
                          presentation of the product through packaging. Even on the above noted
                          aspect, there are undeniably some similarities which are quite visible, but
                          they are largely occurring because of identical designs (for which the plaintiff
                          is entitled to injunction on account of design infringement) and the mono-
                          chromactic colour of the bottles. However, at this interim stage, such
                          similarities are not sufficient to grant injunction on a passing off action,
                          particularly when the trinity test, recounted above is not met.
