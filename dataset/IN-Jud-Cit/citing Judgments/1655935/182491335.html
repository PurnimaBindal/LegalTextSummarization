                          since 2013. Plaintiff&#x27;s products are available across India and in several

                          20,000 retailers and service centres, spread across 29 States in India.

<p id="p_5">                          3.    Plaintiff is the proprietor of the trademark/label                which is
                          registered under TM Application No.2503134 in Class 11 since 26.03.2013,
                          for goods being water heaters, electric water heaters, heating coils, electric
                          water geysers, etc. as averred in the plaint. According to the Plaintiff, the
                          word PEBBLE is the essential and prominent part of the Trademark/label

                                       and thus, Plaintiff has the exclusive right qua the said word in
                          respect of any electric good by virtue of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_1">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
                          1999 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;) albeit Plaintiff has filed an
                          application for registration of the trademark PEBBLE (word per se) under
                          No.4984108 in Class 7, for goods namely, ironing machines, ironing

                          fortify its existing rights. The Trade Marks Registry has objected to the
                          application on the ground that there exists a conflicting mark on the Trade
                          Marks Register and the application is currently pending.

                          products like water heaters, geysers, etc., that has won the trust of
                          consumers on account of their quality, dependability, long durability and
                          true after-sales service, provided through authorized service centres, located
                          throughout India. Plaintiff has also initiated efforts to popularize its products

                           sold under the aforesaid trademark and has expended substanital sums of
                          money on sales promotion, advertisement and publicity. Due to superior
                          quality and high efficacy of its goods under the trademark PEBBLE,
                          continuous and extensive use and large sales, Plaintiff has acquired immense
                          reputation and goodwill in the mark and the goods sold thereunder.
                          Consequently, members of the trade and public exclusively associate the
                          trademark with the Plaintiff and with none else. Statement of sales under the
                          trademark PEBBLE reflecting sales turnover till the year 2020-21 has been
                          placed on record.

                          exclusive use and painstaking quality control, Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark PEBBLE
                          has acquired enviable goodwill and reputation such that it has acquired the
                          status of a well-known mark under <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_2">Section 2(1)(zb)</a> of the Act, which

                          form of infringement, misappropriation and dilution of distinctiveness,
                          irrespective of whatever goods or business it is used for. Thus, Plaintiff has
                          the exclusive right to use the trademark which ought to be protected against
                          imitation, confusion, deception, dilution and unfair competition by
                          competitors in the trade.

                          intellectual property rights against misuse by third parties and was granted
                          ex parte ad interim injunction in a suit being CS (COMM) 225/2021, with

                           has no objection and the grievance of the Plaintiff is limited to the
                          Defendant dealing in &#x27;electric iron&#x27; under the impugned mark PEBBLE,
                          which is phonetically, structurally and visually identical/deceptively similar

                          to Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark/label            . It is the case of the Plaintiff that
                          in the first week of January, 2021, Plaintiff came across the impugned
                          product, &#x27;electric iron&#x27;, sold on Defendant&#x27;s interactive website, namely
                          https://www.crompton.co.in/ and Defendant also published brochures and
                          uploaded images of the product bearing the impugned mark on its website.
                          Further enquiries revealed that the product bearing the impugned mark is
                          also available on third party e-commerce websites like, Amazon and Flipkart
                          and the images reflect the word &#x27;PEBBLE&#x27; prominently.
</p><p id="p_10">                          8.    Plaintiff sent a legal notice on 21.01.2021 to the Defendant to
                          discontinue the use of the impugned mark. Defendant, however, responded
                          by stating that there shall be no confusion amongst the public as the
                          Defendant was using CROMPTON PEBBLE and not PEBBLE for selling
                          dry irons, which were not being sold by the Plaintiff. Defendant also stated
                          that Plaintiff&#x27;s mark was registered with respect to goods falling under
                          Class 11 while the Defendant was selling dry irons falling under Class 7 and
                          had a registration for the mark.

                                         , which is registered for goods being inter alia water heaters,

                          heating coils etc. falling in Class 11. The word &#x27;PEBBLE&#x27; is the essential

                          the electrical goods falling in the said Class. Adoption and use of the
                          impugned mark by the Defendant with respect to similar goods i.e electric
                          irons, is likely to cause confusion and deception.

                          same trade channels; (4) are purchased by same class of consumers; and
                          (5) convert electric energy to heat energy. Thus, the goods are related and

                          violating the statutory rights of the Plaintiff and its action amounts to
                          infringement under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_5">Section 29</a> of the Act.

                           sales of the Plaintiff amounting to Rs.42.14 Crores in the year 2018-19 and
                          Rs.36.13 Crores in the year 2019-20. Sale of electric irons by the Defendant
                          under the impugned mark PEBBLE is a clear misrepresentation by the
                          Defendant to the public at large that the source/origin of the electric irons is
                          from the Plaintiff and/or there exists a trade connection or association
                          between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Defendant&#x27;s acts are calculated to
                          deceive the consumers and the adoption of the impugned mark is clearly
                          dishonest and with a view to encash on the goodwill and reputation of the
                          Plaintiff. This is adversely affecting the Plaintiff&#x27;s image and reputation in
                          the market and the Defendant is guilty of passing off.
</p><p id="p_16">                          13.   Irreparable harm is being caused to the Plaintiff due to passing off and
                          unfair competition by the Defendant, besides monetary losses on account of
                          dilution of its registered trademark. A consumer buying the Defendant&#x27;s
                          product presuming it to be a product originating from the Plaintiff shall
                          expect the same high standards that the Plaintiff has strived to achieve over
                          the years. Plaintiff would lose the trust and goodwill of its loyal customer
                          base if the quality control is diluted by the Defendant and this would be an
                          irreversible damage.

                          under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_7">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act is clearly made out, as all the ingredients are

                          suit was filed in February, 2022 and Plaintiff had averred in the plaint that


                          the Defendant&#x27;s mark              was registered on 23.07.2021 in Class 8, in
                          respect of &#x27;electric irons&#x27;, claiming user from 17.10.2020. However,

                          predicated on registration of its mark, however, on account of the aforesaid
                          development, the contention urged with respect to the registration and the

                          mark with respect to &#x27;electric irons&#x27;, falling in Class 8. Plaintiff&#x27;s application
                          for registration with respect to electric irons is pending before the Registrar.
                          Even assuming that the registration of the Plaintiff covers electric irons,
                          even then <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_12">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act bars the Plaintiff from initiating
                          proceedings for infringement against the Defendant, who is a registered
                          proprietor of its mark. Extensive arguments were also addressed on the issue
                          as to whether registration of the Defendant with respect to &#x27;electric irons&#x27;
                          was correctly granted in Class 8 and several documents were relied upon by
                          the Defendant to justify the classification in Class 8 based on Nice
                          Classification System. Plaintiff&#x27;s counsel had laboured hard to demonstrate
                          that the registration was in a wrong class.
</p><p id="p_21">                          17.   It bears repetition to state that registration of the Defendant&#x27;s mark
                          stands suspended and thus, the aforesaid contentions of the Defendant
                          premised on registration, need not detain the Court any further, as they are
                          no longer relevant for adjudication of the lis between the parties.

</p><p id="p_22">                          18.   Plaintiff has obtained registration in the trademark/label
                          in Class 11, which is evident from the certificate of registration. Plaintiff has
                          separately applied for registration of the word mark PEBBLE, however, the
                          application is pending. Thus, at this stage, Plaintiff cannot assert a statutory
                          right in the word PEBBLE and consequently, cannot allege infringement
                          against the Defendant for adopting and using the word PEBBLE as a part of
                          its trademark &#x27;CROMPTON PEBBLE&#x27;. In law, registration of a composite/
                          label mark confers exclusive right to its use as a whole and not to its
                          constituent parts separately.

                          the veracity of which can only be tested during the trial, the only material
                          produced by the Plaintiff are two online news articles stating that Plaintiff
                          has introduced PEBBLE series of &#x27;water heaters&#x27;. No sales figures, certified
                          by the Chartered Accountant, have been placed on record by the Plaintiff.
                          Moreover, mark of the Plaintiff has neither been declared as a well-known
                          mark by any Court of law nor is it listed in the list of well-known
                          trademarks by the Trade Marks Registry. Since the mark of the Plaintiff is
                          not a well-known mark, in order to establish infringement, Plaintiff would
                          be required to satisfy the triple test, i.e. identity/deceptive similarity of
                          trademarks in relation to identical/similar goods and common trade

                          CROMPTON along with the word PEBBLE, which acts as a source
                          identifier of its products. The word CROMPTON is the prominent part of
                          the mark of the defendant. The goods in question are also dissimilar
                          inasmuch as water heaters of the Plaintiff are used for heating water while
                          the electric irons of the Defendant are used for ironing. Apart from different
                          usage, goods manufactured and marketed by the Plaintiff traverse through
                          completely divergent trade channels and cater to a different consumer base
                          and thus there is no scope of confusion or deception on account of
                          co-existence of the marks, judged from the perspective of a man of average
                          intelligence with imperfect recollection.

                           as aforementioned, in view of the suspension of the said registration, the
                          entire edifice of the Defendant&#x27;s case founded on registration falls and,
                          therefore, the Defendant cannot claim any statutory right flowing from the
                          earlier registration of the trademark.
</p><p id="p_35">                          27.   In order to deal with the allegation of infringement, the first question
                          that begs an answer is whether the competing trademarks are identical/
                          deceptively similar or not. However, before entering into the said aspect, it
                          is crucial to deal with the contention of the Defendant that the Plaintiff has

                          registration in the label/device mark             , which is neither identical

                          nor deceptively similar to the impugned mark PEBBLE and Plaintiff cannot
                          claim infringement of the word mark PEBBLE. This contention, in my
                          view, only merits rejection. In this context, useful would it be to refer to a
                          judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/94612663/" id="a_20">United Biotech Pvt. Ltd. v.

                          In the said case, Appellant had obtained registration of the trademark
                          &quot;FORZID&quot; in Class 5 and questioning the registration, Respondent filed
                          application for removal of the mark on the ground that the said trademark
                          was deceptively similar to an earlier registered trademark &#x27;ORZID&#x27; (label
                          mark), registered in the name of Respondent No.1 in Class 5. IPAB
                          (Intellectual Property Appellate Board) allowed the rectification application
                          with direction to the Registrar of the Trade Marks to remove the trademark
                          &#x27;FORZID&#x27; from the Register. Learned Single Judge dismissed the writ
                          petition laying a challenge to the said order and the Appellant filed an
                          intra-court Appeal. The primordial argument of the Appellant was that
                          Respondents&#x27; assertion of statutory right in the word &quot;ORZID&quot; (per se) was
                          contrary to the mandate of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_21">Section 17</a> of the Act, which gives exclusive right

                           to a registered proprietor to use the trademark as a whole and not in part,
                          which the Respondents were trying to assert. Relying on the dicta of the
                          Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_22">Ramdev Food Products Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai
                          Patel</a> AIR 2006 SC 3304, more particularly paras 82 to 84 thereof, the
                          Division Bench held that though ORZID was a label mark, the word
                          &#x27;ORZID&#x27; contained therein was also worthy of protection. Para 26 from the
                          judgment in United Biotech (supra) is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                &quot;26. We find that the learned Single Judge rightly held that
                                when a label mark is registered, it cannot be said that the word
                                mark contained therein is not registered. We, thus, are of the
                                opinion that although the word &quot;ORZID&quot; is a label mark, the
                                word &quot;ORZID&quot; contained therein is also worthy of protection.
                                The learned Single Judge has rightly observed that the
                                judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramdev Food Products
                                Ltd. (supra) is the complete answer. This aspect is considered
                                and the argument of the appellant is rejected in the following
                                words:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                       &quot;27. On whether the OCPL could successfully ask for
                                       rectification for UBPL&#x27;s word mark FORZID
                                       notwithstanding that OCPL held registration only for a
                                       label mark, the judgment of the Supreme Court
                                       in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_23">Ramdev Food Products Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai
                                       Patel</a>, (2006) 8 SCC 726 : AIR 2006 SC 3304 is a
                                       complete answer. The Court there referred to an earlier
                                       decision in <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_24">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra
                                       Rakhit</a>, AIR 1955 SC 558, which concerned the
                                       proprietory mark &#x27;Shree&#x27; which formed part of the device
                                       as a whole and was an important feature of the device.
                                       The Supreme Court observed that registration of a trade
                                       mark as a whole would give the proprietor &quot;a right to the
                                       exclusive use of word &#x27;Shree&#x27; as if separately and by
                                       itself.&quot; Therefore it would not be correct for UBPL to
                                       contend that the registration held by OCPL does not
                                       cover the word mark ORZID.&quot;&quot;

                          Ramdev Food Products Ltd. (supra) that the test for infringement of a
                          label/word mark is a test of prominent word of the mark and thus, adoption
                          by a Defendant of a prominent word in the label/device mark of the Plaintiff
                          in a given case, amounts to infringement.
</p><p id="p_37">                          29.   Coming to the present case, the word PEBBLE, in my view, is an
                          essential and the dominant part of Plaintiff&#x27;s registered label mark

                                      . Tested on the touchstone of the aforementioned precedents,
                          Defendant cannot be permitted to argue that Plaintiff cannot assert a right
                          for exclusive use on the word PEBBLE on the basis of registration in the
                          label/device, pending registration in the word PEBBLE per se.
</p><p id="p_38">                          30.   The next issue that now arises for consideration is to examine the
                          identity/similarity of the competing marks. The tests to determine the
                          similarity have been laid down in several judgments but to avoid burdening
                          this judgment, I may only refer to a passage from FDC Limited (supra),
                          wherein the determining factors were elucidated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                &quot;57. The degree of similarity between the marks concerned

                                similarity. Apart from the visual and phonetic similarity,
                                factors like class of users, distinctive character of the
                                registered trademark, imperfect recollection of the average
                                consumer, and overall impression of the mark are considered

                                        &quot;In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
                                       doubt, make out that use of the defendant&#x27;s mark is likely
                                       to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                       and the defendant&#x27;s mark is so close either visually,
                                       phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the
                                       conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence
                                       is required to establish that the plaintiff&#x27;s rights are
                                       violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential
                                       features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
                                       adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,
                                       packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on
                                       the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show
                                       marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
                                       different from that of the registered proprietor of the
                                       mark would be immaterial;....&quot;
</p><p id="p_40">                                                                             [emphasis supplied]
</p><p id="p_41">                          31.   The impugned mark PEBBLE, in my prima facie view, is
                          phonetically, visually and structurally identical to the dominant part of the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark, i.e. PEBBLE and thus, no further inquiry is
                          necessitated to assess &#x27;similarity&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_42">                          32.   At this stage, it is important to deal with the contention of the
                          Defendant that a trademark is a source indicator and the word CROMPTON
                          is a source identifier of its product and thus seen in this light, use of the
                          impugned mark PEBBLE shall not create any confusion in the minds of the
                          consumers. In my view, this stand of the Defendant cannot be accepted. It is
                          a settled law that a trademark, in order to be a source indicator, must either
                          be distinctive or where the word mark is descriptive or generic, it should
                          have acquired a secondary meaning, such that the consumers associate
                          the mark with the proprietor of that mark and none else and this can
                          be established by showing its continuous and extensive use in relation to
                          the goods, substantial sales turnover etc. In the present case, Defendant has
                          only averred in the reply to the present application that the word

                           CROMPTON is a source identifier. There are no pleadings showing its
                          extensive user, sales turnover etc. with respect to electric irons sold under
                          the mark CROMPTON PEBBLE and be it noted that the user is claimed
                          only from the year 2020. Additionally, Plaintiff has filed screenshots of
                          Defendant&#x27;s product as listed on an interactive website of the Defendant
                          https://www.crompton.co.in, which reflects the usage of the mark of the
                          word CROMPTON along with the word PEBBLE and it cannot be said that
                          CROMPTON is a source identifier. Moreover, in view of the suspension of
                          the registration of the Defendant&#x27;s mark, this argument even otherwise does
                          not hold water, as against a registered proprietor of the mark, in the absence
                          of a claim of user prior to the registration/user of the Plaintiff etc. For ready
                          reference, the screenshots are placed below:

</p><p id="p_44">                           33.   Relevant would it be in this regard to note that Defendant has, in its
                          reply to the present application, itself relied on an image to depict the usage
                          of the mark PEBBLE along with the word CROMPTON. Image from the
                          reply of the Defendant to the present application is scanned and placed
                          below for ready reference:
</p>



<p id="p_45">                                It is pertinent to mention that it is a common case of the parties that
                          the Defendant is selling its electric irons on its interactive website as well as
                          third party e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc. The above
                          image, as reflected on the Defendant&#x27;s website, in fact, supports the case of
                          the Plaintiff and makes a dent in the argument of the Defendant that the use
                          of the house mark CROMPTON is a source indicator and associates the
                          electric irons with the Defendant, when a customer accesses the website.
                          Secondly, the use of the impugned mark PEBBLE by the Defendant
                          amounts to sub-branding, in my prima facie view. It is a settled law that the
                          <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_28">Trade Marks Act</a> does not recognize the concept of sub-branding. In this
                          regard, I may usefully allude to a judgment of the Bombay High Court in
                          <a href="/doc/153606302/" id="a_29">Hem Corporation Pvt. Ltd. v. ITC Limited</a>, 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 551,

                                in a stylized manner within the device of a rectangle with red
                                borders. To the right of the rectangle is the word &quot;MADHUR
                                100&quot; written in red letters within a horizontal oval device with
                                a white background. The letters in the word &quot;MADHUR&quot; are
                                indeed much smaller than the letters in the word
                                &quot;MANGALDEEP&quot;. The word &quot;MANGALDEEP&quot; is more
                                prominent than the mark &quot;MADHUR 100&quot;. That, however, to
                                my mind, makes no difference for the mark &quot;MADHUR 100&quot;
                                appears as a part of a composite mark &quot;MANGALDEEP
                                Madhur 100&quot; and not as merely a term descriptive of the
                                products sold under the mark &quot;MANGAL DEEP&quot;. The
                                placement of the word &quot;MADHUR 100&quot; right next to the word
                                &quot;MANGALDEEP&quot; enhances the possibility of the consumer
                                considering the mark to be &quot;MANGALDEEP Madhur 100&quot; and
                                not &quot;MANGALDEEP&quot; alone.

                                descriptive sub-brands such as &quot;MOGRA&quot;, &quot;JASMINE&quot;,

                                &quot;MADHUR 100&quot; and that the descriptors are used to signify
                                the quality and characteristics of the products and are used
                                only    in    conjunction    with     the   umbrella   brand

                                would make no difference if the use of the mark is likely to be

                                       connection in the course of trade between the goods or
                                       services, as the case may be, and some person having the

                                       use the mark whether with or without any indication of

                                only factor that constitutes infringement. A registered
                                trademark is infringed by a person if he uses it in such a
                                manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as a
                                trademark. In other words the use of a registered trademark
                                would constitute an infringement if it indicates a connection in
                                the course of trade between the person and his goods or
                                services irrespective of his intention. This is clear from the

</p><p id="p_57">                                 26. I have already come to the conclusion that the use of the
                                mark by the defendant is as a trademark and not merely as
                                descriptive of the product.
</p><p id="p_58">                                27. I also find well founded Dr. Tulzapurkar&#x27;s submission
                                that the defendant, in fact, intended using the word
                                &quot;MADHUR&quot; as a trademark and not merely to describe its
                                products. Dr. Tulzapurkar rightly prefaced his reference to the
                                various factors with the comment that although each of these
                                factors taken by themselves may not support his submission,
                                taken together they do.

</p><p id="p_60">                                38. The test is not whether a person terms the use of a mark
                                as a brand name or a sub-brand. If the use of a mark is to
                                distinguish or is capable of distinguishing the goods or
                                services of a person, it is a trademark amenable to the
                                provisions of the Act. That, it is a sub-brand makes no
                                difference. A view to the contrary would virtually erode, not
                                merely the value of trademarks, but their very existence by the
                                simple expedient of an infringer adding to his &quot;main brand&quot;
                                any embellishment constituting it then as a &quot;sub-brand&quot;. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_35">The
                                Act</a> knows no such thing as a sub-brand.&quot;

                          between the Plaintiff&#x27;s goods, i.e. &#x27;water heaters&#x27; and the goods of the
                          Defendant, i.e. &#x27;electric irons&#x27;. While the contention of the Plaintiff is that
                          the goods sold by the respective parties are similar, the contention of the
                          Defendant per contra is that the goods are dissimilar.

                          facie view, learned counsel for the Plaintiff is not correct in his submission.
                          In the present case, it cannot be disputed that the competing goods are not
                          identical and at the highest, the argument of the Plaintiff can be that the
                          goods are similar. In order to assess the similarity of goods in question, I
                          may refer to the judgment in <a href="/doc/98128532/" id="a_36">Assam Roofing Ltd. v. JSB Cement LLP</a>, 2015

                          test of similarity of goods is to be looked at from a business and commercial
                          point of view. The nature and composition of the goods, respective uses of
                          the articles and the trade channels through which they are bought and sold
                          all go into consideration in this context. Relevant would it be in this context,
                          to refer to a passage from Kerly&#x27;s Law which is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                &quot;As para.23 of the decision in Canon v. MQM (1999) R.P.C.
                                117 makes clear, all factors relating to the goods or services
                                themselves must be taken into account. These include, inter
                                alia, their nature, their intended purpose, their method of use
                                and whether they are in competition with each other or are
                                complementary. It is clear that goods in different classes may
                                nevertheless be considered similar, and likewise that goods or
                                services within the same class may be found to not be similar.&quot;

                          context of similarity of goods is the trade connection between the goods of
                          the Plaintiff and that of the infringer. To avoid prolixity, I may only refer to
                          the relevant passage from the judgment in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_38">Corn Products Refining Co. v.

                                are unable to accept this contention. It is true that we have to
                                proceed on the basis that the goods are not of the same
                                description for the purposes of <a href="/doc/707980/" id="a_39">Section 10(1)</a> of the Act. But
                                there is evidence that glucose is used in the manufacture of
                                biscuits. That would establish a trade connection between the
                                two commodities, namely, glucose manufactured by the
                                appellant and the biscuits produced by the respondent. An
                                average purchaser would therefore be likely to think that the
                                respondent&#x27;s &#x27;Gluvita biscuits&#x27; were made with the appellant&#x27;s
                                &#x27;Glucovita&#x27; glucose. This was the kind of trade connection
                                between different goods which in the &quot;Black Magic&quot; case (In
                                re: an application by Edward Hack [58 RPC 91]) was taken
                                into consideration in arriving at the conclusion that there was
                                likelihood of confusion or deception. The goods in this case
                                were chocolates and laxatives and it was proved that laxatives
                                were often made with chocolate coatings. We may also refer to
                                the &quot;Panda&quot; case (In re: an application by Ladislas
                                Jellinek [63 RPC 59]). The goods there concerned were shoes
                                and shoe polishes. It was observed that shoe polishes being
                                used for shoes, there was trade connection between them and
                                that this might lead to confusion or deception though the goods
                                were different. The application for registration was however
                                refused under that section of the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_40">English Act</a> which corresponds
                                to <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_41">Section 8</a> of our Act on the ground that the opponents, the

                                 the case here. But that in our opinion makes no difference. The
                                absolute identity of the two competing marks or their close
                                resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the
                                question of likelihood of deception or confusion. Trade
                                connection between different goods is another such test.
                                Ex hypothesi, this latter test applies only when the goods are
                                different. These tests are independent tests. There is no reason
                                why the test of trade connection between different goods should
                                not apply where the competing marks closely resemble each
                                other just as much as it applies, as held in the &quot;Black Magic&quot;
                                and &quot;Panda&quot; cases, where the competing marks were identical.
                                Whether by applying these tests in a particular case the
                                conclusion that there is likelihood of deception or confusion
                                should be arrived at would depend on all the facts of the case.
</p><p id="p_68">                                22. It is then said that biscuits containing glucose are
                                manufactured with liquid glucose whereas the appellant&#x27;s mark
                                only concerns powder glucose. We will assume that only liquid
                                glucose is used in the manufacture of biscuits with glucose. But
                                there is nothing to show that an average buyer knows with what
                                kind of glucose, biscuits containing glucose are or can be
                                made. That there is trade connection between glucose and
                                biscuits and a likelihood of confusion or deception arising
                                therefrom would appear from the fact stated by the appellant
                                that it received from a tradesman an enquiry for biscuits
                                manufactured by it under its mark &#x27;Glucovita&#x27;. The tradesman
                                making the enquiry apparently thought that the manufacturer of
                                &#x27;Glucovita&#x27; glucose was likely to manufacture biscuits with
                                glucose; he did not worry whether biscuits were made with
                                powder or liquid glucose. Then again it is stated in one of the
                                affidavits filed by the appellant that the respondent&#x27;s director
                                told the appellant&#x27;s manager that the respondent had adopted
                                the name &#x27;Gluvita&#x27; to indicate that in the manufacture of its
                                biscuits glucose was used. Those statements on behalf of the
                                appellant are not denied by the respondent. So, a trade
                                connection between glucose and biscuits would appear to be
                                established. We are therefore of opinion that the commodities
                                concerned in the present case are so connected as to make
                                confusion or deception likely in view of the similarity of the two
                                trade marks. We think that the decision of Desai, J., was right.&quot;

                          judicial precedents, as aforementioned, in my prima facie view, the goods of
                          the Plaintiff and the Defendant cannot be held to be similar. Water heaters
                          and electric irons are dissimilar in their physical nature, their intended
                          purpose and their method of use. The two products also fail the tests of
                          being competing products, of being complementary to each other or of
                          having a trade connection with each other. With respect to trade channels,
                          the case set out in the plaint is that the electric irons are sold by the
                          Defendant on its interactive website as well as on third party e-commerce
                          platforms and in my prima facie view, Plaintiff has been unable to establish
                          that the trade channels of the two products are common. The argument in
                          support of similarity, that the competing goods are meant for domestic use
                          and convert electric energy into heat energy, cannot be an apt criteria. If this
                          argument is to be accepted, then goods as dissimilar as electric room heaters
                          and electric kettles, would also be similar goods, which would be over-
                          stretching the criteria laid down to determine the similarity of goods.

                          and the Defendant, the next question that needs deliberation is if the Plaintiff
                          has made out a case of infringement against the Defendant. Plain reading of
                          <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_42">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act shows that the recurring theme in each of the
                          sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) is similarity/identity in goods/services. In
                          absence of the condition of similarity of goods being satisfied, Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          claim of infringement under the provisions of <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_43">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act

                          necessary for constituting infringement are viz. (a) the impugned mark is
                          identical with or similar to the registered trademark; (b) it is used in relation
                          to goods or services different from those in respect of which the trademark is

                          the Plaintiff&#x27;s registered mark/label            . Thus, the first ingredient of
                          the <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_47">Section 29(4)</a> stands satisfied.
</p><p id="p_75">                          43.   The next requirement of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_48">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act is that the impugned
                          mark PEBBLE must be used in relation to goods and services which are not
                          similar to those for which the trademark is registered. The impugned mark
                          PEBBLE is admittedly used by the Defendant in respect of electric irons,

                          part of the judgment that electric irons and water heaters are not similar
                          goods and in view thereof, the second requirement envisaged in <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_49">Section

                          infringement as the other conditions, which are conjunctive, are also
                          required to be met.

                          and different from <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_51">Section 29(1)</a> to (3) of the Act, inasmuch as the element
                          or the requirement to establish the likelihood of confusion is absent. As held

                          Suneel Kumar Rajput &amp; Anr</a>., 2013 (56) PTC 116 [Del], in order to balance
                          this element, Legislature has mandated the necessity of showing that the

                          distinctive character such that its use by the infringer is without due cause.
                          The legislative intent is to afford stronger protection to a mark with
                          reputation without the registered proprietor of such a mark having to
                          demonstrate the likelihood of confusion from the use of the similar mark in

                          been selling water heaters under the trademark                     since the year
                          2013 and the tabular presentation of sales turnover brought out in the plaint
                          reflects robust sales over the years. As observed in Bloomberg(supra), at the
                          interim stage, &#x27;reputation&#x27; is required to be shown prima facie to exist and
                          whether in fact it exists, would depend upon the evidence led by the parties
                          at the trial. Sales figures, amounts expended on promotion, advertisement
                          and publicity of the goods by the Plaintiff bearing the aforesaid mark, its
                          continuous and extensive use, number of outlets/dealers for sale of the
                          products, as brought forth in the plaint, reflect that the Plaintiff has built a
                          strong reputation and the trademark of the Plaintiff has become a house-hold
                          name across India qua its product, i.e. water heaters. Thus, the Plaintiff has
                          established a prima facie case of existence of its reputation in India.

                           electric irons. The consistent stand of the Defendant in its reply is that
                          Defendant has always prefixed the mark PEBBLE with its house mark
                          &quot;CROMPTON&quot; which acts as a source identifier of its products. Plaintiff
                          has been using the registered mark/label with the dominant part being the
                          word PEBBLE since 2013 and there have been advertisements and
                          promotions by the Plaintiff, both online and offline. Defendant cannot feign
                          ignorance of the mark of the Plaintiff. It is significant to note that there is no
                          plausible explanation disclosed in the reply filed by the Defendant as to why
                          the word PEBBLE has been adopted by the Defendant albeit with a prefix
                          CROMPTON, save and except stating that the word PEBBLE has a
                          dictionary meaning and although not descriptive, fits appropriately with the
                          product, &#x27;electric iron&#x27; that the Defendant sells and hence, the use of the
                          mark by the Defendant is bona fide. It needs no gainsaying that the word
                          PEBBLE is not descriptive of electric irons and is an arbitrary word used by
                          the Plaintiff for water heaters, entitling it to a high degree of protection. In
                          the absence of any explanation or justification for using the word PEBBLE,
                          the prima facie inference that can be drawn is that Defendant adopted its
                          mark to gain unfair advantage of the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff
                          and the adoption is without due cause. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff is
                          prima facie right in his submission that the use of the essential part of the
                          trademark of the Plaintiff by the Defendant, is without due cause and is
                          resultantly having a detrimental impact on the distinctive character of the

                          Plaintiff has prima facie established the ingredients of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_64">Section 29(4)</a> of the
                          Act and thus, for the aforementioned reasons, this Court is of the view that
                          prima facie case of infringement has been made out against the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_83">                          50.   Next plank of the argument of the learned counsel for the Plaintiff
                          was that the actions of the Defendant amount to passing off the goods of the
                          Plaintiff. It is a settled position in law that while infringement is a statutory
                          remedy, passing off is a common law remedy, which grants a right of
                          protection of goodwill in the business against misrepresentation caused by
                          the Defendant in the course of trade and prevention of consequent loss on
                          account of misrepresentation. The entire basis or edifice of passing off is
                          that no one has a right to represent his goods or services as those of someone
                          else and the Courts would come to the aid and restrain the misrepresentation,
                          even though it may not be fraudulent. The essential characteristics/elements
                          of the action of passing off have been brought out by Lord Diplock in <a href="/doc/188154817/" id="a_65">Erven
                          Warnink BV v. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd</a>., [1979] 2 All ER 927 and it
                          would be apposite to refer to them:

                                of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to
                                injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense
                                that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence), and (5)
                                which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the

                          AIR 1985 ALL 242, where the Court was dealing with a case where the
                          Plaintiff was manufacturing shoes while the Defendant was producing goods
                          like foam and similar products. Rejecting the argument that there was no
                          possibility of any deception on purchase of foam in the market, the Court
                          observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">                                &quot;36. Great emphasis was laid by the learned counsel for the
                                respondents on the underlined portion to say that there should
                                be some similarity or correlationship between the two products.
                                This argument is supplemented by another argument that the
                                plaintiff was not producing any goods like foam or analogous
                                product. Consequently, there was no question of any deception
                                being practised on the purchaser of foam materials in the
                                market. This argument loses sight of an important feature viz.,
                                how would a lay customer know in the first place that the
                                plaintiff was not producing foam or foam material? How would
                                the customers know that Bata were not producing foam? It is
                                well known that the name represented makers of shoes and
                                analogous products, but a question would also arise in the mind
                                of the lay customers whether Bata were also producing foam.
                                Who is going to answer this question? Does an ordinary
                                customer ask the seller as to whose product it is? The answer
                                generally is in the negative. He buys a thing on the basis of his
                                own impression.</blockquote>

                                the view taken by the Calcutta High Court. Merely because the
                                plaintiff in the present case is not producing foam is not enough
                                to hold that there can be no passing off action in respect of the
                                user of the name &#x27;Bata&#x27; to the products marketed by the
                                defendants. The user of the name or mark &#x27;Bata&#x27; by the

                                in a competitive market. As seen earlier, there is no plausible
                                explanation as to why the name &#x27;Bata&#x27; was being used by them.
                                A passing off action would lie even if the defendants were not
                                manufacturing or producing any goods similar to that of the
                                plaintiff. A passing off action would lie where a
                                misrepresentation is likely to be caused or a wrong impression
                                created, as if the product was of someone else.&quot;

                                 parties to the state of mind of public in deciding whether it will
                                be confused.
</p><p id="p_89">                                14. In the case of trading name which has become almost a
                                household word and under which trading name a variety of
                                activities are undertaken, a passing off can successfully lie if
                                the defendant has adopted identical or similar trading name
                                and even when the defendant does not carry on similar activity.
                                Even if the defendant&#x27;s activities in such circumstances, are
                                remote, the same are likely to be presumed a possible extension
                                of plaintiff&#x27;s business or activities.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_90">                          54.   The law on passing off, as can be seen from the aforesaid judgments
                          including several other judicial precedents, does not envision that the goods
                          in question should be similar. Where the Defendant uses the mark
                          deceptively similar to that of the Plaintiff and there is misrepresentation,
                          passing off may arise, even though the goods may not be the same or
                          similar. An important ingredient or element in an action for passing off is
                          &#x27;misrepresentation&#x27;. Therefore, if the Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case
                          of misrepresentation by the Defendant, in the course of its trade, which is
                          likely to injure the goodwill of the Plaintiff and has a detrimental effect on
                          its business, an interim injunction should follow. In case the Defendant is
                          permitted to continue selling its goods, misrepresenting them to be those of
                          the Plaintiff, not only would it be unfair to the Plaintiff but it shall also
                          adversely impact the consumers who are being deceived on account of
                          misrepresentation by the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_91">                          55.   In the context of passing off, once again a crucial question arises as to
                          why and with what intent the Defendant adopted the word PEBBLE as a part
                          of its mark and the answer in my prima facie view could only be to confuse
                          an unwary purchaser and create an impression that the purchaser is buying
                          the goods of the Plaintiff. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff rightly contended

                           that in the absence of any plausible reason for the Defendant to adopt the
                          word PEBBLE, the only inference that can be drawn is that the intent was to
                          pass off its goods as those of the Plaintiff. Defendant, as claimed in the
                          reply, has an enviable and formidable reputation and does not need to ride
                          over the goodwill of the Plaintiff. If that be so, it intrigues the Court as to
                          why the Defendant adopted the word PEBBLE in addition to its house mark
                          CROMPTON. In this context, I may refer to a few lines from the passage in
                          the case of <a href="/doc/597646/" id="a_68">Thomas Bear and Sons (India) Ltd. v. Prayag Narain</a>, (1941)
                          58 RPC 25, wherein Lord Langdale observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                                &quot;A man is not to sell his own goods under the pretence that they
                                are the goods of another man; he cannot be permitted to
                                practise such a deception nor to use the means which
                                contribute to that end. He cannot, therefore, be allowed to use
                                names, marks, letters or other indicia, by which he may induce
                                purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the
                                manufacture of another person.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_92">                          56.   The word PEBBLE, which is an essential part of the Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          trademark/label, is phonetically and visually identical to the word PEBBLE
                          in the Defendant&#x27;s mark. A customer may not know about all the products
                          manufactured and sold by the Plaintiff and the use of the word PEBBLE
                          would be sufficient to cause confusion resulting in the goods of the
                          Defendant being passed off as that of the Plaintiff. <a href="/doc/125822018/" id="a_69">In Laxmikant V. Patel</a> v.
                          Chetanbhat Shah, (2002) 3 SCC 65, the Supreme Court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">                                &quot;10. The law does not permit any one to carry on his business

                                believing that his goods or services belonging to someone else
                                are his or are associated therewith. It does not matter whether

                                are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the
                                basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a person

<p id="p_93">                          57.     Applying the aforestated principles to the facts of the present case, the
                          use of the mark by the Defendant in respect of the impugned product,
                          though dissimilar, is likely to cause confusion in the minds of consumers
                          that the products of the Defendant are those of the Plaintiff. Plaintiff has a
                          reputation in respect of its goods and if the goods of the Defendant are
                          passed off as that of the Plaintiff, the damage caused would be irreparable.

                          Nandhini Deluxe (supra). The judgment, in my view, does not apply to the
                          present case. The Supreme Court recapitulated the undisputed facts viz.:
</p><p id="p_95">                          (a) Nandini/Nandhini is a generic name; (b) it represents the name of
                          Goddess, worshipped in India in Hindu Mythology; (c) it is not an inventive
                          or coined word of the Respondent; and (d) is descriptive for milk, which was
                          the product of the Respondent. In the present case, the word PEBBLE is
                          distinctive and arbitrary for the water heaters sold by the Plaintiff and
                          Plaintiff is admittedly prior user of the trademark/label, with the word
                          PEBBLE being its essential and dominant part. It is not descriptive of the
                          products of the Plaintiff and therefore unlike in the cited case, there is prima
                          facie no justification by the Defendant for use of the word PEBBLE in its
                          mark.

                          using the mark PEBBLE for electric goods or that it is common to the trade.
                          The judgment, therefore, does not help the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_97">                          60.   In Vardhman Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Respondent was the
                          proprietor of the label/mark &#x27;VARDHMAN PLAZAS&#x27; and was claiming
                          exclusivity in respect of the word &#x27;VARDHMAN&#x27;, which is quite different
                          from the present case where the label/mark of the Plaintiff being

                                       comprises of the word PEBBLE as its essential and dominant
                          part. Moreover, the word VARDHMAN was found to be not only common
                          to the trade in question but also to several other businesses, which is not the
                          case here. In Max Healthcare (supra), the test for infringement of a
                          label/mark is a test of prominent word of the mark.
</p><p id="p_98">                          61.   In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma (Supra), the Appellant had
                          applied for registration of the words &#x27;NAVARATNA KALPA&#x27; for his
                          medicinal preparations. Respondent Firm therein, had opposed the
                          application for registration on the ground that the word &#x27;NAVARATNA&#x27;
                          was descriptive and could not be registered as it had no distinctiveness. The
                          objection prevailed and the registration was refused. The Supreme Court
                          held that for an action of infringement, Plaintiff must no doubt establish that
                          the use of the Defendant&#x27;s mark is likely to deceive, but in situations
                          wherein the similarity between Plaintiff&#x27;s and Defendant&#x27;s mark is so close
                          that the court reaches a conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
                          evidence is required to ascertain that the Plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated. This
                          Court has returned prima facie finding in earlier part of the judgment that
                          the impugned mark is identical to the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark PEBBLE and

                           therefore, in my view, the judgment is in favour of the Plaintiff and against
                          the arguments put forth by the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_99">                          62.      For all the aforesaid reasons, this Court is of the view that the Plaintiff
                          has made out a prima facie case of infringement as well as passing off. The
                          balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiff and against the
                          Defendant and in case the Defendant is allowed to use the impugned mark
                          PEBBLE, Plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury in its business with
                          respect to its trademark, goodwill and reputation. Another ground which tilts
                          the balance of convenience in favour of the Plaintiff is that the products of
                          the Defendant under its mark have been launched only in the year 2020
                          which is reflected from the user claim in the application for registration filed
                          before the Trade Marks Registry, and the sales are far and few.
</p><p id="p_100">                          63.      The application is accordingly allowed and the Defendant, its
                          Directors, assignees in business, licensees, franchisee, distributors and
                          dealers, are restrained from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale,
                          advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in electric irons under the
                          impugned mark PEBBLE or any other trade mark/trade name/domain name

                          as may be deceptively similar to the Plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark                           ,
                          amounting to infringement and passing off, during the pendency of the
                          present suit.
