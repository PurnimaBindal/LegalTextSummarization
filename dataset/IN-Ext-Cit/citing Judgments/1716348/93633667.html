                     of the present petitioners. The complaint in this case has been instituted

                     to browbeat the witnesses and prevent them from giving a fair testimony.

                     It is a case of malicious prosecution to force the petitioners from pursuing

                     the aforesaid case pending before Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Karnal and

                     get justice for the pain suffered by them. It is also stated that certain

                     persons   implicated in the present case are cited as witnesses in the

                     challan, report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_23">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. submitted before the Magistrate

                     in case FIR No.237 dated 1.4.2009. They being arrayed as accused here

                     clearly shows the intention of the respondent-complainant to stall the said

                     proceedings in relation to the FIR case. The FIR for the offences under

                     <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_24">Sections 498-A</a>, <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_25">406</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_26">323</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_27">506</a> IPC was registered against Jasdeep

                     Harpreet Singh Chhabra at the instance of Tajwant Singh (petitioner No.1

                     in Cr. Misc. No.M-38526 of 2012), wherein it is stated that the marriage

                     of Navneet Kaur (petitioner No.2 in Cr. Misc. No.M-38526 of 2012)

                     daughter of Tajwant Singh was solemnized on 15.9.2007. The offence

                     under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_28">Section 307</a> IPC was added during the course of investigation but

                     later on dropped. It is stated therein that marriage ceremonies and dinner

                     were organized at Jewel Hotel at Karnal and large number of dowry

                     articles were given and about `3 Crores was spent on the marriage. It is

                     also stated in the petition that Harjit Singh filed an application dated

                     18.5.2009 in the FIR case in the proceedings of anticipatory bail before

                     the Hon'ble High Court and stated that he is ready and willing to return

                     the gift items (dowry articles) received by them. As per the list appended

                     with the FIR, the value of the jewelry articles gifted by the complainant in

                     the FIR case is `1,32,67,000/-.       Hence, as the dowry articles were

                     admitted regarding jewellery, therefore, there is no question of false bills

                     having been prepared by Shree Ganesh Jewellers Limited (hereinafter

                     referred to as `the Company') or its employee or the petitioners. This

                     allegation is levelled only to harass the petitioners for pursuing their legal

                     rights. In the FIR, petitioner No.1 has stated that his daughter Navneet

                     Kaur was being given cocktail of medicines which was causing her to

                     slow-down mentally. Petitioner No.1 had relied on the prescription slip

                     dated 19.12.2008 in which the doctor (also an accused in the present

                     complaint) advised petitioner No.2 not to use Larpose. The doctor also

                     issued certificate dated 2.4.2009 wherein he opined that Larpose causes

                     addiction and if taken in excess may be dangerous to life. Statement of

                     the doctor has been recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_29">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. on 2.4.2009 and

                     opinion was obtained from an independent Board of Doctors of General

                     Hospital, Karnal, which opined that Larpose in a very high dose could be

                     dangerous to life. The offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_30">Section 307</a> IPC was added during

                     the investigation, but later on dropped by the Police. The challan under

                     <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_31">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. had been submitted in the Court of Judicial Magistrate

                     Ist Class, Karnal. It is stated that in the prescription slip erroneously the

                     date was put as 19.12.2008, whereas in fact, the actual date of the doctor

                     having checked Navneet Kaur (petitioner No.2) was 19.11.2008 and the

                     date 19.12.2008 had been written on account of mistake. In the said

                     prescription slip the doctor merely recommended that Larpose be stopped

                     argued that this complaint is counter-blast to the FIR case and the

                     allegation against petitioner Tajwant Singh is that he handed over these

                     contended that the doctor, who had given the prescription slip and

                     prescribed that this medicine may not be given, cannot be made accused.

                     If the date is given inadvertently as 19.12.2008 instead of 19.11.2008, he

                     cannot be made an accused. Otherwise, the doctor has also no where

                     petitioners also contended that the petitioners cannot be summoned under

                     <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_33">Sections 193</a>, <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_34">195</a> IPC as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_35">Section 195(1)(i)</a> Cr.P.C.

                     Leaned senior counsel for the petitioners also contended that there is no

                     evidence regarding forging of any document and there is no finding of the

                     Court at this stage that these documents are forged or these documents

                     have been falsely prepared to give during the investigation or criminal

                     conspiracy.

                     respondent argued that on the basis of opinion of the doctor, the offence

                     under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_36">Section 307</a> IPC was added, which was later on dropped. Learned

                     senior counsel for the respondent further argued that bills which were

                     issued by Shree Ganesh Jewellers Limited, are also forged one as these

                     bills are showing the amount of another bills above the bills on the papers,

                     which he states, shows forgery. Learned senior counsel for the respondent

                     not liable to be quashed and the present petitioners have committed the

                     offences. He also argued that the petition filed by Smt. Prem Kalra and

                     Smt. Mona Kalra should also be dismissed on the ground that they have

                     not disclosed that they are Director or Managing Director of the

<p id="p_13">                                 From the record, I find merit in the arguments of the learned

                     senior counsel for the petitioners. It is clear from the record that FIR has

                     been registered for the offences under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_37">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_38">498-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_39">323</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_40">506</a>

                     IPC and challan has already been presented. During investigation, the

                     print-outs of the computer copies of the bills are taken from the Shree

                     Ganesh Jewellers, from whom the jewellery was purchased and those

                     print-outs were signed by some official and given to the Police. It is an

                     admitted fact and as is clear from the documents that huge jewellery had

                     been given in dowry. Even the respondent had admitted that they have

                     received the gold ornaments and articles during the marriage. The mere

                     fact that on the carbon copies some amount of another bill had been

                     printed above the bills upon the printed paper itself, will not show that

                     these bills are forged one. The witnesses are to appear before the trial

                     Court during the trial and the respondent will get the opportunity to cross-

                     examine them and to get explanation regarding as to how these entries/

                     the computer copies or the amount nothing has been pointed out. There is

                     no allegation in the complaint as to who had forged that. How these bills

                     have been forged and, who had forged and fabricated these bills.

                     Petitioners Smt. Prem Kalra as well as Smt. Mona Kalra, as argued, are

                     the Director and Managing Director of the Company. They have no role

                     in issuing print-outs of the bills. There are no allegations against them

                     that they have falsely created or fabricated these bills specially in view of

                     the allegation that jewellery of more than worth `1 Crore has been given

                     and as per the fact that during the anticipatory bail application, the

                     complainant has admitted receiving a large number of gold items. Even

                     otherwise, there is no law to vicariously hold liable in criminal case the

                     owner, Director or Managing Director etc. Therefore, the complaint does

                     not lie only against Smt. Prem Kalra and Smt. Mona Kalra. But, as

                     already stated, there is nothing to show that bills have been fabricated.

                     There is no report of the expert. There is nothing in the complaint to show

                     that these bills are not correct print-outs.

                     time Navneet Kaur was admitted in some hospital at Delhi. Annexure-P.4

                     is the certificate given by the doctor on 2.4.2009 where he certified that he

                     examined Ms. Navneet Kaur daughter of Tajwant Singh and gone through

                     the medicines, she was taking Tablets Larpose 2 mg. extra than the

                     medicines prescribed in the prescription and the doctor told her that these

                     tablets cause addiction and if taken in excess dose may be dangerous to

                     life. Learned senior counsel for the respondent, no where, has stated that

                     this opinion is incorrect regarding this medicine. He has not challenged

                     this opinion and this opinion is regarding medicine Larpose. On the same

                     day, statement of the doctor under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_41">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. has been recorded

                     in which he has again given the date 19.12.2008 when he visited the

                     house and checked Navneet Kaur. Now in this petition, there is plea of

                     the learned senior counsel that inadvertently date has been written as

                     19.12.2008 on the prescription slip instead of 19.11.2008.

                     during the investigation to hold that these are false or fabricated

                     witness has not been examined before the Court. Therefore, only on this
