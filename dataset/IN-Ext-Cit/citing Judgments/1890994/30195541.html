The Appellant has sought the following reliefs in the instant Appeal:
     a)   Set aside the impugned order dated 08/09/2017 by Ld.GERC in
          the original Petition No. 1558/2016.

     b)   Direct the Respondent 2 - SLDC to refund the payment made
          against impugned bills along with interest @ 18% per annum.

     c)   Pass any other order that this Hon'ble Tribunal may deem
          necessary in the facts of the case and in the interests of justice

The Appellant has presented this Appeal for considering the
following Question of Law:
     A.   Whether impugned Order is suffering from infirmity as passed
          overlooking a very clear and unambiguous decision under MOM
          dated 24.11.2011 of Ld. GERC and CERC Regulations?

     B.   Whether Ld. GERC can allow SLDC to raise impugned bills after
          a period of over 2 years negating its own ruling in MOM dated
          24.11.2014 and against CERC Regulations?

     C.   Whether the Impugned Order is legally tenable?

     D.   Whether Ld. GERC was justified in taking recourse to its order in
          Petition 1440 / 2015 which had raised different grounds than
          those raised in petition 1558 / 2016 filed by this Appellant?

Order dated 08.09.2017 passed by the first Respondent/ GERC, the

Appellant has filed the present appeal contending that the second

Respondent/SLDC, which was all along recovering Transmission charges

based    on   energy    actually   scheduled,    has   recovered       additional

Transmission charges for the same power transactions illegally after a

period of 2 years for the periods of Short-trades and Non-trades periods

in respect of Short Term Open Access (STOA) charges by arbitrary after

thoughts and misleading interpretation of permission granted for Open

Access by way of issuing the NOC by second Respondent/SLDC for Sale

of power through collective transactions allegedly as capacity reserved.


</p><p id="p_22">7.    It is the case of the Appellant that, the second Respondent/SLDC

has retrospectively recovered the charges on the basis of assumption that

the No Objection Certificate given for the capacity limited under the NOC

is the capacity reserved for the Appellant/petitioner whereas in fact

according to Open Access Regulation Notification 3 of 2011 for Terms and

conditions of Intra State Open Access Regulation, capacity is reserved for

Long Term Open Access ( LTOA ) and Medium Term Open Access

(MTOA), while for the Short Term Open Access (STOA ) for collective

transactions in particular, it is considered as permission only for operation

if and when the capacity is available after allowing (i) the use of capacity in

priority by LTOA first, (ii) MTOA and (iii) by STOA under bilateral

contracts. Thus the question of reserved capacity for STOA in case of

collective transactions in particular is far from the fact.


</p><p id="p_24">8.    Further, it is the case of the Appellant that, the second Respondent

SLDC did not furnish any specific reply against the specific issues and

references pointed out by the petitioner in his correspondence referring to

regulatory reference documents for reservation of capacity and the

collective transactions but merely preferred to reiterate irrelevant

generalized references based claims only. Appreciating the fact that the

second Respondent/SLDC enjoying a monopoly status and dominant

position, the Appellant/petitioner has paid the claim amounts with protest.

The after thoughts based recovery after a period of a few years for

quantum     of    energy    not    scheduled     or    less   scheduled           than

approved/permitted capacity is arbitrary, unwarranted and illegal and,

therefore, liable for refunding such recovery amounts with interest.

Respondent/ SLDC vide Minutes of Meeting (MOM) dated 24.11.2011

vide clarification at serial no. 4 of MOM that the transactions of power

made by STOA consumer through power exchange is a collective

transaction and to be treated as per Interstate Open Access Regulation of

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and not as per intra

State transactions as per regulation of the first Respondent/(GERC).

Therefore, it is the case of the Appellant that the issues arise for

consideration before this Tribunal in the present appeal are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (i)   Whether No Objection Certificate (NOC) / Standing Clearance

            granted by the second Respondent/SLDC - means reservation

            of transmission capacity for Short Term Open Access

            consumers selling power through Power Exchange i.e.

            Collective Transaction there by being obligated to pay

            transmission charges - claiming error by them - after a period

            of over two years.

submission contending that two issues, as stated above, arise for the

consideration of this Tribunal in the instant appeal. He submitted that, the

first issue of reservation of capacity, following facts need to be considered

that,

<p id="p_32">13.   The second Respondent/SLDC had contended in Appeal No. 70 of

2015 decided by this Tribunal on 07.04.2016 that Short Term open Access

gets lowest priority and can be accorded only when there is a surplus

capacity available after meeting the requirements of Long Term and

Medium Term Open access. Therefore, the contention of the Respondent

is misplaced that even for Short Term Open Access transmission Charges

are applicable on basis of Max. Capacity Reserved. The first

Respondent/GERC has derived Transmission Tariff based on ACs i.e.

Sum of Capacities Allocated to all Long and Medium Term and Bilateral

Short Term Open Access customers. For Short Term Open Access

through Collective Transaction, granting Open Access is last priority in the

whole chain.

NOC/Prior Standing Clearance issued by second Respondent/SLDC vide

letter dated 26.06.2013 para 1 states that Sufficient Transmission capacity

is available. The letter does not specify/stipulate any reservation of

capacity for Appellant. Also "NOC" format: PX-I - Standing Clearance/No

use per day. In the same NOC under Declaration SLDC certifies that (a)

We have "No Objection" to seeking and availing Open Access by M/s.

Ultra Tech Cement Ltd., Kovaya through Power Exchange up to the 24

MW ceiling. Such terms used by the second Respondent/SLDC e.g. "Max.

Ceiling", "Sufficient Transmission capacity", ....availing Open Access

through Power Exchange UP TO 24 MW CEILING" leads to the

interpretation that there is No Reservation of Capacity for Short Term

Open Access through Power Exchange.

<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">15.   The counsel for the Appellant contended that in the meeting held

between the first Respondent/GERC and State Utilities on 24.11.2011, the

State Utilities sought clarification from first Respondent/GERC regarding

treatment to be given to Short Term Open Access through Power

Exchange     i.e.   Collective   Transaction,   first   Respondent/GERC

unambiguously confirmed that for Short Term Open Access thru Collective

Transaction, CERC Regulations for Open access shall apply.                  It is

pertinent to note that the said meeting was between the State Commission

and State Utilities, where customers who are important Stake Holders in

the whole process were never involved. Therefore, the contention of the

Respondent's that the meeting was to clear procedures is totally

unfounded since detailed procedure already existed as per the relevant

Regulation. CERC Regulations for Open Access which were notified in


                                                                     12 | P a g e

2008 - much before GERC Open access Regulations notified in 2011 -

clearly mandates that State Transmission charges will apply as per State

Commission, with a proviso that where the State Commission has not

defined the same in Rs.'/MWh, it will be applicable at the rate of

Rs.80/MWh as applicable in CERC Regulation. It is pertinent to note that

first Respondent/GERC had not defined Transmission Charges in

Rs./MWh, thereby making Transmission Charges of CERC as applicable

for Short Term open Access through Collective Transactions. These

aspects of the matter has not been looked into nor considered nor

appreciated by the first Respondent/GERC in the impugned Order.

Therefore, the impugned Order passed by the first Respondent/GERC is

liable to be set aside.

Appellant has never defaulted or disputed bills raised by Power Exchange

as per procedure laid down in the applicable Regulation. It is a sound

business proposition that while selling or buying any product or service, all

parameters which have a bearing on the cost of product or service are

factored. It is obvious that had Appellant been aware of this huge liability -

to arise on a future date after a period of over two years - of over ₹12

million with nil possibility of recovery from his customers, like any sane

business entity, he would have acted prudently. i.e. he would have added

this part of the cost to the purchasers of his power sold thru' Open Access

to Exchange or even not obtained NOC for such periods wherever not

financially viable.

transaction. Equity demands that Appellant cannot be put to a

disadvantageous position due to error committed by Respondent when the

Appellant has no such remedy available. The second Respondent/SLDC

for over two years kept on accepting Transmission Charges without any

demur.        Their   raising   additional   demand   puts      Appellant         into

disadvantageous position and causes Appellant irreparable loss for no

fault of his. The well settled law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

and various High Courts held that once a position is accepted by a party,

he cannot be permitted to change his position if it would put the other

party in a disadvantageous position. To substantiate his submissions, he

paced reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_4">Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh

and Ors</a>. [1979 ]2SCR641 and another judgment by High Court of

Guwahati in the case of <a href="/doc/743747/" id="a_5">Union of India (UOI) vs. Raj Brothers</a> AIR 2000

allowed the appeal filed by the Appellant and set aside the judgment of the

High Court, and in its judgment, the High Court of Guwahati has held that,

the trial Court was not justified in directing the appellant to refer such new

claims raised by the plaintiff respondent for settlement by the arbitrator.

The judgment and order passed by the trial Court being vitiated is

accordingly set aside. In the result the appeal succeeds which is allowed

with costs.     Therefore, he submitted that, following the ratio of the

judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court and High Court, as referred above,

</p><p id="p_51">20.   Regarding issue No. (I), the learned counsel for the first

Respondent/GERC submitted that, as per the relevant provision of the

CERC Regulations needs to be seen, which read as under:

</blockquote><p id="p_52">21.   Further, Regulation 16(3) of the CERC Regulations specifically

provides that, in the case of intra-state entities and transactions, additional

payment of transmission charges for use of the state network shall be

determined by the respective State Commission(s). Thus, the aforesaid

Regulation recognizes that when the Intra-State Transmission system is

utilized, the Open Access customers are required to additionally pay the

transmission charges as per the charges determined by the respective

State Commission and once this exercise has been fulfilled by a

respective State Commission, there is no occasion for application of the

proviso to the aforesaid Regulation 16(3). Further, in terms of the above, it

is seen beyond dispute that the Appellant is situated in the State of

Gujarat and injecting power at injection point for collective transactions,

utilizing the Intra-State network from the injection point to inter-connection

point of Intra-State and Inter-State transmission network. It is also beyond

any lis that the Appellant is liable to pay the transmission charges for

utilization of Intra-State network.

Regarding reliance of the Appellant on the Minutes of Meeting of the

answering Respondent dated 24.11.2011 is concerned, it is most

respectfully submitted that the said reliance is misplaced as nowhere in

the said Minutes has it been stated that the first Respondent/GERC's

relevant Regulations shall not apply and in fact, when the Intra-State

network is also involved or utilized, in such case the GERC Regulations

shall apply. Thus, the Appellant is bound to bear the transmission charges

as determined by the answering Respondent, as per its Open Access

Regulations.

<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">22.     The counsel for the first Respondent/GERC submitted that, regarding the

first   part   of   Issue   No.   2,   it   is   respectfully submitted    by the first

Respondent/GERC that foremost, as per the definition of Reserved Capacity

needs to be perused, the said definition can be seen that the definition

envisages transfer of energy between drawal and injection point in MW which is

not in energy term but the same is in capacity term for Open Access. The

definition of Reserved Capacity as per the CERC Regulations is also required to

be seen as the same is being relied upon by the Appellant, which read thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">        (j) "Reserved Transmission Capacity", means the power transfer
        between the specified point(s) of injection and points of drawal
        allowed to a short-term customer on the transmission system
        depending on availability of transmission capacity                and the
        expression "reservation of transmission capacity" shall be construed
        accordingly

</blockquote><p id="p_57">23.   The counsel for the first Respondent/GERC contended that the

counsel for the Appellant placing reliance on Regulation 16 of the CERC

Open Access Regulations and contended that transmission charges are

payable for energy scheduled for transmission i.e. on scheduling which is

approved and not on Prior Standing Clearance/NOC capacity basis. It is,

thus, submitted with regard to the entire gamut of the aforesaid issue and

stand of the Appellant that the definition of Reserved Capacity under the

captioned CERC Regulations does not provide to mean either scheduled

energy or scheduled capacity and whichever way, the array of the

Appellant's   contention   with   regard   to   scheduled     capacity        would

unwantingly mean variance in the scheduled capacity on different dates

and shall lead to different reserved capacity for Short Term Open Access

which is not the case in NOCs as sought by such customers and shall also

lead to a situation wherein Short Term Open Access period may vary

considering the scheduled capacity on which the Short Term Open Access

is sought by such customer which is against the provisions of the relevant

Regulations. Therefore, the contention of the counsel for the Appellant is

liable to be rejected.

recovery of transmission charges from Short-Term Open Access

charges are/were payable on the basis of reserved capacity in MW till

13.08.2014, i.e. prior to coming into effect of the aforementioned Second

Amendment. Furthermore, it is necessary to clarify and state herein that

the definition of the Reserved Capacity as per the Regulations proves that

the capacity stated in the Regulations is on MW basis applied for NOC in

Short-Term Open Access application and accordingly the same has been

granted by the second Respondent/SLDC herein and it is neither on

scheduled capacity basis nor on MWh basis and the term maximum

reserved capacity cannot be equated with the scheduled capacity or

energy actually scheduled. That, it is also vital to note that there has been

no revision of the applicable transmission charges by the first

Respondent/GERC and the relevant Regulation and its subsequent

amendments are distinct and have different meaning in the domain they

cover.

Appellant's transmission capacity is booked under Short-Term Open

Access by the second Respondent/SLDC. It has also been put forth by the

Appellant before the first Respondent/GERC, as also this Tribunal that on

short-traded days the transmission charges are payable limited to traded

quantity only, however, it is submitted that this stand of the Appellant is

erroneous as the quantum of short-traded quantity of Short-Term Open

Access is a commercial transaction carried out at the Exchange level

between seller and purchaser for power purchase/sale and once the

Short-Term Open Access is granted on the transmission system, the same

needs to be utilized by the open access customers to whom such open

access is granted and consequently, any shortfall in procurement of power

through Energy Exchange due to mismatch of price between seller and

procurer of power is not a ground for non-applicability of transmission

charges for Short-Term Open Access. Sight cannot be lost of the GERC

Regulations and its First Amendment, wherein it has been specifically

provided that once the capacity is booked for Short Term Open Access,

such consumers are liable to pay transmission charges as per the relevant

Regulations prevailing when such Short-Term Open Access transactions

took place. As such, the recovery of transmission charges for NOC

capacity/Reserved capacity by the Respondent No. 2, as per the

answering Respondent is legal and valid strictly in consonance with the

                                                            Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


</p><p id="p_68">26.   The counsel for the first Respondent/GERC regarding issue No.4, at

the outset, submitted that, second Respondent/SLDC has made a claim

for recovery of Transmission Charges from the Appellant vide its invoice

dated 28.01.2015 for an amount Rs. 63,74,625 for the Financial Year

2013-14 and invoice dated 16.04.2015 for an amount of Rs. 56,70,282 for

the Financial Year 2012-13. Further, the Appellant herein has contended

that the second Respondent/SLDC is barred from recovering any dues

which falls beyond a period of 2 years from the date when such dues first

fell due as per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_8">Section 56</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. It is pertinent to

note that as per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_9">section 56</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, in its entirety, this

Tribunal in the case of Ajmer Vidhyut Vitarant Nigam Limited Vs. RERC

particularly paragraph nos. 32 to 39, a conjoined reading of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">Section 56</a> of

the Electricity Act, 2003 and the aforesaid judgment of this Tribunal leads

to a conclusion that <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">Section 56(2)</a> particularly provides for a barrier from

disconnection with regard to default in payment of any pending due(s) that

lies beyond a period of 2 years. However, there is no bar in the said

section on the licensee/generating Company from recovering any pending

due(s) that is beyond the period of 2 years but within the general limitation

period of 3 years as provided under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_12">Limitation Act</a>, 1963. Further, to

substantiate his submission, the counsel for the first Respondent/GERC

placed reliance on the judgment of this Tribunal as referred above. In the

case at hand, it is beyond dispute that the invoices dated 28.01.2015 and

16.04.2015 are raised by the Respondent no. 2 on the Appellant within a
                                                                        26 | P a g e

period of 3 years period from the date of grant of Open Access to the

Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">27.   Further, the counsel for the first Respondent/GERC contended that

with regard to the second part of Issue No. 4, i.e. recovery of transmission

charges      (dues)   retrospectively,   it   is   submitted   by      the      first

Respondent/GERC that the basis and mechanism under the prevalent

GERC Regulations along with the First Amendment held domain for

recovery of transmission charges on reserved capacity basis until

13.08.2014 i.e. prior to coming into effect, the Second Amendment.

Further, the Respondent No. 2 has recovered charges from the Appellant

on scheduled capacity (energy) basis instead of reserved capacity basis,

when the GERC Regulations along with the First Amendment specifically

envisaged the latter under an erroneous application of the said

Regulation. Thus, it is this error that was rectified by the second

Respondent/SLDC and the consequent supplementary invoices dated

28.01.2015 and 16.04.2015 were raised for the under-billed balance

amounts.      Hence, in these set of facts, the recovery by second

Respondent/SLDC cannot be termed as recovery based of retrospective

applicability of GERC Regulations. Further, estoppel cannot be pleaded

against a statute or law and Regulations are a sub-legislative function

conferred on the State Commission(s) having statutory force, this position

of law is also settled by a catena of judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court.


</p><p id="p_71">                                                                        27 | P a g e

Further, he submitted that, it has to be kept in notice that the charges

recoverable under the GERC Regulations were wrongly recovered by the

second Respondent/SLDC and there is no restriction to correct the error

and recover the correct amount. Furthermore, the recovery of these

charges is counted in the ARR of the licensee and given effect in the

Long-Term Open Access and Medium-Term Open Access customer

charges. The recovery of transmission charges by the second

Respondent/SLDC from the Appellant is legal and valid. Therefore, this

aspect of the matter has rightly been considered by the first

Respondent/GERC and by assigning valid and cogent reasons has

passed the order impugned. Hence, interference by this Tribunal does not

call for.
</p>
<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">28.    The learned counsel for the first Respondent/GERC vehemently

contended that certain issues are raised in the present Appeal before this

Tribunal which were never raised in the original proceedings before the

first Respondent/GERC. In this regard, it is submitted that, the present

proceedings are Appeal proceedings as envisaged under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_13">Section 111</a> of

the Electricity Act, 2003 and as such, the first Respondent/GERC had no

occasion to deal with such contentions which were never raised before it.

As such, no Review proceedings were either initiated before the first

Respondent/GERC to bring such new issues to the foray before it. The

contention of the counsel for the Appellant regarding new issues raised


                                                                    28 | P a g e
                                                           Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


herein regarding whether the first Respondent/GERC has overlooked its

own Regulation which gives all formats i.e. ST-2, ST-3, ST-4 for

transmission charges as in Rs./MWh and not in Rs./MW, it is respectfully

submitted that there cannot be any overriding effect of formats over the

main Regulations and this position is also a settled law as laid down by

the Hon'ble Apex Court in host of cases. Further, it is pertinent to mention

herein that GERC Regulations along with its First Amendment, in the most

certain way lays down that Short-Term Open Access transmission charges

is on the basis of maximum capacity reserved and as per the formats, this

capacity allocated is in MW. A reference may be had to the prevalent

Regulation 21 in this regard. As such, the contention of the Appellant in

the issue under submission is erroneous and misplaced and liable to be

rejected at threshold.     Regarding contention of the counsel for the

Appellant with reference to the issue of conduct of meetings by the first

Respondent/GERC, it is submitted and clarified that the same are within

the regulatory framework and as per the Conduct of Business Rules,

particularly Regulation 14.    As per Regulation 14, the Commission is

empowered to hold meetings and that has been followed strictly. With

regard to the issue of part of day billing, it is submitted and clarified that

Short-Term Open Access, under the said Regulation is defined for a

period upto 1 month at a time, but not exceeding a period of 6 months in a

calendar year thus making it clear that any person seeking Short-Term

Open Access may be granted open access for a period of 1 month and
                                                                       29 | P a g e

wherever the said grant is for such period, the charges payable shall be

calculated on this basis. In the present case, it is imperative to see

whether the Appellant had applied for Short-Term Open Access for the

entire period of 1 month or otherwise, as provided under the said

Regulations. Therefore, he most respectfully submitted that, the Appellant

has failed to make out any case passed by the first Respondent/GERC.

The first Respondent/GERC, after thorough evaluation of the evidences

available on record and critical verification of the relevant materials

available, by assigning the valid and cogent reasons has passed the

reasonable and proper order. The said order is proper and sound and

interference by this Tribunal does not call for and the appeal filed by the

Appellant is liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits.


Oral and written submissions of the learned counsel for the second
Respondent/SLDC are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">29.   The learned counsel, Mr. M.G. Ramachandran, appearing for the

second Respondent/SLDC contended that, the matter in issue is the

Recovery of the applicable transmission charges for the State network

(within the State of Gujarat)on the basis of the maximum capacity

reserved under the Short Term Open Access granted to the beneficiaries

and the applicable regulations are the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory

Commission (Terms and Conditions of Intra-State Open Access)

Regulations, 2011 and the amendments thereto (hereinafter referred to as

'GERC Open Access Regulations').     The Appellant has claimed that it is
                                                                        30 | P a g e
                                                         Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


selling power through Power Exchanges, a collective transaction regulated

by the Central Commission and not by the State Commission. As per the

Appellant, the open access is governed by only those regulations

applicable to Inter State transactions notified by the Central Commission

under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">Section 79</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.        Though the Power

Exchange transactions is an Inter State Transaction involving the use of

the Inter State Transmission Network owned, operated and maintained by

the CTU/Powergrid/Transmission Licensees of the Central Commission, it

also involves the use of the Transmission Network of the State

Transmission Utility (STU). Accordingly, the Transmission System

involved are both the networks of the CTU/Powergrid/Inter State

Transmission Licensees and also the network of the Intra State

Transmission Licensee, as well as it may involve the network of the

Distribution Licensees in the State. The transmission charges and other

related charges for the state transmission network are to be paid as per

the Tariff Terms and Conditions decided by the State Commission of

Gujarat, in addition to any charges applicable to inter-state transmission

network maintained by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Central

Transmission Utility) or any transmission licensee of the Central

Commission. The transmission charges are determined by the State

Commission in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_15">Sections 61</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">62</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_17">74</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_18">86</a> of

the Electricity Act, 2003. The fact that the transmission charges are to be

determined by the State Commission is also specifically provided in the
                                                                     31 | P a g e
                                                         Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


Regulations of the Central Commission. It is submitted that the short term

open access was sought by the Appellant for sale of power through Power

Exchange. The nature of open access is short term open access and for

such open access, there is no distinction under GERC Open Access

Regulations between Bilateral or Collective Transactions. Similarly, the

CERC Open Access Regulations also in so far as they relate to the State

Network do not distinguish the bilateral or collective transactions. The

attempt of the Appellant therefore to seek a special dispensation due to

collective transaction is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">30.   The counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC submitted that, the

transmission charges applicable for the short term open access to the

State network have beendetermined as per the GERC Open Access

Regulations. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">The Electricity Act</a>, 2003 in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_20">Section 86</a> provides that the

State Commission shall regulate the intra-state entities including the

transmission network of the State Transmission Utility (<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_21">Section 86(1)(c)</a>)

and the transmission charges for the State transmission network is

determined by the State Commission. The transmission charges for the

State network of Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation is admittedly

determined by the State Commission and it is not the contention of the

Appellant that the tariff has to be determined by the Central Commission.

The Central Commission cannot determine the transmission charges in

respect of transmission lines/network of the State Transmission Utility nor


                                                                     32 | P a g e

can the Central Commission determine the methodology or otherwise any

terms and conditions for such determination of tariff. The Central

Electricity   Regulatory   Commission    (Open    Access     in    inter-State

Transmission) Regulations, 2008, which governs the short-term open

access in inter-state transmission system, itself provides that the

transmission charges payable for use of state network shall be as fixed by

the concerned State Commission. As per Regulation 16(3) of the Central

Electricity   Regulatory   Commission    (Open    Access     in    inter-State

Transmission) Regulations, 2008 i.e. The intra-State entities shall pay the

transmission charges for use of the State network as fixed by the

respective State Commission in addition to the charges specified under

clauses (1) and (2), provided that in case the State Commission has not

determined the transmission charges, the charges for use of respective

State network shall be payable at the rate of Rs.80/MWh for the electricity

transmitted. After amendment i.e. 11.09.2013, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_22">section 16(2)</a>, the intra-

State entities shall pay the transmission charges for use of the State

network as fixed by the respective State Commission in addition to the

charges specified under clauses (1) of this regulation, provided that where

the State Commission has not determined the transmission charges for

use of the state network in `/MWh. The charges for use of respective State

network shall be payable at the rate of `80/MWh for the energy approved.

Therefore, it is submitted that, the transmission charges for use of the

State network are in addition to the charges specified under Regulation
                                                                     33 | P a g e
                                                        Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


16(1) of the CERC Open Access Regulations for use of inter-state

network. Such transmission charges are for the usage of the State

network are to be determined by the State Commission. The Appellant

has sought to claim in terms of the amended regulations (effective

11.09.2013) that the transmission charges determined even for State

network by the State Commissions are to be in MWh. This is contrary to

the basic scheme of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_23">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 where-under the State

Commission determines the terms and conditions for tariff in relation to

transmission network of the intra-state transmission licensees such as

GETCO. The Appellant cannot seek to interpret the CERC Regulations in

a manner to contradict or overrule the Regulations of the State

Commission. As stated above, the State Commission has jurisdiction over

transmission charges of state networks and the Central Commission has

jurisdiction over transmission charges of inter-state networks. This has

also been held by this Tribunal in the case of State Load Despatch Centre,

Gujarat itself. The Appellant cannot seek to contend to the contrary. The

Central Commission does not mandate under Regulation 16(2) of CERC

Regulation that the transmission charges to be determined by the State

Commission have to be for energy scheduled. The proviso would only

apply if the State Commission has not determined the transmission

charges, which is not the present case. In any case the reference to MWh

is due to the fact that the short term open access may be sought for a

certain number of hours and not necessarily for an entire day. Therefore
                                                                    34 | P a g e
                                                         Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


the MWh is the capacity multiplied by number of hours for which the

Applicant may be granted short term open access. In the present case,

the Appellant had sought for and been granted open access for 24 MW for

the entire day and therefore the MWh is 24 X 24 (per day). This is also

manifest from the fact that the GERC Open Access Regulations also

provide for transmission charges incorporating the number of hours for

which allocation is made vis-à-vis number of hours in the year (Regulation

21 referred in Written Submissions of the Appellant).


</p><p id="p_78">31.   To substantiate his submission, the counsel for the second

Respondent/SLDC contended that this Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/13444261/" id="a_24">State Load

Despatch Centre and Anr v. Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission

and Anr</a> dated 07.04.2016 in Appeal No. 70 of 2015 which had upheld the

jurisdiction of the State Commission in cases of short term open access

for collective transactions.   In the said Appeal, specific grounds were

raised that only the Central Commission Regulations have to be

considered for grant of short term open access to facilitate transaction

through power exchange. However, the said stand taken has not been

accepted by this Tribunal. The stand of Respondent in the said Appeal

cannot be relied on when this Tribunal has dismissed the Appeal and held

that the jurisdiction even for collective transactions lies with the State

Commission.     Therefore, the contention of the Appellant seeking to

distinguish collective transaction from other transactions is not borne out


                                                                     35 | P a g e

by the GERC Open Access Regulations and is contrary to the specific

judgment of this Tribunal. Therefore, he submitted that, the first

Respondent/GERC has rightly justified in taking the said view and

interference by this Tribunal does not call for.

rationale behind the same is that there cannot be different charges

applicable for use of the State Transmission System for similarly placed

for a collective transaction and for a bilateral transaction. Thus, there can

be no dispute on the fact that the transmission charges for state network

for those specific hours. In such cases where the open access is granted

only for part of the day, the capacity is reserved accordingly and the

<p id="p_89">38.   Regarding maximum capacity reserved is the capacity for which

NOC was granted, the learned counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC

submitted that, the Appellant had sought the facility of Short Term Open

Access on the state transmission system to sell electricity through the

Indian Energy Exchange as a collective transaction. The consent or the

No Objection Certificate (NOC) of the SLDC is required for such open

access on the state's transmission system and the same has been

recognized in the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Open

Access in inter-State Transmission) Regulations, 2008 also. The SLDC,

after considering the surplus capacity available after allotment to the Long

and Medium Term Open Access, grants the consent/NOC for a certain

capacity in MW to the open access customer. Once granted, such

capacity is accounted for and kept reserved for the open access customer.

The spare capacity is considered at the time of allocation, but once such

allocation is made, this capacity is blocked. The above capacity is not


                                                                      43 | P a g e

considered in the available surplus capacity considered while granting

open access to the subsequent applicants. It is, thus, wrong on the part of

the Appellants to claim that there is no reservation of capacity for short

term open access. Merely because the short term open access applicant

has lowest priority for grant of open access does not mean that there is no

capacity reserved once the short term open access is granted. The same

capacity would not be granted to another short term open access

applicant. The Consent/NOC granted by SLDC is for a certain capacity,

which is the maximum capacity reserved for the short term open access

customer. Merely because the No Objection does not use the term

'maximum capacity reserved' does not negate the clear the provisions of

the GERC Open Access Regulations. Otherwise, the above capacity for

which NOC/Consent is granted would have no relevance. The fact that

the short term open access also has capacity reserved is clear from the

definition of 'Reserved Capacity' under the GERC Open Access

Regulations, which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">      "3.1 (r) "Reserved Capacity" means the power transfer in MW
      between the specified point(s) of injection and point(s) of drawal
      allowed to a short-term customer on the transmission/distribution
      system depending on availability of transmission/distribution capacity
      and the expression "reservation of capacity" shall be construed
      accordingly."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_90">39.   The reserved capacity is defined as the MW allowed to a short term

customer depending on availability of transmission capacity. If the

                                                                          44 | P a g e

contention of the Appellants is accepted that there is no reservation of

capacity for short term open access, then there would have been no

definition of the term "reserved capacity" in the GERC Open Access

Regulations and the Regulations would not have provided for transmission

charges on basis of maximum reserved capacity. There is no need to

mention any capacity in the NOC if there was no reservation of capacity

and there would be no requirement to check for sufficiency of transmission

capacity while granting NOC. The contentions of the Appellants are

contrary to the specific Regulations of the State Commission which are to

be considered even for collective transactions.      The term 'maximun

capacity reserved' in Regulation 21 has to be given a meaning, which is

nothing but the capacity for which No Objection/Consent has been given

by the SLDC. This is the 'maximum' capacity which can be utilized by the

short term open access customer. The maximum capacity reserved

cannot be determined on a day to day basis as claimed by the Appellant

but is the capacity reserved by the Short Term Open Access Customer for

the period of Open Access. This capacity is the capacity for which NOC

has been granted by the SLDC. The capacity placed on bid by the

Appellants and accepted by Power Exchanges is not the reserved

capacity under open access but the capacity sought to be purchased

under open access.     The capacity in NOC is the maximum capacity

allowed to the Appellants for open access. The Appellant has wrongly

sought to rely on the terms "Maximum" "Ceiling" and "Up to" to claim that
                                                                    45 | P a g e

there was no reservation. Since the GERC Open Access Regulations

refer to the 'maximum capacity reserved', the NOC also refers to

Maximum/Ceiling/Up to to signify the 'maximum' capacity reserved. This

only means that the Appellant is entitled to inject the power of 24 MW but

there is no obligation on the Appellant to inject power exactly 24 MW but

the Appellant can inject any quantum of power up to 24 MW. This is the

reason why the term "up to 24 MW" is used. But since the Appellant is

entitled to inject 24 MW, the transmission capacity of 24 MW has been

reserved for the Appellant and therefore the Appellant has to pay the

transmission charges for 24 MW for the entire day irrespective of whether

the Appellant actually transmits power or not. It is reiterated that no further

allocation of short term open access would be made for such 24 capacity

for the said period.

Court.   Therefore, he submitted that the Appellants had specifically

applied for the open access and has been allocated the reserved capacity.

In terms of the applicable regulations, the Appellants are required to pay

and settle the transmission charges. As per the CERC Open Access

Regulations, the transmission charges are payable by intra-state entities

i.e. the open access customer such as the Appellant (Regulation 16(2)

read with 2(h)). Similarly under GERC Open Access Regulations under

Regulation 21 also provide for the transmission charges to be paid by

Short term open access customers, i.e. the Appellant and not Power

Exchange. Thus even assuming but not admitting that any procedure

provides for Power Exchange to settle the transmission charges, this

would not negate the liability of the Appellant who is the open access

customer. The settlement of transmission charges by the Power Exchange

is only a methodology or avenue to recover and does not change the

liability of the Open Access Customer to pay the transmission charges.

Even if the transmission charges are recovered from the power exchange,

the same would be passed on to the Open Access Customer since the

liability is of the Open Access Customer. Therefore in case the settlement

by Power Exchange is not possible, the transmission charges are

recovered directly from the Appellant. The Appellant cannot seek to evade

the liability of payment of transmission charges by relying on the alleged

protocols. Since the liability is of the short term open access customer



                                                                    47 | P a g e

such as the Appellants, the invoices were raised by SLDC on the

Appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">41.   Regarding Doctrine of Estoppel/Promissory Estoppel, the learned

counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC contended that, as per GERC

Open Access Regulations, the SLDC is vested with the power to collect

the transmission charges. Therefore SLDC is entitled to recover

transmission charges for the open access granted as per the GERC Open

Access Regulations which provided for transmission charges on maximum

capacity reserved. There is no aspect of any dominant position in the

present case. SLDC has only collected the transmission charges as per

the GERC Open Access Regulations and Tariff Orders passed by the

State Commission. It is, further, submitted that, if by inadvertence, there

was under-recovery of the amounts, the differential amount can be

recovered subsequently by raising corrected invoices/supplementary

invoices. It is the obligation of the Appellants/short term open access

customer to pay the transmission charges as per the GERC Open Access

Regulations and Tariff Orders. They cannot deny the liability merely

because the invoice was raised subsequently. The invoices raised by

SLDC are not invalid merely because they were raised subsequently. This

is particularly, when the claim for transmission charges had not been time

barred. There had been an under-recovery of the transmission charges

for the relevant period and the SLDC had sought to recover the said


                                                                     48 | P a g e

amount. SLDC cannot be prevented from recovery of legitimate dues.

The   Appellant's    claim   of   application    of     promissory     estoppel        is

misconceived. There can be no application of such concept of estoppel in

the present case. At the outset it is submitted that the Appellant had not

raised the issue of doctrine of estoppel/promissory estoppel in the Petition

before the State Commission or even in the Memorandum Appeal. The

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the foundation has to be laid in the

Petition itself by invoking the doctrine. <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_27">In Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd.v.

Commercial Tax Officer and Ors</a>. (2005) 1 SCC 625, wherein the Hon'ble

the Estoppel/Promissory Estoppel arises only when there is a clear and

unequivocal assurance or promise by a party to induce the other party to

believe in a position which is relied on by another party and acted upon.

There was no such assurance or promise by the SLDC that the

transmission charges would be charged as per energy scheduled and not

on the basis of capacity reserved. The Appellant has not placed on record

any such promise or assurance. In the cases relied on by the Appellant,

there was a specific promise by the Government that an exemption would

be provided for three years and on that basis, the person had set up an

industry. The facts of the case are completely different.                     Therefore,

reliance placed by the counsel for the Appellant are not applicable to the

facts and circumstances of the present case.                    To substantiate his

submission, he placed reliance on the following judgments of the Hon'ble

<p id="p_111">RE:ISSUE (A):
</p>
<p id="p_112">45.   The principal submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant is

that, as per the GERC (Terms and Conditions of Intra State Open Access)

Regulations, 2011 Sec. 21(2) - Transmission Charges for use of intra-

state transmission system specifies Transmission Tariff for Long &amp;

Medium Term Open access users for part of a month.              The second

Respondent/SLDC had contended in Appeal No. 70 of 2015 decided by

this Tribunal on 07.04.2016 that Short Term open Access gets lowest

priority and can be accorded only when there is a surplus capacity

available after meeting the requirements of Long Term and Medium Term

Open access. Therefore, he contended that, the stand of the Respondent

cannot be acceptable that even for Short Term Open Access transmission

Charges are applicable on basis of Max. Capacity Reserved. The first

Respondent/GERC has derived Transmission Tariff based on ACs i.e.

                                                                     54 | P a g e
                                                           Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


Sum of Capacities Allocated to all Long and Medium Term and Bilateral

Short Term Open Access customers. For Short Term Open Access

through Collective Transaction, granting Open Access is last priority in the

whole chain. Therefore, he contended that, in the NOC/Prior Standing

Clearance issued by second Respondent/SLDC vide letter dated

26.06.2013 para 1 states that Sufficient Transmission capacity is available

but the same communication does not specify/stipulate any reservation of

capacity for Appellant. Therefore, he submitted that, it leads to the

interpretation that there is No Reservation of Capacity for Short Term

Open Access through Power Exchange. Secondly, he contended that, in

the meeting held between the first Respondent/GERC and State Utilities

on 24.11.2011,     the   State   Utilities sought   clarification    from first

Respondent/GERC regarding treatment to be given to Short Term Open

Access through Power Exchange i.e. Collective Transaction, first

Respondent/GERC confirmed that for Short Term Open Access thru

Collective Transaction, CERC Regulations for Open access shall apply. It

is pertinent to note that the said meeting was between the State

Commission and State Utilities, where customers who are important Stake

Holders in the whole process were never involved.              Therefore, he

vehemently contended that the meeting was to clear procedures is totally

unfounded since detailed procedure already existed as per the relevant

Regulation. Therefore, CERC Regulations for Open Access which were

notified in 2008 - much before GERC Open access Regulations notified in
                                                                       55 | P a g e

2011 - clearly mandates that State Transmission charges will apply as per

State Commission. The first Respondent/GERC had not defined

Transmission Charges in Rs./MWh, thereby making Transmission

Charges of CERC as applicable for Short Term open Access through

Collective Transactions. These relavant aspects of the matter has not

been    looked   into   nor   considered   nor     appreciated      by     the     first

Respondent/GERC in the impugned Order. Therefore, he submitted that,

the impugned Order passed by the first Respondent/GERC is liable to be

set aside and the prayers sought by the Appellant in the instant Appeal

may kindly be granted.

Respondent/GERC, after evaluation of the oral and documentary

evidences and other relevant material available on record and by

assigning the valid and cogent reasons, has dismissed the petition filed by

the Appellant by upholding the recovery of the applicable transmission

charges on the basis of the maximum capacity reserved for the Short-

Term Open Access ('STOA') granted to the beneficiaries for the period

prior to 14.08.2014. In fact, the first Respondent/GERC has dealt with the

issues raised in the petition before it, in detail taking in consideration the

relevant regulations i.e. 16(3) of the CERC Regulations which specifically

provides that, in the case of intra-state entities and transactions, additional

payment of transmission charges for use of the state network shall be


                                                                           56 | P a g e

determined by the respective State Commission(s). Thus, the aforesaid

Regulation recognizes that when the Intra-State Transmission system is

utilized, the Open Access customers are required to additionally pay the

transmission charges as per the charges determined by the respective

State Commission and once this exercise has been fulfilled by a

respective State Commission, there is no occasion for application of the

proviso to the aforesaid Regulation 16(3). It is pertinent to note that the

Appellant is situated in the State of Gujarat and injecting power at injection

point for collective transactions, utilizing the Intra-State network from the

injection point to inter-connection point of Intra-State and Inter-State

transmission network. It is also beyond any lis that the Appellant is liable

to pay the transmission charges for utilization of Intra-State network. To

substantiate his submissions, he placed reliance on the judgment of this

Tribunal in the case of State Load Dispatch Centre and Paschim Gujarat

Vij Company Limited Vs. Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission and

Steel Cast Limited, wherein at paragraph no. 7 onwards, it has been

specifically held that in case of users of Intra-State networks for collective

transaction, it would fall within the jurisdiction of the State Commission

within whose jurisdiction the intra-state network falls. Regarding reliance

placed by the counsel for the Appellant on the Minutes of Meeting of the

first Respondent/GERC dated 24.11.2011 is concerned, it is most

respectfully submitted that the said reliance is misplaced as nowhere in

the said Minutes has it been stated that the first Respondent/GERC's
                                                                        57 | P a g e
                                                                 Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


relevant Regulations shall not apply and in fact, when the Intra-State

network is also involved or utilized, in such case the GERC Regulations

shall apply. Thus, the Appellant is bound to bear the transmission charges

as determined by the answering Respondent, as per its Open Access

Regulations.    This aspect of the matter has been rightly considered and

appreciated by the first Respondent/GERC and decided against the Appellant

by assigning valid and cogent reasons. Therefore, the contention of the counsel

for the Appellant is liable to be rejected at threshold.


</p><p id="p_115">47.   As per GERC Regulation 21 provides for payment of the

transmission charges on the basis of 'maximum capacity reserved',

recoverable from Open Access customers who are availing the Long-

Term,     Medium-Term         and     Short-Term      Open      Access        by      the

STU/Transmission        Licensee.      Further,    on      04.03.2014,      the      first

Respondent/GERC vide its notification no. 1 of 2014 (effective from

01.04.2014) carried out First Amendment in the GERC Regulations

particularly Regulation 21 i.e. the transmission charges payable by a

Short-Term Open Access customer and they were bought on par with the

Long-Term and Medium-Term Open Access customers, however, the

basis for these charges i.e. maximum capacity reserved was not amended

or changed. The recovery of transmission charges from Short-Term Open

Access customers on the basis of actual scheduled energy in the State of

Gujarat has become operational and effective only from 14.08.2014 and

such charges are/were payable on the basis of reserved capacity in MW
                                                                             58 | P a g e

till 13.08.2014, i.e. prior to coming into effect of the aforementioned

Second Amendment. Furthermore, it is necessary to clarify and state

herein that the definition of the Reserved Capacity as per the Regulations

proves that the capacity stated in the Regulations is on MW basis applied

for NOC in Short-Term Open Access application and accordingly the

same has been granted by the SLDC/second Respondent herein and it is

neither on scheduled capacity basis nor on MWh basis and the term

maximum reserved capacity cannot be equated with the scheduled

capacity or energy actually scheduled. It is pertinent to note that there has

been no revision of the applicable transmission charges by the first

Respondent/GERC and the relevant Regulation and its subsequent

amendments are distinct and have different meaning in the domain they

cover.   Hence,    the   recovery     of   transmission   charges       for    NOC

capacity/Reserved capacity by the second Respondent/SLDC, as per the

first Respondent/GERC is legal and valid strictly in consonance with the

relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_31">Electricity Act</a> and Rules. Therefore, interference

by this Tribunal does not call for.

Commission (Terms and Conditions of Intra-State Open Access)

Regulations, 2011 and the amendments thereto. The contention of the

Appellant that it is selling power through Power Exchanges, a collective

transaction regulated by the Central Commission and not by the State

Commission. As per the Appellant, the open access is governed by only

those regulations applicable to Inter State transactions notified by the

Central Commission under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_32">Section 79</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. Though

the Power Exchange transactions is an Inter State Transaction involving

the use of the Inter State Transmission Network owned, operated and

maintained by the CTU/Powergrid/Transmission Licensees of the Central

Commission, it also involves the use of the Transmission Network of the

State Transmission Utility. Accordingly, the Transmission System involved

are both the networks of the CTU/Powergrid/Inter State Transmission

Licensees and also the network of the Intra State Transmission Licensee,

as well as it may involve the network of the Distribution Licensees in the

State. The transmission charges and other related charges for the state

transmission network are to be paid as per the Tariff Terms and

Conditions decided by the State Commission of Gujarat, in addition to any

charges applicable to inter-state transmission network maintained by

Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Central Transmission Utility) or

any transmission licensee of the Central Commission. The transmission

charges are determined by the State Commission in exercise of its powers

under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_33">Sections 61</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_34">62</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_35">74</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_36">86</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. The fact that
                                                                      60 | P a g e

the transmission charges are to be determined by the State Commission

is also specifically provided in the Regulations of the Central Commission.

It is submitted that the short term open access was sought by the

Appellant for sale of power through Power Exchange. The nature of open

access is short term open access and for such open access, there is no

distinction under GERC Open Access Regulations between Bilateral or

Collective Transactions. Similarly, the CERC Open Access Regulations

also in so far as they relate to the State Network do not distinguish the

bilateral or collective transactions. The attempt of the Appellant therefore

to seek a special dispensation due to collective transaction is

misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_118">
</p><p id="p_119">49.   The transmission charges applicable for the short term open access

to the State network have been determined as per the GERC Open

Access Regulations. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_37">The Electricity Act</a>, 2003 in <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_38">Section 86</a> provides that

the State Commission shall regulate the intra-state entities including the

transmission network of the State Transmission Utility (<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_39">Section 86(1)(c)</a>)

and the transmission charges for the State transmission network is

determined by the State Commission. The transmission charges for the

State network of Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation is admittedly

determined by the State Commission and it is not the case of the

Appellant that the tariff has to be determined by the Central Commission.

The Central Commission cannot determine the transmission charges in


                                                                      61 | P a g e

respect of transmission lines/network of the State Transmission Utility nor

can the Central Commission determine the methodology or otherwise any

terms and conditions for such determination of tariff. As per Regulation

16(2), the intra-State entities shall pay the transmission charges for use of

the State network as fixed by the respective State Commission in addition

to the charges specified under clauses (1) of this regulation. Therefore,

the State Commission has jurisdiction over transmission charges of state

networks and the Central Commission has jurisdiction over transmission

charges of inter-state networks. The Central Commission does not

mandate under Regulation 16(2) of CERC Regulation that the

transmission charges to be determined by the State Commission have to

be for energy scheduled. The proviso would only apply if the State

Commission has not determined the transmission charges. Therefore, the

contention of the appellant seeking to distinguish collective transaction

from other transactions is not borne out by the GERC Open Access

Regulations and is contrary to the judgment of this Tribunal. Therefore, he

submitted that, as per relevant regulations, the first Respondent/GERC by

assigning the valid and cogent reasons has rightly justified in taking the

said view. The said reasons given are sound and proper. Therefore,

interference by this Tribunal does not call for.

dated 24.11.2011 between State Commission and State Utilities. It is

submitted that the clarification in the meeting was neither an order nor a

Regulation and therefore cannot be relied on. In this regard, the State

Commission has in the Impugned Order clarified the nature of the above

clarification in para 7.10 of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">51.   The contention of the counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC

regarding transmission charges payable as per GERC Open Access

Regulations is on maximum capacity reserve. Thus, the GERC Open

Access Regulations provide for payment of transmission charges on

maximum capacity reserved. Accordingly, the above methodology has

been adopted for calculation of Short term Open Access charges. It is

submitted that, in the present case, the Appellant had applied for open

access for the entire period (not certain hours) and the NOC was also

granted for the entire period.         The first Respondent/GERC in the

Impugned Order has also noted that in the NOC sought, there was no

different capacity for different dates and the STOA was granted for the

duration of a month and such capacity is kept reserved for the month. As

per second Amendment notified by the first Respondent/GERC, vide

Notification No. 3 of 2014 dated 12.08.2014, which came into effect on

14.08.2014 was made for the first time to recover the transmission charges

payable for short-term open access on the energy actually scheduled for

Short-Term transactions. However, prior to the above Amendment, the


                                                                    63 | P a g e

transmission charges are to be based on the maximum reserved capacity

as provided in the then prevailing Regulations. Therefore, the second

amendment to the GERC Open Access Regulations applies prospectively

and not retrospectively. To substantiate his submission, he placed reliance

on the judgment of the Constitutional Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/163276075/" id="a_40">PTC

India Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission</a> (2010) 4 SCC

603 as held in paragraphs 40, 59 &amp; 60 respectively.          Therefore the

contentions raised by the Appellant in regard to determination of

transmission charges for short-term open access cannot be considered.

The Short Term Open Access consumers are required to pay the

transmission charges determined in accordance with the Open Access

Regulations. The counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC submitted

that the Appellant has failed to make out any ground to consider the relief

sought in the instant appeal. Hence, the appeal filed by the Appellant may

be dismissed as devoid of merits on this issue.

Commission (Terms and Conditions of Intra-State Open Access)

Regulations, 2011 and the amendments thereto.          The Appellant has

claimed that it is selling power through Power Exchanges, a collective

transaction regulated by the Central Commission and not by the State

Commission. As per the Appellant, the open access is governed by only

those regulations applicable to Inter State transactions notified by the

operated and maintained by the CTU/Powergrid/Transmission Licensees

of the Central Commission, it also involves the use of the Transmission

Network of the State Transmission Utility (STU). Accordingly, the

Transmission   System    involved   are   both   the   networks        of     the

CTU/Powergrid/Inter State Transmission Licensees and also the network

of the Intra State Transmission Licensee, as well as it may involve the

network of the Distribution Licensees in the State. Therefore, the

transmission charges and other related charges for the state transmission

network are to be paid as per the Tariff Terms and Conditions decided by

the first Respondent/GERC, in addition to any charges applicable to inter-

state transmission network maintained by Power Grid Corporation of India

Limited (Central Transmission Utility) or any transmission licensee of the

Central Commission. The transmission charges are determined by the

State Commission in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_42">Sections 61</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_43">62</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_44">74</a> and

be determined by the State Commission is also specifically provided in the

Regulations of the Central Commission. It is submitted that the short term

open access was sought by the Appellant for sale of power through Power

Exchange. The nature of open access is short term open access and for

such open access, there is no distinction under GERC Open Access

Regulations between Bilateral or Collective Transactions. Similarly, the

CERC Open Access Regulations also in so far as they relate to the State

Network do not distinguish the bilateral or collective transactions. The

attempt of the Appellant therefore to seek a special dispensation due to

collective transaction is misconceived.

charges specified under Regulation 16(1) of the CERC Open Access

Regulations for use of inter-state network. Such transmission charges are

for the usage of the State network are to be determined by the State

Commission. The Appellant has contended that to claim in terms of the

amended regulations (effective 11.09.2013) that the transmission charges

determined even for State network by the State Commissions are to be in

MWh. This is contrary to the basic scheme of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_50">Electricity Act</a>, 2003

where-under the State Commission determines the terms and conditions

for tariff in relation to transmission network of the intra-state transmission

licensees such as GETCO. The Appellant cannot seek to interpret the

CERC Regulations in a manner to contradict or overrule the Regulations

of the State Commission. As stated supra, the State Commission has

jurisdiction over transmission charges of state networks and the Central

Commission has jurisdiction over transmission charges of inter-state

networks as rightly pointed out by the counsel for the second

Respondent/SLDC. This Tribunal in the case of State Load Despatch

Centre, Gujarat held that the Appellant cannot seek to contend to the

contrary. The Central Commission does not mandate under Regulation

16(2) of CERC Regulation that the transmission charges to be determined

by the State Commission have to be for energy scheduled. The proviso

would only apply if the State Commission has not determined the

transmission charges, which is not the present case. In any case the

reference to MWh is due to the fact that the short term open access may

be sought for a certain number of hours and not necessarily for an entire

day. Therefore the MWh is the capacity multiplied by number of hours for

which the Applicant may be granted short term open access. In the instant

case, the Appellant had sought for and been granted open access for 24

MW for the entire day and, therefore, the MWh is 24 X 24 (per day). This

is also manifest from the fact that the GERC Open Access Regulations

also provide for transmission charges incorporating the number of hours

for which allocation is made vis-à-vis number of hours in the year

(Regulation 21 referred in Written Submissions of the Appellant). Hence,

the contention of the appellant seeking to distinguish collective transaction

from other transactions is not borne out by the GERC Open Access

Regulations and is contrary to the judgment of this Tribunal. Therefore, the

contention of the Appellant is neither acceptable nor has got any force to

contend his submissions contrary to Regulation 16(2) of the CERC

Regulation that the transmission charges to be determined by the State

Commission have to be for energy scheduled and the said proviso would

only apply if the State Commission has not determined the transmission

charges, which is not the case in hand. Therefore, there is no substance

in the submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant.

capacity and above hours and the NOC/Open Access would be granted

for those specific hours. In such cases where the open access is granted

only for part of the day, the capacity is reserved accordingly and the

transmission charges are to be paid for such part of the day. However, this

would apply only when the open access is granted for part of the day. It

does not mean that an Applicant can seek open access for the entire day

second amendment to the GERC Open Access Regulations applies

prospectively and not retrospectively. It is well settled principle that

subordinate legislation cannot be applied retrospectively.    It is, further,

contended that the Open Access Regulations and the principles of

determination of transmission charges for short term open access

provided therein cannot be challenged by the Appellant in the present

Appeal. It is a settled principle that the Regulations are binding and the

validity of the Regulations cannot be a subject matter of appeal. The

counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC has rightly pointed out that the

Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/163276075/" id="a_51">PTC India Limited v.

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission</a> (2010) 4 SCC 603 as held in

paragraphs 40, 59 &amp; 60 respectively. In the light of the ratio of law laid

down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the said paragraphs, the contentions

raised by the Appellant in regard to determination of transmission charges

for short-term open access cannot be considered. The Short Term Open

Access consumers are required to pay the transmission charges

determined in accordance with the Open Access Regulations.


</p><p id="p_141">56.   The contention of the learned counsel for the Appellant regarding

maximum capacity reserved is the capacity for which NOC was granted,

the counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC contended that the

Appellant had sought the facility of Short Term Open Access on the state

transmission system to sell electricity through the Indian Energy Exchange

as a collective transaction. The consent or NOC of the SLDC is required

for such open access on the state's transmission system and the same

has been recognized in the CERC Regulations, 2008 also. The second

Respondent/SLDC, after considering the surplus capacity available after

allotment to the Long and Medium Term Open Access, grants the

consent/NOC for a certain capacity in MW to the open access customer.

Once granted, such capacity is accounted for and kept reserved for the

open access customer. The spare capacity is considered at the time of

allocation, but once such allocation is made, this capacity is blocked. The

above capacity is not considered in the available surplus capacity

considered while granting open access to the subsequent applicants. It is,


                                                                     75 | P a g e

thus, wrong on the part of the Appellant to claim that there is no

reservation of capacity for short term open access. Merely because the

short term open access applicant has lowest priority for grant of open

access does not mean that there is no capacity reserved once the short

term open access is granted. The same capacity would not be granted to

another short term open access applicant. The Consent/NOC granted by

the second Respondent/SLDC is for a certain capacity, which is the

maximum capacity reserved for the short term open access customer.

Merely because the No Objection does not use the term 'maximum

capacity reserved' does not negate the clear the provisions of the GERC

Open Access Regulations. Otherwise, the above capacity for which

NOC/Consent is granted would have no relevance. The fact that the short

term open access also has capacity reserved is clear from the definition of

'Reserved Capacity' under the GERC Open Access Regulations.

Therefore, contentions of the Appellant are contrary to the specific

regulations of the first Respondent/GERC which are to be considered

even for collective transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_142">
</p><p id="p_143">57.   The term 'maximun capacity reserved' in Regulation 21 has to be

given a meaning, which is nothing but the capacity for which No

Objection/Consent has been given by the second Respondent/SLDC. This

is the 'maximum' capacity which can be utilized by the short term open

access customer. The Appellant has wrongly sought to rely on the terms


                                                                     76 | P a g e

"Maximum" "Ceiling" and "Up to" to claim that there was no reservation.

Since the GERC Open Access Regulations refer to the 'maximum capacity

reserved', the NOC also refers to Maximum/Ceiling/Up to to signify the

'maximum' capacity reserved. This only means that the Appellant is

entitled to inject the power of 24 MW but there is no obligation on the

Appellant to inject power exactly 24 MW but the Appellant can inject any

quantum of power up to 24 MW. This is the reason why the term "up to 24

MW" is used. But since the Appellant is entitled to inject 24 MW, the

transmission capacity of 24 MW has been reserved for the Appellant and

therefore the Appellant has to pay the transmission charges for 24 MW for

the entire day irrespective of whether the Appellant actually transmits

power or not. It is reiterated that no further allocation of short term open

access would be made for such 24 capacity for the said period.

future date after a period of over two years - of over ₹12 million with nil

possibility of recovery from his customers, like any sane business entity,

he would have acted prudently i.e. he would have added this part of the

cost to the purchasers of his power sold thru' Open Access to Exchange

or even not obtained NOC for such periods wherever not financially viable.

It is, further, the case of the Appellant that, if the cost of his product would

eventually turn out to be more than amount realized through sale of his

product, he would have refrained from any such transaction. Therefore,

the equity demands that Appellant cannot be put to a disadvantageous

position due to error committed by Respondent when the Appellant has no

such remedy available. The second Respondent/SLDC for over two years

kept on accepting Transmission Charges without any demur. Their raising

additional demand puts Appellant into disadvantageous position and

causes Appellant irreparable loss for no fault of his. To substantiate his

submissions, he paced reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_52">Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. vs. State of

Uttar Pradesh and Ors</a>. [1979 ]2SCR641 and another judgment by High

Court of Guwahati in the case of <a href="/doc/743747/" id="a_53">Union of India (UOI) vs. Raj Brothers</a> AIR

Supreme Court has allowed the appeal filed by the Appellant and set

aside the judgment of the High Court, and in its judgment, the High Court

of Guwahati has held that, the trial Court was not justified in directing the

appellant to refer such new claims raised by the plaintiff respondent for
                                                                         78 | P a g e

settlement by the arbitrator. The judgment and order passed by the trial

Court being vitiated is accordingly set aside and appeal filed by the

appellant succeeds with costs. Therefore, he submitted that, following the

ratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court and High Court, as

referred above, the order impugned passed by the first Respondent/GERC

is liable to be set aside directing the second Respondent/SLDC to refund

the payment made against the impugned bills along with interest @ 18%

per annum in the interest of justice and equity.

<p id="p_147">
</p><p id="p_148">      The learned counsel for the Appellant, further, submitted that, the

Appellant's claim for promissory estoppels has not been considered by the

first Respondent/GERC nor assigned any valid and cogent reason for

rejecting the claim of the Appellant regarding promissory estoppels.

Therefore, he submitted that, on this ground also the order impugned

passed by the first Respondent/GERC is liable to be set aside.


</p><p id="p_149">59.   The learned counsel for the first Respondent/GERC, on this issue,

recovery of Transmission Charges from the Appellant vide its invoice

dated 28.01.2015 for the Financial Year 2013-14 and invoice dated

16.04.2015 for the Financial Year 2012-13. Further, the Appellant has

contended that the second Respondent/SLDC is barred from recovering

any dues which falls beyond a period of 2 years from the date when such

dues first fell due as per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_54">Section 56</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. As per

                                                                     79 | P a g e

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_55">section 56</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, in its entirety, this Tribunal in the

case of <a href="/doc/193076/" id="a_56">Ajmer Vidhyut Vitarant Nigam Limited vs. RERC</a> particularly, in

paragraph nos. 32 to 39, a conjoined reading of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_57">Section 56</a> of the

Electricity Act, 2003 and the aforesaid judgment of this Tribunal leads to a

conclusion that <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_58">Section 56(2)</a> particularly provides for a barrier from

disconnection with regard to default in payment of any pending due(s) that

lies beyond a period of 2 years. However, there is no bar in the said

section on the licensee/generating Company from recovering any pending

due(s) that is beyond the period of 2 years but within the general limitation

period of 3 years as provided under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_59">Limitation Act</a>, 1963. In the case

at hand, it is beyond dispute that the invoices dated 28.01.2015 and

16.04.2015 are raised by the Respondent no. 2 on the Appellant within a

period of 3 years period from the date of grant of Open Access to the

Appellant. Therefore, he submitted that the first Respondent/GERC

considering the case in hand as per the prevalent GERC Regulations

along with the First Amendment held domain for recovery of transmission

charges on reserved capacity basis until 13.08.2014 i.e. prior to coming

into effect, the Second Amendment. He, further, contended that the

second Respondent has recovered charges from the Appellant on

scheduled capacity (energy) basis instead of reserved capacity basis,

when the GERC Regulations along with the First Amendment specifically

envisaged the latter under an erroneous application of the said

Regulation. Thus, it is this error that was rectified by the second
                                                                       80 | P a g e

Respondent/SLDC and the consequent supplementary invoices were

raised for the under-billed balance amounts.       Hence, the recovery by

second Respondent/SLDC cannot be termed as recovery based of

retrospective applicability of GERC Regulations. Further, estoppel cannot

be pleaded against a statute or law and Regulations are a sub-legislative

function conferred on the State Commission(s) having statutory force.

Therefore, the stand taken by the Appellant has got no substance and is

liable to be rejected. The invoices raised by the second Respondent/SLDC

are strictly in consonance with the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_60">Electricity Act</a>

and Rules and, therefore, interference by this Tribunal does not call for.


</p><p id="p_150">60.   The learned counsel for the second Respondent/SLDC contended

that, as per GERC Open Access Regulations, second Respondent/SLDC

is vested with the power to collect the transmission charges. Therefore,

second Respondent/SLDC is entitled to recover transmission charges for

the open access granted as per the GERC Open Access Regulations

which provided for transmission charges on maximum capacity reserved.

There is no aspect of any dominant position in the present case. The

second Respondent/SLDC has only collected the transmission charges as

per the GERC Open Access Regulations and Tariff Orders passed by the

first Respondent/GERC. He further, contended that, if by inadvertence,

there was under-recovery of the amounts, the differential amount can be

recovered subsequently by raising corrected invoices/supplementary


                                                                        81 | P a g e

invoices. The invoices raised by the second Respondent/SLDC are not

invalid merely because they were raised subsequently. This is particularly,

when the claim for transmission charges had not been time barred. The

Appellant's claim of application of promissory estoppel is misconceived.

There can be no application of such concept of estoppel in the instant

case. He, further, vehemently contended that the Appellant had not raised

the issue of doctrine of estoppel/promissory estoppel in the Petition before

the State Commission or even in the Memorandum Appeal. Therefore, the

said contention raised by the Appellant for the first time in this appeal and

the same cannot be acceptable and liable to be rejected at threshold. To

substantiate his submission, he placed reliance on the judgment of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_61">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd.v.

Commercial Tax Officer and Ors</a>. (2005) 1 SCC 625, wherein the Hon'ble

Apex Court has held in paragraph 19 of its judgment that foundation has

to be laid in the Petition itself by invoking the doctrine of promissory

estoppels. The Appellant has not taken this ground in its petition filed

before the first Respondent/GERC nor he pleaded any specific ground in

the memo of appeal before this Tribunal, therefore, on this ground, the

contentions of the Appellant may be rejected at threshold.


OUR CONSIDERATION:
</p>
<p id="p_151">
</p><p id="p_152">61.   After careful consideration of the submissions of the learned counsel

for the Appellant and the learned counsel for the Respondent Nos. 1 and

                                                                       82 | P a g e

2, we are of the considered view that the submissions of the counsel for

the Appellant regarding Doctrine of Estoppel/Promissory Estoppel, are

misconceived for the reason that as per GERC Open Access Regulations,

second Respondent/SLDC is vested with the power to collect the

transmission charges and is entitled to recover transmission charges for

the open access granted as per the GERC Open Access Regulations

which provided for transmission charges on maximum capacity reserved.


</p><p id="p_153">62.   In the instant case, the second Respondent/SLDC has only collected

the transmission charges as per the GERC Open Access Regulations and

Tariff Orders passed by the first Respondent/GERC. It is significant to

note that, if by inadvertence, there was under-recovery of the amounts;

the differential amount can be recovered subsequently by raising

corrected invoices/supplementary invoices. Therefore, the obligation of the

Appellants/short term open access customer to pay the transmission

charges as per the GERC Open Access Regulations and Tariff Orders.

They cannot deny the liability merely because the invoice was raised

subsequently. The invoices raised by SLDC are not invalid merely

because they were raised subsequently.      This is particularly when the

claim for transmission charges had not been time barred. There had been

an under-recovery of the transmission charges for the relevant period and

the second Respondent/SLDC had sought to recover the said amount.

The second Respondent/SLDC cannot be prevented from recovery of


                                                                     83 | P a g e
                                                                 Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


legitimate dues.      Therefore, the contention of the Appellant claiming

application of promissory estoppel is misconceived and there was no

application of such concept of estoppel in the instant case on the ground

that   the   Appellant     had    not   raised    the   issue     of    doctrine        of

estoppel/promissory estoppel in the Petition before the State Commission

or even in the Memorandum Appeal before this Tribunal. It is a well settled

law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and by this Tribunal in hosts of

judgments that the foundation has to be laid in the Petition itself by

invoking the doctrine of estoppels. It is worthwhile to refer the judgment in

the case of <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_62">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer and

Ors</a>. (2005) 1 SCC 625, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in

paragraph 19 of its judgment, which is reproduced hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">       "19. In order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear,
       sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by
       the party invoking the doctrine and bald expressions without any
       supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted
       because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position
       relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient
       to press into aid the doctrine. The courts are bound to consider all
       aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public
       good at large, because while considering the applicability of the
       doctrine, the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles
       of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the court."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_80">                                                    (Emphasis Supplied)




                                                                             84 | P a g e
                                                           Judgment in Appeal No. 83 of 2018


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_81">63.   It is pertinent to note that since the Appellant had not invoked the

doctrine of estoppels nor presented any supporting material, the same

cannot be considered. Without prejudice to the above, doctrine of

estoppels in any case not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the

case in hand on the ground that the Estoppel/Promissory Estoppel arises

only when there is a clear and unequivocal assurance or promise by a

party to induce the other party to believe in a position which is relied on by

another party and acted upon. In the instant case, there was no such

assurance or promise by the second Respondent/SLDC that the

transmission charges would be charged as per energy scheduled and not

on the basis of capacity reserved. Therefore, the Appellant has not placed

on record any such promise or assurance. In the judgments relied on by

the Appellant, there was a specific promise by the Government that an

exemption would be provided for three years and on that basis, the person

had set up an industry. The facts of the instant case are entirely different.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_154">Therefore, reliance placed by the counsel for the Appellant is not

applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. Thus,

when the Open Access Regulations provide for transmission charges on

capacity reserved, the Appellant cannot invoke the doctrine of estoppel to

claim contrary to the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). It is pertinent to

note that the said doctrine would not apply when payments/non payments

have been made due to a mistake. It is well settled principle that any

amount paid/received without authority of law has to return and can be
                                                                       85 | P a g e

adjusted as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chandi

Prasad Uniyal v State of Uttarakhand and Others (2012) 8 SCC 417,

which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">      "14. We are ........ Payments are being effected in many situations
      without any authority of law and payments have been received by
      the recipients also without any authority of law. Any amount
      paid/received without the authority of law can always be recovered
      barring few exceptions of extreme hardship but not as a matter of
      right, in such situations law implies an obligation on the payee to
      repay the money, otherwise it would amount to unjust enrichment"

      Therefore, the ground and the submissions/stands taken by the

learned    counsel       for   the   Appellant    regarding      Doctrine          of

Estoppel/Promissory Estoppel cannot be acceptable and it is liable to be

rejected at threshold.
