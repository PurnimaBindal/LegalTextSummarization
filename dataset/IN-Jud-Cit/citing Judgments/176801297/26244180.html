                  I.A.14992/2022

                  1.       This application has been filed by the plaintiff praying that the
                  additional documents filed by it on 09.09.2022 be taken on record.
                  2.       The plaintiff asserts that the additional documents are being filed
                  to show that the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; is common to trade and that the filing of
                  these documents has been necessitated due to the stand taken by the
                  defendant in its written statement.
                  3.       For reasons stated in the application, and as the suit is at an initial
                  stage, the application is allowed, and the additional documents are taken
                  on record.
                  4.       This order shall, however, not be read as accepting the
                  admissibility or effect of these documents, and shall be without prejudice

                  5.       I.A. No. 7825 of 2022 has been filed by the plaintiff praying for
                  the grant of an ad-interim injunction restraining the defendant from
                  manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or
                  indirectly dealing in medicinal preparations under the mark &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27;
                  or any other trademark which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s
                  trademark &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;.
                  6.       This Court, vide order dated 19.05.2022, was pleased to pass ad-
                  interim ex-parte order restraining the defendant from using the mark
                  &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27; or any other trademark which is deceptively similar to the
                  plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;.
                  7.       I.A. No. 9523 of 2022 was thereafter filed by the defendant under
                  Order XXXIX Rule 4 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil
                  Procedure, 1908 (in short, the &#x27;CPC&#x27;) praying for setting aside the order

                  use&#x27;. The plaintiff has been recorded as the subsequent proprietor of the
                  said trade mark with the Trade Mark Registry.
</p><p id="p_2">                  9.       The plaintiff further asserts in the plaint that it was only in the first
                  week of May, 2022, that the plaintiff came across the defendant&#x27;s
                  application seeking registration of the impugned mark &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27;
                  under application no. 4624943 dated 25.08.2020 on a „proposed to be
                  used‟ basis in Class 05; and the same was immediately opposed by the
                  plaintiff on 04.05.2022.
</p><p id="p_3">                  10.      The plaintiff further asserts that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;
                  was cited in the Examination Report against the trade mark application of
                  the defendant, and the defendant vide reply dated 27.10.2020 stated that
                  the cited mark, that is, &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;, is different, phonetically as also
                  visually, from the defendant&#x27;s mark. It was further contended that the
                  defendant is the registered proprietor of various &#x27;ZEST&#x27; trade marks. The
                  trade mark application of the defendant was thereafter advertised on
                  31.01.2022 and is pending consideration before the Trade Marks
                  Registry.
</p><p id="p_4">                  11.      The plaintiff asserts that the adoption of a similar mark to that of
                  the plaintiff by the defendant amounts to infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                  trade mark as also passing off and unfair competition.
</p><p id="p_5">                  12.      As noted hereinabove, based on the assertions of the plaintiff and
                  the documents filed with the plaint, this Court on 19.05.2022 passed an
                  ad-interim ex-parte order of injunction against the defendant restraining
                  the defendant from selling its medicinal preparations under the impugned
                  mark &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27;.

</p><p id="p_7">                  13.      The defendant in its application, being I.A. No.9523 of 2022, has
                  asserted that the plaintiff obtained the above ad-interim ex-parte order of
                  injunction by concealing various material facts from this Court. It is
                  asserted that the defendant is a leading manufacturer and distributor of
                  pharmaceutical products in the domestic and international markets. It is a
                  registered proprietor of the trade mark &#x27;ZEST&#x27; since the year 1983, and
                  has a family of registered trade marks, with &#x27;ZEST&#x27; forming a part of

                  the &#x27;ZEST&#x27; Family of Marks. The said opposition is still pending

</p><p id="p_9">                  15.      The plaintiff thereafter applied for registration of its mark
                  &#x27;TRIOLMEZEST&#x27;, which was also opposed by the defendant on
                  30.12.2014 on the ground of the defendant being the registered proprietor
                  of the &#x27;ZEST&#x27; Family of Marks. Even for the subject-mark, that is,
                  &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;, when the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff applied for
                  registration, the defendant&#x27;s mark &#x27;FERIZEST&#x27; was cited as a
                  conflicting mark. The plaintiff has also not disclosed the reply that was
                  filed by the plaintiff/its predecessor-in-interest before the Trade Mark
                  Registry against the said Examination Report. It is the case of the
                  defendant that the plaintiff has intentionally not disclosed the above facts
                  in its plaint, and is, therefore, guilty of concealing material facts.
                  SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE

</p>
<p id="p_10">                  16.      Mr.Darpan Wadhwa, the learned senior counsel for the defendant,
                  submits that the above facts were material to be disclosed by the plaintiff
                  in the plaint as they would have clearly disproved the assertion of the
                  plaintiff that it came to know of the defendant and their use of the mark
                  &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27; only in the first week of May, 2022. In fact, it would also
                  have shown to this Court that the defendant has numerous registrations,
                  of which the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; is an important and integral part, and it is the
                  plaintiff, who with a mala fide intent, is trying to usurp the same. Placing

                  referred to as the &#x27;Act&#x27;), being I.A. No.14991 of 2022, has further
                  asserted that the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; has a dictionary meaning, that is, &#x27;feeling
                  of enjoyment, excitement and enthusiasm&#x27;. He submits that, in fact, the
                  plaintiff has further asserted that the mark &#x27;ZEST&#x27; is itself publici juris
                  and is incapable of being monopolized by anyone. Therefore, the
                  impugned mark, being a combination of the words &#x27;FOR&#x27; and &#x27;ZEST&#x27;,
                  is clearly descriptive of the pharmaceutical goods of the plaintiff, and no
                  exclusivity can be claimed by the plaintiff in such a mark.

                  PLAINTIFF:

<p id="p_13">                  19.      On the other hand, Mr.Sachin Gupta, the learned counsel for the
                  plaintiff, though was not available at the time of oral submissions, by
                  way of written submissions, has asserted that the marks of the plaintiff
                  and the defendant are deceptively similar and, therefore, the plaintiff is
                  entitled to the ad-interim protection as had been granted by this Court
                  vide order dated 19.05.2022.

                  pharmaceutical goods, wherein the threshold of confusion is low, the test
                  of deceptive similarity is stringent, with public interest being paramount.
                  The use of the medicinal preparations of the plaintiff and the defendant is
                  different, with the medicinal preparation of the plaintiff targeting erectile
                  dysfunction in men, while the medicinal preparation of the defendant is a
                  multivitamin for pregnant women for lowering the risk of pre-term births.
                  Thus, any confusion between the two marks can lead to wrongful
                  consumption of the pharmaceutical goods by an unwary consumer, which
                  in turn will lead to disastrous consequences. He submits that the

                  defendant has, therefore, rightly been injuncted by this Court from selling
                  its pharmaceutical goods under the mark &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27;. In support, he
                  places reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_9">Cadila Health
                  Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., (2001) 5 SCC 73; the

                  derived from the salt &#x27;TADALFIL&#x27; and is, therefore, entitled to
                  protection.
</p><p id="p_16">                  22.      He submits that the defendant cannot rely upon the registrations
                  obtained by it in the &#x27;ZEST&#x27; Family of Marks, inasmuch as, the
                  argument of &#x27;family of marks&#x27; is available only to a plaintiff and not to a
                  defendant. In this regard, he places reliance on the celebrated text of
                  „McCarthy           on   Trademarks   and    Unfair     Competition&#x27;,        2007

</p><p id="p_17">                  23.      He further submits that not only the plaintiff has other registrations
                  with the mark &#x27;ZEST&#x27;, but there are also third parties co-existing in the
                  market using different trade marks with the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; as either a
                  prefix or a suffix, therefore, the defendant cannot claim any exclusivity
                  over the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27;. &#x27;ZEST&#x27;, even otherwise, is a common dictionary
                  word over which no one person can claim exclusivity.

                  2009 citing its &#x27;ZEST&#x27; Family of Marks. The plaintiff then sought the

                                           the withdrawal letter dated 15.04.2014 has erred
                                           in not appreciating that the same was
                                           concealment of a material fact having bearing on
                                           the case of the respondent/plaintiff. The mere fact
                                           that the appellants themselves have applied for
                                           registration of its trademark does not, in any
                                           manner, help the case of the respondents. What is
                                           material is the stand taken by the respondents in
                                           the plaint and in other proceedings and not the
                                           conduct of the appellants/defendants. A party who
                                           approaches the Court for grant of a discretionary
                                           relief has to approach the Court with clean hands.
                                           The respondents clearly did not do so.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                           18. We are of the view that the interim
                                           injunction is liable to be vacated in view of
                                           various factors. First of all, the respondents
                                           themselves have taken a categorical stand that the
                                           word „SHRI RAM‟ is the name of a popular figure
                                           and deity in Hinduism and no one proprietor can
                                           claim exclusive rights on the mark „SHRI RAM‟.
                                           Secondly, their stand that the mark „SHRI RAM‟ is
                                           common to trade and several „SHRI RAM‟
                                           formulative marks are peacefully co-existing on
                                           the register of trademark. Thirdly, the appellants
                                           have prima facie shown that there were several
                                           schools in existence using the name „SHRI RAM‟
                                           in existence even prior to the adoption of the mark
                                           by the respondents. Fourthly, the respondents are
                                           guilty of concealment and misrepresentation and,
                                           lastly, discretion should not be exercised in
                                           favour, of a person who approaches the court with
                                           unclean hands.&quot;

                                           purpose of grant of interim injunction. Though the
                                           senior counsel for the plaintiff contended that
                                           what is stated by the advocates for the plaintiff in
                                           the aforesaid communications is a submission of
                                           law made in the context and the plaintiff cannot be
                                           bound thereby, but it cannot be said that the said
                                           contention makes the fact aforesaid „not relevant‟.
                                           The fact, that the plaintiff took a stand, not so long
                                           back, that (i) „ATORVAKIND‟ is different from
                                           „ATORKIND‟ and that (ii) „STARKIND‟ is
                                           different from „KINDERPLEX‟, „KINDERBON‟,

                                           „KINDMAX‟ and „KINDFLOX-OZ‟, certainly has
                                           a weightage for purposes of interim injunction,
                                           specially     ex-parte.     The      plaintiff,   while
                                           approaching this Court for ex parte relief against
                                           the defendants, concealed the said relevant fact
                                           from this Court and called upon the Court to,
                                           without the said fact being before the Court, grant
                                           injunction against the defendant. Such conduct of
                                           the plaintiff disentitles the plaintiff to the equitable
                                           relief, at least at this stage. I must however state
                                           that thought has indeed crossed my mind, whether

                  its reply to the Examination Report, at least at the stage of consideration
                  of the relief of ad-interim injunction, is relevant, and the plaintiff, when
                  approaching the Court, has to make a clean breast of the state of affairs
                  and ought to have informed the Court so on the very first date when the
                  suit comes up before this Court alongwith the application for interim
                  relief, including ex-parte relief against the defendant, to enable the Court
                  to consider the grant/non-grant of ex-parte relief, in the light of all facts.

                  Examination Report was, therefore, a material document and though may
                  or may not act as an estoppel, would certainly be relevant to be
                  considered while determining the prayer of the plaintiff for grant of an
                  ad-interim ex-parte relief based on the registration granted. In the case of
                  Teleecare Network India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), there was no concealment of
                  material facts, therefore, the judgment is of no assistance to the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_28">                  33.      The grant of an ad-interim injunction is a discretionary relief. In
                  K.D. Sharma (supra), the Supreme Court emphasized the necessity of
                  the petitioner (herein, the plaintiff) approaching the Court with clean
                  hands, putting forward all the facts before the Court, without concealing
                  or suppressing anything. It was further emphasized that if there is no
                  candid disclosure of relevant and material facts, the petition (herein, the
                  application) may be dismissed at the threshold, without considering the
                  merits of the claim. The said principle was reiterated by the Supreme
                  Court in Ramjas Foundation (supra) and Amar Singh (supra). In fact,
                  such concealment is sufficient to vacate the ad-interim ex-parte order of
                  injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff. Reference in this regard may
                  be made to the judgments of this Court in Kent RO System (supra),

                  and the order of this Court dated 20.10.2022 in Phonographic
                  Performance Limited (supra).
</p><p id="p_29">                  34.      I also find merit in the submission of the learned senior counsel for
                  the defendant that the mark of the plaintiff is descriptive in nature. The
                  plaintiff has itself stated in its application under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_16">Sections 124</a> and <a href="/doc/1313062/" id="a_17">125</a> of
                  the Act, being I.A. No. 14991 of 2022, that the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; has a
                  dictionary meaning, that is, &#x27;feeling of enjoyment, excitement and
                  enthusiasm&#x27;. The medicinal preparation of the plaintiff is intended for
                  treating erectile dysfunction in men. Therefore, clearly, the mark is
                  descriptive to its product, being a combination of the words &#x27;FOR&#x27; and
                  &#x27;ZEST&#x27;. The plaintiff has further asserted in its replication, as also in I.A.
                  No.14991 of 2022, that the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; is publici juris, and no person
                  can claim exclusivity over the same. On this assertion itself, the claim of
                  exclusivity of the plaintiff on its mark relying on the registration thereof
                  should ideally fail. The descriptive nature of the mark need not only be
                  because of its adoption from the name of its ingredient but may even be
                  because of its inherent nature and use.
</p><p id="p_30">                  35.      Having considered the above, and inspite of the above, in the
                  present case, prima facie, the mark of the plaintiff, that is &#x27;FORZEST&#x27;,
                  is deceptively similar to the mark of the defendant, that is &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27;;
                  with the only difference being in the alphabet &#x27;R&#x27; being replaced in the
                  mark of the defendant by the alphabet &#x27;L&#x27;. In considering the relief
                  prayed for by the plaintiff, it is also important to note that the medicine of
                  the plaintiff is for treating erectile dysfunction in men, while the
                  medicinal preparation of the defendant is a multivitamin for pregnant

                                           of trade mark in respect of medicinal products as
                                           against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are
                                           poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal
                                           products may, therefore, be life threatening, not
                                           merely inconvenient. Noting the frailty of human
                                           nature and the pressures placed by society on
                                           doctors, there should be as many clear indicators
                                           as possible to distinguish two medicinal products
                                           from each other. It is not uncommon that in
                                           hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or
                                           under critical/pressure situations. Many patients
                                           may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not
                                           be in a position to differentiate between the

                  spite of the concealment and misstatement of the plaintiff, the plaintiff
                  shall be entitled to an ad-interim relief if the marks of the medicinal
                  goods are deceptively similar to each other.

                  mark &#x27;FORZEST&#x27; under the application no. 1171650 dated 04.02.2003
                  in Class 05, has also contended that the said mark has been used since the
                  year 2003. The plaintiff has given the figures of sales for the medicinal
                  product sold under the said mark for the financial years 2004-05 to 2020-
                  21, asserting that such sales have grown from Rs.95.31 Lakh (Rupees
                  Ninety-Five Lakh Thirty-One Thousand only) in the financial year 2004-
                  05 to Rs.187.53 Lakh (Rupees One Hundred Eighty-Seven Lakh Thirty-
                  Three Thousand only) in the financial year 2020-21. The plaintiff has
                  further asserted that the defendant applied for the registration of its mark
                  &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27; under application no. 4624943 dated 25.08.2020 claiming
                  the same is still „proposed to be used‟ in Class 05. The plaintiff submits
                  that it is only in the second week of May, 2022 that the plaintiff came
                  across the defendant&#x27;s products being sold online on various e-

                  marks having &#x27;ZEST&#x27; as a predominant feature. Pertinently, the
                  defendant has not filed any counter-claim against the plaintiff. In

                  establish that it has a &#x27;family of marks&#x27; and may rely upon the same for
                  contending that the defendant&#x27;s mark, which incorporates the &#x27;family of
                  marks&#x27;, is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff&#x27;s. However, the text
                  very explicitly states that the doctrine of &#x27;family of marks&#x27; is an argument
                  available only to a plaintiff asserting its rights, not to a defendant to
                  prove its defence against a plaintiff&#x27;s intervening rights.
</p><p id="p_35">                  40.      In my opinion, the above text is based on the principal that where
                  the plaintiff has, in spite of the defendant having a &#x27;family of marks‟,
                  established goodwill in a mark that may even be forming a part of the
                  „family of the marks‟ of the defendant, the defendant cannot later adopt a
                  mark deceptively similar to the that of the plaintiff, relying upon its
                  „family of marks‟.
</p><p id="p_36">                  41.      In the present case, the defendant has asserted that it is selling
                  more than sixty-five different products. Out of these, eighteen are
                  claimed to have &#x27;ZEST&#x27; as a predominant feature of the mark/name of
                  the medicinal goods. Certain pending applications also bearing &#x27;ZEST&#x27;
                  as a predominant part of the mark are stated in the written statement filed
                  by the defendant. The defendant, however, by that assertion alone cannot
                  claim a right to adopt a deceptively similar mark to that of the plaintiff,
                  especially where the mark of the plaintiff has been in long use. The
                  defendant would have to prove exclusivity over the mark &#x27;ZEST&#x27; in all
                  its variants to succeed in its defence.

                  the date of launch of its medicinal good under the impugned mark

                  the first week of May, 2022 that it came across the medicine of the
                  defendant with the impugned mark, remains unrebutted, at least, at this
                  stage. I may herein note that the Local Commissioner appointed by this
                  Court vide order dated 19.05.2022, had seized certain data, which shows
                  the medicine under the mark &#x27;FOLZEST&#x27; being marketed by the
                  defendant from sometime in June, 2021, however, even that would make
                  the defendant a subsequent user and adopter of the said mark. A right of a
                  prior user of the mark shall always prevail. [Ref: <a href="/doc/120264982/" id="a_18">Neon Laboratories Ltd
                  v. Medical Technologies Ltd</a>., (2016) 2 SCC 672]
</p><p id="p_38">                  43.      The defendant has also contended that there is no possibility of
                  confusion being caused on account of the packaging of the two medicinal
                  products being different. The same assertion, however, again does not
                  impress me. The medicines are sold by their trade mark/trade name
                  which, in the present case, I have found prima facie to be deceptively
                  similar to each other. For an unwary consumer with average intelligence
                  and imperfect recollection, the differences that are sought to be
                  highlighted by the defendant in its application under Order XXXIX Rule
                  4 read with Section 151 of the CPC cannot nullify the possibility of
                  confusion.

                  prefix, and is publici juris. It also has a dictionary meaning and,

                  been registered since the year 1983. It is further the assertion of the
                  defendant, which has also not been denied by the plaintiff, that this mark
                  was cited by the defendant in opposition to the applications filed by the

                  challenge the registration granted in favour of the defendant for the mark
                  &#x27;ZEST&#x27;. At least, this has not been pleaded by the plaintiff in the Suit or
                  in this application. There was, therefore, clearly a case of acquiescence in
