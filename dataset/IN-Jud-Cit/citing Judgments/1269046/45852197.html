<p id="p_6">     Whether by	 virtue of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_1">Article 105</a> of the Constitution a
Member of  Parliament can claim immunity from prosecution on
a charge  of bribery  in a  criminal court,  and  whether  a
Member of  Parliament is  a "public  servant" falling within
the purview  of	 the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_2">Prevention  of  Corruption  Act</a>,	1986
[hereinafter referred  to as  `the 1988 Act']. These are the
two questions  which have  come up  for consideration before
this bench in these matters.
</p><p id="p_7">     In the General Election for the Tenth Lok Sabha held in
1991 the  Congress (I)	part, emerged  as the single largest
party and  it formed  the Government  with P.V. Narsimha Rao
[hereinafter referred  to as `A-1] as the Prime Minister. In
the Monsoon  Session of Lok Sabha July 1993 a `No Confidence
Motion' was  moved  against  the  Government  by  Shri	Ajay
Mukhopadhyaya, a  CPI(M) M.P.  At that	time  the  effective
strength of  the House	(Lok Sabha) was 528 and Congress (I)
party had 251 members. It was short by 14 members for simple
majority. The  Motion of  No-Confidence	 was  taken  up	 for
discussion in  the Lok	Sabha on July 20 1993 and the debate
continued till	July 28, 1993. The motion was thereafter put
to vote.  The motion was defeated with 251 members voting in
favour of  the motion,	while  265  voting  against  it.  On
February 28, 1996, on Shri Ravindra Kumar of Rashtriya Mukti
Morcha filed  a complaint  dated February  1, 1996  with the
Central Bureau of Investigation [for short `CBI'] wherein it
was alleged  that in  July 1993	 a criminal  conspiracy	 was
hatched by  A-1, Satish	 Sharma [hereinafter  referred to as
`A-2], Ajit Singh [hereinafter referred to as `A-13], Bhajan
Lal [hereinafter  referred to  as `A-14],  V.C. Shukla, R.K.
Dhawan and  Lalit Suri to prove a majority of the Government
on the	floor of  the House  on July  28,  1993	 by  bribing
Members	 of   Parliament  of  different	 political  parties,
individuals and	 groups of an amount of over Rs.3 crores and
that in furtherance of the said criminal conspiracy a sum of
Rs. 1.10  crores  was  handed  over  by	 the  aforementioned
persons, except	 A-15, to Suraj Mandal [hereinafter referred
to as  `A-3]. On  the basis  of the  said complain  the	 CBI
registered four	 cases under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_3">Section 13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/852315/" id="a_4">Section

belonging to  the Jharkhand  Mukti Morcha  party [for  short
`JMM']. Subsequently in pursuance of the order dated May 24,
1996 passed  by the  Delhi High Court in Civil Writ Petition
No. 23/96  another case	 was registered	 on  June  11,	1996
against A-1,  A-2, A-3,	 A-4, A-5,  A-6,  A-14,	 A-15.	V.C.
Shukla, R.K.  Dhawan, Lalit  Suri and  others under  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_5">Section

investigation, the  CBI submitted  three charge sheets dated
October 30,  1996, December  9, 1996 and January 22, 1977 in
the court  of Special  Judge, New Delhi. In the first charge
sheet  dated   October	30,   1996  it	 was   stated	that
investigation had  revealed that A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, A-
6, Buta	 Singh [hereinafter referred to as `A-7'], and other
unknown persons entered into a criminal conspiracy to defeat

also stated  in the charge sheet that investigation has also
revealed that  the four	 Members of  Parliament belonging to
JMM had	 been bribed  in crores	 of rupees for voting agains
the `No	 Confidence Motion'. The said charge sheet was filed
against A-1,  A-2, A-3,	 A-4, A-5,  A-6 and  A-7   and other
unknown persons	 in respect  of offences under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_11">Section 120-B</a>

criminal conspiracy which is the subject matter of the first
charge sheet  filed on	October 30, 1996 and in pursuance to
the said  criminal conspiracy  they had	 arranged funds	 and
bribed the  four JMM  MPs as  the motive  or award to secure

13(1)(d)(iii)</a> of  the  1988  Act  and  substantive  offences
thereunder along  with the  original seven  accused. In	 the
third  charge  sheet  dated  January  22,  1997,  which	 was
described as  `Supplementary Charge  Sheet No.	2',  it	 was
stated that  further investigation has been carried on under
<a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_21">Section 173(8)</a>	of Cr.	P.C. and  as a	result	identity  of

Gulam Mohd. Khan [hereinafter referred to as `A-21] and late
G.C. Munda  [hereinafter referred  to  as  `A-22'].  It	 was
stated that  even after securing the support of four JMM MPs
in the manner stated in the first charge sheet dated October
30, 1996  and second charge sheet dated December 9, 1996 the
Congress (I)  Government still	required the support of some
more MPs  and that  with this objective the Congress (I) led
by A-1	was making  efforts to win the support of some other
MPs including  MPs belonging  to Janta Dal (Ajit Group) [for
short `JD(a)].	In the	charge sheet it was also stated that
A-14, A-15,  A-16, A-17,  A-18, A-19,  A-20, A-21  and A-22'
were parties to the criminal conspiracy along with A-1 to A-
13 already  named in  the earlier  two charge  sheets and in
pursuance to  the said criminal conspiracy A-14 had arranged
funds and  had paid  bribes to A-15 and the seven MPs of the
breakaway JD(A) as a motive or award to secure their support
to defeat  the `No  Confidence Motion  and thereby committed
the offences  punishable under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_22">Section 120-B</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_23">Section
7</a>, <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_24">12</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_25">13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/852315/" id="a_26">Section 13(1)(d)(iii)</a> of the 1988 Act
and substantive offences thereunder.
</p><p id="p_8">     An application  was submitted by A-6 (Shailendra Mahto)
under <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_27">Section  306</a> Cr.	P.C. for  grant of  pardon for being
treated as an approver. The said application was referred to
the Magistrate for recording his statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_28">Section 164</a>
Cr. P.C.  and  after  considering  the	said  statement	 the
Special Judge,	by order  dated April  5, 1997,	 allowed the
application of	A-6  and  tendered  pardon  to	him  on	 the
condition of  his making  a full  and true disclosure of all
the circumstances  within  his	knowledge  relating  to	 the
offences of  every other  person  concerned,  whether  as  a
principal or abettor in the commission of the offences under
the charge  sheets. After  hearing the arguments on charges,
the Special Judge passed the order dated May 6, 1997 wherein
he held	 that there  is sufficient  evidence  on  record  to
justify framing of charges against all the appellants. In so
far as	A-1, A-2,  A-7 and  A-8' to  A-14 are concerned, the
Special Judge  held that  there is  sufficient	evidence  on
record to justify framing of charges under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_29">Section 120-B</a> IPC
read with  <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_30">Section 7</a>,  <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_31">12</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_32">13(2)</a>, read with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_33">Section 13(1)(d)</a>
of the	1998 Act and also for substantive offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_34">Section 12</a> of the 1988 Act against all of them. So far
as A-3	to A-5	and A-15  to A-21 are concerned, the Special
Judge held  that there	is sufficient  evidence on record to
justify framing of charges under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_35">Section 120-B</a> IPC read with
<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_36">Section 7</a>,<a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_37">12</a>,  <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_38">13(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_39">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of t he 1988
Act  and   as  well   as  charges  for	substantive  offence
punishable under  <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_40">Section 7</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_41">Section  13(2)</a>  read	with
<a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_42">Section 13(1)(d)</a>  of the  1988 Act  against all of them. The
Special Judge  also held  that there is prima facie evidence
of commission  of offence  under <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_43">Section  193</a> IPC by accused
Nos. A-3 to A-5.
</p><p id="p_9">     Before the	 Special Judge,	 an objection  was raised  n
behalf of  the accused	persons that the jurisdiction of the
Court to try the case was barred under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_44">Article 105(2)</a> of the
Constitution because  the trial	 is in	respect	 of  matters
which relate  to the  privileges and immunities of the House
of Parliament  (Lok Sabha)  and its  Members inasmuch as the
foundation  of	the  charge  sheets  is	 the  allegation  of
acceptance of bribe by some Members of Parliament for voting
against the  `No Confidence Motion' and that the controversy
to be decided in this case would be in respect of the motive
and action  of Members	of Parliament pertaining to the vote
given by  them in  relation to	the  `No Confidence Motion'.
The Special  Judge rejected  the said contention on the view
that in	 the present  case voting  pattern  of	the  accused
persons was  not under	adjudication and they were sought to
be  tried   for	 their	 illegal  acts	 committed   outside
Parliament, i.e.,  demanding and  accepting  the  bribe	 for
exercising their  franchise in	a particular manner, and the
accused persons	 are not  being	 prosecuted  for  exercising
their right  of vote  but they	are being  prosecuted on the
allegations that they while holding a public office demanded
and accepted  illegal  gratification  for  exercising  their
franchise  in  a  particular  manner  which  is	 an  offence
punishable under  the 1988  Act and  that <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_45">Article 105</a> of the
Constitution does  not provide any protection to the accused
persons.  Another  contention  that  was  urged	 before	 the
Special Judge  was that	 a Member  of Parliament  is  not  a
public servant	for the	 purpose of the 1988 Act and as such
giving and  taking of the alleged illegal gratification does
not amount to any offence punishable under the provisions of
the 1988  Act and  there cannot be any offence of conspiracy
of giving and taking of bribe by a Member of Parliament. The
said contention	 was rejected  by the  Special Judge  on the
view that  the question	 whether a Member of Parliament is a
public servant	is concluded  by the  decision of  the Delhi
High Court  in the cases of <a href="/doc/111334/" id="a_46">L.K. Advani v. Central Bureau of
Investigation</a> wherein  it  has	been  held  that  Member  of
Parliament is  a public	 servant under	the 1988 Act. It was
also urged  before the Special Judge that the case could not
be proceeded  against the  accused  persons  since  previous
sanction for  prosecution under	 <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_47">Section 19</a>  of the 1988 Act
had not been obtained. The said contention was also rejected
by the Special Judge on the ground that no previous sanction
of prosecution	for an	accuse under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_48">Section 19</a> is necessary
if he has ceased to hold a public office which was allegedly
misuse by  him and in the present case at the time of filing
of the charge sheets and on the sate of taking of cognizance
by the	Court Tenth  Lok Sabha	had come to an end and after
the Election  in 1996  at the  accused persons	who were the
members of the Tenth Lok Sabha had ceased to hold the office
as Members  of the said Lok Sabha and therefore under law no
sanction for  their prosecution	 is required and furthermore
accused	 persons   are	sought	to  be	tried  for  criminal
conspiracy under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_49">Section 120-B</a> IPC read with Sections 7, 12,
13(2) OF  of the 1988 Act as well as the substantly offences
and that according to <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_50">Section 19</a> of the 1988 Act sanction is
required only  in respect  of the  offences punishable under
<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_51">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_52">13</a> and these substantive offences were alleged
committed by  Members of  Parliament who  had  accepted	 the
illegal gratification  for voting  again the  `No Confidence
Motion' and  that no  sanction is  required in the case of a
Member of  Parliament or  a Member  of the State Legislature
though	he   is	 a   public  servant  because  there  is  no
sanctioning authority  qua him.	 Revision Petitions filed by
the appellants	against the  said order of the Special Judge
have been  dismissed by	 the impugned  judgment of the Delhi
High Court. In the High Court the following contentions were
urged by the appellants :-
</p><p id="p_10">(i)   Even  if	the  allegations  of  the  prosecution	were
     accepted, the  Court  would  have	no  jurisdiction  to
     fasten any criminal liability on the accused persons as
     whatever allegedly	 happened was  in respect  of  votes
     given by some of them in the Lok Sabha and that, in any
     case, whatever  transpired, touched  the privileges  of
     the House	within the meaning of clauses (2) and (3) of
     <a href="/doc/631375/" id="a_53">Article 195</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_11">(ii) Member of Lok Sabha hold no office an d as such are not
     public servants  within the  meaning of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_54">Section 2(c)</a> of
     the 1988  Act and	that for  that reason  the 1988	 Act
     would not	apply to  the alleged  acts of	omission and
     commission of the accused persons.
</p><p id="p_12">(iii)Even if  it be  taken that Members of Lok Sabha do fall
     within <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_55">Section  2(c)</a> of the 1988 Act and are thus taken
     to be  public servants, yet the Act would not apply for
     the simple reason that in the case of Lok Sabha Members
     there is  no authority  competent to  remove them	from
     their office  within the meaning of <a href="/doc/574558/" id="a_56">Section 19(1)(c)</a> of
     the 1988 Act.
</p><p id="p_13">(iv) In	 the case  of A-1, A-9, A-10, A-11 and A-13 there is
     nothing to show that they had conspired or were part of
     any conspiracy.
</p><p id="p_14">(v)   Sanction was  required under  <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_57">Section 197</a>	 Cr. P.C. to
     prosecute A-1.
</p><p id="p_15">(vi) No case is made out for framing the charges against the
     appellants.
</p><p id="p_16">     While  dealing  with  the	first  contention  based  on
clauses (2)  and (3)  of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_58">Article 105</a> of the Constitution the
High Court  has held  that to  offer bribe  to a  Member  of
Parliament to  influence him  in his conduct as a member has
been treated as a b reach of privilege in England but merely
treating the commission of a criminal offence as a breach of
privilege does	not amount  to ouster  jurisdiction  of	 the
ordinary court	to try penal offences and that to claim that
in such	 matters the courts would have no jurisdiction would
amount to  claiming a  privilege to commit a crime. The High
Court has  also pointed	 out that four notices of a question
of privilege  dated February  26 and  27, 1997 were given by
four members of Lok Sabha, namely, Sarva Shri Jaswant Singh,
Indrajit Gupta,	 Arjun Singh  and Jagmeet Singh Brar against
A-1 and the four members belonging to JMM (A-3	to A-6). The
notices were  forwarded to the said accused for comments and
after discussion on the said notices during which members of
all parties expressed their views the Speaker disallowed the
notice given  by Shri  Arjun Singh on March 11, 1996 and the
notices of  a question	of privilege  given  by	 Sarva	Shri
Jaswant Singh,	Indrajit Gupta	and Jagmeet  Singh Brar were
disallowed by  the Speaker  on March  12, 1996.	 The  second
submission that	  a  Member of	Parliament is  not a  public
servant under  <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_59">Section 2(c)</a>  of the 1988 Act was rejected by
the High  Court on the view that that a member of Parliament
holds an office and is a public servant falling under clause
</p><p id="p_17">(viii) of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_60">Section 2(c)</a> of the 1988 Act. The third contention
that  the  1988	 Act  is  not  applicable  to  a  Member  of
Parliament since  there is  no authority competent to remove
him from  his office  for the  purpose of  granting sanction
under <a href="/doc/574558/" id="a_61">Section 19(1)(c)</a> of the 1988 Act was also not accepted
by the	High Court.  It	 was  held  in	the  absence  of  an
authority to  remove a	Member of  Parliament does  not mean
that the 1988 Act would not be applicable to him. As regards
the requirement	 of sanction  under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_62">Section  197</a> Cr. P.C. as
against A-1,  the High	Court held  that A-1  was a party to
actual bribing	of Members  of Parliament  and that it is no
job of	a Prime	 Minister to  hatch or	be a party to such a
criminal conspiracy and that what A-1 did cannot fall within
the ambit of the words "while acting of purporting to act in
the discharge  of his official duty" in <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_63">Section 197</a> Cr. P.C.
The High Court thereafter examined the material on record in
relation to  each accused person and found that there was no
ground for  interfering with the order passed by the Special
Judge.
</p><p id="p_18">     Felling aggrieved	by the	said judgment  of  the	High
Court, the  appellants have filed these appeals. The appeals
were heard  by a  bench of  three Judge.  After hearing	 the
arguments of  the learned  counsel, the	 following order was
passed by that bench on November 18, 1997 :-
</p><p id="p_19">     "Among    other	 questions,    a
     substantial question  of law  as to

     of the  Constitution  of  India  is
     raised in	these  petitions.  These

</p><p id="p_21">In pursuance  of the  said order, the matter has been placed
before us. At the commencement of the hearing, we passed the
following order on December 9, 1997 :-

     prosecution under the 1988 Act?
</blockquote><p id="p_42">Immunity From Prosecution
     In order  to answer  the first  question  it  would  be
necessary to  examine the  scope and ambit of the protection
available to  a Member of Parliament under <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_105">Article 105</a> which
deals with  the powers,	 privileges and	 immunities  of	 the
Houses of  Parliament and  its members.	 Before we undertake
this task,  we would briefly set out the prevailing state of
law in	the United  Kingdom a  other countries following the
common law.
</p><p id="p_43">     UNITED KINGDOM  :	 During the  rule of  the Tudor	 and
Stuart Kings  the Commons  had to  wage a bitter struggle to
assert their  supremacy which  culminated  in  the  Bill  of
Rights, 1989  whereby it  was secured  "that the  freedom of
speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to
be impeached  or questioned  in any  court or  place out  of
Parliament" (<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_106">Article 9</a>). On May 2. 1695 the House of Commons
passed a  resolution whereby  it resolved that "the offer of
money, or  other advantage,  to any Member of Parliament for
the promoting  of any  matter whatsoever, depending or to be
transacted in Parliament is a high crime and misdemeanor and
tends to the subversion of the English constitution". In the
spirit of  this resolution,  the offering  to  a  Member  of
either House of a bribe to influence him in his conduct as a
Member or  of any  fee or  reward  in  connection  with	 the
promotion of  or opposition  to any bill, resolution, matter
or thing  submitted or intended to be submitted to the House
or any	committee thereof,  has been  treated as a breach of
privilege. [See	 : May's Parliamentary Practice, 21" Edn. p.
128]. In  its  report  submitted  in  July  1976  the  Royal
Commission on  Standards of  Conduct in Public Life (chaired
by Lord	 Salmon) has pointed out that "neither the statutory
nor the	 common law  applies to	 the  bribery  or  attempted
bribery	 of  a	Member	of  Parliament	in  respect  of	 his
Parliamentary activities but "corrupt transactions involving
a Member  of Parliament	 in  respect  of  matters  that	 had
nothing to  do with  his parliamentary	activities would  be
caught by  the ordinary criminal law" (page 98, para 307 and
</p><p id="p_44">308). The  Salmon Commission  has  observed  that  sanctions
against bribery	 introduced by	the criminal  law  in  other
fields	have  now  outstripped	whatever  sanctions  may  be
exerted through Parliament's own powers of investigation and
punishment and	the Commission	was of	the view  there is a
strong	case   for  bringing  such  malpractice	 within	 the
criminal  law.	According  to  the  Salmon  Commission,	 the
Committee of Privileges and the Select Committee on Members'
Interests  do	not  provide   an  investigative   machinery
comparable to that of a police investigation and that having
regard to the complexity of most investigations into serious
corruption special  expertise is  necessary for this type of
inquiry. (para	310, pp.  98, 99). The Salmon Commission has
recommended :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     "Membership  of   Parliament  is  a
     great honour  and carries with it a
     special  duty   to	  maintain   the
     highest standards	of probity,  and
     this  duty	 has  almost  invariably
     been	strictly       observed.</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">     Nevertheless in  view of our report
     as a  whole, and  especially in the
     light of  the points set out in the
     foregoing paragraph,  we  recommend
     that  Parliament	should	consider
     bringing  corruption,  bribery  and
     attempted bribery	of a  Member  of
     Parliament	   acting     in     his
     parliamentary capacity  within  the
     ambit of  the criminal  law." [para
     311 p. 99]
During the  course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord
Salmon said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "To my mind equality before the law
     is one  of the  pillars of freedom.
     To say  that immunity from criminal
     proceedings  against   anyone   who
     tries  to	 bribe	 a   Member   of
     Parliament	 and   any   Member   of
     Parliament who  accepts the  bribe,
     stems from	 the Bills  of Rights is
     possibly a serious mistake."
</blockquote><p id="p_46">After quoting the Bill of Rights Lord Salmon continued :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     "Now this	is a charter for freedom
     of speech	in the House it is not a
     charter for corruption. To my mind,
     the Bill  of Rights,  for which  no
     one has  more respect  than I have,
     has no  more to  do with  the topic
     which we  are discussing  that  the
     <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_107">Merchandise Marks Act</a>. The crime of
     corruption	 is  complete  when  the
     bribe  is	 offered  or   given  or
     solicited or taken."</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">     The correctness  of the  statement in the Report of the
Salmon Commission that `common law does not apply to bribery
or attempted bribery of a Member of Parliament in respect of
his parliamentary  activities, has  been  doubted  by  Prof.
Graham Zellick who has said that Sir James Fitzjames Stephen
appears to be the only writer to have taken the same view in
his Digest  of the  Criminal Law  (1878) <a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_108">art.  118</a>, and that
there is nothing in the English authorities which compels to
the conclusion	that a	Member of Parliament is not a public
officer and  is not punishable at common law for bribery and
breach of  trust. [See : Grahma Zellick : Bribery of Members
of Parliament and the Criminal Law, 1979 Public Law p. 31 at
pp. 39, 40].
</p><p id="p_48">     The question  whether   offering  of  a  bribe  to	 and
acceptance of the same by a Member of Parliament constitutes
an offence  at common law came up for consideration before a
criminal court (Buckley J.) in 1992 in R.V. Currie &amp; Ors. In
that case  it was  alleged that	 a Member  of Parliament had
accepted bribes	 as a  reward for  using his  influence as a
Member in  respect of application for British nationality of
one of	the persons  offering the  bribe. The indictment was
sought to  be quashed on the ground that bribery of a Member
of Parliament is not a crime and that in any event the court
has no	jurisdiction and  Parliament alone  can try a member
for bribery,  the  matter  being  covered  by  parliamentary
privilege. The	learned Judge  ruled against  the contention
and held :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     "That  a	member	 of   Parliament
     against whom there is a prime facie
     case of corruption should be immune
     from prosecution  in the  courts of
     law is  to my  mind an unacceptable
     proposition at  the present time. I
     do not believe it to be the law."
</blockquote><p id="p_49">In 1994	 the  Attorney	General	 advised  the  Committee  of
Privileges of  the House  of Commons  that, in	his opinion,
though bribery	of a  Member was not a statutory offence, it
might be  an  offence  at  the	common	law.  [See  :  May's
Parliamentary Practice,	 22nd End, p. 114]. The Committee on
Standards in  Public Life,  Chaired  by	 Lord  Nolan  (Nolan
Committee) in	its  first report submitted in May 1995, has
said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "There is one area of conduct where
     a need  already exists  to clarify,
     and  perhaps  alter,  the	boundary
     between the  courts and Parliament.
     Bribery  of   a  Member,	or   the
     acceptance of  a bribe by a Member,
     is contempt  of Parliament	 and can
     be punished  by the House. The test
     which the	House  would  apply  for
     bribery would  no doubt  be similar
     to that  which  would  apply  under
     Common Law.  However  it  is  quite
     likely that  Members of  Parliament
     who accepted  bribes in  connection
     with  their   Parliamentary  duties
     would  be	 committing  Common  Law
     offences which  could be  tried  by
     the  courts.  Doubt  exists  as  to
     whether the  courts  or  Parliament
     have jurisdiction	in such	 cases."</blockquote>

</blockquote><p id="p_51">AUSTRALIA :  Even though  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_109">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights is
applicable in  Australia but  as far  back as  in  1975	 the
Supreme Court  of New  South Wales  held that  an attempt to
bribe a	 Member of  the Legislative  Assembly  in  order  to
influence his  vote was a criminal offence, a misdemeanor at
common law.[See : R.V. White, 13 SCR (NSW) 332].
</p><p id="p_52">     The said  decision in  White was  approved by  the High
Curt of	 Australia in R.V. Boston &amp; Ors., (1923) 33 CLR 386.
In that	 case three  persons, namely, Walter James Boston, a
member of  the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, John
Andrew Harrison	 and Henry  Ernest Mitchelmore, were alleged
to have unlawfully conspired together and with other persons
that certain  large sums  of money should be corruptly given
to Walter  James Boston	 to use	 his position  to secure the
inspection of  , acquisition  and the  payment in  cash	 for
certain estates	 by the	 Government of	New South  Wales and
which estates were to be paid for out of the public funds of
the said  State and  to put  pressure upon  the Minister for
Lands and  other officers  of the  Crown to inspect, acquire
and to	pay cash for certain estates. The trial Judge upheld
the demurrer  to the  charge by the defendants on the ground
that  the  matters  alleged  did  not  include	a  provision
respecting voting  in Parliament.  In the  High Court it was
not disputed  by the  defendants that  an agreement  to	 pay
money to  a member  of Parliament  in order to influence his
vote in	 Parliament would  amount to  a criminal offence. It
was urged  that consistently  with the	allegations  in	 the
information, the agreement between the defendants might have
been to	 pay money  to Boston  to  induce  him	to  use	 his
position exclusively  outside Parliament,  not	by  vote  or
speech	in   the  Assembly,  and  that	the  transaction  in
connection with	 which he  was to  use his  position to	 put
pressure  on  the  Minister  might,  consistently  with	 the
information, be one which would never come before Parliament
and which,  in his  opinion and	 in the opinion of those who
paid him,  was highly  beneficial to the State; that such an
agreement would	 not amount  to a criminal offence, and that
consequently the  informations is  bad. Rejecting  the	said
contention,. Knox C.J. has observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">     "In  my  opinion,	the  payment  of
     money to,	and the receipt of money
     by,  a   Member  of  Parliament  to
     induce  him  to  use  his	official
     position, whether inside or outside
     Parliament,  for	the  purpose  of
     influencing or  putting pressure on
     a Minister	 or other officer of the
     Crown to  enter into or carry out a
     transaction  involving  payment  of
     money out	of the public funds, are
     acts   tending    to   the	  public
     mischief,	and   an  agreement   or
     combination to do such acts amounts
     to a  criminal  offence.  From  the
     point of view of tendency to public
     mischief I	 can see  no substantial
     difference between	 paying money to
     a member  to induce  him to use his
     vote in  Parliament in a particular
     direction and  paying him	money to
     induce him to use his position as a
     member outside  Parliament for  the
     purpose of	 influencing or	 putting
     pressure  Ministers.  A  member  of
     Parliament	  cannot    divest   his
     position  of  the	right  which  it
     confers  to   take	 part	in   the
     proceedings of Parliament he cannot
     `use his  position as  a member  of
     Parliament'   stripped    of    its
     principal attribute.  The influence
     which his	position as  a member of
     Parliament enables	 him to exert on
     a Minister	 has its  source in  his
     right   to	   sit	 and   vote   in
     Parliament, and it would be idle to
     pretend  that  in	discussions  and
     negotiations between a Minister and
     a member  that right,  or the power
     it confers	 on  a	member,	 can  be
     disregarded or  ignored. The tenure
     of office	of the	Minister and his
     colleagues may  be dependent on the
     vote  or  on  the	abstention  from
     voting of	an individual member, or
     even on his words or his silence in
     Parliament." [pp. 392, 393]
Similarly, Issacs and Rich JJ, have said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">     "It  is  impossible  to  sever  the
     voluntarily  assumed   intervention
     departmentally from the legislative
     position to  which by  custom it is
     recognised as  incidental. A member
     so intervening speaks as member and
     is dealt with as member, and not as
     a private	individual. His ulterior
     power   of	  action,   though   not
     intruded	into   observation,   is
     always existent and is always known
     to	 exist.	  It  is  scarcely  even
     camouflaged. The importance of even
     one   parliamentary   vote	  on   a
     critical occasion	is not	entirely
     unknown." [p. 403]
Higgins J.,  after stating  that it  was not disputed by the
counsel for  the defendants  that if the agreement were that
the member  should use	his votes or his action in the House
to secure  the acquisition  of the land, the agreement would
be criminal conspiracy, expressed the view that he could not
read the  count as `confining the agreement to action of the
member outside	the House'  and that  the words	 `to use his
position as such member' primarily refer to an action in the
House. The learned Judge, however, held :-</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     "A member	is the	watch-dog of the
     public; and  Cerberus must	 not  be
     seduced from  vigilance by a sop. I
     see no reason to doubt that even if
     the  count	  were	confined  to  an
     agreement as  to the  action of the
     member outside  the House-action in
     which the	member used his position
     as member-the agreement would be an
     indictable conspiracy." [p. 410]
     Gavan  Duffy   and	 Starke	 JJ.,  in  their  dissenting
judgment, while holding that the acts charged as intended to
be done	 by the defendant Boston, however important they may
be, would not be malversation in his office, or acts done in
his office,  unless they  were done-in	the discharge of his
legislative functions, have said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     "It cannot	 be denied that a member
     of	 Parliament   taking  money   or
     agreeing to take money to influence
     his vote in Parliament is guilty of
     a high  crime and misdemeanour, and
     that an  agreement to  bring  about
     such a  state of things constitutes
     a criminal	 conspiracy; nor  can it
     be denied	that an	 agreement which
     has   the	 effect	  of   fettering
     parliamentary or  executive  action
     may sometimes  be as  dangerous  to
     the   community   as   the	  direct
     purchase of a member's vote; and it
     may be  that, under t he words used
     in	  the	count	which	we   are
     considering, facts	 might be proved
     which would  constitute a	criminal
     conspiracy." [pp. 413, 414]
Section 73A  of the Crime Act, 1914 in Australia makes it an
offence for  members of	 the Australian Parliament to accept

obtains, or  offers or	agrees to  ask	for  or	 receive  or
obtain, any  property or  benefit of any kind for himself or
any other  person, on  an understanding that the exercise by

</p><p id="p_54">     CANADA : In the case of R.V Bunting, (1984-5) 7 Ontario
Reports 524,  the defendants  had moved	 for quashing  of an
indictment for	conspiracy to  bring about  a change  in the
Government of  Province of Ontario by bribing members of the
Legislature so	vote against  the Government.  It was argued
that  bribery	of  a  member  of  Parliament  is  a  matter
concerning Parliament  or Parliamentary	 business and is not
an indictable  offence at  common law and that the exclusive
jurisdiction to	 deal  with  such  a  case  rests  with	 the
Legislative Assembly  according to  t he  law and  custom of
Parliament. Rejecting the said contention, Wilson CJ. held:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">     "It is  to my  mind  a  proposition
     very  clear   that	 his  Court  has
     jurisdiction over	the  offence  of

     case of  this kind,  where a member
     of	 the   Legislative  Assembly  is
     concerned either  in the  giving or
     in the offering to give a bribe, or
     in the  taking  of	 it  for  or  in
     respect of	 any of	 his duties as a
     member of	that Assembly; and it is
     equally clear  that the Legislative

     which this	 Court has  in a case of
     the kind;	and  it	 is  also  quite
     clear that	 the ancient  definition
     of bribery	 is not	 the  proper  or

<p id="p_55">     [p. 542]
Armour J. was of the some view and has said :-

O'Connor J,  in his dissenting judgment, held that the bribe

<p id="p_58">     UNITED STATES  ; <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_111">Article  1(6)</a> of	the US	Constitution
contains the  `Speech or  Debate Clause' which provides that
"for any  speech or debate in either House, they (Members of
the Congress)  shall not  be questioned in any other place".
In 1853	 the Congress,	by statute, declared a member liable
to indictment  as for  a high  crime and misdemeanour in any
court  of  the	United	States	for  accepting	compensation
intended to  influence a  vote or  decision on	any question
brought before	him in	his official  capacity. In  1862 the
Congress enacted another statute to penalise legislators who
received money	for votes or influence in any matter pending
before Congress	 and in	 1864 Conflict	of Interest statutes
barred Congressmen  from receiving  compensation  for  their
services  before   any	agency.	 The  Conflict	of  Interest
Statutes were  revised in  1962	 and  are  contained  in  18
U.S.C.(1964). [See : Note, The Bribed Congressmen's Immunity
from Prosecution, (1965-66) 75 Yale L.J. 335, at p. 341].
</p><p id="p_59">     A distinction  is, however, made between the conduct of
a Member connected with the proceedings of the House and his
conduct not  in the  House  but	 in  connection	 with  other
activities as  a Member	 of the	 Congress.  The	 speech	 and
debate clause  does not	 give any  protection in  respect of
conduct "that  is in  no sense related to due functioning of
the legislative powers". [See : United Stated v. Johnson, 15
L Ed  2d 681, at p. 684]. In Burton v. United States, 202 US
344, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a Senator
who had	 been bribed in order to get a mail fraud indictment
quashed	 under	 the  rationale	 that  Burton's	 attempt  to
influence the  Post Office  Department was  unprotected non-
legislative conduct.  The  question  regarding	immunity  in
respect of  actions connected  with the	 proceedings of	 the
House has  been considered  by the US Supreme Court in three
decisions, namely,  Johnson, United  State v. Brewster, 33 L
Ed 2d 507, and United States v. Helstoski, 61 L Ed 2d 12.
</p><p id="p_60">     In Johnson	 a former US Congressman, named Johnson, and
three  co-defendants   were  found   guilty  of	  conspiracy
consisting  of	 an  agreement	among  Johnson	and  another
Congressman and	 two other  co-defendants who were connected
with a	Maryland saving and loan institution whereby the two
Congressmen would  exert  influence  on	 the  Department  of
Justice to  obtain the	dismissal of  pending indictments of
the loan  company and  it officers on mall fraud charges and
as part	 of  this  general  scheme  Johnson  read  a  speech
favourable to  independent saving  and loan  associations in
the House  and that  the company distributed copies to allay
apprehensions of  potential  depositors	 and  that  the	 two
Congressmen approached	the Attorney  General and  Assistant
Attorney General  in charge  of the  Criminal  Division	 and
urged them  to review  the indictment and for these services
Johnson received  substantial sums  in the  form of campaign
contribution and  legal	 fees.	Harlan	j.,  delivering	 the
opinion of  the Court,	held that  the	prosecution  of	 the
conspiracy count  being dependent  upon an intensive inquiry
with respect  to the  speech  on  the  floor  of  the  House
violated the  Speech or	 Debate Clause	so as to warrant the
granting of  a new  trial on  the conspiracy  count with all
elements offensive  to the  Speech or  Debate Clause  to  be
eliminated. The	 Speech or  Debate Clause  was given a wider
construction so	 as to exclude the motive for performing the
legislative  acts   being  enquired   into  in	 a  criminal
prosecution.
</p><p id="p_61">     In Brewster  a former  US Senator,	 named Brewster, had
been charged  with accepting  bribes and  the allegation was
that while  he was  a Senator  an d  a member  of the Senate
Committee on  Post and	Civil Service he received and agreed
to receive  sums in  return  for  being	 influenced  in	 his
performance of	official acts in respect of his action, vote
and decision  on postage  rate legislation  which  had	been
pending before	him in his official capacity. Brewster moved
to dismiss  the indictment  on the ground that he was immune
from prosecution  for any  alleged act of bribery because of
the Speech or Debate Clause. The District Court accepted the
said contention	 and dismissed the counts of the  indictment
which applied to Brewster. The said judgment of the District
Court was  reversed by	the US	Supreme Court and the matter
was remanded.  Burger CJ.,  who delivered the opinion of the
Court on  behalf of  six Judges,  held that  the  Speech  or
Debate Clause  protects the members of Congress from inquiry
into legislative  acts or  into	 the  motivation  for  their
actual performance  of legislative  acts  and  it  does	 not
protect them  from other  activities they undertake that are
political, rather  than	 legislative,  in  nature  and	that
taking a  bribe for  t he  purpose of  having one's official
conduct influenced is not part of any legislative process or
function and  the Speech  or Debate  Clause did	 not prevent
indictment and prosecution of Brewster for accepting bribes.
Brennan and White JJ. (joined by Douglas J.) disssented. The
Court construed	 the  Speech  or  Debate  Clause  as  giving
protection to  an act  which  was  clearly  a  part  of	 the
legislative process - the due functioning of the process. It
was held  that the purpose of the Speech or Debate Clause is
to protect the individual legislator, not simply for his own
sake, but  to preserve	the  independence  and	thereby	 the
integrity of  the legislative  process	and  that  financial
abuse, by way of bribes, would grossly undermine legislative
integrity and  defeat the  right of  the  public  to  honest
representation. The learned Chief Justice has observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     "Taking a	bribe is,  obviously, no
     part of  the legislative process or
     function; it  is not  a legislative
     act. It  is not, by any conceivable
     interpretation, an act performed as
     a part of or even incidental to the
     role of a legislator." [p. 526]
     In	 Helstoski   a	former	 member	 of   the  House  of
Representatives,  named	  Heistoski,  was   prosecuted	 for
accepting  money   for	promising   to	introduce   and	 for
introducing  private   bills   which   would   suspend	 the
application of	the immigration	 laws so  as  to  allow	 the
aliens to  remain in the country. Helstoski moved to dismiss
the indictment	in the	District Court	contending that	 the
indictment violated  the Speech	 or Debate  Clause. The said
motion was rejected by the District Court though it was held
that the  Government would  not be allowed to offer evidence
at trial  of the performance of the past legislative acts by
the Congressmen. The said judgment was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals  which judgment  was	 also  affirmed	 by  the  US
Supreme Court by majority (Brennan J dissenting). Burger CJ.
</blockquote><p id="p_62">has held  that references  to	past legislative  acts of  a
Member cannot  be admitted  without considering	 the  values
protected by  the Speech or Debate Clause which was designed
to preclude prosecution of Members for legislative act.
</p><p id="p_63">     Having taken  note of the legal position as it prevails
in the	various countries,  we may  now	 examine  the  legal
position in this regard in India.
</p><p id="p_64">      Offering	of  a  bribe  or  payment  to  a  Member  of
Parliament influence  him in  his conduct  as a	 member	 and
acceptance of  a bribe	by such	 a Member  is treated  as  a
breach of  privilege by	 Indian Parliament  even  though  no
money has  actually changed  hands. [See  : M.N. Kaul &amp; S.L.
Shakdher : Practice and Procedure of Parliament 4th Edn., at
p. 254].  As early  as	in  1951  an  ad  hoc  Committee  of
Parliament was	appointed to  investigate  the	conduct	 and
activities of  a member	 , H.G.	 Mudgal, in  connection with
some of	 his dealings  with  a	business  association  which
included  canvassing   support	and   making  propaganda  in
Parliament on certain problems on behalf of that association
in  return   for  alleged   financial  and   other  business
advantages. A ad hoc Committee of the House was appointed to
consider whether  the conduct  of the  member concerned	 was
derogatory to the dignity of the House and inconsistent with
the standards  which Parliament	 is entitled  to expect from
members. The  Committee found the member guilty of receiving
monetary  benefits  for	 putting  questions  in	 Parliament,
moving amendments to the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Bill
and urging  interviews with  the Ministers, etc. and it held
that the  conduct of  H.G. Mudgal   was	 derogatory  tot  he
dignity of  the House  and inconsistent	 with the  standards
which Parliament  was entitled to expect of its members. The
Committee recommended  the expulsion  of the member from the
House. While  the said	report was  being considered  by the
House,	the  member,  after  participating  in	the  debate,
submitted his  resignation from the membership of the House.
In the	resolution the	House accepted	the findings  of the
Committee and  deprecated  the	attempt	 of  the  member  to
circumvent the	effects of the motion expelling him from the
House, by  his resignation,  which constituted a contempt of
the House  and aggravated the offence. [SEE: Kaul &amp; Shakdher
at pp. 284, 285].
</p><p id="p_65">     It does  not, however, constitute breach or contempt of
the House  if the offering of payment of bribe is related to
the business  other than  that of the House. In 1974 the Lok
Sabha considered  the matter relating to offer or payment of
bribe in  the Import  Licences case  wherein it	 was alleged
that a	Member of  Lok Sabha  had  taken  bribe	 and  forged
signatures of  the  Members  for  furthering  the  cause  of
certain applicants. The question of privilege was disallowed
since it was considered that conduct of the Member, although
improper, was  not related to the business of the House. But
at the	same time  it was  held that  as the  allegation  of
bribery and  forgery were  very serious	 and unbecoming of a
Member of  Parliament, he  could be  held guilty of lowering
the dignity  of the House. [See: Kaul &amp; Shakdher at pp. 254.

<p id="p_68">     Clause (1)	 secures freedom  of speech in Parliament to
its members.  The said freedom is "subject to the provisions
of this	 Constitution and  to the  rules and standing orders
regulating the	procedure of Parliament". The words "subject
to the	provisions of  the Constitution" have been construed
to mean	 subject to the provisions of the Constitution which
regulate the  procedure of Parliament, viz., <a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_113">Article 118</a> and
</p><p id="p_69">121. [See  : <a href="/doc/944601/" id="a_114">Pandit M.S.M Sharma v. Shri Sri Krishna Sinha &amp;

of speech  that is  available to Members of Parliament under
<a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_115">Article 105(1)</a>	is wider  in amplitude	than  the  right  to
freedom of  speech and	expression guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_116">Article
19(1)(a)</a> since the freedom of speech under <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_117">Article 105(1)</a> is
not subject to the limitations contained in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_118">Article 19(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_70">     Clause (2)	 confers immunity in relation to proceedings
in courts.  It can  be divided	into two parts. In the first
part immunity  from liability  under any  proceedings in any
court is  conferred on	a Member of Parliament in respect of
anything said  or any vote given by him in Parliament or any
committee thereof.  In the  second  part  such	immunity  is
conferred on  a person in respect of publication by or under
the authority  or either  House of Parliament of any report,
paper, votes  or proceedings.  This immunity  that has	been
conferred under	 Clause (2)  in respect	 of anything said or
any vote  given by  a Member  in Parliament or any committee
thereof and  in respect	 of  publication  by  or  under	 the
authority of  either House  of	Parliament  of	any  report,
paper, votes  or proceedings,  ensures that  the freedom  of
speech that  is granted	 under clause  (1) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_119">Article 105</a> is
totally	 absolute   an	d  unfettered.	[See  :	 Legislative
Privileges Case pp. 441, 442].
</p><p id="p_71">     Having secured  the freedom  of speech in Parliament to
the members  under clause  (a) and (2), the Constitution, in
clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_120">Article 105</a>, deals with powers, privileges and
impunities of the House of Parliament and of the members and
the committees thereof in other respects. The said clause is
in two	parts. The first part empowers Parliament to define,
by law,	 the powers, privileges and immunities of each House
of Parliament  and of the members and the committees of each
House.	In  the	 second	 part,	which  was  intended  to  be
trasitional in	nature, it  was provided that until they are
so defined by law the said powers, privileges and immunities
shall be those of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom
and of its members and committees at the commencement of the
Constitution. This  part of  the provision  was on  the same
lines as  the provisions  contained in	Section	 49  of	 the
Australian Constitution	 an d  Section 18  of  the  Canadian
Constitution. Clause (3), as substituted by the Forty-fourth
Amendment of  the Constitution,	 does not make any change in
the content  and it  only seeks to omit future reference tot
he house  of Commons  of Parliament  in the  United  Kingdom
while preserving  the position	as it  stood on	 the date of
coming into force of the said amendment.
</p><p id="p_72">     Clause (4)	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_121">Article  105</a> makes	the  privileges	 and

persons who  by virtue of the Constitution have the right to

of Parliament  or any  committee thereof  as they  apply  in
relation to Members of Parliament.
</p><p id="p_73">     Shri P.P.	Rao, Shri  D.D. Thakur and Shri Kapil Sibal,
the learned  senior counsel  appearing for  the	 appellants,
have submitted	that having regard tot he purpose underlying
the grant  of immunity	under clause  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_122">Article	105</a>,
namely, to  secure full	 freedom for  a Member of Parliament
while participating  in the  proceedings in the House or its
committees by way of speech or by casting his vote, the said
provision should  be given  a wide  construction  so  as  to
enable the  Member to exercise his said rights without being
exposed to legal proceedings in a court of law in respect of
anything said  or any vote given by him in Parliament or any
committee thereof.  It has  been submitted that the immunity
from liability	that has  been	conferred  on  a  Member  of
Parliament under clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_123">Article 105</a> would, therefore,
extend to  prosecution of  member on  a charge	o bribery in
making a  speech or  giving his	 vote in  the House  or	 any
committee as  well as  the charge  of conspiracy  to  accept
bribe for  making a speech or giving the vote. It is claimed
that by	 virtue of  the immunity granted under clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_124">Article 105</a>  the offer	to and	acceptance by  a  Member  of
Parliament of  bribe in	 connection with his making a speech
or giving  the vote  would not constitute a criminal offence
and, therefore,	 neither the  member receiving the bribe nor
the person offering this bribe can be prosecuted and so also
there can be no offence of criminal conspiracy in respect of
such offer  and acceptance  of bribe. It has been urged that
on that	 view neither the charge of conspiracy under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_125">Section
120B</a> IPC  nor the  charges in  respect	of  the	 substantive
offences under	the 1988  Act can  be sustained	 against the
appellants. Strong  reliance has been placed on the decision
of the	Court of  Queen's Bench in Ex parte Wason, (1869) LR
QBD 573,  as well  as on  the judgment	of the	U.S. Supreme
Court (Harlan J.) in Johnson and on the dissenting judgments
of Brennan J. and White J. in Brewster.
</p><p id="p_74">     The learned  Attorney General,  on the  other hand, has
urged that  the immunity granted under clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_126">Article
105</a> gives  protection to  a Member  of Parliament  from	 any
liability for a speech made by him or a vote given by him in
the House  or any  committee thereof,  but the said immunity
cannot be  extended to confer immunity from prosecution of a
Member for  having received  bribe or  having entered into a
conspiracy to  receive bribe  for the  purpose of  making  a
speech or  giving a  vote in  the House or in any committees
thereof. The learned Attorney General has placed reliance on
the judgment  of the  U.S. Supreme  Court  (Burger  CJ.)  in
Brewster,  the	 Canadian  decision   in  Bunting   and	 the
Australian decisions  in White	and Boston and the ruling of
Buckley J. in R.V. Currie &amp; Ors.
</p><p id="p_75">     Before we	proceed to consider these submissions in the
light of  the provisions  contained in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_127">Article
105</a>, we	 may refer to the decision in Ex parte Wason and the
other decision in which it has been considered.
</p><p id="p_76">     In Ex  parte Wason	 information had  been laid by Wason
before the  Magistrate wherein	it was	stated that  the had
given Eari  Russell a  petition to be presented in the House
of Lords  wherein the  Lord Chief  Baron  was  charged	with
wilful and  deliberate	falsehood  and	the  object  of	 the
petition was that the Lord Chief Baron might be removed from
his office  by an  address of  both House  of Parliament and
that Eari  Russell, Lord Chelmsford and the Lord Chief Baron
conspired together  to prevent	the  course  of	 justice  by
agreeing to make statements which they knew to be untrue and
that Eari  Russell, Lord Chelmsford and the Lord Chief Baron
agreed to  deceive the	House of  Lords by  stating that the
charge of  faleshood contained	in the	petition against the
Lord Chief  Baron was  unfounded and false whereas they knew
it to  be true.	 The magistrate	 refused to take applicant's
recognizance on	 the ground  that no  indictable offence was
disclosed by  the information.	The Court  of Queen's  Bench
upheld the said order of the magistrate and refused to grant
the rule  sought  by  the  applicant.  Cockburn	 CJ.,  after
referring to  the information  which was  placed before	 the
magistrate, said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">     "Now inasmuch  as these  statements
     were alleged  to have  been for the
     purpose of preventing the prayer of
     the petition,  and	 the  statements
     could  not	 have  had  that  effect
     unless made  in the House of Lords,
     it seems  to me  that the	fair and
     legitimate inference  is  that  the
     alleged conspiracy was to make, and
     that the  statements were	made, in
     the  House	  of  Lords.   I  think,
     therefore,	 that	the  magistrate,
     looking at this and the rest of the
     information,   was	  warranted   in
     coming to	the conclusion, that Mr,
     Wason charged  and proposed to make
     the substance  of	the  indictment,
     that  these   three   persons   did
     conspire to  deceive the  House  of
     Lords by  statements  made	 in  the
     House of  Lords for  the purpose of
     frustrating the  petition.	 Such  a
     charge could not be maintained in a
     court of  law.  It	 is  clear  that
     statements	 made	by  members   of
     either House of Parliament in their
     places in	the House,  though  they
     might be untrue to their knowledge,
     could not be made the foundation of
     civil  or	 criminal   proceedings,
     however injurious	they might be to
     the interest of a third person. And
     a	 conspiracy    to   make    such
     statements would  not  makes  these
     persons guilty  of it  amenable  to
     the  criminal   law.,"   [p.   576]
     [emphasis supplied]
Blackburn J. said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">     "I perfectly  agree with my Lord as
     to	 what	the  substance	 of  the
     information is;  and when the House
     is sitting	 and statements are made
     in either	House of Parliament, the
     member making  them is not amenable
     to the  criminal law.  It is  quite
     clear that	 no indictment	will lie
     for  making   them,   nor	 for   a
     conspiracy	 or  agreement	to  make
     them, even though the statements be
     false  to	 the  knowledge	 of  the
     persons  making  them.  I	entirely
     concur   in   thinking   that   the
     information  did	only  charge  an
     agreement to make statements in the
     House of  Lords, and  therefore did
     not charge any indictable offence."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">     [p. 576]
Lush J. also said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">     "I cannot	doubt that  it charges a
     conspiracy to  deceive the House of
     Lords,   and   so	 frustrate   the
     application,  by  means  of  making
     false statements in the house. I am
     clearly of	 opinion that  we  ought
     not to allow it to be doubted for a
     moment   that    the   motives   or
     intentions	 of  members  of  either
     House cannot  be inquired	into  by
     criminal proceedings  with	 respect
     to anything  they may  do or say in
     the House." [p. 577]
The observations if Cockburn CJ., with whom Blackburn J. has
concurred, show	 that the  substance of the information laid
by Wason  was that  the alleged conspiracy was to make false
statements and	that such  statements were made in the House
of Lords  and that  the said  statements had  been made	 the
foundation  of	 the  criminal	proceeding.  Though  in	 the
judgment there	is no  reference to <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_128">Article 9</a> of the Bill of
Rights but  the tenor of the abovequoted observations of the
learned Judges leave no doubt that the judgment was based on
that Article.  It has been so understood in later judgments.
</blockquote>[See : R.V. Caurrie &amp; Ors.].
<p id="p_77">     Reliance  has   been  placed   by	Shri   Rao  on	 the
observations of	 Lush J.  that "the motives or intentions of
members of  either House cannot be inquired into by criminal
proceedings with  respect to  anything they may do or say in
the House".
</p><p id="p_78">     In Johnson,  while dealing with the contention urged on
behalf of  the Government  that the  Speech or Debate Clause
was meant  to prevent only prosecutions based on the content
of speech,  such as  libel actions, but not those founded on
the antecedent	unlawful conduct of accepting or agreeing to
accept a bribe, Harlan J. has observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">     "Although	historically   seditious
     libel   was   the	 most	frequent
     instrument	    for	    intimidating
     legislators, this	has  never  been
     the sole  form of legal proceedings
     so employed,  and the  language  of
     the Constitution  is framed  in the
     broadest terms." [PP. 689, 690]
     In order  to show	the broader  thrust of the privilege
reference was  made by	the learned Judge to the decision in
Ex parte Wason and the observations of Cockburn CJ. and Lush
J/. have  been quoted.	The contention	that the  Speech  or
Debate Clause  was not	violated because the gravamen of the
count was  the	alleged	 conspiracy,  not  the	speech,	 was
rejected by pointing out that "the indictment itself focused
with particularity upon motives underlying the making of the
speech and  upon its  contents". [p  690]. The learned Judge
has further said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">     "We emphasise  that our  holding is
     limited to	 prosecutions  involving
     circumstances   such    as	   those
     presented in  the case  before  us.
     Our  decision   does  not	touch  a
     prosecution which,	 though as  here
     founded on	 a criminal  statute  of
     general application,  does not draw
     in question the legislative acts of
     the defendant member of Congress or
     his motives  for performing  them."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     [pp. 690, 691]
     "The making of the speech, however,
     was only  a part  of the conspiracy
     charge. With all references to this
     aspect    of     the     conspiracy
     eliminated, we think the Government
     should not	 be precluded from a new
     trial on  this count,  thus  wholly
     purged of elements offensive to the
     Speech or Debate Clause.: [p. 691]
     In Brewster Brennan J. and White J. in their dissenting
judgments, have	 referred to the earlier judgment in Johnson
and the	 decision in  Ex parte	Wason. Brennan J. was of the
view that  Johnson "can	 only be  read	as  holding  that  a
corrupt agreement  to  perform	legislative  acts,  even  if
provable without reference to the acts themselves may not be
the subject  of a general conspiracy prosecution". [p. 533].
</blockquote><p id="p_79">Burger CJ.  did not  agree with	 this reading of Johnson and
said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">     "Johnson thus stands on a unanimous
     holding that  a Member  of Congress
     may be  prosecuted under a criminal
     statute	provided     that    the
     Government's case	does not rely on
     legislative acts  or the motivation
     for legislative acts. A legislative
     act has  consistently been	 defined
     as	 an   act  generally   done   in
     Congress	in   relation	to   the
     business before  it.  In  sum,  the
     Speech or	Debate Clause  prohibits
     inquiry  only   into  those  things
     generally said or done in the House
     or the Senate in the performance of
     official  duties	and   into   the
     motivation for   those  acts." [pp.</blockquote>
<p id="p_80">     517, 518]
After pointing	out that  the privileges in England is by no
means free  form grave abuses by legislators, Burger CJ. has
observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">     "The authors  of  our  Constitution
     were well	aware of  the history of
     both the need for the privilege and
     the abuses that could flow from the
     sweeping safeguards.  In  order  to
     preserve other  values, they  wrote
     the privilege  so that it tolerated
     and protects  behaviour on the part
     of	 Members   not	 tolerated   and
     protected	when   done   by   other
     citizens, but  the shield	does not
     extend beyond  what is necessary to
     preserve  the   integrity	of   the
     legislative process.' [p. 521]
     The learned  Chief Justice	 took note  of the fact that
"Congress is  ill-equipped to  investigate, try,  and punish
its Members  for a  wide range	of behaviour that is lossely
and incidentally  related to  the legislative  process"	 and
said :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">     "In this sense, the English analogy
     on which  the dissents  place  much
     emphasis, and  the reliance  on  Ex
     parte Wason,  LR 4	 QB 573	 (1869),
     are inapt." [p. 521]
While referring	 to the observations made by Brennan J., the
learned Chief Justice has observed :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     "Mr. Justice  Brennan suggests that
     inquiry into  the alleged	bribe is
     inquiry into  the motivation  for a
     legislative act,  and it  is  urged
     that   this    very   inquiry   was
     condemned	 as   impermissible   in
     Johnson. That argument misconstrues
     the  concept   of	motivation   for
     legislative  acts.	 The  Speech  or
     Debate  Clause  does  not	prohibit
     inquiry into illegal conduct simply
     because  it   has	some   nexus  to
     legislative functions.  In Johnson,
     the  Court	 held  that  on	 remand,
     Johnson could  be	retried	 on  the
     conspiracy-to-defraud   count,   so
     long  as  evidence	 concerning  his
     speech on	the House  floor was not
     admitted.	 The   Court's	 opinion
     plainly  implies	that   had   the
     Government chosen	to retry Johnson
     on that  count, he	 could not  have
     obtained immunity from prosecutions
     by asserting  that the matter being
     inquired into  was related	 to  the
     motivation for  his House	speech."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     [p. 527]
In his	dissenting judgment  White J., after referring to Ex
parte Wason has observed :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">     "The Wason court clearly refused to
     distinguish  between   promise  and
     performance;    the     legislative
     privilege	applied	 to  both."  [p.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">     546]
The learned Judge then refers to Johnson and says :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">     "I	  find if  difficult to	 believe
     that  under   the	 statute   there
     involved the  Johnson  Court  would
     have permitted  a prosecution based
     upon  a   promise	to   perform   a
     legislative act." [p. 546].
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">But in	Helstoski White	 J. was	 a  party  to  the  majority
judgment delivered by Burger CJ. wherein it was held :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">     "Promises by a member to perform an
     act in  future are	 not legislative
     acts". [p. 23]
     "But it  is clear from the language
     of	 the   clause  that   protection
     extends only  to an  act  that  has
     already been  performed. A	 promise
     to deliver a speech, to vote, or to
     solicit other  votes at some future
     dates is  not `speech  or	debate'.
     Likewise a	 promise to  introduce a
     bill is not a legislative act." [p.
     24].
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">In Bunting  Wilson CJ.,	 has considered,  Ex parte Wason and
has pointed  out that  in that	case the  alleged conspiracy
could not  fall under  the head	 of an	agreement to  do  an
illegal act  because the truth of falsity of statements made
by members  in Parliament could not b e enquired into by the
court and  that it did not also fall under the head of doing
an act,	 nor necessarily  illegal, by  illegal means because
there were  no illegal means used or to be used. The learned
Chief Justice has, however, observed :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">     "But if  these  three  persons  had
     agreed that  the two members of the
     House of  Lords should  make  these
     false statements,	or vote	 in  any
     particular manner, in consideration
     of a  bribe paid  or to  be paid to
     them,  that   would  have	 been  a
     conspiracy	 to   do  an   act,  not
     necessarily illegal perhaps, but to
     do	 the   act  by	 illegal  means,
     bribery being  an	offence	 against
     the  law;	 and  the   offence   of
     conspiracy would have been complete
     by reason	of the	illegal mans  by
     which the act was to be effected.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">     That  offence   could   have   been
     inquired into by the Court, because
     the inquiry  into all that was done
     would have	 been of matters outside
     of the  House of  Lords, and  there
     could therefore be no violation of,
     or	 encroachment	in  any	 respect
     upon, the lex parliament". [p. 554]
In R.  V. Currie  &amp; Ors.  Buckley J.  has  referred  to	 the
observations of Wilson CJ. in Bunting and has ruled that the
reasoning in  Ex parte	Wason would  not  apply	 to  alleged
bribery for  the proof of which no reference to goings on in
Parliament would  be necessary.</blockquote>
<p id="p_81">		       in
     We may  now examine whether the decision Ex parte Wason
has any	 bearing on  the interpretation	 of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_129">Article  105(2).</a>
Clauses (1)  and (2)  of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_130">Article  105</a> are interlinked, while
clause (1)  secures to	the Members  freedom  of  speech  in
Parliament, clause  (@) safeguards  and	 protects  the	said
freedom by conferring immunity on the Members from liability
in respect  of anything	 said or  any vote  given by  him in
Parliament or  in any  committee thereof.  This is necessary
because for  a regulatory  body like Parliament, the freedom
of speech  is of  the utmost  importance and a full and free
debate is  on the  essence of  Parliamentary  democracy.  In
England this  freedom of  speech in Parliament is secured by
<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_131">Article 9</a>  of the  Bill of Rights. Though clause (2) <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_132">Article
105</a> appears to be similar to <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_133">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights
but a  closer look  would show	that they   certain aspects.
<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_134">Article 9</a>  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  by  prescribing	that
"freedom of  speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament
ought not  to be  impeached or	questioned in  any court  or
place out  of Parliament",  confers immunity  in respect  of
speech,	 debates   or  proceedings   in	  Parliament   being
questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. The said
immunity has  been construed  to precluded  what was said or
done in	 Parliament in the course of proceedings there being
examined outside  Parliament for the purpose of supporting a
cause of  action even though the case of action itself arose
out of	something done	outside Parliament.  See : Church of
Scientology of	California v. Johnson Smith, 1972 (1) All ER
378]. In an Australian case R. v. Murphy, (1986) 5 NSWLR 18,
a question  arose whether  in the  course of criminal trial,
the witness's earlier evidence to the Select Committee could
be put	to him in cross-examination with a view to showing a
previous inconsistent  statement. Hunt	J.  in	the  Supreme
Court of New South Wales, held that <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_135">Article 9</a> of the Bill of
Rights did  not prohibit  such cross-examination even if the
suggestion was	made that  the evidence	 given to the Select
Committee was  a lie. He further held that the statements of
the Select  Committee could  b e used to draw inferences and
could  be analysed and be made the basis of submission.
</p><p id="p_82">     In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd., 12994 All ER
</p><p id="p_83">407.  Lord  Browne  Wilkinson,	speaking  for  the  Judicial
Committee of  the Privy	 Council, after	 taking note  of the
decision of Hunt J. in R. v. Murphy (supra), has said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">     "Finally, Hunt  J. based himself on
     a narrow  construction  of	 art  9,
     derived from the historical context
     in which it was originally enacted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">     He	  correctly    identified    the
     mischief sought  to be  remedied in
     1688  as  being,  inter  alia,  the
     assertion by the King's courts of a
     rights  to	  hold	 a   member   of
     Parliament	 criminally  or	 legally
     liable for what he had done or said
     in Parliament. From this he deduced
     the  principle   that  art	 9  only
     applies to	 cases in  which a court
     is being  asked to expose the maker
     of the statement to legal liability
     for what he has said in Parliament.
     This  view	  discounts  the   basic
     concept underlying	 art 9	viz. the
     need to  ensure so	 far as possible
     that a  member of	the  legislature
     and witnesses  before committees of
     the House	can speak freely without
     fear that	what they say will later
     be held against them in the courts.
     The   important   public	interest
     protected by  such privilege  is to
     ensure that  the member  or witness
     at	 the   time  he	 speaks	 is  not
     inhibited from  stating  fully  and
     freely what he has to say. If there
     were any exceptions which permitted
     his  statement   to  be  questioned
     subsequently, at  the time	 when he
     speaks in	Parliament he  would not
     know whether  or  not  there  would
     subsequently be a challenge to what
     he is  saying. Therefore  he  would
     not   have	  the	confidence   the
     privilege is  designed to protect."</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">     [p. 415]
The protection	given under  clause (2)	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_136">Article  105</a>  is
narrower than  that conferred under <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_137">Article 9</a> of the Bill of
Rights in  the sense  that the	immunity conferred  by	that
clause in  personal in nature and is available to the member
in respect  of anything	 said or in any vote given by him in
the House or any committee thereof. The said clause does not
confer an  immunity for challenge in the court on the speech
or vote	 given by  a Member  of Parliament.  The  protection
given under  clause (2)	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_138">Article  105</a> is  thus similar to
protection envisaged  under the	 construction placed by Hunt
J. in  R v.,  Murphy [supra]  on <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_139">Article  9</a> of	the Bill  of
Rights which  has not  been accepted by the Privy Council in
Prebble v.  Television New  Zealand Ltd.  The decision in Ex
parte Wason  (supra), which  was given	in  the	 context  of
<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_140">Article 9</a>  of the  Bill of  Rights, can,  therefore, have no
application in	the matter  of construction of clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_141">Article 105.</a>  Ex parte	Wason (supra),	which holds that the
information laid  by Wason  did not  disclose any indictable
offence, proceeds  on the  basis  that	statements  made  by
members of either House of Parliament in their places in the
House, though they might be untrue to their knowledge, could
not be made the foundation of civil or criminal proceedings.
The position  under clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_142">Article 105</a> is, however,
different. The	said clause does not prescribe that a speech
made or	 vote given by a member in Parliament cannot be made
the basis  of civil or criminal proceedings at all. The said
clause only  gives protection to the member who has made the
speech	or   has  given	 the  vote  from  liability  in	 any
proceeding in  a court	of law. Therefore, on the basis on t
he decision  in Ex  parte Wason	 (supra), it  cannot be said
that no	 offence was  committed by  those who are alleged to
have offered  the illegal gratification and by those who had
received  such	 gratification	to   vote  against   the  No
Confidence  Motion   and  for  that  reason  the  charge  of
conspiracy and	abetment must  also fall.  On the  basis  of
<a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_143">Article 105(2)</a>	the claim  for immunity from prosecution can
be made	 only on  behalf of  A-3 to A-5 and A-16 to A-21 who
are alleged  to have voted against the No Confidence Motion.
As to  whether they  are entitled  to  such  immunity  under
<a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_144">Article 105(2)</a>	will, however,	depend on the interpretation
of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_145">Article 105(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_85">     As indicated  earlier, <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_146">Article  105(2)</a> is in two parts.
In these  appeals we are required to consider the first part
which provides	that no member of Parliament shall be liable
to any	proceedings in any court in respect of anything said
or any	vote given  by him  in Parliament  or any  committee
thereof. The  immunity	that  has  been	 conferred  by	this
provision is  : (i)  only on  the Member of Parliament, (ii)
with regard  to liability  in any  proceedings in any court,
which would  include civil  as well as criminal proceedings,
</p><p id="p_86">(iii) in  respect of anything said or any vote given by such
Member, (iv) in Parliament of in any committee thereof.
</p><p id="p_87">     Shri Rao has submitted that having regard to the object
underlying the	provision, viz.,  to secure  the freedom  of
speech in  Parliament to  the members,	the immunity granted
under clause  (2) must be construed in a wide sense and just
as the expression "anything" was construed in <a href="/doc/367125/" id="a_147">Tej Kiran Jain
&amp; Ors  v. N.  Sanjiva Reedy  &amp; Ors</a>.,  1971 (1) SCR 612, as a
word of	 widest import,	 the expression "in respect of" must
also be	 given a  wide meaning	so as  to comprehend  an act
having a  nexus or connection with the speech made or a vote
given by a member in Parliament or any committee thereof and
would include,	within its  ambit, acceptance  of bribe by a
member in  order to  make a  speech or	to cast	 his vote in
Parliament or  any committee thereof in a particular manner.
In support  of his  submission for giving a wider meaning to
the expression "in respect of" Shri Rao h as relied upon the
decisions of  this Court  in <a href="/doc/353083/" id="a_148">The  State of  Tripura  v.	 The
Province of East Bengal</a>, 1951 (2) SCR 1; <a href="/doc/1014504/" id="a_149">Tolaram Relumal and

1974 (2) All ER 772.
</p><p id="p_88">     The learned  Attorney General  has, on  the other hand,
urged that  immunity granted under clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_151">Article 105</a>
is intended  to protect	 a member form liability arising out
of the speech made by him or vote given by him and it cannot
be extended  to cover  the  conduct  of	 a  member  who	 has
received bribe	or has	entered into  a conspiracy to commit
the offence of bribery in order to make a speech or cast his
vote in	 Parliament. The  submission is	 that the expression
`in respect  of' in  clause (2)	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_152">Article  105</a> must  be so
construed as  to ensure	 that the  immunity conferred  under
clause (2)  is only  available in respect of legitimate acts
of a member of Parliament and it cannot be invoked to secure
immunity against  any criminal	acts committed	by member in
order to  make a speech or to give his vote in Parliament or
in any	committee thereof. According to the learned Attorney
General, the  expression `in  respect of'  in <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_153">Article 105(2)</a>
must be	 construed to	moon `foe'. Reliance has been placed
by him	on the	decision of this Court in State of madras v.
M/s Swastik Tobacco Factory, Vedaranyam, 1966 (3) SCR 79.
</p><p id="p_89">     In Tej  Kiran Jain	 the appellants had filed a suit for
damages in  respect of defamatory statements alleged to have
been made  by certain  members of Parliament on the floor of
the Lok	 Sabha during  a calling  attention motion. The said
suit was  dismissed by	the High  Court on  the view that no
proceedings could  be initiated	 in respect of anything said
on the	floor of  the House in view of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_154">Article 105(2)</a> of the
Constitution. Before  this Court  it was contended on behalf
of the plaintiffs that the immunity under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_155">Article 105(2)</a> was
granted to  what was  relevant to the business of Parliament
and  not   to  something  which	 was  irrelevant.  The	said
contention was rejected by the Court. It was observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">     "The article confers immunity inter
     alia in  respect of  `anything said
     ....... in	 Parliament'.  The  word
     `anything' is  of the widest import
     and is  equivalent to `everything'.
     The only limitation arises from the
     words `in	Parliament' which  means
     during the	 sitting  of  Parliament
     and in  the course	 of the business
     of	 Parliament.  We  are  concerned
     only with	speeches in  Lok  Sabha.</blockquote>
<p id="p_90">     Once it  was proved that Parliament
     was sitting  and its  business  was
     being  transacted,	  anything  said
     during the	 course of that business
     was immune	 from proceeding  in any
     court. This  immunity is  not  only
     compete but  is as it should be. It
     is of  the essence of parliamentary
     system of	Government that people's
     representatives should  be free  to
     express themselves	 without fear of
     legal consequences.  What they  say
     is only  subject to  the discipline
     of the  rules  of	Parliament,  the
     good sense	 of the	 members and the
     control  of   proceedings	by   the
     Speaker. The  courts have no say in
     the matter	 and should  really have
     none." [p. 615]
These observations  in Tej  Kiran Jain	emphasise the object
underlying  the	 immunity  that	 has  been  conferred  under
<a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_156">Article 105(2</a>),	 namely, that  the people's  representatives
should be  free to  exercise their functions without fear of
legal consequences. Borrowing the words Burger CJ. it can be
said that  this immunity has been `"to protect the integrity
of the	legislative process  by ensuring the independence of
the  individual	  legislators".	 It   cannot  be   given   a
construction which  could lead	to <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_157">Article 105(2</a>), a charter
for freedom  of speech in Parliament, being regarded, as per
the phrase  used by  Lord Salmon, a "charter for corruption"
so to  elevate Members	of Parliament  as  "super  citizens,
immune	from   criminal	 responsibility".   (Burger  CJ.  in
Brewster). It would indeed be ironic if a claim for immunity
from  prosecution   founded  on	  the  need  to	 ensure	 the
independence of	 Members of  Parliament in  exercising their
right to  speak or  cast their	vote in Parliament, could be
put  forward   by  a   Member  who  has	 bartered  away	 his
independence by	 agreeing to  speak or	vote in a particular
manner in  lieu of  illegal gratification that has been paid
or promised.  Bu claiming  the immunity	 such a Member would
only be	 seeking  a  licence  to  indulge  in  such  corrupt
conduct.
</p><p id="p_91">     It is  no doubt true that a member who is found to have
accepted bribe in connection with the business of Parliament
can be punished by the House for contempt. But that is not a
satisfactory solution.	In exercise  of its  power to punish
for contempt  the House	 of Commons  can convict a person to
custody and  may also order expulsion or suspension from the
service of  the House.	There is  no power to impose a fine.
The power  of committal	 cannot exceed	the duration  of the
session and  the person,  if not  sooner discharged  by	 the
House,	is   immediately  released   from   confinement	  on
prorogation. [See  " may's Parliamentary Practice, 21st Edn.
pp. 103,  109 and  111]. The  House of	Parliament in  India
cannot claim  a higher	power.	The  Salmon  Commission	 has
stated that  "whilst the  theoretical power  of the House to
commit a  person into custody undoubtedly exists, nobody has
been committed	to prison  for contempt	 of Parliament for a
hundred	 years	 or  son,  and	it  is	most  unlikely	that
Parliament would use this power in modern conditions". [para
306[]. The  Salmon Commission  has also	 expressed the	view
that in	 view of the special expertise that is necessary for
this type  of inquiry  the Committee  of Privileges  do	 not
provide an  investigative machinery  comparable to that of a
police investigation. [para 310]
     The expression  `in respect  of' has to be construed in
this perspective.  The cases  cited by Shri Rao do show that
this expression has been construed as having a wider meaning
to convey  `some connection  or relation  in between the two
subject matters	 to which the words refer'. But as laid down
by this	 Court in <a href="/doc/1609169/" id="a_158">The State of Madras v. M/s Swastik Tabacco
Factory, Vendarayam</a>  (supra) the expression has `received  a
wide interpretation,  having regard  to the  object  of	 the
provisions  and	  the  setting	 in  which  the	 said  words
appeared'. The	expression `in respect of' in <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_159">Article 105(2)</a>
has, therefore,	 to be	construed keeping in view the object
of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_160">Article  105(2)</a> and	the setting  in which the expression
appears in that provision.
</p><p id="p_92">     As	 mentioned  earlier,  the  object  of  the  immunity
conferred  under   <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_161">Article  105(2)</a>     is   to	ensure	 the
independence   of    the   individual	 legislators.	Such
independence is	 necessary for	healthy functioning  of	 the
system	 of   parliamentary   democracy	  adopted   in	 the
Constitution. Parliamentary democracy is a part of the basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 An  interpretation  of	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_162">Article 105(2)</a> which would enable a Member of
Parliament to  claim immunity from prosecution in a criminal
court for  an offence of bribery in connection with anything
said by	 him or	 a vote	 given by  him in  Parliament or any
committee thereof  and thereby	place such Members above the
law would  not only  be repugnant  to healthy functioning of
Parliamentary democracy	 but would also be subversive of the
Rule of	 Law which  is also  an essential  part of the basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 It is	settled law  that in
interpreting the  constitutional provisions the court should
adopt a	 construction  which  strengthens  the	foundational
features and  the basic structure of the Constitution. [See-
Committee on <a href="/doc/1581602/" id="a_163">Judicial Accountability v. Union of India</a>, 1991
(4) SCC	 699, 719].  The expression `in respect of' precedes
the words  `anything said  or any  vote	 given'	 in  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_164">Article
105(2).</a> The words `anything said or any vote given' can only
mean speech  that has  already been  made or a vote that has
already been  given. The immunity from liability, therefore,
comes into  play only  if a speech has been made or vote has
been given.  The immunity  would not  be available in a case
where a	 speech has  not been  made or	a vote	has not been
given. When  there is  a prior agreement whereunder a Member
of Parliament has received an illegal consideration in order
to exercise  his right	to speak  or to	 give  his  vote  in
particular manner  on matter  coming  up  for  consideration
before the  House, there  can be  two  possible	 situations.
There may  be  an  agreement  whereunder  a  Member  accepts
illegal gratification  and agrees not to speak in Parliament
or not	to give his vote in Parliament. The immunity granted
under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_165">Article 105(2)</a> would not be available to such a Member
and he	would be  liable to  be prosecuted  on the charge of
bribery in  a criminal court. What would b e the position if
the agreement  is that	in lieu of the illegal gratification
paid or	 promised the Member would speak or give his vote in
Parliament in  a particular  manner and	 he speaks and gives
his vote  in that manner ? As per the wide meaning suggested
by Shri Rao for the expression `in respect of', the immunity
for prosecution	 would be  available to	 the Member  who has
received illegal  gratification under  such an agreement for
speaking or  giving his vote and who has spoken or given his
vote in	 Parliament as	per the	 said agreement because such
acceptance  of	 illegal  gratification	  has  a   nexus  or
connection with	 such speaking	or giving  of vote  by	that
Member. If  the construction  placed  by  Shri	Rao  on	 the
expression `in	respect of'  is adopted,  a Member  would be
liable to be prosecuted on a charge of bribery if he accepts
bribe for  not speaking	 or for	 not giving  his vote  on  a
matter under  consideration before  the House  but he  would
enjoy immunity	from prosecution  for such  a charge  if  he
accepts bribe  for speaking or giving his vote in Parliament
in a  particular manner	 and he	 speaks or gives his vote in
Parliament in  that manner. It is difficult to conceive that
the framers  of the  Constitution intended  to make  such  a
distinction in	the matter  of grant  of immunity  between a
Member of  Parliament who  receives bribe  for	speaking  or
giving his  vote in  Parliament in  a particular  manner and
speaks or  gives his  vote in  that manner  and a  Member of
Parliament who receives bribe for not speaking or not giving
his vote  on a	particular matter coming up before the House
and does  not speak or give his vote as per the denying such
immunity to the latter. Such an anamolous situation would be
avoided if  the words  `in respect of' in <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_166">Article 105(2)</a> are
construed to  mean `arising  our of'.  If the express in `in
respect of'  is thus construed, the immunity conferred under
<a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_167">Article 105(2)</a>	would be  confined to  liability that arises
out of or is attributable to something that has been said or
to a  vote that	 has been given by a Member in Parliament or
any committee  thereof. The immunity would be available only
if the	speech that  has been made or the vote that has been
given is  an essential	and integral  part of  the cause  of
action for the proceedings giving rise to the liability. The
immunity would	not be	available to give protection against
liability for  an act that precedes the making of the speech
or giving  of vote  by a Member in Parliament even though it
may have a connection with the speech made or the vote given
by the Member if such an act gives rise to a liability which
arise independently and does not depend on the making of the
speech or  the giving  of vote	in Parliament by the Member.
Such  an   independent	liability   cannot  be	regarded  as
liability in  respect of  anything said or vote given by the
Member in  Parliament. The  liability for which immunity can
be claimed  under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_168">Article  105(2)</a> is  the liability that has
arisen as  a consequence of the speech that has been made or
the vote that has been given in Parliament.
</p><p id="p_93">     An indication  about the liability with regard to which
immunity is  granted by	 <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_169">Article  105(2)</a>  is  given  in	 the
Legislative Privileges Case wherein in the context of clause
(2) of	<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_170">Article 194</a>,  which confers immunity similar to that
conferred  by	<a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_171">Article	 105(2)</a>	 on  Members  of  the  State
Legislatures, it has been said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">     "Having conferred freedom of speech
     on	 the   legislators,  clause  (2)
     emphasises the  fact that	the said
     freedom   is    intended	to   the
     abosolute and  unfettered.	 Similar
     freedom  is   guaranteed	to   the
     legislators in respect of the votes
     they may  given in	 the Legislature
     or any  committee thereof. In other
     words,   even   if	  a   legislator
     exercises his  right of  freedom of
     speech  in	  violation,   say,   of
     <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_172">Article 21</a>,  he would not be liable
     for  any	action	in   any  court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">     Similarly, if the legislator by his
     speech or	vote, is alleged to have
     violated  any  of	the  fundamental
     rights guaranteed	by Part	 III  of
     the Constitution in the Legislative
     Assembly,	 he    would   not    be
     answerable	    for	    the	    said
     contravention in  any court. If the
     impugned speech amounts to libel or
     becomes  actionable  or  indictable
     under any	other provision	 of  the
     law, immunity has been conferred on
     him from any action in any court by
     this clause." [p. 441]
     With regard to liability arising from giving of vote in
the House  an illustration  is furnished  by the decision of
the US Supreme Court in Kilbourn v. Thompson, 26. L.Ed. 377.
In the case one Hallet Kilbourn was found guilty of contempt
of the	House of  Representatives  and	was  ordered  to  be
detained in custody under a resolution passed by that House.
He brought  an action  in trespass  for	 false	imprisonment
against the  members of the House who had voted in favour of
the resolution.	 The action  was held to be not maintainable
against the members in view of the immunity conferred by the
Speech or Debate Clause in the US Constitution.
</p><p id="p_95">     The  construction	placed	by  on	the  expression	 `in
respect of'  in <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_173">Article	 105(2)</a> raises the question : Is the
liability to  be prosecuted arising from acceptance of bribe
by a  Member of	 Parliament for	 the purpose  of speaking or
giving his  vote in  Parliament in  a particular manner on a
matter	pending	  considerations   before   the	  House	  an
independent liability  which cannot  be said to arise out of
anything said  or any vote given by the Member in Parliament
? In  our opinion,  this question  must be  answered in	 the
affirmative. The  offence of bribery is made out against the
receiver if takes or agrees to take money for promise to act
in  a	certain	 way.  The  offence  is	 complete  with	 the
acceptance of  the money  or on t he agreement to accept the
money  being   concluded  and	is  not	  dependent  on	 the
performance of	the illegal  promise by	 the  receiver.	 The
receiver of  the money will be treated to have committed the
offence even  when he  defaults in  the illegal bargain. For
proving the  offence of	 bribery all  that is required to be
established is	that the  offender has received or agreed to
receive money  for a  promise to act in a certain way and it
is not	necessary to  go further  and prove that he actually
acted in that way.
</p><p id="p_96">     The offence  of criminal conspiracy
     is defined in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_174">Section 120A</a> in these

     more parties  to such  agreement in
     pursuance thereof.
</p><p id="p_100">     Explanation.-  It	 is   immaterial

</p><p id="p_101">The offence is made out when two or more persons agree to do

120A</a> IPC  an agreement	to commit an offence shall by itself
amount to  criminal conspiracy	and it is not necessary that
some act besides the agreement should be done by one or more
parties to  such agreement  in pursuance thereof. This means
that the  offence of  criminal conspiracy would be committed
if two or more persons enter into an agreement to commit the
offence of bribery and it is immaterial whether in pursuance
of that	 agreement that	 act that  was agreed  to be done in
lieu of payment of money was done or not.

independently of the making of the speech or giving of	vote
by the	Member and  the said liability cannot, therefore, be
regarded as  a liability `in respect of anything said or any

that the  protection granted  under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_176">Article 105(2)</a> cannot be

</p><p id="p_103">     Shri P.P.	Rao has	 also  invoked	the  privileges	 and
immunities available  to Members  of Parliament under clause
(3) of	<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_185">Article 105.</a> It has been urged that since no law has
been made  by Parliament defining the powers, privileges and
immunities  of	 each  House   of  Parliament,	the  powers,
privileges and	immunities enjoyed  by Members of Parliament
in India are the same as those enjoyed by the Members of the
House of  Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom at
the commencement of the Constitution on January 26, 1950. In
order to show that on January 26, 1950 a Member of the House
of Commons  in the  United Kingdom  enjoyed an immunity from
prosecution for	 bribery in  connection with the exercise of
his functions  as such	Member, Shri  Rao  has	invited	 our
attention to  the following statement in May's Parliamentary
Practice :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">     "The acceptance  by any  Member  of
     either  House   of	  a   bribe   to
     influence him  in	his  conduct  as

     compensation    or	    reward    in
     connection with  the promotion  of,
     or	  opposition	to   any   bill,
     resolution,   matter    of	   thing
     submitted	 or   intended	 to   be
     submitted	to   the  House	 or  any
     committee thereof	is a  breach  of
     privilege." [18th Edn.p. 138]
It has	been submitted that since acceptance of a bribe by a
Member	of  House  of  Commons	was  treated  as  breach  of
privilege and  was not triable as an offence in any criminal
court in the United Kingdom, the same privilege and immunity
is available to a Member of Parliament in India by virtue of
the second  part of  clause (3)	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_186">Article 105.</a> It has been
further contended  that in  a case  where the  conduct which
constitutes the	 breach of  privilege is  also an offence at
law, it	 is for	 the House  to decide whether the punishment
which the  House is  empowered to inflict is not adequate to
the offence  and it is necessary that the offender should be
prosecuted in  a criminal  court an  d reliance is placed on
the following passage in May's Parliamentary Practice :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">     "In case  of  breach  of  privilege
     which are	also  offences	at  law,
     where  the	  punishment  which  the
     House has	power to  inflict  would
     not be adequate to the offences, or
     where for any other cause the House
     has  though  a  proceeding	 at  law
     necessary, either	as a  substitute
     for, or  in addition  to,	its  own
     proceeding,  the  Attorney	 General
     has been  directed to prosecute the
     offender." [18th Edn. p.127]
In the	Legislative Privileges Case, while construing clause
(3) of	<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_187">Article 194</a>,  which was	 in the same terms as clause
(3) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_188">Article 105</a>, this Court has said :-</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">     "This  clause   requires  that  the
     powers, privileges	 and  immunities
     which are claimed by the House must
     be shown  to ave  subsisted at  the
     commencement of  the  Constitution,
     i.e., on  January 26,  1950. It  is
     well known	 that  out  of	a  large
     number  of	 privileges  and  powers
     which the	House of Commons claimed
     during the	 days  of  its	  bitter
     struggle for recognition, some were
     given up  in course  of  time,  and
     some   virtually	faded	out   by
     desuetude; and  so, in  every  case
     where a  power is	claimed,  it  is
     necessary to enquire whether it was
     an existing  power at  the relevant
     time. It  must also appear that the
     said power	 was not only claimed by
     the House	of  Commons,  but  if  a
     particular power  which is	 claimed
     by the  House was	claimed	 by  the
     House  of	 Commons  but	was  not
     recognised by  the English	 courts,
     it would still be upheld that under
     the latter	 part of clause (3) only
     on the  ground that  it was in fact
     claimed by the House of Commons. In
     other words,  the inquiry	which is
     prescribed by  this clause	 is : is
     the power	in  questions  shown  or
     proved to	have  subsisted	 in  the
     House of  Commons at  the	relevant
     time."  [pp.  442,	 443]  [emphasis
     supplied]
The learned  Attorney General  has submitted  that till	 the
decision in  R.V. Currie  &amp; Ors. the position in England was
that acceptance	 of bribe  by a Member of Parliament was not
being treated  as an  offence at  common law,  the  question
whether a  Member of  Parliament  enjoys  an  immunity	from
prosecution in a criminal court on a charge of bribery never
came up	 before the English courts and, therefore, it cannot
be said that on January 26, 1950 the members of the House of
Commons in  t he  United Kingdom  enjoyed a privilege, which
was recognised by the English courts, that they could not be
prosecuted on  a charge	 of bribery  in a criminal court and
that such  a privilege	cannot,	 therefore,  be	 claimed  by
members of  Parliament in  India under clause (3) of Article
</blockquote><p id="p_104">105. The learned Attorney General has placed reliance on the
following observations of Stephen J. in Bradiaugh V. Gossett
(1884) 12 QBD 271 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     "I know  of no  authority	for  the
     proposition that  an ordinary crime
     committed in  the House  of Commons
     would   be	  withdrawn   from   the
     ordinary	course	  of	criminal
     justice."</blockquote>
<p id="p_105">     The learned  Attorney General  has also placed reliance
on the	following statement  of law  in Halsbury's  Laws  of
England, Vol  AA(1/), Para  37 at  page 40,  wherein  it  is
stated :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">     "37. Members  of Parliament. Except
     in relation  to  anything	said  in
     debate, a	member of  the House  of
     Lords or of the House of Commons is
     subject to	 the ordinary  course of
     criminal justice, the privileges of
     Parliament do not apply to criminal
     matters."
</blockquote><p id="p_106">In Footnote (1) to the said para it is stated that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">     "Although	members	  are	probably
     subject to	 the jurisdiction of the
     courts in	respect of other conduct
     in Parliament,  they cannot be made
     criminally	  responsible	in   the
     courts for	 what is said by them in
     Parliament while it is sitting; see
     the Privileges  of	 Parliament  Act
     1512 (as amended)."
</blockquote><p id="p_107">We find	 considerable force  in the  aforesaid submission of
the learned  Attorney General.	Since offering of bribe to a
Member of  Parliament and acceptance of bribe by him had not
been treated  as an  offence at	 common law by the courts in
England, when  t he  Constitution was  adopted in  1950, the
fact that  such conduct	 was being  treated as	a breach  of
privilege by  the House	 of Commons  in England at that time
would not  necessarily mean  that the courts would have been
precluded from	trying the offence of bribery committed by a
Member of Parliament if it were to be treated as an offence.
In Australia  and Canada  where bribery	 of a legislator was
treated as  an offence	at common  law the  courts in White,
Boston and  Bunting has	 held that  the legislator  could be
prosecuted in  the criminal  court for	the said offence. It
cannot, therefore, be said that since acceptance of bribe by
a Member  of House  of Commons	was treated  as a  breach of
privilege by  the House of Commons and action could be taken
by the House for contempt against the Member, the Members of
the House  of Commons,	on January 26. 1950, were enjoying a
privilege that in respect of conduct involving acceptance of
bribe in  connection with  the business	 of Parliament, they
could only  be punished for breach of privilege of the House
and they  could not  be prosecuted in a court of law. Clause
(3) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_189">Article 105</a> of the Constitution cannot, therefore, be
invoked by the appellants to claim immunity from prosecution
in respect of the charge levelled against them.
</p><p id="p_108">     Before we conclude on this aspect relating to the claim
for immunity  from  prosecution,  we  would  deal  with	 the
contention urged  by Shri  D.D. Thakur	wherein he  has laid
emphasis  on   the     practical  political  realities.	 The
submission of  Shri Thakur  is that during the course of the
election   campaign    a   candidate	receives   financial
contributions and  also makes promises to the electorate and
that if	 the immunity  under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_190">Article 105(2)</a> is not available
he would  be liable to be prosecuted if, after being elected
as member  of Parliament,  he speaks  or gives	his vote  in
Parliament in  fulfilment of  those  promises.	The  learned
counsel has  placed reliance  on the  dissenting judgment of
White J.  in Brewster wherein he has expressed the view that
permitting the	executive to  initiate the  prosecution of a
member of  Congress for	 the specific  crime of	 bribery  is
subject to  serious potential  abuse that might endanger the
independence of	 the legislature.  Burger CJ.  has, however,
pointed out that there was no basis for such an apprehension
inasmuch as  no case was cited in which the bribery statutes
which have  been applicable  to members of Congress for over
100 years  have been  abused by	 the Executive	Branch.	 The
learned Chief Justice has stated :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">     "We do  not discount  entirely  the
     possibility  that	an  abuse  might
     occur, but	 this possibility, which
     we	  consider   remote,   must   be
     balanced  against	 the   potential
     danger  flowing   from  either  the
     absence  of   a   bribery	 statute
     violates the  Constitution.  As  we
     noted at the outset, the purpose of
     the Speech	 or Debate  Clause is to
     protect the  individual legislator,
     not simply for his own sake, but to
     preserve	the   independence   and
     thereby  the   integrity	of   the
     legislative process.  But financial
     abuses, by	 way of	 bribes, perhaps
     even  more	 than  Executive  power,
     would gravely undermine legislative
     integrity and  defeat the	right of
     the      public	  to	  honest
     representation.	Depriving    the
     Executive	 of    the   power    to
     investigate and  prosecute and  the
     Judiciary of  the power  to  punish
     bribery of	 Members of  Congress is
     unlikely  to   enhance  legislative
     independence." [p. 525]
In the	earlier part  of the judgment we have found that for
the past  more than  100 years	legislators in Australia and
Canada are liable to be prosecuted for bribery in connection
with their legislative activities and, with the exception of
the United Kingdom, most of the commonwealth countries treat
corruption and	bribery	 by  members  of  legislature  as  a
criminal offence.  In the  United Kingdom  also there  is  a
move to	 change the  law in this regard. There appears to be
no reason why legislators in India should be beyond the pale
of laws	 governing bribery  and corruption  when  all  other
public functionaries  are subject  to  such  laws.  We	are,
therefore, unable   to	uphold the  above contention of Shri
Thakur.</blockquote>
<p id="p_109">     On a  consideration of  the submissions  urged  by	 the
learned counsel	 we arrive  at the  conclusion that  on	 the
basis of  provisions contained	in clauses  (2) and  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_191">Article 105</a>,  the  appellants  cannot  claim  immunity	from
prosecution on	the charges  that have been levelled against
them.

servant'  in   <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_206">Section	21</a>   IPC  and  that  the  amendments
introduced in  <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_207">Section 21</a>  IPC by  the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_208">Amendment Act</a> of 1964
did not	 bring about  any change.  While dealing with clause
(12)(a) of  <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_209">Section 21</a>	IPC, as amended by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_210">Amendment Act</a>
of 1964,  the Court observed that a person would be a public
servant under  clause (12)(a) if (i) he is in the service of
the Government,	 or (ii) he is in the pay of the Government,
or (iii)  he is	 remunerated by	 fees or  commission for the
performance of	any public  duty by  the Government.  It was
held that  even though	a  Member  of  Legislative  Assembly
receives his  salary and  allowances in his capacity as such
Member, he  is not  a person  in the  pay of  the Government
inasmuch  as   the  expression	 `Government'  connotes	 the
executive and not eh legislature and a Member of Legislative
Assembly is  certainly not  in the  pay of the executive. It
was also  held that a Member of Legislative Assembly is also
not remunerated	 for performance  of any  public duty by the
Government because he is not remunerated by fees paid by the
Government, i.e.  the Executive.  At the  same	time,  while
dealing with  the contention  that a  Member of	 Legislative
Assembly is not performing any public duty it was observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">     "It is  not  necessary  to	 examine
     this aspect  because it  would   be
     rather  difficult	 to  accept   an
     unduly vide  submission that M.L.A.
     is not  performing any public duty.
     However, it  is unquestionable that
     he is  not	 performing  any  public
     duty   either   directed	by   the
     Government or  for the  Government.</blockquote>
<p id="p_112">     He no  doubt performs public duties
     cast on him by the Constitution and
     his electorate.  He thus discharges
     constitutional functions  for which
     he is  remunerated by  fees under t
     he	 Constitution  and  not	 by  the
     Executive" [p. 548]
The Court  also considered  the question whether a Member of
the Legislative	 Assembly is a public servant with reference
to clauses  (3) and  (7) of  <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_211">Section 21</a>	 IPC and held that a
member of  the Legislative  Assembly did not fall within the
ambit of the said clauses.

<p id="p_115">     The clause	 relevant for  our purpose  is clause (viii)
whereunder "any	 person who  holds an  office by  virtue  of
which he  is authorised	 or required  to perform  any public
duty" is  to be	 treated as  a public servant under the 1988
Act. The  said clause  postulates that	the person  must (i)
hold an	 office and  (ii) by  virtue of that office (iii) he
must be	 authorised or	requried to  perform (iv)  a  public
duty.
</p><p id="p_116">     On behalf	of the	appellants it has been urged that  a
Member of Parliament does not fall within the amibit of this
clause because (1) he does not hold an office; and (2) he is
not authorised	or requried  to perform	 any public  duty by
virtue of his office.
</p><p id="p_117">     We will  first examine the question whether a Member of
Parliament holds  an office.  The word	`office' is normally
understood to  mean "a	position to which certain duties are
attached, esp.	a place of trust, authority or service under
constituted  authority".   [See	 :  Oxford  Shorter  English
Dicikonary, 3rd Edn. p. 1362]. In McMillan v. Guest, 1942 AC
561, Lord Wright has said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">     "The word `office' is of indefinite
     content. It  various meanings cover
     four columns  of  the  New	 English
     Dictionary, but  I take as the most
     relevant for  pusposes of this case
     the  following  :	"A  position  or
     place to  which certain  duties are
     "attached, especially one of a more
     or less public character."
</blockquote><p id="p_118">In the same case Lord Atkin gave the following meaning :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">     "an office	 or employment which was
     subsisting, permanent,  substantive
     position, which  had  an  existence
     independent  of   the  person   who
     filled it,	 which went  on and  was
     filled in	succession by successive
     holders."</blockquote>

this   Court has  adopted the  meaning given  by Lord Wright
when it said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">     "An office	 means on  more	 than  a
     position to  which	 certain  duties
     are attached."</blockquote>
<p id="p_120">     <a href="/doc/335022/" id="a_221">In Kanta  Kathuria v.  Manakchand Surana</a>,	1970 (2) SCR

speaking for  the majority,  while construing  the  words  "
holds any  office of  profit" in  Articel 19(1)(g), has said
that "there  must be an office which exists independently of
the holder  of the office". It was observed that there is no
essential difference  betweent he  definitions given by Lord
Wright and Lord Atkin.
</p><p id="p_121">     In White  the Supreme Court of New South Wales has held
that a member of the State Legislature holds an office. That
view has  been affirmed	 byt he	 High Court  of Australia in
Boston. Isaacs &amp; Tich, JJ. said :
</p><p id="p_122">     "A	  membr	   of	Parliament   is,
     therefore, in the highest sense, as
     servant of	 the State;  his  duties
     are  those	  appertaning	to   the
     position he fills, a position of no
     transient or temporary existence, a
     position  forming	 a   recongnized
     place   in	   the	  constitutional
     machinery of government. Why, then,
     does he  not hold	an "office"?  In
     R.V. White it was held, as a matter
     of	 cours,	  that	the  does.  That
     decision  is   sound.  "Office"  is
     defined in	 the Oxford  Dictionary,
     as including  :- "5.  A position or
     place to  which certain  duties are
     attached, esp,  one of  a	more  or
     less public  character; a	position
     of	 turst,	 authority,  or	 service
     under constituted	authority."  And
     "Officer" is  defined (inter  alia)
     as "2.  One  who  holds  an  ofice,
     post, or place. (a) One who holds a
     public,  civil,  or  ecclesiastical
     office;	  ...	   a	  person
     authoritatively	appointed     or
     elected to	 exercise some	function
     pertaining to public life." Clearly
     amember of	 Parliament is a "public
     officer" in a very real sense , for
     he has,  in the words of Willams J.
</p><p id="p_123">     in Faulkner  V.  Upper  Boddingtion
     Overseers, "duties to perform which

     <a href="/doc/199699/" id="a_222">In Habibullah  Khan v.  State of  Orissa</a>, 1993 Cr. L.J.
3604, the  Orissa Hihg	Court has  held that a Member of the
Legislatvie Assembly  holds an	office and performs a public
duty. The learned Judges have examined the matter keeping in
view the  meaning given	 to the	 expression "office" by Lord
Wright as  well as  by	Lord  Atkin  in	 McMillan  v.  Guest
[supra].  Taking   into	 consideration	 the  provisions  of
Articles 168,  170, 172 and 173 of the Constitution relating
to Legislative Assembly of the State, the learned Judge ahve
held that  the Member of the Legislative Assembly if created
by the	Constitution and that there is a distinction between
the office and the holder of the office.
</p><p id="p_124">     Shri P.P.	Rao has, however, pointed out that under the
COnstitution a distinction has been made between an 1office'
and a 1seat' and that while the expression `office' has been
used   int    he   COnstitution	   inrelation	to   various
constitutional authorities  such as President, [Articles 56,
57, 59	a nd  62] Vice-Presiden,  [<a href="/doc/1944038/" id="a_223">Article 67]</a>	Speaker	 and

a Member  of State  Legoslature is  concerned the expression
used in	 `seat'	 and  not  `office'  which  shows  that	 the
COnstitution  does   not  contemplate	that  a	  Member  of
Parliament or a Member of State Legislature holds an Office.
In this	 context Shri  Rao  has	 invited  our  attention  to
<a href="/doc/568164/" id="a_232">Article 84</a><a href="/doc/813152/" id="a_233">, 99</a>, and <a href="/doc/1185201/" id="a_234">101</a> where the expression `seat' has been

and <a href="/doc/848108/" id="a_236">190</a>	 where the  word `seat'	 has been used in respect of
Members of State Legislatures.
</p><p id="p_125">     The learned  Attorney General  has, on  the other hadn,
invited our  attention to  <a href="/doc/519318/" id="a_237">Section 12</a>,	<a href="/doc/115512669/" id="a_238">154</a>, and  <a href="/doc/70689510/" id="a_239">155</a> of the

(Pension).
</p><p id="p_126">     It would thus appear that although in t he Constitution
the word  `office' has been used  in the provisions relating
to Members  of Parliament  and members	of State Legislature
but in	other	parliamentary enactment relating toe members
of Parliament the word `office' has been used. Having regard
to the	provisions of the Contitution and the Representation
fo the	<a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_249">People Act</a>,  1951 as  well as the Salary, Allowances
and Pension  fo Members	 of Parliament	Act,  1954  and	 the
meaning that  has been	given to the expressiion `office' in
the decisions  of this	Court,	we  are	 of  the  view	that
Membership of  Parliament is an `office' inasmuch as it is a
position carrying  certain responsibilities  which are	of a
public character  and it has an existence independent of the
holder of  the office.	It must, therefore, be held that the
Member of Parliament holds an `office'.
</p><p id="p_127">     The next  question is whether a Member of Parliament is
authorised or  required to perform any public duty by virtue
of his	office. As  mentioned earlier, in <a href="/doc/1586918/" id="a_250">R.S. Navak v. A.R.
Antulay</a> this  Court has	 said that  though a  member of	 the
State Legislature  is not  performing any public duty either
directed by  the Government  or for the Government but he no
doubt performs public duties cast on him by the Constitution
and by	his  electorate	 and  he  discharges  constitutional
obligations for	 which he  is  remunerated  fees  under	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_128">     In the  1988 Act  the expression `publid duty' has been
defined in  <a href="/doc/655475/" id="a_251">Section 2(b)</a>  to mean  " duty in the dischrge of
which the State, the public or the community at large has an
interest".
</p><p id="p_129">     The Form of Oath or Affirmation which is required to be
made by	 a Member  of Parliament  (as  prescribed  in  Third
Schedule to the Constitution) is in these terms :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">     "I, A.B.,	haing been  elected  (or
     nominated) a  member of the Council
     of States	(or  the  House	 of  the

     God/ Solemnly  affirm that	 I  will
     bear ture	faith and  allegiance to
     the Constitution of India as by law
     established,  that	 I  will  uphold
     that sovereignty  and integrity  of
     India and	that I	will  faithfully
     discharge the  duty upon which I am
     about to enter."
</blockquote><p id="p_130">The words  "faithfully discharge  the duty  uponwhich  I  am
about to enter' show that a Member of Parliament is required
to discharge certain duties after he is sworn in as a Memebr
of Parliament. Under the COnstitution the Union Executive is
responsibel to	Parliament and	Members of Parliament act as
watchdogs ont he functioning of the Council of Ministers. In
adition, a Member of Parliament plays an importance role  in
parliamentary	proceedings,	including    enactment	  of
legislation,  which   is  asovereign  function.	 The  duties
discharged by  him are	such in	 which the State, the public
and the	 community at  large have  an interest	and the said
duties are,  therefore, public duties. It can be said that a
Member of  Parliament is  authorised  and  requried  by	 the
Constitution to perform these duties and the said duties are
performed by him by virtue of his office.
</p><p id="p_131">     In Horne  v. Barber,  (1920) 27 CLR
     494 at  p. 500,  Isaacs J. has said
     :-
</p><p id="p_132">     "When a  man becomes  a  member  of
     Parliament,  he   undertakes   high
     public  duties.  Those  duties  are
     inseparable from  the position : he
     cannot retain the honour and divest
     himself of	 the duties.  One of the
     duties  is	  that	of  watching  on
     behalf of the general community the
     conduct  of   the	 Executive,   of
     criticizing it,  and if  necessary,
     of calling	 it to	account	 in  the
     constitutional way	 by censure from
     his place	in Parliament  - censure
     which, if	sufficiently  supported,
     means removal  from office. That is
     the whowle	 essence of  responsibel
     Government,w hich	is the	Keystone
     of our Political system, and is the
     main consititutional  safeguard the
     community possesses," [p. 402]
     In Boston	while examining	 the  nature  of  duties  of
Member of  Parliament, Isaacs  &amp; Rich,	JJ. have reitereated
the abovequoted	 observations	in Horne  v. Brber  and have
said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">     "The fundamental  obligation  of  a
     membr in relation to the Parliament
     of which  he is  a constituent unit

     fundamental obligation which is the
     key to  this case	is the	duty  to

     "These duties are of a transcendent

     people,   and   the   function   of
     vigilantly	    controlling	     and
     faithfully	 guarding   the	  public
     finances." [p. 401]
     We are,  therefore,  of  the  view	 that  a  Member  of
Parliament holds  an office  and by virtue of such office he
is required  or authorised to perform duties and such duties
are in	the nature  of public duties. A Member of Parliament
would, therefore, fall withint he ambit of sub-clause (viii)
of clause (c) of <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_252">Section 2</a> of the 1988 Act.
</p><p id="p_134">     The learned  counsel for  the appellants have, however,
urged that  while enacting  the 1988  Act Parliament did not
intend to  include Member  of Parliament  and Members of the
State Legislatures  within the ambit of the Act and that the
expression "public  servant" as	 defined in  <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_253">Section 2(c)</a> of
the 1988  Act	should be so construed as to exclude Members
of Parliament and Members of State Legislatures. The learned
counsel ahve  placed strong reliance ont eh speeches of Shri
P. Chaidambaram,  the then Minister of State in the Ministry
of Personnel,  Public Grievances  and Pensions	and  in	 the
Ministry of  Home Affairs during the course of debate on the
Prevention of Corruption Bill, 1987 in the Lok Sabha as well
as int	he Rajya  Sabha. Reliance  has been  palced  on	 the
following excerpts  from the  speech of	 the Minister in the
Lok Sabha  on May  7, 1987  and in the Rajya Sabha on May 11
and August 11, 1987 :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_95">     Lok Sabha

     to the  law  as  it  stands  today.
     Under the	law, as it stands today,
     the  Supreme   Court  has	held  in

     I believe that when an MP functions

     servant and,  therefore, we are not
     attempting a  definition which will
     lead to difficulties. We think that
     there could  b e situations when an
     MP of  an MLA  does  centain  thing
     which are	really not  part of  his
     duties as	an MP  an MLA.	We think
     that an  MP  or  an  MLA  could  in
     certain   ciecumstances   hold   an
     office where he Act. If an MP or an

     qua-MLA,  but   as	 an  indicidual,
     abusing  his  position,  I	 am  not
     using the	word `Office' I think he

	  "Now I  will reply to the best
     of my  ability how	 an MP or an MLA

	  A  law   has	to  be	made  by

     say while	we are	making a law. We
     believe  that   our  interpretation
     will be  accepted by the courts. If
     you    find    fault    with    our
     interpretation tell  use  where  we
     should improve  the bill,	tell  us

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">	  A question was asked about the
     Member of Parliament and Members of

     Member of	Legislative Assembly per
     se is  not a  public  servant.  But
     there can be a number of situations
     where an MP or an MLA holds another
     office and	 discharges other duties
     which will	 being	him  under  this
     Bill. If	he  holds another office
     in a  cooperative	society,  if  he

     certain  duties   which  will  come
     under the	definition  of	  public
     duty  clearly,  then  he  would  be
     within the	 definition  of	 `public
     servant' under this Bill. But these
     are matters  in  which  you  cannot
     make on a prior assumption. One has
     to look into the facts of each case
     and then the courts will decided on
     the facts of that case.</blockquote>
<p id="p_135">     It has been urged that these excerpts from the speeches
of the	Minister who has moved the Bill for consideration in
both the  Houses of  Parliament throws considerable light on
the meaning of the expression `public servant' as defined in
<a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_258">Section 2(c)</a>  of the 1988 Act and that provisions of <a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_259">Section
2(c)(viii)</a> of  the 1988	 Act should  be given a construction
whihc is  in accord  with these	 statements of the Minister.
Relying upon the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_260">K.P. Verghese v.
Income Tax  Officer</a>, 1982  (1) SCR  629, <a href="/doc/1586918/" id="a_261">R.S.  Nayak v. A.R.
ANTULAY</a> (supra);  <a href="/doc/1590801/" id="a_262">State of  Orissa v.  Mahanadi Coal Fields</a>,

Union of  India</a>, 1989(3) SCR 43, Shri Rao has urged that the
speech of  the mover  of the  Bill can	be looked  into	 for
construing the	provisions of  the enactment.  It  has	been
pointed out  tht in  hte recent	 decision in <a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_264">Pepper v. Hart</a>,
1993 (1)  All ER  42, the  House of  Lorde has also departed
from the  earlier position taken by the courts in England in
this regard  and that it has been held that the statement of
the Minister  who had  moved the  Bill in  Parliament can be
taken into consideration for the purpose of interpreting the
provisions of the enactment.
</p><p id="p_136">     The view  vwhich prevailed	 earlier with  the courts in
England was  that references to Parliamentary material as an
aid to	statutory construction	is not permissible. The said
exclusionary rule  precluded the  court from looking even at
reports made  by  Commissioners	 on  which  legislation	 was
based. The  rigidity of	 the said  rule was relaxed in later
decisions  so	as  to	 permit	 reports  of  Commissioners,
including Law  Commissioners, and  white papers to be looked
at for	the purpose solel,y of ascertaining the mischief the
statute is  intended to	 cure but  not for  the	 purpsoe  of
discovering the	 meaning of  the words used by Parliament to
effect such  cure. Parliamentary  debates were, however, not
looked at  as an  aid to construction. The rationale for the
exculsion of  parliament debates  is contained in the speech
of  Lord   Reld	 in   Black-Clawson  International  Ltd.  v.
Papierworke Waidhof-Aschaffenburg,  1975 AC 591. The learned
Lord Reid has said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_100">     "We often	say that  we are looking
     for the  intention	 of  Parliament,
     but that  is not quite accurate. We
     are  seeking  the	meaning	 of  the
     words whihc Parliament used. We are
     seeking not  what Parliament  meant
     but the  true meaning  of what they
     said."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_101">     "The questions  which give	 rise to
     debate are rerely those which later
     have to  be decided  by the courts.</blockquote>
<p id="p_137">     One might	take the  views	 of  the
     promoters	 of   a	  Bill	 as   an
     indication	 of   the  intention  of
     Parliament	  but	any   view   the
     promoters	may   have   had   about
     questions which  later come  before
     the court	will not often appear in
     Hansard and  often those  questions
     have  neve	  occurred   to	  t   he
     promoters. At  best  we  might  get
     material from  which a more or less
     dubious inference moght be drawn as
     to what  the promoters inmtended or
     would have	 intended  if  they  had
     though about  the	matter,	 and  it
     would,  I	 think,	 gfenerally   be
     dangerous to  attach weight to what
     some other	 members of either House
     may have said" [pp. 613-615]
     The decision  in <a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_265">Pepper  v. Hart</a>  makes an	 advance. In
that case  Lord Browne-	 Wilkisnon, who	 delivered the	main
judgment, has said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_102">     ".........In my  judgment, subject	 to the questions of
     the privileges  of the  House of  Commons, reference to
     parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to
     the construction  of legislation  which is ambiguous or
     obscure or	 the literal  meaning of  which leads  to an
     absurdity. Even  in such  cases references	 in court to
     parliamentary material  should only  be permitted where
     such material  clearly discloses t he mischief aimed at
     or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous
     or obscure	 words. In  the case  of statements  made in
     Parliament, as at present advised I cannot foresee that
     any statement  other than the statement of the minister
     or other  promoter of  the Bill is likely to meet these
     criteria." [p.64]
     "........Given the	 purposive approach  to construction
     now adopted  byt eh  courts in  order to give effect to
     the  true	intentions  of	the  legislature,  the	fine
     distinctuions between  looking  for  the  mischief	 and
     looking for  the intention	 in useing  words to provide
     the remedy	 are technicdal and inappropriate. Clear and
     unambiguous statements  made by ministers in Parliament
     are  as   much  the  background  to  the  enactment  of
     legislation as white papers and parliamentary reports."</blockquote>
<p id="p_138">     [p. 65]
     In the  earlier decisions	this court  also adopted the
rule  of   exclusion  followed	 by  the   English   courts.
Parliamentary debates on a Bull were held to be inadmissible
for construction  of the  Act [See  : <a href="/doc/950735/" id="a_266">Aswini  Kumar Ghose v.
Arabinda Bose</a>.	1953 SCR  1 at p. 29]. But in later judgemnt
this court  has referred to the speech of the Minister while
introducting the  Bill in the Legislature for the purpose of
ascertaining the  mischief sought  to  be  remedied  by	 the
legislation  and  the  object  and  purpose  for  which	 the
legislation is	enacted. <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_267">In  K.P.  Verghese  v.	 Income	 Tax
Officer</a>, 1982 (1) SCR 629, Bhagwati,J. (as the learned Chief
Justice then was)  has siad :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">     "Now it  is true  that the speeches
     made  by	the   Members	of   the
     Legislatures on  the florr	 of  the
     House when	 a Bill	 for enacting  a
     statutory	 provision    is   being
     debated are  inadimissible for  the
     purpose   of    interpreting    the
     statutory provision  but he  speech
     made  by  the  Mover  of  the  Bill
     explaining	 the   reason  for   the
     introduction  of	the   Bill   can
     certainly be  referred to	for  the
     purpose   of    ascertaining    the
     mischief sought  to  be remedied by
     the legislation  and the object and
     purpose for  which the  legislation
     is enacted." [p. 645]
     The otehr	decisions of this Court cited by Shri Rao do
not lay	 down any  different principle. On the other hand in
<a href="/doc/1195357/" id="a_268">Snajeev Coke  Manufacturing Co.	 v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd</a>.,
1983 (1) SCR 1000, this court has laid down :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_104">     "No   one	 may   speak   for   the
     Parliament and  Parliament is never
     before the	 Court. After Parliament
     has said  what it	intends to  say,
     only the  Court may  say  what  the
     Parliament meant to say. None else.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_105">     Once a  statute  leaves  Parliament
     House,  the  Court's  is  the  only
     authentic	voice	which  may  echo
     (interpret)  the  Parliament.  This
     the court will do with reference to
     the language  of  the  statute  and
     other permissible aids." [p. 1029]
It would  thus be  seen that  as per  the decisions  of this
Courtt the statement of the  Minister who had moved the Bill
in Parliament can be looked at to a scertain mischief sought
to be remedied by the legislation and the object and purpose
for which  the legislation  is enacted. The statement of the
Minister who  had moved	 the Bill in Parliament is not taken
into account  for the  purpose of interpreting the provisons
of the	enactment. The	decision in  <a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_269">Pepper v.	Hart</a> permits
reference to the statement of the minister or other promoter
of the	Bill as	 an aid to construction of legislation which
is ambiguous  or obscure  or the  literal meaning  of  which
leads to  an absurdity	provided the  statement relied	upon
clearly discloses  the mischief	 aimed at or the legislative
intention lying	 behind the  ambigous or  obscure words	 and
that such  a statement	of the	minister must  be clear	 and
unambiguous. This rule of contruction laid in Papper v. Hart
has no	application int	 he present  case because sub-clause
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_106">(viii) of  <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_270">Section 2(c)</a> of the 1988 Act cannot be said to be
ambiguous or  obscure nor  can it  be said  that the literal
meaning of the said clause leads to any absurdity.
</blockquote><p id="p_139">Moreover, the excerpts from the statement of the Minister on
which rellance has been placed byt eh learned counsel fo the
appellants cannot  be regarded	as clear  and unambiguous on
the questionw hether a Member of Parliament or the Member fo
the State Legislature would fall within the ambit of `public
servant'  under	 the  1988  Act	 because  according  to	 the
statements of  the Minister  a Member  of Parliament  and  a
Memebr of  the State legislature would be a `public servant'
under Secction	2(c)(viii) of  the Act in certain stuations.
The statemnt of the Minister does not clearly indicate those
situations. The	 provisions of the 1986 Act also do not give
any indication	about the  situations in  whihc a  Member of
Parliament or  a Member	 of the	 State Legislature  would be
treated as  apublic servant  and the  situations in which he
will not  be treated  as a  public servant. Shri Kapil Sibal
has submitted  that what  the Minister	meant was  that if a
Member of  Parliament or  a Member of the  State Legislature
is given  some	other  assignment,  e.g.  memebership  of  a
delegation, then  in connection	 witht that  assignment	 his
position would	be that	 of a  public servant under the 1988
Act. The  language used	 in <a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_271">Section 2(c)(viii)</a> does not lend
support to such a limit4d onstruction of the said provision.

indicated in  the Statement  of Objects and Reasons, nemely,

itnroducing the	 definition of "public duty" in <a href="/doc/655475/" id="a_272">Section 2(b)</a>
and the definition of `public servant' in <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_273">Section 2(c)</a> which
enlarges the  scipe of	the existing  definition  of  public
servant contained  in <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_274">Section  21</a> IPC,	we do  not find	 any
justification for  restricting the  scope of  the wide words

the basis  of the statement of the Minister so as to exclude
Members of Parliament a nd Members of State Legislatures. In
our opinion  th eowrds	used in sub-clause (viii) of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_276">Section
2(c)</a> are  clear and ambiguous they cannot be out down on the
basis of  the statement	 made by the Minister while piloting

</p><p id="p_141">     Shri D.D. Thakur has invoked the doctrine of Promissory
Estoppel and  ahs submitted  that in  view of  the statement
made by	 the Minister  whiel piloting the Bill in Parliament
that  Members	of  Parliament	and  Members  of  the  State
Legislatures do not fall withint he sambit of the definition
of "public  servant" the  State is  estopped from  taking  a
contrary satand	 and to claim that a Member of Parliament is
a public  servant under <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_277">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act. There is no
legal basis  for this  contention. We are concerned with the
provisions of a law made by Parliament. There is no estoppel
against the statute.
</p><p id="p_142">     Shri Thakur  has also  invoked the	 rule  of  statutory
construction that  the legislature does not intend to make a
substantial alteration	in  law	 beyond	 what  it  wxplicity
declares either in express words or by clear implication and
that the general words of the Act are not to be so construed
as to  alter the  previous policy  of the law. He has placed
reliance on  the decision  in  <a href="/doc/1126538/" id="a_278">M.K.  Ranganathan  &amp;  Anr  v.
Government of Madra &amp; Ors</a>., 1955(2) SCR	 374.  The said rule
can have  not application  int he apresent c ase because the
1988 Act  has replaced th 1947 Act. It has been enacted with
the specific object o faltering the existing anti-corruption
laws so	 as to	make them  more effective  by widening their

[Verma J.  dissenting]. Shetty	J., who	 delivered the	main
judgment on  behalf of	the  majority,	held  that  for	 the
purpose of  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_325">Section 6</a>  of   the 1947  Act  a  Judge  of	 the

the President  of India	 is the authority competent to grant
sanction for  his prosecution.	The learned  counsel for the
appellants   have   placed   reliance	on   the   following
observations in	 the judgement	of  Shetty  J.	wherein	 the
learned Judge  h as construed the provisions of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_327">Section 6</a> of
the 1947 Act :-
</p>     "Section 6	 may  now  be  analysed.
<blockquote id="blockquote_107">     Clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_328">Section  6(1)</a> covers
     public   servants	  employed    in
     connection with  the affairs of the
     Union. The prescribed authority for
     giving  prior   sanction  for  such
     persons  would   be   the	 Central
     Government. Clause	 (b) of	 <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_329">Section
     6(1)</a>  cover   public  servants   in
     connection with  the affairs of the
     State. The	 competent authority  to
     give prior sanction for prosecution
     of such  persons would be the State
     Government.  Clause   (a)	and  (b)
     would  thus   cover  the  cases  of
     public servants who are employed in
     connection with  the affairs of the
     Union  or	 State	 and   are   not
     removable from their office save by
     or with the sanction of the Central
     Government or the State Government.</blockquote>
<p id="p_163">     That is  not the  end. The	 section
     goes further in clause (c) to cover
     the remaining  categories of public
     servants. Clause (c) states that in
     the case  of any  other person  the
     sanction would  be of the authority
     competent to  remove him  from  his
     office.  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_330">Section	6</a>  is  thus  all
     embracing bringing	 within its fold
     all  the	  categories  of  public
     servants as  defined under	 <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_331">Section
     21</a> of the IPC." [p. 238]
     "The provisions  of clauses (a) and
</p><p id="p_164">     (b) of  <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_332">Section  6(1)</a>  of	the  Act
     covers certain categories of public
     servants and  the	`other	'  which
     means  remaining	categories   are
     brought within  the scope of clause
</p><p id="p_165">     (c)." [p. 240]
It has	been pointed  out that	Verma J.,  in his dissenting
judgment, has also taken the same view when he said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_108">     "Clauses (a),  (b) and  (c) in sub-
</blockquote><pre id="pre_3">     section   (1)    of    <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_333">Section    6</a>

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_109">     sanction for prosecution in case of
     all  the  public  servants	 falling
     within  the  purview  of  the  Act.</blockquote>
<p id="p_166">     Admittedly, such  previous sanction
     is a condition precedent for taking
     cognizance	   for	   an	 offence
     punishable	 under	the  Act;  of  a
     public servant  who  is  prosecuted
     during  his   continuance	in   the
     office. It follows	 that the public
     servant falling  within the purview
     of the  Act  must	invariably  fall
     within one	 of the three clauses in
     sub-section (1)  of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_334">Section  6</a>.  It
     follows  that   the  holder  of  an
     office,  even   though  a	 `public
     servant'	 according     to    the
     definition in the Act, who does not
     fall within   any	of  the	 clauses
</p><p id="p_167">     (a), (b)  or (c) of sub-section (1)
     of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_335">Section	 6</a> must	 be held  to  be
     outside  the  purview  of	the  Act
     since this	 special  enactment  was
     not enacted  to cover that category
     of	 public servants in spite of the
     wide definition of `public servant'
     in the Act. This is the only manner
     in which  these provisions	 of  the
     Act can  be  harmonised  and  given
     full effect." [pp. 285, 286]
     The said  decision	 in  Veeraswami	 was  given  in	 the
context of  the definition  of `public servant' as contained
in <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_336">Section  21</a> IPC.  The various  clauses in  <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_337">Section 21</a> IPC
refer to  persons who  can be  removed from  the office	 and
keeping in  view the  criterion of  removability from office
this Court  in Veeraswami  has said that clauses (a) (b) and
</p><p id="p_168">(c) of	sub-section (1)	 of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_338">Section  6</a> of the 1947 Act cover
all the	 categories of	public servants mentioned in <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_339">Section
21</a> IPC.	 In the 1988 Act the concept of `public servant' has
been  enlarged.	  A  separate	provision   containing	 the
definition  of	`public	 servant'  has	been  introduced  in
<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_340">Section 21</a>  IPC and  that contained  in <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_341">Section	 2(c)</a> of the
1988 Act  would show  that <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_342">Section  21</a> IPC  did not  indlude
persons falling under sub-clauses (ix,(x), (xi) and (xii) of
<a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_343">Section 2(c)</a>.  Sub-clauses (viii)  of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_344">Section  2(c)</a> is	also
wider in amplitude than clause 12(a) of <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_345">Section 21</a> IPC.
</p><p id="p_169">     In Veeraswami  while considering  whether Parliament is
the authority  which could grant sanction for prosecution of
a Judge	 of the	 Supreme Court since under <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_346">Article 124(4)</a> of
the Constitution,  the address	must be passed by each House
of Parliament, Shetty J. has said :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_110">     "The  grant  of  sanction	requires

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_111">     (c) of  <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_347">Section  6(1)</a>  of	the  Act
     could not	have intended Parliament

<p id="p_170">     [p. 244]
The enlarged definition of public servant in <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_348">Section 2(c)</a> of
the 1988  Act includes persons who are not removable by an y
single individual  authority and  can only  be removed	by a
collective body and the aforementioned observation of Shetty
J. made	 in the	 context of  parliament would be applicable.
Reference, in  this context, may be made to sub-clauses (ix)
and (xii)  of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_349">Section  2(c)</a>. Sub-section  (ix) speaks  of  a
person "who  is the  president, secretary  or other  office-
bearer	of  a  registered  cooperative	society	 engaged  in
agriculture, industry, trade or banking, receiving or having
received any  financial aid from the Central Government or a
State Government  or form  any corporation established by or
under a	 Central, Provincial  or <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_350">State Act</a>, or any authority
or body	 owned or controlled or aided by the Government or a
Government  company   as  defined  in  <a href="/doc/1430621/" id="a_351">Section	617</a>  of	 the
Companies Act,	1956 (a	 of 1956)". The President, Secretary
and other  office bearers  of a	 co-operative  society	hold
office in  accordance with  the provisions  of the  relevant
statute governing  such society	 and the  rules and bye-laws
made thereunder. The said statute and the rules and bye-laws
may provide  for an  elected President,	 Secretary and other
office bearers	who may	 be  removable	by  a  vote  of	 no-
confidence by  the body	 which has  elected them.  Similarly
sub-clause (xii)  of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_352">Section 2(c)</a> of the 1988 Act talks of a
person "who  is	 an  office=bearer  or	an  employee  of  an
educational,   scientific,   social,   cultural	  or   other
institution, in	 whatever manner  established  receiving  or
having received	 any financial	assistance from	 the Central
Government   or any  State Government,	or  local  or  other
public authority".  There may  be an  institution run  by  a
society through	 an elected  Managing Committee.  The office
bearer of such an institution would be the elected President
or  Secretary	of  the	 Managing  Committee  who  would  be
removable  only	  by  the   body  which	  elected  him.	 The
consideration which  weighed with  this Court  in Veeraswami
for holding  that Parliament could not be intended to be the
sanctioning authority  under <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_353">Section 6(1)(c)</a> of the 1947 Act
would equally  apply to the general body of members of a co-
operative society  under clause	 (ix) and  to the  generally
body of members of a society running an institution referred
to in  clause (xii)  and it can be said that the said bodies
could not  have	 been  intended	 by  Parliament	 to  be	 the
sanctioning authority for the purpose of <a href="/doc/574558/" id="a_354">Section 19(1)(c)</a> of
the 1988 Act.
</p><p id="p_171">     This  would  mean	that  the    definition	 of  `public
servant' in  <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_355">Section 2(c)</a>  of the  1988 Act includes persons
who are	 public servants  under that  provision	 though	 the
criterion of  removability does	 not apply to them and there
is no  single individual  authority which  is  competent  to
grant sanction for their prosecution under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_356">Section 19</a> of the
1988  Act.   In	 respect  of  a	 Member	 of  Parliament	 the
Constitution does not confer on any particular authority the
power to  remove him.  Clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_357">Article  103</a> lays down
that if any question arises as to whether a member of either
House of  Parliament  has  become  subject  to	any  of	 the
disqualifications mentioned  in clause	(1) of	<a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_358">Article 102</a>,
the question  shall be	referred  to  the  decision  of	 the
President and his decision shall be final. The said function
of the	President  is  in  the	nature	of  an	adjudicatory
function which	is to be exercised in the event of a dispute
giving rise to the question whether  a Member o either House
of  Parliament	 has  become   subject	 to   any   of	 the
disqualification mentioned  in clause  (1)  of	<a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_359">Article	 102</a>
being raised.  If the  President holds	that the  member has
become subject	to a  disqualifications mentioned  in clause
(1) of	<a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_360">Article 102</a>,  the member  would be  treated to	have
ceased to  be member  on the d ate when he became subject to
such disqualification.	If it  is not disputed that a member
has incurred  a disqualification  mentioned in clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_361">Article 102</a>, the matter does not go to the President and the
member ceases  to be  a member	on the date when he incurred
the disqualification.  The  power  conferred  under  <a href="/doc/834320/" id="a_362">Article
103(1)</a> cannot,	therefore, regarded as a power of removal of
a Member  of Parliament. Similarly, under the Tenth Schedule
to the	Constitution a	power  has  been  conferred  on	 the
Chairman of  the Rajya/	 the Speaker  of the  Lok  Sabha  to
decided the  question  as  to  whether	a  Member  of  Rajya
Sabha/Lok Sabha	 has become  disqualified for being a member
on the	ground	of  defection.	The  said  decision  of	 the
Chairman of the Rajha Sabha and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
that a Member has incurred disqualification on the ground to
defection may  result in  such Member ceasing to be a Member
but it	would not  mean	 that  the  Chairman  of  the  Rajha
Sabha/Speaker of the Lok Sabha is the authority competent to
remove a  Member of  Rajya Sabha/Lok  Sabha. It	 is no doubt
true that the House in exercise of its power of contempt can
pass a	resolution for	expulsion of  a Member	who is found
guilty of  breach of  privilege and acceptance of bribe by a
Member in  connection with the business of the House has the
power to  remove a  Member who	is found to have indulged in
bribery and  corruption. But  in view  of  the	decision  in
Veeraswami wherein Shetty J. has said that legislature while
enacting clause	 (c) of	 <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_363">Section 6</a> of the 1947 Act could not
have intended  Parliament to  be the  sanctioning authority,
the House  cannot be  regarded as the authority competent to
grant sanction	under <a href="/doc/574558/" id="a_364">Section  19(1)(c)</a> of  the 1988 Act. On
that view  of the  matte it  must be  held that	 there is no
authority who	can  remove a  Member of  Parliament and who
would be  competent under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_365">Section
19(1)</a> of the 1988 Act to grant sanction for his prosecution.
This does  not, however,  lead to  the	conclusion  that  he
cannot	be  treated  as	   `public  servant'  under  <a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_366">Section
2(c)(viii)</a> of the 1988 Act if, on a proper interpretation of
the said revision he is found to be public servant. Since on
an interpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_367">Section 2(c)(viii)</a> of
the 1988  Act we  have held that a Member of Parliament is a
public servant,	 a Member of Parliament has to be treated as
public servant	of the	purpose of  the 1988 Act even though
there is  no authority	who  can  grant	 sanction  for	this
prosecution under <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_368">Section 19(1)</a> of the 1988 Act.
</p><p id="p_172">     It is  them urged	that if it is found that there is no
authority who  is competent to remove a Member of Parliament
and to	grant sanction	for his	 prosecution  under  <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_369">Section
19(1)</a> of the 1988 Act then a Member of Parliament would fall
outside	  the purview  of the  Act because  in view  of	 the
provisions  of	 <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_370">Section  19</a>   sanction	 is  imperative	 for
prosecution i  respect of  an offence under the 1988 Act. In
support of  this contention  reliance has been placed on the
following observations	in the	dissenting judgment of Verma
J. in Veeraswami :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">     "The  grant  of  previous	sanction
     under <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_371">Section  6</a> being  a condition
     precedent for  the prosecution of a
     public servant  covered by the Act,
     it must  follow that the  holder of
     an	 office	 who  may  be  a  public
     servant  according	  to  the   wide
     definition of the expression in the
     Act  but  whose  category	for  the
     grant of  sanction for  prosecution
     is not  envisaged by  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_372">Section 6</a>  of
     the Act,  is outside the purview of
     the Act, not intended to be covered
     by the Act. This is the only manner
     in which  a harmonious constitution
     of the provisions of the Act can be
     made for  the purpose  of achieving
     the object	 of that enactment." [p.</blockquote>
<p id="p_173">     286]
     With due  respect we  find it  difficult to  agree with
these observations.  In taking	this view  the learned Judge
has construed  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_373">Section 6</a> of the 1947 Act, which like <a href="/doc/1145599/" id="a_374">Section
193</a> and <a href="/doc/1914005/" id="a_375">105</a> to <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_376">197</a> Cr. P.C. was a limitation on the power of
the Court to take cognizance and thereby assume jurisdiction
over a	matter, as  a right  conferred on a public servant o
mean "no public servant shall be prosecuted without previous
sanction". This	 aspect has been considered by this Court in
<a href="/doc/811423/" id="a_377">S.A. Venkataraman  v. The  State</a>, (1985)  SCR 1037.  In that
case the  appellant, who  was a	 public	 servant,  had	been
dismissed after	 departmental enquiry  and thereafter he was
charged	 with  having  committed  the  offence	of  criminal
misconduct under  <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_378">Section 5(1)</a>	of the	1947 Act  and he was
convicted. No  sanction under  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_379">Section 6</a> was produced before
the trial court. It was contended before this Court that the
court could not take cognizance of the offence without there
being a	 proper sanction  to prosecute.	 The said contention
was rejected on the view that sanction was not necessary for
the prosecution	 of the	 appellant as  he was  not a  public
servant at  the time  of taking	 cognizance of	the offence.
After referring	 to the	 provisions contained in <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_380">Section 190</a>
Cr. P.C.  which confers	 a general power on a criminal court
to take	 cognizance of	offences  and,	after  holding	that
<a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_381">Section 6</a>  is in  the nature  of a  limitation on  the	said
power, it was observed :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_113">     "In   our	opinion,  if  a	 general
     power  to	take  cognizance  of  an
     offence is	 vested in  a court, any
     prohibition to the exercise of that
     power, by	any  provision	of  law,
     must be  confined to  the terms  of
     the prohibition.  In enacting a law
     prohibiting  t   he  taking   of  a
     cognizance	 of   an  offence  by  a
     court,  unless  certain  conditions
     were complied with, the legislature
     did  not  purport	to  condone  the
     offence. It was primarily concerned
     to	  see	that   prosecution   for
     offences in  cases covered	 by  the
     prohibition  shall	  not	commence
     without	complying    with    the
     conditions contained  therein, such
     as	 a   previous  sanction	  of   a
     competent authority  in the case of
     a	public	servant,  and  in  other
     cases  with   the	consent	 of  the
     authority or  the party  interested
     in the  prosecution or aggrieved by
     the offence." [pp. 1043, 1044]
     "When the provisions of<a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_382"> s. 6</a> of the
     Act are  examined	it  is	manifest
     that   two	  conditions   must   be
     fulfilled	before	 its  provisions
     become applicable.	 One is that the
     offences mentioned	 therein must be
     committed by  a public  servant and
     the other	is that	 that person  is
     employed  in  connection  with  the
     affairs of the Union or a State and
     is not  removable from   his office
     save by or with the sanction of the
     Central  Government  or  the  State
     Government or  is a  public servant
     who is removable from his office by
     any    other  competent  authority.</blockquote>
<p id="p_174">     Both  these   conditions  must   be
     present to	 prevent  a  court  from
     taking  cognizance	 of  an	 offence
     mentioned in  the	section	 without
     the  previous   sanction	of   the
     Central  Government  or  the  State
     Government	  or	the    authority
     competent	to   remove  the  public
     servant from  his office. If either
     of these conditions is lacking, the
     essential	 requirements	of   the
     section  are   wanting  and   t  he
     provisions of  the section	 do  not
     stand in  the way of a court taking
     cognizance	    without	previous
     sanction." [p. 1045]
This means  that when  there is	 an authority  competent  to
remove a  public servant  and  to  grant  sanction  for	 his
prosecution under  <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_383">Section  19(1)</a>  of  the  1988    Act	 the
requirement  of	  sanction  preludes  a	 court	form  taking
cognizance  of	the  offences  mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_384">Section  19(1)</a>
against him in the absence of such sanction, but if there is
no authority  competent to  remove a  public servant  and to
grant sanction for his prosecution under <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_385">Section 19(1)</a> there
is  no	limitation  on	the  power  of	the  court  to	take
cognizance under  <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_386">Section  190</a>	Cr.  P.C.  of  the  offences
mentioned in  <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_387">Section 19(1)</a> of the 1988 Act. The requirement
of sanction  under <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_388">Section  19(1)</a> is intended as a safeguard
against criminal  prosecution of  a public  servant  on	 the
basis of  malicious or	frivolous allegations  by interested
persons. The  object underlying	 the said requirement is not
to condone the commission of an offence by a public servant.
The inapplicability  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_389">Section 19(1)</a> to a
public servant	would only  mean that the intended safeguard
was not	 intended to be made available to him. The rigour of
the prohibition	 contained in sub-section (1) is now reduced
by sub-section (#) of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_390">Section 19</a> because under clause (a) of
sub-section (3)	 it is provided that no finding, sentence or
order passed by a special Judge shall be reversed or altered
by   a	 ******** confirmation	or revision on the ground to

rquirement of  sanction under  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_391">Section 19</a>
is a matter relating to the procedure and the absence of the
sanction does  not go to the root of the jurisdiction of the
court. It must, therefore, be held that merely because there
is no  authority which	is  competent  to  remove  a  public
servant and  to grant  sanction for  his  prosecution  under
<a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_392">Section 19(1)</a>  it cannot  be said  that Member of Parliament
ins outside the Purview of the 1988 Act.
</p><p id="p_175">     In the  absence of requirement of previous sanction for
initiating proceedings in a court of law against a Member of
Parliament in  respect of  an offence  mentioned in  <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_393">Section
19(1)</a> of  the 1988  Act t  he possibility  of  a  Member  of
Parliament being  subjected to	criminal prosecution  on the
basis  of   malicious  or   frivolous  allegations  made  by
interested persons  cannot be  excluded. It  is	 hoped	that
Parliament will	 provide for  an adequate  safeguard in that
regard by  making suitable  amendment in  the 1988  Act. But
till such  safeguard is	 provided, it appears appropriate to
us  that   protection  from   being  subjected	to  criminal
prosecution  on	  the  basis   of  malicious   or  frivolous
allegations should  be available to Members  of Parliament.

question regarding  the applicability  of the  provisions of
the 1947  Act to  Judges of  Superior Courts,  has held that
Judge of Superior Courts fall within the purview of the said
Act and	 that the  President is	 the authority	competent to
grant sanction	for their  prosecution. But  keeping in view
the need  for preserving  the independence  of the judiciary
and the	  fact	that the  Chief Justice	 of India, being the
head of	 the judiciary,	 is  primarily	concerned  with	 the
integrity and  impartiality of	the judiciary, the Court has
directed that the Chief Justice of India should be consulted

Sabha holds a position which is not very different from that
held by the Chief Justice of India in relation to members of
the superior judiciary. In the United Kingdom the Speaker of
the House  of Commons  is regarded  as the representative of
the House  itself in its powers, proceedings and dignity and
is treated  as a  symbol of  the powers	 and priviges of the

Parliament enjoy  freedom of  speech  subject  only  to	 the
provisions of  the Constitution	 and the  rules and standing
orders regulating  the procedure of Parliament. That express
provision is  made for	freedom of  speech in  Parliament in
sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_435">article (1)</a>	 of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_436">article  105</a> suggests  that this freedom
is independent of the freedom of speech conferred by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_437">Article
19</a> and	unrestricted by	 the exceptions	 contained  therein.
This is recognition of the fact that members need to be free
of all	constraints in	the  matter  of	 what  they  say  in
Parliament  if	they  are  effectively	to  represent  their
constituencies in  its	deliberations.	Sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_438">article  (2)</a>  of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_439">Article 105</a>  puts negatively  what  sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_440">article	 (1)</a>  states
affirmatively.
</p><p id="p_198">Both sub-articles  must be read together to deter mine their
content. By  reason of	the first part of sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_441">article (2)</a> no
member is  answerable in  a court  of  law  or	any  similar
tribunal for  what he  has said in Parliament. This again is
recognition of	the fact that a member needs the freedom  to
say what  he thinks is right in Parliament undeterred by the
fear of	 being proceeded  against. A  vote, whether  cast by
voice or  gesture or  the aid of a machine, is treated as an
extension of  speech or	 a  substitute	for  speech  and  is
given the  protection that the spoken word has. Two comments
need to be made in regard to the plain language of the first
part of	 sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_442">article (2).</a> First, what has protection is what
has been  said and  a vote that has been cast, not something
that  might have been said but was not, or a vote that might
have been  cast but  was not.  Secondly, the  protection  is
broad, being  "in respect  of". It is so given to secure the
freedom	 of   speech  in  Parliament  that  sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_443">article	 (1)</a>
provides for.  It is  necessary, given	the role  members of
Parliament must perform . The protection is absolute against
court proceedings that have a nexus with what has been said,
or a  vote that has been cast in Parliament. The second part
of sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_444">article	(2)</a> provides  that no person shall be liable
to  any	  proceedings  in   any	 court	in  respect  of	 the
publication of	any report,  papers, votes or proceedings if
the publication	 is    by  or under  the authority of either
House of  Parliament. A	 person who  publishes a  report  or
papers or  votes or proceedings by or under the authority of
Parliament is  thereby given  protection in  the same  broad
terms  against	 liability  to	 proceedings  in  any  court
connected with	such publication.   The	 constitution having
dealt with  the all  - important  privilege  of	 members  of
Parliament to speak and vote therein as they deem fir, freed
of the fear of attracting legal	 proceedings concerning what
they say  or how  they	vote,  provides	 for  other  powers,
privileges and	immunities is  sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_445">article (3).</a> Till defined
by Parliament  by enactment,  they are	such as were enjoyed
before the  Constitution came  into force;  that is  to say,
they are  such as were enjoyed	by the House of Commons just
before 26th January, 1950. For it to be established that any
power, privilege  or immunity  exists under sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_446">article (3</a>),
it must	 be shown that power, privilege or immunity had been
recognised as  inhering in  the	 House	of  Commons  at	 the
commencement of	 the Constitution.  So	 important  was	 the
freedom to  speak and  vote in Parliament thought to be that
it was	expressly provided  for, not left to be gathered, as
other powers, privileges and immunities were, from the House
of Commons.  In so far as the immunity that attaches to what
is spoken  in Parliament  and to  a vote  given	 therein  is
concerned, provision  is made in sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_447">article (2);</a> it is only
in other respects that sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_448">article (3)</a> applies. For the sake
of completeness,  though we  are not here concerned with it,
we must add that sub-<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_449">article (4)</a> gives the protection of the
Sub-articles that  preceded it	to all who have the right to
address the House, for example, the Attorney General.
</p><p id="p_199">     The provisions of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_450">Article 105</a> and of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_451">Article 194</a>, which
is in  the same	 terms but  deals  with	 the  privileges  of
Legislative Assemblies,	 have been examined by this Court in
the past.  In the  case of  <a href="/doc/944601/" id="a_452">Pandit M.S.M.  Sharma v.Shri Sri
Krishna Sinha  And  Others</a>,  [1959]  Supp.1  S.C.R.  806,  a
portion of  the speech	made by	 a member  of a	 Legislative
Assembly had  been expunged  by the  orders of	the Speaker.
Nonetheless, the  speech was  published in its entirety in a
newspaper of  which the	 petitioner was	 the editor.  He was
called upon  to show  cause why	 action should	not be taken
against him  for breach	 of  privilege	of  the	 Legislative
Assembly and  he challenged  the notice	 by a petition under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_453">Article 32.</a> S.R. Das, C.J., speaking for the majority on the
Constitution Bench  which heard	 the writ petition, observed
that Parliamentary privilege in England was defined in May's
Parliamentary practice	as "the	 sum of	 the peculiar rights
enjoyed by  each House collectively as a constituent part of
the High  Court of  Parliament, and by members of each House
individually, without  which they  could not discharge their
functions, and	which exceed those possessed by other bodies
individuals". The  privileges of  the House  of Commons,  as
distinct from  those of	 the House of Lords, were defined as
"the sum  of the  fundamental rights of the House and of its
individual members as against the prerogatives of the Crown,
the authority  of the ordinary courts of law and the special
rights of  the House  of Lords". The privileges of the House
of Commons  included the  freedom of  speech, which had been
claimed in  1554. This	comprised the  right of the House to
provide for  the due  composition of its own body, the right
to regulate  its  own  proceedings,  the  right	 to  exclude
stranger, the  right to	 prohibit publication of its debates
and the	 right to  enforce observation	of its privileges by
fine, imprisonment  and expulsion.  For deliberative  bodies
like the  House of  Lords  and	Commons,  this	Court  said,
"freedom of  speech is	of the utmost importance. A full and
free debate  is of  the essence of Parliamentary democracy."
The argument  that the	whole of  <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_454">article 194</a> was subject to
<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_455">Article	 19(1)(a)</a>   overlooked	the  provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/601062/" id="a_456">article
194(2).</a> The  right conferred  on  a  citizen  under  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_457">Article
19(1)(a)</a> could be restricted by a law which fell within sub-
<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_458">article 2</a>  of that  Article and he could be made liable in a
court of  law for  breach of  such law,	 but <a href="/doc/601062/" id="a_459">Article  194(2)</a>
categorically laid  down that  no member  of the legislature
was to	be made	 liable to  any proceedings  in any court in
respect of  anything said  or any  vote given  by him in the
Legislature or	in committees  thereof and  that  no  person
would be  liable in  respect of	 the publication by or under
the authority  of the  House of	 such a	 Legislature of	 any
report, paper  or proceedings.	The  provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/601062/" id="a_460">Article
194(2</a>), therefore,  indicated that  the	 freedom  of  speech
referred to  in sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_461">article  (1)</a> thereof  was different from
the  freedom  of  speech  and  expression  guaranteed  under
<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_462">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and could not be cut down in any way by any
law contemplated  by <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_463">article 19(2).</a> A law made by Parliament
in pursuance  of the  earlier part of <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_464">Article 105(3)</a> or by a
State Legislature  in  pursuance  of  the  earlier  part  of
<a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_465">Article 194(3)</a>	was not	 law made in exercise of constituent
power but law made in exercise of ordinary legislative power
under  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_466">Article	 246</a>  read   with  the	 relevant   entries.
Consequently, if such a law took away or abridged any of the
fundamental  rights,  it  would	 contravene  the  peremptory
provisions of  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_467">Article 13(2)</a> and would be void to the extent
of such contravention. It might well be that that was reason
why Parliament	and the State Legislatures had not made laws
defining their powers, privileges or immunities conferred by
the latter  part of  Articles 105  and 194 were repugnant to
the fundamental	 rights, they would be void to the extent of
such  repugnancy.  It  could  not  be  overlooked  that	 the
provisions of Articles 105(3) and 194(3) were constitutional
law and	 not ordinary  law made	 by Parliament	or the State
Legislatures and  therefore, they  were as  supreme  as	 the
provisions of  part II	of the	Constitution. Further, quite
conceivably,  the  Constitution	 makers,  not  knowing	what
powers, privileges and immunities Parliament
or the	State Legislatures   might  claim, though fir not to
take any  risk and  made such laws subject to the provisions
of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_468">Article  13;</a> but  that, knowing  and being satisfied with
the reasonableness  of the powers, privileges and immunities
of  the	  House	 of  Commons  at  the  commencement  of	 the
Constitution, they  did not,  in their	wisdom, think fit to
make such  powers, privileges  and immunities subject to the
fundamental right conferred by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_469">Article 19(1)(a).</a>
</p><p id="p_200">     The case  of <a href="/doc/261796/" id="a_470">Dr.  Satish Chandra	Ghosh  V.Hari Sadhan
Mukherjee</a>, [1961]  3 S.C.R. 486, dealt with an appellant who
was a  member of a Legislative Assembly. He had given notice
of his	intention to  put certain questions in the Assembly.
The questions  being  disallowed  by  the  Speaker,  he	 had
published them	in a  journal in his constituency. The first
respondent, whose  conduct was	the  subject-matter  of	 the
questions, filed  a complaint  under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_471"> the  Indian Penal	Code</a>
against the  appellant and  the printer and publisher of the
journal. The  appellant pleaded privilege and immunity under
<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_472">Article 194</a>  of	 the  Constitution  as	a  bar	to  criminal
prosecution. The  claim of absolute privilege was disallowed
by this	 Court. It  was said,  with reference  to the law in
England in  respect of	the privileges and immunities of the
House of  Commons, that	 there	was  no	 absolute  privilege
attaching to the publication of extracts from proceedings in
the House.  So far  as a  member of the House of Commons was
concerned, he  had an  absolute privilege in respect of what
he had	spoken within the four walls of the House, but there
was only a qualified privilege in his favour even in respect
of what	 he had	 himself said  in the House if he caused the
same  to  be  published	 in  the  public  press.  The  legal
position,  which   was	undisputed,   was  that	 unless	 the
appellant could make out an absolute privilege in his favour
in respect  of the  publication which was the subject-matter
of the	charge, the  prosecution against  him could  not  be
quashed. He  having no	such absolute privilege, it was held
that "he  must take  his trial	and enter  upon his defence,
such as he may have."
</p><p id="p_201">     Special Reference	No.1 of	 1964,[1965]  1	 S.C.R.	 412
known more commonly as Keshav Singh's case or the Privileges
case, deals  extensively with the scope of the privileges of
legislative bodies.   The Presidential Reference was made in
the following circumstances: The Legislative Assembly of the
State of  Uttar Pradesh	 committed one Keshav Singh, not one
of its	members, to  prison for	 contempt.  The	 warrant  it
issued was a general warrant, in that it did not set out the
facts which  had been found to be contumacious. Keshav Singh
moved a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_473">Article 226</a> challenging his committal
and he	prayed for  bail. Two  learned judges of the Lucknow
Bench of  the  High  Court  ordered  that  Keshav  Singh  be
released on  bail pending the decision on the writ petition.
The Legislative	 Assembly passed  a resolution requiring the
production  in	custody	 before	 it  of	 Keshav	 Singh,	 the
advocate who had appeared for him and the two judges who has
granted him  bail. The	judges and  the advocate  filed writ
petitions before  the High  Court at Allahabad. A Full Bench
of the	High Court  admitted their petitions and ordered the
stay of	 the execution	of the	Assembly's  resolution.	 The
Legislative Assembly modified its earlier resolution so that
the two judges were now asked to appear before the House and
offer an  explanation.	The  President	thereupon  made	 the
Special Reference.  Briefly put, the questions he asked were
: whether  the Lucknow	Bench could  have entertained Keshav
Singh's writ  petition and released him on bail; whether the
judges who  entertained the  petition and  granted bail	 and
Keshav Singh  and his advocate had committed contempt of the
Assembly; whether  the Assembly was competent to require the
production of  the judges  and the  advocate  before  it  in
custody or  to call  for their explanation; whether the Full
Bench of  the High Court have entertained the writ petitions
of the two judges and the advocate and could have stayed the
implementation	of  the	 resolution  of	 the  Assembly;	 and
whether a  judge  who  entered	or  dealt  with	 a  petition
challenging any	 order of  a Legislature imposing penalty or
issuing process	 against the  petitioner for its contempt or
for infringement  of its privileges and immunities committed
contempt of  the Legislature and whether the Legislature was
competent to  take proceedings	against	 the  judge  in	 the
exercise of  its  powers,  privileges  and  immunities.	 The
adjectival  clause   "regulating  the	procedure   of	 the
Legislature" in	 <a href="/doc/679324/" id="a_474">Article 194(1)</a>	 governed, it was held, both
the proceeding	clauses relating  to "the  provisions of the
Constitution"  and   "the  rules   and	 standing   orders."
Therefore,   <a href="/doc/679324/" id="a_475">Article   194(1)</a>	conferred   on	 legislators
specifically the  right of  freedom of speech subject to the
limitation prescribed by its first part. By making this sub-
article subject	 only to  the specified	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution, the  Constitution-makers	wanted	to  make  it
clear that  they thought  it  necessary	 to  confer  on	 the
legislators freedom  of speech	separately and,	 in a sense,
independently of  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_476">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  It	 was  legitimate  to
conclude     that  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_477">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  was  not	one  of	 the
provisions of  the Constitution	 which controlled  the first
part of	 <a href="/doc/679324/" id="a_478">Article 194(1).</a>  Having conferred freedom of speech
on the	legislators, <a href="/doc/601062/" id="a_479">Article 194(2)</a> emphasized the fact that
the freedom  was intended  to be  absolute  and	 unfettered.
Similar freedom was guaranteed to the legislators in respect
of the	votes they  might give	in the	legislature  or	 any
committee thereof.  "In other words". this Court said, "even
if a  legislator exercises his right of freedom of speech in
violation, say, of Article
, he  would not	 be liable  for any  action  in	 any  court.
Similarly, if  the legislator  by  his	speech	or  vote  is
alleged to  have violated  any	of  the	 fundamental  rights
guaranteed  by	 Part  III   of	 the   Constitution  in	 the
Legislative Assembly,  he would	 not   be answerable for the
said contravention  in any  court. If  the  impugned  speech
amounts o  libel or  becomes actionable	 or indictable under
any other  provision of the law, immunity has been conferred
on him from any action in any court by this clause .... ....
.... It	 is plain  that the  Constitution-makers attached so
much importance	 to the	 necessity of  absolute	 freedom  in
debates within the legislative chambers that they thought it
necessary to  confer complete  immunity on  the	 legislators
from any action in any court in respect of their speeches in
the legislative	 chambers in  the wide	terms prescribed  by
clause (2).  Thus, clause  (1) confers	freedom of speech on
the legislators	 within the  legislative chambers and clause
(2) makes  it plain  that the  freedom is literally absolute
and unfettered."  Referring to	<a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_480">Article 194(3</a>),	 this  Court
said that  it was  well-known that  out of a large number of
privileges and	powers which  the House	 of Commons  claimed
during the days of its bitter struggle for recognition, some
were given  up in  course of  time and	some  faded  out  by
desuetude. Accordingly,	 in every  case where  a  power	 was
claimed, it  was necessary  to enquire	whether	 it  was  an
existing power	at the	relevant time. It had also to appear
that the  power was not only claimed by the House of Commons
"but  was   recognised	by  the	 English  courts.  It  would
obviously be  idle to  contend that  if a  particular  power
which is  claimed by  the House was claimed  by the House of
Commons but  was not  recognised by  the English  courts, it
would still  be upheld	under the  latter part of clause (3)
only on	 the ground that it was in fact claimed by the House
of  Commons."  In  India,  this	 Court	said,  the  dominant
characteristic of  the British	Constitution  could  not  be
claimed. The  supremacy of the Constitution was protected by
an independent	judicial body  which was  the interpreter of
the scheme  of distribution  of powers. It was difficult for
this Court  to accept  the argument  that the  result of the
provisions contained  in the  latter part  of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_481">Article 194(3)</a>
was intended  to be  to confer	on the State Legislatures in
India the  status of  a superior  Court of  Record.  It	 was
essential to  bear in  mind the	 fact that  the status	of a
superior Court	of Record which was accorded to the House of
Commons was  based on  historical facts.  It was  a fact  of
English	 history   that	 Parliament   had  been	 discharging
judicial functions and the House of Lords still continued to
be the	highest court of law in the country. The Legislative
Assemblies in  India never discharged any judicial functions
and their  historical and  constitutional background did not
support the  claim that they could  be regarded as Courts of
Record in  any sense. The very basis on which English courts
agreed to  treat a  general warrant  issued by	the House of
Commons the  footing that  it was  a  warrant  issued  by  a
superior Court of Record was absent in the case of a general
warrant issued by a State Legislature in India.

612, it	 was contended	that the immunity granted by <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_483">Article
105(2)</a> was  with reference to the business of Parliament and
not in	regard to  something  which  was  something  utterly
irrelevant. This Court said:
</p><p id="p_203">     "The article means what it says in language which could
not be	plainer. The article confers immunity inter  alia in
respect of  anything said  ....... in  Parliament. The	word
"anything is  of the  widest import  and  is  equivalent  to
'everything'. The  only limitation arises from the words 'in
Parliament' which means during the sitting of Parliament and
in  the	 course	 of  the  business  of	Parliament.  We	 are
concerned only	with speeches  in Lok  Sabha.  Once  it	 was
proved that  Parliament was  sitting and  its  business	 was
being transacted,  anything said  during the  course of that
business was  immune from  proceedings in  any	court.	This
immunity is  not only complete but is as it should be. It is
of the	essence of  parliamentary system  of Government that
people's  representatives   should  be	 free	to   express
themselves without fear of legal consequences. What they say
is  only   subject  to	 the  discipline  of  the  rules  of
Parliament, the good sense of the members and the control of
proceedings   by the  Speaker. The courts have no say in the
matter and should really have none."

is <a href="/doc/184521/" id="a_484">State  of Karnataka v. Union of India &amp; Another</a>, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1.  It was  there held  that the	 Constitution vested
only legislative  power	 in  Parliament	 and  in  the  State
Legislatures. A	 House of  Parliament or  State	 Legislature
could	not try	 anyone or  any case directly, as a Court of
Justice could. It could proceed quasi-judicially in cases of
contempts of  its authority  and take  up motions concerning
its privileges	and immunities	because, in  doing so,	  it
sought removal of obstructions to the due performance of its
legislative  functions.	 If  any  question  of	jurisdiction
arose, it  had to  be decided  by the  courts in appropriate
proceedings. Beg,  J. added,  "For example, the jurisdiction
to try	a criminal  offence, such  as murder, committed even
within a  house vests in ordinary criminal courts and not in
a House of Parliament or in a State Legislature".
</p><p id="p_205">     In Tolaram	 Relummal and  anr. vs. The State of Bombay,
1995 (1)  S.C.R. 158,  this Court  construed the  words	 "in
respect of"  occurring in  Section 18(1)  of the Bombay Rent
Restriction Act,  1947, the  relevant portion  of which read
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">     "If any  landlord either himself or
     through  any   person   acting   or
     purporting	  to	act    on    his
     behalf........receives  any   fine,
     premium  or   other  like	 sum  or
     deposit or any consideration, other
     than the  standard rent..........in
     respect of	 the grant,  renewal  or
     continuance  of   a  lease	 of  any
     premises........such  landlord   or
     person shall be punished.......".
</blockquote><p id="p_206">The High Court	had observed that the expression "in respect
of" was very comprehensive but this Court took the view that
it had laid undue emphasis thereon. This Court said, "Giving
the  words  "in	 respect  of"  their  widest  meaning,	viz,
"relating to"  or "with reference to", it is plain that this
relationship must  be predicated  of the  grant, renewal  or
continuance of	a lease,  and  unless  a  lease	 comes	into
existence simultaneously  or   near about  the time that the
money is  received, it	cannot be  said that the receipt was
"in respect  of" the  grant  of	 a  lease.............It  is
difficult to  hold that	 any relationship  of  landlord	 and
tenant comes into existence on the execution of an agreement
executory in  nature or that the expression "premium" can be
appositely used	 in connection	with the receipt of money on
the occasion  of the  execution of such an agreement. It may
well   be that if a lease actually comes into existence then
any receipt  of money  which has a nexus with that lease may
fall within  the  mischief  of	<a href="/doc/1301218/" id="a_485">section	 18(1)</a>,	 but  it  is
unnecessary to	express any final opinion on the question as
in the	present case  admittedly no  lease  ever  came	into
existence and  the relationship	 of landlord  and tenant was
never created between the parties.:"
</p><p id="p_207">     The learned  Attorney General  submitted that the words
"in   respect of"  had not  always received a board meaning,
and he	cited the  judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1609169/" id="a_486">State of Madras
vs. M/s.  Swastik  Tobacco  Factory,  Vedaranyam</a>,  1966	 (3)
S.C.R. 79.  A provision	 of the	 Madras	 General  Sales	 Tax
(Turnover and  Assessment) Rules,  1939, which	stated that,
"the excise  duty, if any, paid by the dealer to the Central
Government in  respect of  the goods sold by him,...." would
be deducted  from the  gross turnover  of a  dealer for	 the
purposes  of   determining  the	  net  turnover,  was  under
consideration. The  Court noted	 that the words "in  respect
of" had	 been considered  by the  House of  Lords in  Inland
Revenue Commissioners  vs.  Courts  &amp;  Co.,  [1963]  2	All.
E.R.722, and  it had  observed that "the phrase denoted some
imprecise kind	of nexus between the property and the estate
duty".In Asher	v. Seaford  Court Estates  Ltd., L.R. [1950]
A.C. 508,  the House  of Lords	had held that the expression
"in respect  of"  in  the  Increase  of	 Rent  and  Mortgage
Interest  (Restrictions)   Act,	 1920,	 must  be   read  as
equivalent to "attribute". The Privy Council in <a href="/doc/416340/" id="a_487">Bicber, Ltd.
V. Commissioners  of Income-tax</a>,[1962] 3 All. E.R.. 294, had
observed that  these words  could mean more than "consisting
of" or	"namely". This	Court said, "It may be accepted that
the said  expression received  a wide interpretation, having
regard to  the object  of the  provisions and the setting in
which the said words appeared. On the other hand, Indian tax
laws use  the expression  'in respect of' as synonymous with
the expression	'on'." In  the provision under consideration
the expression	"in respect  of the  goods" was held to mean
"on the goods".
</p><p id="p_208">     This Court drew a distinction in the above case between
the use of the expression "in respect of" in taxing statutes
in India and its use elsewhere. In the context of its use in
the Constitution  and having  regard to	 the object which is
intended to  be secured by <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_488">Article 105(2</a>), we think that the
broad interpretation  thereof is the most appropriate. It is
thus that this Court has already interpreted the provision.
</p><p id="p_209">     The Attorney  General submitted  that a  proceeding  in
court founded  on the allegation that a member of Parliament
had received  a bribe  to vote in a particular way was not a
proceeding in  respect of a vote that he had given and that,
therefore, the	member	did  not  enjoy	 immunity  from	 the
proceeding  by	reason	of  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_489">Article  105(2)</a>  did  not  cover
criminal proceedings.  It had been held by the courts of the
United States  of America,  Canada, Australia and, recently,
England, he  said, that	 a  legislator	could  be  proceeded
against for corruption. The Attorney General relied upon the
decisions and  reports in  this behalf	to  which  we  shall
refer.The Attorney General submitted that the immunity given
by <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_490">Article  105(2)</a> should be interpreted in the light of the
times in  which we  live and,  so  interpreting	 it,  should
exclude from its coverage corrupt legislators.
</p><p id="p_210">     In Bradlaugh  v. Gossett,	12 Q.B.D.271,  the plaintiff
Bradlaugh had  been elected  to the  House  of	Commons.  He
required the  Speaker to  call him  to the table to take the
oath.  By  reason  of  what  had  transpired  on  a  earlier
occation, the  Speaker declined	 to  do	 so  and  the  House
resolved that  the Serjeant-at-Arms should exclude Bradlaugh
until  "he   shall  engage   not  further   to	disturb	 the
proceedings  of	  the  House".	 Bradlaugh  prayed   for  an
injunction against the Serjeant-at-Arms restraining him from
carrying out  the resolution.  The  suit was dismissed. Lord
Coleridge, C.J. said, "What is said or done within the walls
of  Parliament	cannot	be  inquired  into  in	a  court  of
law...........The jurisdiction	of the Houses over their own
members, their	right  to  impose  discipline  within  their
walls, is  absolute and	 exclusive. To use the words of Lord
Ellenborough, "They  would  sink  into	utter  contempt	 and
inefficiency  without  it."'  He  added,    "The  Houses  of
Parliament cannot  act by  themselves in  a body : they must
act by	officers; and  the Serjeant-at-arms is the legal and
recognised officer  of the  House of  Commons to execute its
orders. I  entertain no	 doubt that the House had a right to
decide on  the subject-matter,	have decided  it,  and	have
ordered their  officer to  give effect to their decision. He
is protected by their decision.	 They have ordered him to do
what  they  have  a  right  to	order,	and  he	 has  obeyed
them.........If injustice has been done, it is injustice for
which the  Courts of  law afford  no remedy."  Stephen,	 J.,
concurring, said  that the  House of Commons was not subject
to the control of Her Majesty's Courts in its administration
of that	 part of  the statute  law which had relation to its
own internal  proceedings, and	that the  use of such actual
force  as   was	 necessary  to	carry  into  effect  such  a
resolution as  the one	before the court was justifiable. In
support, the  learned Judge quoted Blackstone, who had said,
"The whole  of the  law and  custom of	Parliament  has	 its
original from  this one	 maxim, 'that whatever matter arises
concerning  either  House  of  Parliament  ought      to  be
examined, discussed,  and adjudged in that House to which it
relates, and  not elsewhere."  This principle  had been	 re-
stated by the judges who decided Stockdale v. Hansard, 9 Ad.
&amp; E.I.	Lord Denman  had said,	"Whatever is dome within the
walls of  either assembly  must pass without question in any
other place."  Littledale, J.,	had said,  "It is  said	 the
House of  Commons is  the sole judge of its own	 privileges;
and so	I admit	 as far as the proceedings in the House	 and
some other  things are	concerned." Patteson,  J., had said,
"Beyond all dispute, it is necessary that the proceedings of
each  House  of	 Parliament  should  be	 entirely  free	 and
unshackled, that  whatever is  said or	done in either House
should	not   be  liable   to  examination  elsewhere."	 And
Coleridge,  J.,	 had  said,  "That  the	 House	should	have
exclusive jurisdiction	to regulate  the course	 of its	 own
proceedings,  and  animadvert  upon  any  conduct  there  in
violation of  its rules	 or  derogation	 from  its  dignity,
stands upon the clearest grounds of necessity." It seemed to
follow that  the House of Commons had the exclusive power of
interpreting the  Parliamentary Oaths  Act, so	far  as	 the
regulation of  its own	proceedings within its own walls was
concerned:  and	  that,	 even  if  that	 interpretation	 was
erroneous ,  the court	had no	power to  interfere with  it
"directly or  indirectly". It  was in  regard to  a possible
case as	 to the	 effect of an order  by the House of Commons
to put	a member to death or to inflict upon him bodily harm
that the learned Judge said, "I know of no authority for the
proposition that an ordinary crime committed in the House of
Commons would  be withdrawn  from  the	ordinary  course  of
criminal justice".  Referring to  the old  case of  Sir John
Eliot, Denzil  Hollis, and  Others, the	 learned Judge said,
"This case is the great leading authority, memorable on many
grounds, for the proposition that nothing said in parliament
by a  member as	 such, can  be treated	as an offence by the
ordinary Courts".
</p><p id="p_211">     In the  case of Church of Scientology of California vs.
Johnson Smith,	(1972) ALL E.R. 378, the defendant, a member
of Parliament,	was sued  for libel allegedly published in a
television programme. He pleaded fair comment and privilege.
The plaintiffs	countered by alleging malice, to prove which
they sought  to bring  on record  as evidence  extracts from
Hansard. The  trial judge  declined to permit them to do so.
In his ruling he said,
     "I am quite satisfied that in these
     proceedings  it   is  not	open  to
     either party  to  go  directly,  or
     indirectly, into  any  question  of

     defendant or  Mr.	Hordern	 or  the

     House."
</p><p id="p_212">The report  of the  Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct
in Public  Life, chaired  by Lord  Salmon, was	presented in
July 1976. It says,
     "307. Only	 Parliament  can  decide
     what conduct  constitutes a  breach
     of	 privilege   or	 a  contempt  of
     Parliament.  In   cases  that   are
     adjudged  to  be  'contempts',  the
     House  may	  exercise   its   penal
     jurisdiction    to	   punish    the
     offenders. The main penal sanctions
     available	 to    the   House   are
     reprimand	and   committal	 to  the
     custody of	 the Serjeant at Arms or
     to prisons.  These sanctions  apply
     both to  Members and  strangers. In
     addition, a Member may be suspended
     from the  House  or  expelled.  The
     House of Commons possesses no power
     to impose a fine.
</p><p id="p_213">     "308. Whilst  the theoretical power
     of the  House to  commit  a  person
     into  custody  undoubtedly	 exists,
     nobody has been committed to prison
     for contempt  of Parliament  for  a
     hundred years or so, and it is most
     unlikely that  Parliament would use
     this power in modern conditions."
</p><p id="p_214">The Report  states (in para 307), "it is in the light of the
foregoing paragraphs  that we note the fact that neither the
statutory nor  the common  law applies	to  the	 bribery  or
attempted bribery  of a	 Member of  Parliament in respect of
his Parliamentary  activities". The  Report speaks  (in para
</p><p id="p_215">309) of	 "the historical circumstances in which the ordinary
criminal law  has not  applied	to  bribery  in	 respect  of
proceedings in Parliament". It finds (in para 310) that "the
briber of  a Member  of	 Parliament  would  be	immune	from
effective  punitive  sanctions	of  the	 kind  that  can  be
inflicted under the criminal law. Public obloquy is unlikely
to be  an effective  sanction  against	such  a	 person	 and
accordingly we	consider that  there is	 a strong  case	 for
bringing such  malpractices within  the	 criminal  law".  It
reiterates that	 "the bribery  of  a  Member  of  Parliament
acting in  his Parliamentary capacity does not constitute an
offence known  to the  criminal law........". The conclusion
of the Report on the point is contained in para 311:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_123">	  "Membership of Parliament is a
     great honour  and carries with it a
     special  duty   to	  maintain   the
     highest standards	of probity,  and
     this  duty	 has  almost  invariably
     been	strictly       observed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_124">     Nevertheless in  view of our report
     as a  whole, and  especially in the
     light of  the points set out in the
     foregoing paragraph,  we  recommend
     that  Parliament	should	consider
     bringing  corruption,  bribery  and
     attempted bribery	of a  Member  of

<p id="p_216">     In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd., (1994) 3 All
E.R. 407, the Privy Council considered <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_491">Article 9</a> of the Bill
of Rights  (1688), which  applies by reason of incorporation
in  New Zealand. It reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_125">     "That the	freedom	 of  speech  and
     debates	or     proceedings    in
     parliament	  ought	   not	 to   be
     impeached	or   questioned	 in  any
     court or place out of Parliament."
</blockquote><p id="p_217">The defendant,	a New  Zealand television  company, aired  a
programme in  which  it	 was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff,
Prebble, then  a Minister in the New Zealand Government, had
conspired with	certain businessman  and public officials to
give the businessmen an unfair opportunity to obtain certain
state-owned assets  which were	being privatised  on  unduly
favourable terms  in return  for donations to his  political
party, and  he had  thereafter	arranged  for  incriminating
documents and  computer files to be destroyed. The plaintiff
having brought	an action  for libel,  the defendant company
pleaded justification, alleging that the plaintiff and other
ministers   had	   made	  statements   in   the	  House	  of
Representatives which  had  been  misleading  and  that	 the
conspiracy had	been implemented  by introducing and passing
legislation in	the House.  The plaintiff  applied to strike
out these  particulars	on  the	 ground	 that  parliamentary
privilege was infringed. The trial judge upheld the claim to
immunity,  as  did  the	 Court	of  Appeal.  The  privileges
Committee of  the House	 of Representatives having held that
the House   had	 no power  to waive the privileges protected
by <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_492">Article  9</a>, the  plaintiff appealed	to the Privy Council
also upheld  the claim	to immunity.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson,
speaking for the Board, said that if <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_493">Article 9</a> was looked at
alone, the  question was  whether  it  would  infringe	that
Article to suggest that the statements that were made in the
House were  improper or that the legislation was procured in
pursuance  of	the  alleged   conspiracy,  as	constituting
impeachment or	questioning of	the  freedom  of  speech  of
Parliament. In	addition to  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_494">Article 9</a>	itself, there  was a
long line  of authority	  which supported a wider principle,
of which  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_495">Article 9</a>  was merely	 one manifestation,  namely,
that the courts and Parliament were both astute to recognise
their respective  constitutional roles. So far as the courts
were concerned,	 they would  not allow	any challenge  to be
made to what was said or done within the walls of Parliament
in performance	of its	legislative functions and protection
of  its	 established  privileges.  The	basic  concept	that
underlay <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_496">Article  9</a>, namely  , the  need to ensure so far as
possible that  a member	 of the	 legislature  and  witnesses
before a  committee of	the House spoke freely "without fear
that what  they say  will later	 be held against them in the
courts. The  important public  interest	 protected  by	such
privilege is  to ensure	 that the  member or  witness at the
time he	 speaks is  not inhibited  from	 stating  fully	 and
freely what  he has  to say.  If there	were any  exceptions
which	permitted    his   statements	to   be	  questioned
subsequently, at  the time  when he  speaks in Parliament he
would not  know whether or not there would subsequently be a
challenge to  what he is saying. Therefore he would not have
the confidence	the privilege  is designed  to protect." The
privilege protected  by <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_497">Article	  9</a>  was  the  privilege  of
Parliament itself.  The actions	 of an	individual member of
Parliament, even  if he	 had an	 individual privilege of his
own, could   not  determine whether  or not the privilege of
Parliament was	to apply.  The wider principle that had been
encapsulated  by   Blackstone  prevented   the	courts	from
adjudicating on	 "issues arising in or concerning the House,
viz whether  or not  a member  has misled the House or acted
from improper motives. The decision of an individual  member
cannot override	 that collective  privilege of	the House to
be the	sole judge  of such  matters". Cases such as the one
before the  Privy Council  illustrated how public policy, or
human rights,  issues could conflict. There were "three such
issues in  play in  these cases:  first, the  need to ensure
that the  legislature can  exercise  its  powers  freely  on
behalf	of   its  electors,  with  access  to  all  relevant
information; second,  the need	to protect freedom of speech
generally; third,  the interests of justice in ensuring that
all relevant  evidence is  available to	 the  courts.  Their
Lordships are of the view that the law has been long settled
that, of  these	 three	public	interests,  the	 first	must
prevail."
</p><p id="p_218">     Very recently,  in the  case of  R. vs.  Currie, it was
alleged against Harry Greenway, a Member of Parliament, that
he had	accepted a bribe from Plasser, Jurasek and Brooks as
a reward  for using his influences as a Member of Parliament
in respect of Jurasek's application for British nationality.
The indictment	of the	four was sought to be quashed on the
basis that  the bribery	 of a Member of Parliament was not a
crime and  that, in any event, the court had no jurisdiction
for only  Parliament could  try a  member for  bribery,	 the
matter being  covered by  Parliamentary privilege. The trial
judge, Buckley,	 J. did	 not agree.  He	 quoted	 the  Salmon
Commission Report.  He also noted that Lord Salmon, speaking
in the	debates of  the House  of  Lords,  had	said,  after
referring to  the immunity  enjoyed by Members of Parliament
from being  prosecuted under  the criminal  law if they took
bribes, that,  "at Common  Law you  cannot be  convicted  of
bribery and corruption unless you are a holder of an office,
and most  of us	 are not the holders of an office". Viscount
Dilhorne had  agreed. Buckley,	J. could  not accept  that a
question of  such great	 importance could turn on semantics.
In his	view, "To  hold that  the existence  of a Common Law
crime of  bribing a  Member of	Parliament depends  upon the
meaning to be given to the word "office" in this context, as
opposed to  looking at	the principle involved, would not be
calculated to  commend the  Criminal Law  to the  public  it
should serve." Buckley, J. noted what had been said by James
Martin, C.J.  in R.V.  White, 13  SCR (NSW), 332, which case
concerned the attempted bribery of a Member of Parliament in
New South Wales, "........a legislator who suffers his votes
to be influenced by a bribe does that which is calculated to
sap the	 utility of  representative  institutions  at  their
foundations.   it would	 be a  reproach to the Common Law if
the offer to, or the acceptance of, a bribe by such a person
were not  an offence".	Faucett, j., agreeing with the Chief
Justice, had  said, "The  principle is,	 that any person who
holds a	 public office	or public employment of trust, if he
accepts a  bribe to  abuse his trust - in other words, if he
corruptly abuses  his trust  - is  guilty of  an offence  at
Common Law;  and the person who gives the bribe is guilty of
an offence  at Common  Law". The same view had been taken in
Canada in R V. Bunting, 1885 Ontario Reports 524; that was a
case of	 a  conspiracy	to  bring  about  a  change  in	 the
Government of  the Province of Ontario by bribing members of
the  Legislature  to  vote  against  the  Government.  R.V..
Boston,(1923) 33  Commonwealth Law  Reports 386,  was also a
case where  similar arguments  had been	 advanced and turned
down, and Buckley, J.quoted this "memorable sentence "from
 the  judgment of Higgins, J.:" A member is the watch-dog of
the public; and Cerberus  must not be seduced from vigilance
by a  sop." Based  upon these  judgments, Buckley,  J.,	 was
satisfied that	"the undoubted common law offence of bribery
is not	artificially limited  by reference to any particular
shade of meaning of the word 'office'. The underlying reason
or principle  is concerned  with the corruption of those who
undertake a  duty, in  the proper  discharge  of  which	 the
public is interested." The learned Judge then considered the
question of  parliamentary privilege  and noted <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_498">Article 9</a> of
the Bill of Rights, 1688, which has already been quoted. The
learned judge  quoted Lord  Salmon, speaking in the House of
Lords, thus:  "To my  mind equality before the law is one of
the pillars  of freedom.  To say that immunity from criminal
proceedings against  anyone who	 tries to  bribe a Member of
Parliament and	any Member  of Parliament  who	accepts	 the
bribe, stems from the Bill of Rights is possibly a serious
 mistake". After quoting the Bill of Rights, Lord Salmon had
continued :  "Now this is a charter for freedom of speech in
the House  it is  not a	 charter for corruption. To my mind,
the Bill of Rights, for which no one has more respect that I
have, has  no more  to	do  with  the  topic  which  we	 are
discussing than	 the Merchandise  Markets Act.	The crime of
corruption is complete when the bribe is offered or given or
solicited  or	taken."	 Buckley,   J.,	 commented,  "It  is
important to  note  that  which	 Lord  Salmon  pointed	out,
namely, that  corruption  is  complete	when  the  bribe  is
offered or  given, solicited  or taken.	 If, as	 is  alleged
here, a bribe is given and taken by a  Member of Parliament,
to use	his position  dishonestly, that	 is  to	 favour	 the
briber as opposed to acting independently and on the merits,
the crime is complete. It owns nothing to any speech, debate
or proceedings	in  Parliament.	 Proof	of  the	 element  of
corruption in  the transaction is another and quite separate
consideration. Privilege might well prevent any inquiry by a
court into  Parliamentary debates  or proceedings. See : The
Church Of  Scientology v.  Johnson-Smith, 1972,	 1  KB	522.
However, it  is not a necessary ingredient of the crime that
the bribe  worked." Referring to the case of Ex parte Wason,
to which  we  shall  make  more	 detailed  reference  later,
Buckley, J.,  observed that  the substance  of the  proposed
indictment there  was that  certain parties had conspired to
make false  statements in  the House  of Lords and Cockburn,
C.J., had  held "that  the making  of  false  statements  in
either House  of Parliament  could not	be  the	 subject  of
criminal or  civil proceedings	and nor	 could	not  be	 the
subject of  criminal or	 civil proceedings  and nor  could a
conspiracy to  do so".	It seemed clear to the learned judge
that the  court had  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_499">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights well in
mind. "The  only candidate", he	 said, "for the unlawful act
or means  was the  very act  which was	not subject  to	 the
criminal law".	He added  that he  could not  see  that	 the
reasoning of  Ex parte	Wason, assuming	 the decision  to be
correct, would	apply to  alleged bribery  for the  proof of
which no  reference to	going  on  in  Parliament  would  be
necessary. This	 approach, he  found, happened to be in line
with several  United States  authorities on their "Speech or
Debate Clause"	which, for  all practical  purposes, was the
same as	 <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_500">Article 9.</a> That a Member of Parliament against whom
there was  a prima facie case of corruption should be immune
from prosecution  in the  courts of law was to Buckley, J.'s
mind an	 unacceptable proposition  "at the present time". He
did  not  believe  it  to  be  the  law.  The  Committee  of
Privileges of the House was "not well equipped to conduct an
enquiry into  such a  cases ..................nor  is it  an
appropriate   or   experienced	 body	to   pass   sentence
..................   The courts	 and legislatures  have over
the years  built up  a formidable  body of  law and codes of
practice t  achieve fair  treatment of	suspects and persons
ultimately charged  and brought	 to trial  .................
Again, unless  it is to be assumed that his peers would lean
in his	favour why should a Member be deprived of a jury and
an experienced judge to consider his guilt or innocence and,
if  appropriate,   sentence  ?	Why  should  the  public  be
similarly deprived."  The prosecution went ahead against the
other accused but the charge was not established. The member
of Parliament was., therefore, also acquitted.

As to  the latter,  on the  one hand  it has  been  said  of
Members of  Parliament that 'Few are in a higher position of

greater interest',  and they  should arguably  therefore  be
subject to the criminal law. On the other hand, they are sui

</p><p id="p_222">     <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_502">Article 1</a>,	 Section 6 of the United States Constitution
contains the  speech or	 debate clause.	 Referring to United
States Senators	 and Representatives,  it says	: (F) or any
Speech	or  Debate  in	either	House,	they  shall  not  be
questioned in any other Place".
</p><p id="p_223">     Thomas F.	Johnson was  convicted by  a  United  States
Distinct Court	for violating a federal conflict of interest
statute and  for conspiring  to defraud	 the United  States.
Evidence was  admitted and  argument was  permitted  at	 the
trial that related to the authorship, content and motivation
of a  speech which the Congressman had allegedly made on the
floor of  the House  of Representatives	 in pursuance  of  a
conspiracy  designed  to  give	assistance,  in	 return	 for
compensation, to certain savings and loan associations which
had been indicated on mail fraud charges. The conviction had
been set  aside by  the Court  of Appeals on the ground that
the allegations	 in regard  to the  conspiracy to   make the
speech were  barred by	the speech or debate Clause. Finding
that  the   evidence  that   had  been	 adduced  upon	 the
unconstitutional  aspects   of	the   conspiracy  count	 had
infected the  entire prosecution,  the Court  of Appeals had
ordered a  new trial on the other counts. The  Supreme Court
, in  further appeal,  held  that  the	prosecution  on	 the
conspiracy charge, being dependent upon an intensive inquiry
with respect  to the  speech on	 the  floor  of	 the  House,
violated the speech or debate clause warranting the grant of
a new  trial on	 the conspiracy	 count,	 with  all  elements
offensive to  the speech  or debate  clause eliminated.	 The
earlier cases,	it  said,  indicated  that  the	 legislative
privilege had  to be read broadly to effectuate its purpose.
Neither of  those cases,  however, had	dealt with  criminal
prosecution based  upon the  allegation	 that  a  member  of
Congress had  abused his  position by  conspiring to  give a
particular speech  in return  for remuneration	from private
interests. However  reprehensible such conduct might be, the
speech or  debate clause  extended at  least so	 far  as  to
prevent it  from being	made the  basis of a criminal charge
against a  member of  Congress of  conspiracy to defraud the
United States  by impeding  the due  discharge of Government
functions. The	essence of  such a charge in the context was
that the Congressman's conduct was improperly motivated, and
that  was   precisely  what  the  speech  or  debate  clause
generally foreclosed  from executive  and judicial  inquiry.
The Government	argued that  the clause was meant to prevent
only prosecutions  based upon  the "content" of speech, such
as libel  actions, but	not those founded on "the antecedent
unlawful conduct  of  accepting	 or  agreeing  to  accept  a
bribe". Th  language of	 the Constitution  was framed in the
broadest terms. The broader thrust of the privilege had been
indicated by  Ex parte	Wason, which dealt specifically with
an  alleged   criminal	conspiracy.   Government  had	also
contended  that	  the  speech	or  debate  clause  was	 not
violated because  the gravamen of the charge was the alleged
conspiracy,  not the speech, and  because the defendant, not
the prosecution,  had introduced  the speech.  Whatever room
the Constitution might allow for such factors in the context
of a  different kind of prosecution, they could not serve to
save the  Government's case  under the conspiracy charge. It
was undisputed	that the  Congressman had  centered upon the
questions of  who first decided that a speech was desirable,
who prepared it, and what the Congressman's motives were for
making it.  The indictment itself focused with particularity
upon motives  underlying the  making of	 the speech and upon
its contents.  The  prosecution	 under	a  general  criminal
statute dependent on such inquiries necessarily, contravened
the speech  or dabate  clause.	The  court  added  that	 its
decision did not touch a prosecution which, though, as here,
it was founded on a criminal statute of general application,
did  not   draw	 in  question  the  legislative	 acts  of  a
Congressman or	his motives  for performing  them. The court
expressly  left	  open	for  consideration  the	 case  of  a
prosecution, which  though it  might entail  an inquiry into
legislative acts or motivations, was founded upon a narrowly
drawn statute  passed by  Congress in  the exercise  of	 its
legislative power to regulate the conduct of its members.
</p><p id="p_224">     Daniel B. Brewster was  a United States Senator. He had
been charged  with accepting bribes in exchange for promises
related to official acts while a Congressman. The charge was
that he	 had violated the terms of a narrowly drawn statute.
The Senator   moved  to dismiss	 the indictment	 before	 the
trial  began   on  the	 ground	 that  he  was	immune	from
prosecution for	 any alleged  act of  bribery because of the
speech or debate clause. The District Court upheld the claim
of immunity. The Government preferred a direct appeal to the
Supreme Court.	Burger, C.J.,  spoke for  6 members  of	 the
court.	Brennan,  J.  and  White,  J.  delivered  dissenting
opinions, with	which Douglas,	J., joined. The charges were
that the  Senator, while  such and  a member  of the  Senate
Committee on  Post Office  and Civil  Service, "directly and
indirectly, corruptly  asked, solicited,  sought,  accepted,
received and  agreed to	 receive sums.........in  return for
being influenced  in his  performance of  official  acts  in
respect to  his action,	 vote and  decision on	postage rate
legislation which  might at any time be pending before hm in
his official  capacity........." The  other  charge  was  in
respect of  official acts performed by him in respect to his
action, vote  and decision on postage rate legislation which
had been  pending  before  him	in  his	 official  capacity.
Burger, C.J. took the view that the immunities of the speech
or debate  clause were	not written  into  the	Constitution
simply for  the personal  or private  benefit of  members of
Congress, but  to protect  the integrity  of the legislative
process	 by   insuring	the   independence   of	  individual
legislators. Although the speech or debate clause's historic
roots were  in English	history, it had to be interpreted in
the  light   of	 the   American	 constitutional	  scheme  of
government rather  than the English parliamentary system. It
had to be borne in mind that the English system	 differed in
that Parliament	 in England was the supreme authority, not a
coordinate  branch.  The  speech  or  debate  privilege	 was
designed   to	preserve   legislative	 independence,	 not
supremacy. The	courts' task  , therefore,  was to apply the
clause in  such a  way as  to insure the independence of the
legislature without  altering the  historic balance  of	 the
three co-equal	branches of  Government.  Referring  to	 the
cause  of   Johnson(ibid).  Burger,   C.J.,  said   that  it
unanimously  held   that  a  member  of	 Congress  could  be
prosecuted  under  a  criminal	statute	 provided  that	 the
Government's case  did not  rely on  legislative acts or the
motivation for	legislative  acts.  A  legislative  act	 had
consistently   been defined  as an  act	 generally  done  in
Congress in  relation to the business before it.  The speech
or debate  clause prohibited  inquiry only into those things
generally said	or done	 in the	 House or  the Senate in the
performance of	official duties	 and into the motivation for
those acts.  Counsel   on behalf  of the  Senator had argued
that the  court in  Johnson had expressed a broader test for
the coverage  of the  speech or	 debate clause. He had urged
that the  court had  held that	the  clause  protected	from
executive or  judicial inquiry	all conductg" related to the
due functioning	 of the	 legislative process." Burger, C.J.,
said that  the	quoted	words  did  appear  in	the  Johnson
opinion, but  they were	 taken out  of context.	 In context,
they reflected a quite different meaning from that urged. In
stating the  speech or	debated clause	did   not  apply  to
things which  "in no  wise related to the due functioning of
the legislative	 process"  the	court  in  Johnson  had	 not
implied as a corollary that everything that "related" to the
office of a member was shielded by the clause. In Johnson it
had been held that only acts generally done in the course of
the process  of enacting  legislation were  protected. In no
case had the court ever treated the clause as protecting all
conduct relating  to the  legislative process. In every case
thus far  before the  court, the speech or debate clause had
been limited  to an  act which	was clearly  a part  of	 the
legislative process,  the due  functioning of  the  process.
The contention	on behalf  of  the  Senator  for  a  broader
interpretation of  the privilege  drew	essentially  on	 the
flavor of the rhetoric and the sweep of the language used by
the courts, not on the precise words used in any prior case,
and not on the sense of those cases, fairly read. It was not
sound or  wise, simply	out of	an abundance  of caution  to
doubly	insure	 legislative  independence,  to	 extend	 the
privilege beyond  its intended	scope, literal	language and
history, to  include all  things in  any way  related to the
legislative process.  Given such  a sweeping  reading, there
would be  few activities  in which a legislator engaged that
he would  be unable  somehow to	 "relate" to the legislative
process. The  speech or debate clause, admittedly, had to be
read broadly  to effectuate  its purpose  was not  "to	make
members of  Congress super-citizens,  immune  from  criminal
responsibility. In its narrowest scope, the clause is a very
large, albeit  essential, grant of privilege. It has enabled
reckless  men  to  slander  and	 even  destroy	others	with
impunity, but that was the conscious choice of the Framers".
Burger, C.J., did not discount entirely the possibility that
an  abuse   might  occur,  but	this  possibility  which  he
considered remote,  had to be balanced against the potential
danger flowing from either the absence of a  bribery statute
applicable to  members of  Congress or	holding that  such a
statute violated  the Constitution.  As he  had noted at the
outset of  his judgment, the learned Chief Justice said that
the purpose  of the  speech or debate clause was  to protect
the individual	legislator, not simply for his own sake, but
to preserve  the independence  and thereby  the integrity of
the legislative	 process. Financial abuses by way of bribes,
perhaps	 even  more  than  Executive  power,  would  gravely
undermine legislative  integrity and defeat the right of the
public to  honest representation. Depriving the Executive of
the power  to investigate and prosecute and the Judiciary of
the power  to punish  bribery of  members  of  Congress	 was
unlikely to  enhance legislative independence. The speech or
debate clause  was  broad  enough  to  insure  the  historic
independence. The  speech or  debate clause was broad enough
to insure  the	historic  independence	of  the	 Legislative
Branch, essential  to the  separation of  powers, but narrow
enough to  guard against  the  excess  of  those  who  would
corrupt the  process by	 corrupting its	 members.  Taking  a
bribe was no part of the legislative process or function; it
was not	 a legislative	act. It	 was not, by any conceivable
interpretation, an  act performed  as  a  part	of  or	even
incidental to  the role	 of a  legislator. It was not an act
resulting from	 the  nature, and  in the  execution, of the
office. It  was not  a thing said or done in the exercise of
the functions  of  that	 office.  Nor  was  inquiry  into  a
legislative act	 or the	 motivation for	 a  legislative	 act
necessary to  a prosecution  under the	concerned statute or
the indictment.	 When a	  bribe was taken, it did not matter
whether the  promise for  which the  bribe was given was for
the performance	 of a  legislative  act	 or  for  use  of  a
Congressman's influence	 with the  Executive Branch.  And an
inquiry into the purpose of a bribe did not draw in question
the legislative	 acts of  the  member  or  his	motives	 for
performing them.  Nor did it  matter if the member defaulted
on his	illegal bargain.  The Government,  to make  a  prima
facie	 case	  under	   the	  indictment,	 need	 not
show any  act of  the  Senator	subsequent  to	the  corrupt
promise for  payment, for  it  was  taking  the	 bribe,	 not
performance of the illicit compact, that was a criminal act.
The learned Chief Justice said, "The only reasonable reading
of the	clause consistent  with its  history and purpose, is
that it	 does not  prohibit inquiry into activities that are
casually or  incidentally related to legislative affairs but
not a part of the legislative process itself".
</p><p id="p_225">     Brennan, J.,  dissenting, said.  "I would dispel at the
outset any  notion that Senator Brewster's asserted immunity
strains the outer limits of the Clause.	 The Court writes at
length in an effort to show that 'Speech or Debate' does not
cover 'all  conduct relating  to the  legislative  process'.
........Even assuming  the validity  of that  conclusion,  I
fail to	 see its  relevance to	the  instant  case.  Senator
Brewster is not charged with conduct merely "relating to the
legislative process,"  but with	 a crime  whose proof  calls
into question  the very motives behind his legislative acts.
The indictment,	 then, lies  not at the periphery but at the
very center  of the  protection that  this Court has said is
provided a  Congressman under the Clause." The learned Judge
said that there could be no doubt that the Senator's vote on
new postal  rates constituted  legislative activity   within
the meaning  of the  speech or	debate clause.	The  Senator
could not  be prosecuted or called to answer for his vote in
any judicial  or executive  proceeding.	 But  the  Senator's
immunity went  beyond the  vote itself	and  "precludes	 all
extra-congressional scrutiny  as to  how and why he cast, or
would have  cast, his vote a certain way". The learned Judge
quoted Frankfurter,  J.,   speaking in	the case of Tenny v.
Brandhove, 95  L. Ed.  1019, thus  : "One  must	 not  expect
uncommon courage even in legislators. The privilege would be
of   little value if they could be subjected to the cost and
inconvenience and  distractions of a trial upon a conclusion
of the	pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment against them
based upon  a jury's  speculation as to motives. The holding
of this Court in Fletcher v Peck, 3 L. Ex. 162, 176, that it
was not	 consonant with our scheme of government for a court
to inquire  into the  motives of  legislators, has  remained
unquestioned...........	 In   times  of	 political  passion,
dishonest or  vindictive motives  are readily  attributed to
legislative conduct and as readily believed. Courts are	 not
the place  for such  controversies. Self-discipline  and the
voters must  be the  ultimate reliance	for discouraging  or
correcting such	 abuses." Neither the Senator's vote nor his
motives for  voting, however  dishonourable,  could  be	 the
subject of  a civil or criminal proceeding outside the halls
of the	Senate. There  was nothing  complicated	 about	this
conclusion. It	followed simply	 and inescapably  from prior
decisions of the United States Supreme Court setting forth
the  basic   elements  of  legislative	immunity.  Yet,	 the
majority has adopted "a wholly artificial view of the
charges before	us". The  indictment alleged  not  the	mere
receipt of  money in  exchange	for  a	Senator's  vote	 and
promise to  vote in  a certain way. Insofar as these charges
bore on	 votes already	cast, the Government could not avoid
proving the  performance of  the bargained-for	acts and any
inquiry in this behalf violated the speech or debate clause.
The charges  of only  a corrupt promise to vote were equally
repugnant to  the speech or debate clause. The majority view
might be  correct that	only receipt  of the  bribe, and not
performance of	the  bargain,  was  needed  to	prove  these
counts.	 But proof of an agreement to be "influenced" in the
performance  of	 legislative  acts  was	 "by  definition  an
inquiry	 into	their  motives,	 whether  or  not  the	acts
themselves  or	 the  circumstances   surrounding  them	 are
questioned at  trial. Furthermore,  judicial inquiry into an
alleged agreement  of this  kind carries  with it  the	same
dangers to  legislative independence  that are	held to	 bar
accountability for  official conduct  itself. As our Brother
White cogently	states,	 ................  Bribery  is	most
often carried  out by  prearrangement; if  that part  of the
transaction may	 be plucked  from its  context and  made the
basis of criminal charges, the Speech or Debate Clause loses
its force.  It would  be small	comfort for a Congressman to
know that  he cannot be prosecuted for his vote, whatever it
might be,  but he can be prosecuted for an alleged agreement
even if he votes contrary to the asserted bargain'.
</p><p id="p_226">     Thus, even if this were an issue of first impression. I
would  hold   that  this   prosecution,	 being	 an   extra-
congressional inquiry  into legislative acts and motives, is
barred by the Speech or Debate Clause.
</p><p id="p_227">     What is especially disturbing about the Court's result,
however, is  that this	is not an issue of first impression,
but one	 that was  settled six years ago in United States v.
Johnson, 15  L.Ed.2d 681."  The learned Judge added that the
majority  could	 not  "camouflage  its	departure  from	 the
holding of  Johnson by	referring  to  a  collateral  ruling
having	little	 relevance  to	the  fundamental  issues  of
legislative privilege  involved in that case. I would follow
Johnson and  hold that	Senator Brewster's  alleged promise,
like the  Congressman's there,	is immune  from executive or
judicial inquiry".  The learned	 judge said  that he yielded
nothing	 to   the  majority   "in   conviction	 that	this
reprehensible and  outrageous conduct,	if committed  by the
Senator, should	 not have  gone unpunished.  But  whether  a
court or  only the  Senate might  undertake the	 task  is  a
constitutional issue of portentous significance, which	must
of course  be resolved	uninfluenced by the magnitude of the
perfidy alleged.  It is no answer that Congress assigned the
task to the judiciary in enacting 18 USC 201. Our duty is to
Nation and  Constitution, not  Congress. We  are guilty of a
grave disservice  to both  nation and  Constitution when  we
permit Congress	 to shirk its responsibility in favor of the
courts. The  Framers' judgment	was that the American people
could have  a Congress of independence and integrity only if
alleged	 misbehavior   in  the	performance  of	 legislative
functions was accountable solely to a Member's own House and
never to the executive or judiciary. The passing years	have
amply justified	 the wisdom  of that  judgment.	 It  is	 the
Court's duty  to enforce  the letter of the Speech or Debate
Clause in  that spirit.	 We did	 so in	deciding Johnson. In
turning its back on that decision today, the Court arrogates
to  the	    judiciary	an  authority	committed   by	 the
Constitution, in Senator Brewster's case, exclusively to the
Senate of  the United  States. Yet  the	 Court	provides  no
principal justification,  and I	 can think of none , for its
denial that  United States  v Johnson compels  affirmance of
the District  Court. The  decision is only six years old and
bears	the   indelible	  imprint   of	 the   distinguished
constitutional scholar	who wrote the opinion for the Court.
Johnson surely merited a longer life".
</p><p id="p_228">     Justice White  took substantially	a similar  view	 and
part of what he said has already been quoted.
</p><p id="p_229">     The judgment  in Brewster was followed in United States
v Henry	 Helstoski, 61 L. Ed. 2d 12 Brennan, J., dissenting,
expressed the  view that  the indictment  in question should
have been  dismissed "since  a corrupt	agreement to perform
legislative acts, even if provable  without reference to the
acts themselves,  may  not  be	the  subject  of  a  general
conspiracy prosecution".

</p><p id="p_231">     The charge	 against the  alleged bribe  takers is	that
they "were  party to  a criminal conspiracy and agreed to or
entered into an agreement with" the alleged bribe givers "to
defeat the  no-confidence motion..........by  illegal means,
viz., to  obtain or agree to obtain gratification other than
legal remunerations"  from the	alleged bribe  givers "as  a
motive or  reward for defeating the no-confidence motion and
in   pursuance thereof "the alleged bribe  givers "passed on
several lacs  of rupees" to the alleged bribe takers, "which
amounts were  accepted" by  then .  The stated object of the

if the facts alleged against the bribe takers are true, that
they were  cast	 pursuant  to  the  alleged  conspiracy	 and
agreement. It  must then  follow, given	 that the expression
"in respect  of" must  receive a  broad	 meaning,  that	 the
alleged conspiracy  and agreement has a nexus to and were in
respect of  those votes and that the proposed inquiry in the
criminal proceedings is in regard to the motivation thereof.
</p><p id="p_233">     It is  difficult to  agree with  the  learned  Attorney
General that,  though the words "in respect of" must receive

limited to  court proceedings that impugn the speech that is

object of  the protection  would be fully satisfied thereby.
The object  of the protection is to enable  members to speak
their mind  in Parliament and vote in the same way, freed of
the fear of being made answerable on that account in a court
of law.	 It is	not enough that members should	be protected
against civil  action and criminal proceedings, the cause of
action of  which is  their speech  or their  vote. To enable
members to participate fearlessly in Parliamentary  debates,
members need  the wider	 protection of	immunity against all
civil and  criminal proceedings	 that bear  a nexus to their
speech or  vote. It  is for  that reason  that member is not
"liable to  any proceedings  in	 any  court  in	 respect  of
anything said or any vote given by him". <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_505">Article 105(2)</a> does
not say, which it would have if the learned Attorney General
were right, that a member is not liable for what he has said
or how	he has	voted. While imputing no such  motive to the
present prosecution,  it is  not  difficult  to	 envisage  a
member who  has made a speech  or cast a vote that is not to
the liking  of the  powers  that  be  being  troubled  by  a
prosecution alleging  that he had been party to an agreement
and conspiracy to achieve a certain result in Parliament and
had been  paid a bribe.
</p><p id="p_234">     We are  acutely conscious	of the	seriousness  of	 the
offence that  the alleged  bribe  takor	 are  said  to	have
committed. If  true,  they  bartered  a	 most  solemn  trust
committed to  them by  those they  represented. By reason of
the lucre  that they  received, they enabled a Government to
survive. Even  so, they	 are entitled to the protection that
the  Constitution   plainly  affords   them.  Our  sense  of
indignation should  not lead us to construe the Constitution
narrowly, imparing  the guarantee to effective Parliamentary
participation and debate.
</p><p id="p_235">     We draw  support for  the view  that we  take from	 the
decision of  United States Supreme Court in Johnson and from
the dissenting judgment of Brennan, J. in Brewster.
</p><p id="p_236">     In Johnson,  the United  States Supreme Court held that
the  speech   or  debate  clause  extended  to	prevent	 the
allegation that a member of Congress had abused his position
by conspiring  to give	a particular  speech in	 return	 for
remuneration from  being the  basis of	a criminal charge of
conspiracy. The	 essence of  such  a  charge  was  that	 the
Congressman's	conduct was  improperly motivated,  and that
was precisely  what the	 speech or  debate clause foreclosed
from executive	and judicial  inquiry. The argument that the
speech	or   debate  clause   was  meant   to  prevent	only
prosecutions based  upon the  content of the speech, such as
libel actions,	but not	 those	founded	 on  the  antecedent
unlawful conduct  of accepting or agreeing to accept a bribe
was repulsed. Also repulsed was the argument that the speech
or debate  clause was  not violated  because the gravamen of
the charge  was the alleged conspiracy , not the speech. The
indictment focused  upon the motive underlying the making of
the speech  and	 a  prosecution	 under	a  criminal  statute
dependent on  such inquiry  contravened the speech or debate
clause. It  might be  that only receipt of the bribe and not
performance of	the bargain  was needed to prove the charge,
but  proof   of	 an   agreement	 to  be	 influenced  in	 the
performance of legislative acts was "by definition an
 inquiry  into	their  motives,	 whether  or  not  the	acts
themselves    or  the  circumstances  surrounding  them	 are
questioned at  trial. Furthermore,  judicial inquiry into an
alleged agreement  of this  kind carries  with it  the	same
dangers to  legislative independence  that are	held to	 bar
accountability for  official conduct  itself". The Senator's
"reprehensible and outrageous conduct", if committed, should
not have  gone unpunished,  but whether	 a court or only the
Senate "might  undertake the task was a constitutional issue
of portentous  significance, which    must  of	course	  be
resolved  uninfluenced	by  the	 magnitude  of	the  perfidy
alleged".
</p><p id="p_237">     We cannot	but be	impressed by the majority opinion in
Brewster but,  with  respect,  are  more  pursuaded  by	 the
dissent.  The	majority  opinion   stated  that   the	only
reasonable reading of the speech and debate clause was "that
it does	 not  prohibit	inquiry	 into  activities  that	 are
casually or  incidentally related to legislative affairs but
     Brennan, J., dissenting in Brewster, said that Brewster
had been  charged with	a  crime  whose	 proof	called	into
question the  motives behind  his legislative acts. He could
not only  not be prosecuted or called to answer for his vote
in any	judicial or  executive proceeding  but his  immunity
went beyond  the  vote	itself	and  precluded	"all  extra-
congressional scrutiny	as to  how and why he cast, or would
have cast,  his vote  a certain way".  Neither the Senator's
vote nor  his motives  for  voting,  however  dishonourable,
could be  the subject  of a  civil  or	criminal  proceeding
outside the  halls of  the Senate.  The charge	of a corrupt
promises to  vote was  repugnant to  the  speech  or  debate
clause. It might be that only receipt of the bribe and not
performance of the bargain was needed to prove the charge,
but  proof   of	 an   agreement	 to  be	 influenced  in	 the
performance  of	 legislative  acts  was	 "by  definition  an
inquiry	 into	their  motives,	 whether  or  not  the	acts
themselves  or	 the  circumstances   surrounding  them	 are
questioned at  trial. Furthermore,  judicial inquiry into an
alleged agreement  of this   land  carries with	 it the same
dangers to  legislative independence  that are	held to	 bar
accountability for  official conduct  itself". The Senator's
"reprehensible and outrageous conduct", if committed, should
not have  gone unpunished,  but whether	 a court or only the
Senate "might  undertake the task was a constitutional issue
of portentous significance, which must of course be resolved
uninfluenced by the magnitude of the perfidy alleged".
</p><p id="p_238">     We cannot	but  be impressed by the majority opinion in
Brewster but,  with respect,  are more	pursuaded    by	 the
dissent.  The	majority  opinion   stated  that   the	only
reasonable reading of the speech and debate clause was "that
it does	 not  prohibit	inquiry	 into  activities  that	 are
casually or  incidentally related to legislative affairs but
not a  part of	the legislative	 process itself".  Upon this
construction of	 the speech or debate clause, it came to the
conclusion that	 a court  could investigate whether Brewster
had taken  a bribe  to be  influenced in  the performance of
official acts  in respect  of his action, vote, and decision
on postage  rate legislation. With respect, we cannot regard
the act of taking a bribe to vote in a particular way in the
legislature to	be merely  "casually or incidentally related
to legislative affairs". The Library of Congress publication
"The Constitution  of the United States of America, Analysis
and  Interpretation"   says,  and   we	respectfully  agree,
"However, in  United States v. Brewster, while continuing to
assert that  the clause	 'must be read broadly to effectuate
its  purpose   of  protecting	the  independence   of	 the
Legislative Branch,  'the Court	 substantially	reduced	 the
scope of the coverage of the clause".
</p><p id="p_239">     For the  first time  in England Buckley, J. ruled in R.
vs. Currie  that a  Member of Parliament who accepts a bribe
to abuse  his trust  is guilty	of the common law offence of
bribery. The innovation in English law needs to be tested in
appeal. We  say this  with respect, having regard to earlier
English judgments,  and we find support in the Twenty-second
edition of  Erskine May's  Treatise on	The Law, Privileges,
Proceedings   and    Usage   of	   Parliament,	 wherein   a
foot note (on p.115) apropos the ruling read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_127">     "The court observed: 'that a Member
     of Parliament against whom there is
     a prima  facie case  of  corruption
     should be	immune from  prosecution
     in the  courts of law is to my mind
     an unacceptable  proposition at the
     present time'  (quoted in Committee
     of Privileges. First Report, HC351-
     ii (1994-95) pp 161-162). The Court
     seems to  have had	 in mind, though
     no attempt	 was made  to define, an
     area of activity where a Member may
     act as  such, without participating
     in		'proceedings	      in
     Parliament'(whether    of	  course
     article IX will apply)."</blockquote>
<p id="p_240">     Our conclusion  is that the alleged bribe takers, other
than Ajit  Singh, have	the protection of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_506">Article 105(2)</a> and
are not	  answerable  in a  court of  law  for	the  alleged
conspiracy and	agreement. The	charges against	 them	must
fail. Ajit  Singh,  not	 having	 cast  a  vote	on  the	 no-
confidence	motion, derives	 no  immunity  from  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_507">Article
105(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_241">     What is  the effect  of this  upon	 the  alleged  bribe
givers? In  the first  place, the  prosecution against	Ajit
Singh would  proceed,  he  not	having	voted  on  the	non-
confidence motion  and, therefore, not having the protection
of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_508">Article  105(2).</a> The	 charge against	 the  alleged  bribe
givers of  conspiracy and agreement with Ajit Singh to do an
unlawful act would, therefore, proceed.
</p><p id="p_242">     Mr.  Rao	submitted  that	 since,	 by  reason  of	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_509">Article 105(2</a>), the alleged  bribe takers had
committed no  offence, the  alleged bribe  givers  had	also
committed no  offence. <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_510">Article	105(2)</a> does not provide that
what is	 otherwise an  offence is  not an offence when it is
committed by  a member	of Parliament  and has	a connection
with his speech or vote therein. What is provided thereby is
that member of Parliament shall not be answerable in a court
of law	for something that has a nexus to his speech or vote
in Parliament.	If a member of Parliament has, by his speech
or vote in Parliament, committed an offence, he	 enjoys , by
reason	of   <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_511">Article  105(2</a>),	immunity  from	 prosecution
therefor. Those	 who  have  conspired  with  the  member  of
Parliament in  the commission  of that	offence have no such
immunity. They can, therefore, be prosecuted for it.
</p><p id="p_243">     Mr.Rao contended  that for	 the offence  that the bribe
takers had  allegedly committed	 they would be answerable to
the Lok	 Sabha. There  was a  possibility of  the Lok  Sabha
deciding one  way upon	the prosecution	 before	 it  of	 the
alleged bribe  takers and  the criminal	 court deciding	 the
other way  upon the prosecution of the alleged bribe givers.
A conflict  of decisions  upon the  same set  of facts being
possible, it  had to  be avoided.  The	charge	against	 the
alleged bribe givers had, therefore, to be quashed. There is
in the	contention a  misconception. <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_512">Article 105(2)</a> does not
state that  the member	of Parliament  who is  not liable to
civil or  criminal proceedings	in Parliament. Parliament in
India is not a Court of Record. It may not exercise judicial
powers or  entertain judicial  proceedings. The decisions of
this Court  so holding	have already  been referred  to. The
alleged bribe takers, except Ajit Singh, who are entitled to
the immunity  conferred by  <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_513">Article 105(2)</a> are not liable to
be tried  in the  Lok Sabha  for the offences set out in the
charges	  against them	or any	other charges,	but the	 Lok
Sabha may  proceed against  them for breach of privileges or
contempt. There	 is, therefore,	 no  question  of  two	fora
coming to  different conclusions  in  respect  of  the	same
charges.
</p><p id="p_244">     Mr. Rao  submitted that  the alleged  bribe givers	 had
breached Parliament's  privilege  and  been  guilty  of	 its
contempt and  it should	 be left  to Parliament to deal with
them. By  the same sets of acts the alleged bribe takers and
the  alleged  bribe  givers  committed	offences  under	 the
criminal law and breaches of Parliament's privileges and its
contempt. From	prosecution  for  the  former,	the  alleged
bribe takers,  Ajit  Singh  excluded,  enjoy  immunity.	 The
alleged	 bribe	givers	do  not.  The  criminal	 prosecution
against the  alleged bribe givers must, therefore, go ahead.
For breach  of Parliament's  privileges	 and  its  contempt,
Parliament may	proceed against the alleged bribe takers and
the alleged bribe givers.
</p><p id="p_245"><a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_514">Article 105(3).</a>
</p><p id="p_246">     Relevant to  the submission  on <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_515">Article  105(3)</a> is	 the
judgement in  Ex Parte	Wason, 1869  L.R.4  QBD	 573.  Rigby
Wason moved  the Court	of Queen's  Bench for a rule to call
upon a	metropolitan police  magistrate to show cause why he
should	not  take  on  record  the  complaint  of  Wason  to
prosecute Earl	Russell, Lord  Chelmsford and the Lord Chief
Baron for  conspiracy. Wason's	affidavit in  support of the
complaint stated  that	he  had	 given	to  Earl  Russell  a
petition addressed  by him to the House of Lords, which Earl
Russell a  petition addressed  by him to the House of Lords,
which Earl  Russell had	 promised to  present. The  petition
charged the  Lord Chief	 Baron, when a Queen's Counsel, with
having told a wilful and deliberate falsehood to a committee
of the	House of Commons sitting as a judicial tribunal. The
petition prayed	 for an	 inquiry into the charge and, if the
charge was  found true,	 for action  against the  Lord Chief
Baron under  the law  to remove	 judges. Earl  Russell, Lord
Chelmsford and	the Lord  Chief Baron  had, according to the
Wason's	 affidavit,  prevented	the  course  of	 justice  by
making statements,  after conferring  together,	 which	they
knew were  not true  in order  to prevent  the prayer of his
petition being	granted; Wason	alleged that  Earl  Russell,
Lord Chelmsford	 and the  Lord Chief Baron had conspired and
agreed together	 to prevent the course of justice and injure
himself. The  alleged conspiracy  consisted in the fact that
Earl Russell,  Lord Chelmsford and the Lord Chief Baron "did
agree to  deceive the  House of	 Lords by  stating that	 the
charge of  falsehood contained in my petition was false, and
that  I	  was  a   calumniator;	 when	Earl  Russell,	Lord
Chelmsford, and	 the Lord  Chief Baron	well knew  that	 the
charge of  falsehood committed by the Lord Chief Baron, when
Queen's Counsel,  was perfectly	 true".	 Wason	desired	 "to
prefer an  indictment against Earl Russell, Lord Chelmsford,
and the Lord Chief Baron for conspiracy". The magistrate had
refused to  take recognizance of the complaint on the ground
that no	 indictable offence  had been  disclosed by  Wason's
information, whereupon Wason moved the Court Cockburn', C.J.
said, "I  entirely agree  that, supposing the matter brought
before the  magistrate had  been matter	 cognizable  by	 the
criminal law,  and upon	 which an indictment might have been
preferred, the	magistrate would have had no discretion, but
would have  been bound	to proceed......On the other hand, I
have no	 doubt that, supposing the matter brought before the
magistrate does not establish facts upon which an indictment
could be  preferred and	 sustained,  the  magistrate  has  a
discretion which,  if rightly exercised, we ought to uphold;
and the	 question is  whether  the  matter  brought  by	 the
present applicant  before the  magistrate was subject-matter
for an	indictment....The information then charges that Earl
Russell, Lord Chelmsford, and the Lord Chief Baron agreed to
deceive the  House of  Lords by	 stating that  the charge of
falsehood brought against the Lord Chief Baron was unfounded
and false,  whereas they  knew it to be true.  Now, inasmuch
as these  statements were  alleged  to	have  been  for	 the
purpose of  preventing the  prayer of  the petition  and the
statements could not have had that effect unless made in the
House of  Lords, it seems to me that the fair and legitimate
inference is  that the	alleged conspiracy  was to make, and
that the  statements were  made, in  the House	of Lords.  I
think, therefore,  that the  magistrate, looking at this and
the rest  of the information, was warranted in coming to the
conclusion, that  Mr. Wason charged and proposed to make the
substance of  the indictment,  that these  three persons did
conspire to deceive the House of Lords by statements made in
the House  of Lords  for  the  purpose	of  frustrating	 the
petition.   Such a charge could not be maintained in a court
of law.	  It  is clear	that statements	 made by  members of
either House  of Parliament  in their  places in  the House,
though they might be untrue to their knowledge, could not be
made  the  foundation  of  civil  or  criminal	proceedings,
however injurious  they might  be to the interest of a third
person. And  a conspiracy to  make such statements would not
make the  persons guilty  of it	 amenable  to  the  criminal
law..............".   Blackburn, J. was of the same opinion.
He said, "When the House is sitting  and statements are made
in either House of Parliament, the member making them is not
amenable to  the criminal  law. It  is quite  clear that  no
indictment will lie for making them, nor for a conspiracy or
agreement to  make them, even though the statements be false
to the	knowledge of  the persons   making  them. I entirely
concur in  thinking that the information did only  charge an
agreement to   make  statements in  the House  of Lords, and
therefore did  not charge  any indictable offence". Lush, J.
agreed. He  said that he could not doubt that the charge was
of "a  conspiracy to  deceive the  House of  Lords,  and  so
frustrate the  application, by	  means	 of    making  false
statements in  the House.  I am	 clearly of  opinion that we
ought not  to allow  it to  be doubted for a moment that the
motives or  intentions of  members of either House cannot be
inquired  into	by  criminal  proceedings  with	 respect  to
anything they may do or say in the House".
</p><p id="p_247">     As we  read Ex  Parte Wason, the Court of Queen's Bench
found  that   wason  desired   criminal	 proceedings  to  be
commenced against three members of Parliament for conspiring
to make,  and  making  statements  in  Parliament  which  he
alleged were  untrue and  made to  harm his cause, The Court
held that criminal proceedings could not be taken in respect
of statements  made   by members of Parliament in Parliament
nor for	 conspiring to make them. ex parte Wason, therefore,
does not  support Mr.  Rao's submission that his client P.V.
Narasimha Rao  and others  of the  alleged bribe  givers who
were members  of Parliament  have  "immunity  from  criminal
proceedings in	a court of law with respect to the charge of
conspiracy in  connection with	the voting  in Parliament on
the no-confidence motion". The speech or vote of the alleged
bribe giving  members of  Parliament is	 not in	 issue	nor,
therefore, a conspiracy in this beheld. In contrast, all the
three alleged conspirators in Ex parte Wason were members of
Parliament and	what was  alleged against them was that they
had made  false statements to Parliament in consequence of a
conspiracy. If what is alleged against members of Parliament
in India is that they had made false statements to, or voted
in, Parliament	in consequence	of a  conspiracy, they would
immune from  prosecution by  reason of <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_516">Article 105(2)</a> itself
and no	occasion would	arise ton  look into  the privileges
enjoyed by  the House  of Commons  under <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_517">Article  105(3).</a> To
repeat what  we have said earlier, Mr. Rao is right, subject
to two	caveats, in saying that Parliament has the power not
only to	 punish its members for an offence committed by them
but also  to punish  others who	 had conspired	with them to
have  the   offence  committed:	  first,  the  actions	that
constitute the	offence must  also constitute  a  breach  of
Parliament's privilege or its contempt; secondly, the action
that Parliament	 will take and the punishment it will impose
is for	the breach  of privilege  or contempt.	There is  no
reason to  doubt that  the Lok	Sabha can  take	 action	 for
breach of  privilege or	 contempt against  the alleged bribe
givers and  against the alleged bribe takers, whether or not
they were members of Parliament, but that is not to say that
the courts  cannot take	 cognizance of	the offence  of	 the
alleged bribe givers under the criminal law.
</p><p id="p_248">     Mr. Rao  relied upon  observations	 in  the  Eighteenth
Edition	 (197)	 of  Erskine  May's  Treatise  on  The	Law,
Privileges, Proceedings	 and Usage  of Parliament.  There is
before	us  the	 Twenty-second	Edition.  Part	of  what  is
contained in  the earlier  edition is  not find in the later
edition. That  May's treatise  is an authoritative statement
on its	subject has  been recognised  by this  Court (Keshav
Singh's case,  ibid). May's  earlier edition  stated, "It is
sometimes said	that, since  the privileges of Parliament do
not  extend  to	 criminal  matters,  therefore	Members	 are
amenable to  the course	 of criminal  justice  for  offences
committed in  speech or	 action in  the House.........It may
prove to  be true that things said or done in Parliament, or
some of	 them, are not withdrawn from the course of criminal
justice.....There is  more doubt as to whether criminal acts
committed  in	Parliament  remain   within  the   exclusive
cognizance of the House in which they are committed.......".
Quoting Mr. Justice Stephen in Bradlaugh v.Gosset, where the
learned judge  said that  he "knew  of no  authority for the
proposition that an ordinary crime committed in the House of
Commons would	be  withdrawn from  the ordinary  course  of
criminal justice",  May	  observed that "it must be supposed
that what  the learned judge had in mind was  a criminal act
as distinguished  from criminal	 speech".  May	went  on  to
state, "It  is probably	 true, as  a general  rule,  that  a
criminal act  done in the House is not outside the course of
criminal justice.  But this  rule is  not without exception,
and both  the rule and the exception will be found to depend
upon whether  the particular  act can or can not be regarded
as a proceeding in  Parliament...........it would be hard to
show that  a criminal  act committed  in  the  House  by  an
individual  Member  was	 part  of  the	proceedings  of	 the
House......Owing to the lack of precedents there is no means
of knowing what view the courts would take of a criminal act
committed in  Parliament, or  whether they would distinguish
action from speech in respect of amenability to the criminal
law. With  regard to  a crime  committed in  Parliament, the
House in  which it  was	  committed might claim the right to
decide whether	to exercise  its own jurisdiction or to hand
the offender  over to  the criminal  courts. In	 taking this
decision, it  would no	doubt be guided by the nature of the
offence, and  the adequacy  or inadequacy  of the penalties,
somewhat   lacking    in   flexibility,	  which	  it   could
inflict........In cases	 of breach  of privilege  which	 are
also offences  at law,	where the punishment which the House
has power  to inflict  would not be adequate to the offence,
or where  for any  other  cause	 the  House  has  thought  a
proceeding at law necessary, either asa a substitute for, or
in addition to, its own proceeding, the Attorney General has
been directed to prosecute the offender".
</p><p id="p_249">     May's Twenty-second  Edition is more succinct, and this
is what it says :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_128">	  "Moreover, though  the Bill of
     Rights will  adequately  protect  a
     Member as	regards criminal  law in
     respect of anything said as part of
     proceedings in Parliament, there is
     more doubt	 whether  criminal  acts
     committed	in  Parliament	  remain
     within the	 exclusive cognizance of
     the  House	  in  which   they   are
     committed. In  the judgment  of the
     House of Lords in Eliot's case (see
     pp 73 and 84n), it was deliberately
     left an  open question  whether the
     assault on	 the Speaker  might have
     been properly  heard and determined
     in	  the	 King's	   bench.    The
     possibility that  it might	 legally
     have   been   so	determined   was
     admitted by  one of the manager for
     the commo ns in the conference with
     the Lords	which preceded	the writ
     of error.	In Bradlaugh  v. Gosset,
     Mr. Justice  Stephen said	that  he
     'knew of	 no  authority	for  the
     proposition that  an ordinary crime
     committed in  the House  of Commons
     would   be	  withdrawn   from   the
     ordinary	course	  of	criminal
     justice".	 Since	  he   went   on
     immediately  to  refer  to	 Eliot's
     case and  accepted the  proposition
     "that nothing said in Parliament by
     a Member,	as such,  can be treated
     as	 an   offence  by  the	ordinary
     courts', it  must be  supposed that
     what the  learned judge had in mind
     was a criminal act as distinguished
     from criminal speech.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_129">	  In  such  cases,  it	will  be
     essential to  determine  where  the
     alleged  criminal	 act  stands  in
     relation to  he proceedings  of the
     House. An	officer carrying  out an
     order of  the House  is in the same
     position as  the Members  who voted
     the order.	 In Bradlaugh v Erskine,
     the Deputy	 Serjeant  at  Arms  was
     heldto be	justified on  committing
     the  assault   with  which	 he  was
     charged, since  it was committed in
     Parliament,  in  pursuance	 of  the
     order  of	the  House,  to	 exclude
     Bradlaugh from  the House.	 As Lord
     Coleridge	observed,   "The  Houses
     cannot act by themselves as a body;
     they  must	  act  committed   by  a
     Member, however, could form part of
     the proceedings of the House, Apart
     from Eliot's case 350 years ago, no
     charge against  a Member in respect
     of an  allegedly  criminal	 act  in
     Parliament has  been brought before
     the courts.  Were such  a situation
     to arise,	it is  possible that the
     House  in	 which	 the   act   was
     committed might  claim the right to
     decide whether  to exercise its own
     jurisdiction.   In	   taking   this
     decision,	it  would  no  doubt  be
     guided  by	  the  nature	of   the

submission, that  the bribery  of a  member of	the House of
Commons, acting	 in his Parliamentary capacity, did not , at
the time  the Constitution  came into  effect, constitute an
offence under  the English  criminal law  or the common law.
Clearly, therefore,  no privilege  or immunity	attached  in
England to  an allegation of such bribery or an agreement or
conspiracy in that behalf which could be imported into India
at the commencement of the Constitution under the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_518">Article 105(3).</a> Secondly, <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_519">Article 105</a>(@) provides for the

<p id="p_261">     It is  not in dispute that the prosecutions against all

contemplated by <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_575">Section 19</a> of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_262">     Mr. P.P.  Rao submitted  that a  Constitution Bench had
in the	case of	 <a href="/doc/1586918/" id="a_576">R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay</a>, 1984 (2) S.C.R.
495, held  that a  member of  a State  legislature was	 not
a public  servant, but	 that  the finding  therein that  he
performed  a   public  duty   was  erroneous   and  required
reconsideration. The  expression 'public  duty'	 in  <a href="/doc/655475/" id="a_577">Section
2(b)</a> of	 the said  Act meant  a duty  in the  context  of  a
interest which	could be  enforced at  law. A mandamus could
not issue  to a	 member of Parliament or a member of a State
legislature  to	 perform  his  duty  for  he  could  not  be
compelled to  speak or	to vote. It was permissible to refer
to the	speech in  Parliament of the Minister who had  moved
the Bill  that became  the  said  Act.	He  had	 stated,  in
response to  a question	 about the  position of	 a member of
Parliament or  a member	 of a  Legislative Assembly  , thus:
"............We have not done anything different or contrary
to the	law as	it stands today. Under the law, as it stands
today, the  Supreme Court  has held in Antulay's case that a
Member of  a Legislative  Assembly is  not a  public servant
within the  meaning of <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_578">Section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code."
That this  was really  the position was supposed by the fact
that two  conditions had to be satisfied for the purposes of
bringing someone within the purview of the said Act, namely,
that he	 should be  a public  servant (<a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_579">Section	2</a>) and there
should be  an authority	 competent to  remove him  from	 his
office (<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_580">Section	 19</a>). In  this behalf,	reliance was  placed
upon the judgement in <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_581">K. Veeraswamy vs. Union of India</a>, 1991
(3) S.C.R.  189. The  judgment of the Delhi High Court under
appeal noted  that it  was not	disputed that  there was  no
authority competent  to remove	members of  Parliament	from
their office.  This had	 also been  found by the Orissa High
Court in <a href="/doc/199699/" id="a_582">Habibullah Khan vs. State of Orissa</a>, (1993) Cr.L.J.
3604. A	  member  of Parliament	 and a	member	of  a  State
legislature did	 not hold  an office. <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_583">Section 2</a> (c)(viii) of
the  said   Act	 postulated   the  existence  of  an  office
independent of	the person holding it, and that by virtue of
the office, the holder was authorised or required to perform
a public  duty. That  a member of Parliament did not hold an
office was  apparent  from  the	 Constitution.	Whereas	 the
Constitution   spoke of other functionaries holding offices,
members	 of  Parliament	 were  said  to	 occupy	 seats.	 The
conclusion, therefore,	was  inescapable  that	the  accused
could not  be prosecuted  under the said Act and the charges
had to be quashed. Mr. D.D. Thakur echoed these submissions.
He added  that it  was legally	permissible,	but  morally
impermissible, for  a legislator   to  vote in	exchange for
money. The  clauses of	<a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_584">Section 2(c)</a>  had to  be constructed
ejusdem generis	 and, so  read, could  not cover  members of
Parliament or  the State  legislatures. Having regard to the
he fact	 that the  Minister had	 made a	  representation  to
Parliament when	 the Bill  was being  moved that  it did not
cover members  of Parliament  and the State legislatures, it
could	not be argued on behalf of the	Union Government, by
reason of  the principle  of promissory	 estoppel, that	 the
said  Act  covered  members  of	 Parliament  and  the  State
legislatures. The  said Act  only removed  the surplusage in
the then  existing definition of "public servant" and had to
be construed only in that light. The inclusion of members of
Parliament in  the said	 Act was  not "clearly implicit" nor
"irresistibly  clear."	A  member  of  Parliament  had	only
privileges given  to him  under the  Constitution; his	only
obligation was to remain present for a given number of days.
Mr. Sibbal  adopted the	 arguments of Mr. Rao. He added that
the Constitution  cast no  duty or obligation upon a  member
of Parliament.	Consequently, there  was no authorisation or
requirement to	perform	 a  duty  under	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_585">Section 2(c)(viii)</a>  of the  said Act. An authority competent
to remove  a public  servant   necessarily  contemplated  an
authority competent  to appoint him. There was	no authority
competent to appoint a	member of Parliament and, therefore,
there was no authority which could remove him.
The  Attorney  General	submitted  that	 the  object  behind
enacting the said Act was to widen the coverage of the anti-
corruption laws,  as had  been stated  in its  Statement  of
Object and  Reasons. 'Public   office'	had been  defined in
Blacks Law  Dictionary (Sixth  edition, pg  1082) thus, "the
right, authority,  and duty created and conferred by law, by
which for a given period, either fixed by law or enduring at
the  pleasure  of  the	creating  power,  an  individual  is
invested with  some portion  of the  sovereign functions  of
government for	the benefit of the public. An agency for the
state, the  duties of which involve in their performance the
exercise of some portion of sovereign power, either great or
small." The  Shorter Oxford  Dictionary (page  1083) defined
"Office" thus,	"A position  to	 which	certain	 duties	 are
attached, esp.	a place of trust, authority or service under
constituted authority."	 In Antulay's  case it had been held
that a	member of  a legislative  assembly "performs  public
duties cast  on him by the Constitution and his electorate".
That a	member of Parliament occupied an office had been the
view taken  in the  cases of Bunting and Boston (referred to
above). A   member  of Parliament  performed  the  sovereign
function of  law making	 and in	 regard to the exchequer. He
had a  fundamental duty	  to serve. He undertook high public
duties which were inseparable from his position. A member of
Parliament, therefore,	held  an  office.  The	Constitution
provided the  number of seats for members of Parliament. The
tenure of  a member  of Parliament  was fixed. He received a
salary	and   other  allowances.   It  was  clear  from	 the
Constitution that  he performed public duties. The oath that
he took	 referred to his obligation to "faithfully discharge
the duty"  upon which  he was  about to	 enter. The  Salary,
Allowances and	<a href="/doc/689696/" id="a_586">Pension of  Members of Parliament Act</a>, 1954,
specified that	a  member  of  Parliament  was	entitled  to
receive a salary per mensem "during the whole of his term of
office" and  an allowance  per day  "during  any  period  of
residence  on	duty"  .  The	 accused,  other  than	D.K.
Adikeshavulu and  M. Thimmagowda,  were,  therefore,  public
servants within	 the scope  of the  said Act  and  could  be
charged thereunder.  Reference to  the provisions of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_587">Section
19</a> of  the said Act and to the Minister's speech on the Bill
that became  the said Act was, consequently, not called for.
The provisions	of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_588">Section  19</a>	 were attracted	 only when a
public servant	had an	authority  which  was  competent  to
remove him.  Where, as in the case of a member of Parliament
or a  State legislature,  there was  no authority  which was
competent to  remove a	public servant,	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_589">section 19</a>  were not  attracted and  a prosecution  could be
launched and  taken cognizance of without previous sanction.
Alternatively,	the   authority	 to  remove  a	  member  of
Parliament was the President under the provisions of <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_590">Article
103</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_263">     There can be no doubt that the coverage of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_591">Section 2(c)</a>
of the	said Act is far wider than that of <a href="/doc/72179/" id="a_592">Section 21</a> of the
Indian penal   Code.  The two  provisions have	only  to  be
looked at side by side to be sure that	more people can	 now
be called  public servants  for the  purposes of  the  anti-
corruption law. There is, therefore,  no reason at all
why <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_593">Section   2(c)</a>  of the said Act should be construed only
in the	light of  the existing law and not on its own terms.
It is  for the	Court to construe <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_594">Section 2(c)</a>. If the Court
comes to  the conclusion  that members of Parliament and the
State legislatures  are clearly	  covered  by its  terms, it
must  so  hold.	 There	is  then  no  reason  to  resort  to
extraneous aids	 of interpretation such as the speech of the
Minister piloting  the Bill  that became  the said  Act. The
true interpretation  of a  statute does	 not depend upon who
urges it.  The	principle  of  promissory  estoppel  has  no
application in	this behalf. Further., if the court comes to
the conclusion,	 based on  <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_595">Section 2(c)</a> itself, that members
of Parliament and the State legislators are, clearly, public
servants, no  resort to	 the provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_596">Section  19</a>  is
required in  this regard.  The	words  "public	servant"  in
<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_597">Section 19</a>  must then  bear that  meaning that is attributed
to them	 on the	 construction of  the definition  thereof in
<a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_598">Section 2(c)</a>.
</p><p id="p_264">     A public servant is "any person who holds an office  by
virtue of which he is authorised or  required to perform any
public duty."  Not only,  therefore, must the person hold an
office but  he must   be authorised or required by virtue of
that office to perform a public duty. Public duty is defined
by <a href="/doc/655475/" id="a_599">Section  2(b)</a> of  the said  Act to  mean "a	duty in	 the
discharge of  which the	 State, the public or that community
at large  has an interest." In a which the State, the public
or  that    community  at  large  has  an  interest."  In  a
democratic  form   of  Government  it  is  the	  member  of
Parliament or  a State legislature who represents the people
of his	constituency in the highest law making bodies at the
Centre and  the State  respectively. Not  only is  he	 the
representative of  the people  in the  process of making the
laws  that   will  regulate   their  society,  he  is  their
representative in  deciding how the funds of the  Centre and
the States shall be spent and in exercising control over the
executive. It is difficult to conceive of a duty more public
than this  or of  a duty  in which the State, the public and
the community  at large	 would have  greater   interest. The
submission that this Court was in error in Antulay's case in
holding that  a member	 of  a State  legislature  "performs
public duties  cast on	 him  by the  Constitution  and	 his
electorate"   must be  rejected outright.  It	may be	- we
express	  no final  opinion - that the duty that a member of
Parliament  or	 a  State  legislature	performs  cannot  be
enforced by  the issuance  of a writ of mandamus but that is
not a sine qua non for a duty to be a public duty. We reject
the submission, in the light of what we have just said, that
a member  of Parliament	 has  only  privileges,	 no  duties.
Members of  Parliament and  the State  legislatures would do
well to	 remember that	if they	 have privileges  it is	 the
better to  perform their  duty of effectively and fearlessly
representing their constituencies.
</p><p id="p_265">     In Antulay's case the question relevant for our purpose
was whether a  member of a Legislative Assembly was a public
servant within	the meaning  of that   expression in clauses
12(a),(3) and  (7) of  <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_600">section 21</a> of the Indian Penal  Code.
These Clauses read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_190">	  21. The words 'public servant'

     following, namely:</blockquote>

<p id="p_266">This Court  held that a member of a Legislative Assembly did

therefore, he was not a public servant within the meaning of

was in	 this  context that this  Court made the observation

     which has	proved that  for   every

     not less  than 60 members chosen by
     direct    election	    from     the
     territorial constituencies	 in  the
     State for	which purpose  the State
     is divided	 into equal   number  of
     territorial   constituencies.    In
     <a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_608">Article  172</a>,   duration	of   the

     the  Constitution	 read  with  the
     <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_611">Representation of	the People  Act</a>,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_199">	  9.  The  aforesaid  submission
     appears to	 us to	be unassailable.
     We	 would,	 therefore,  accept  the
     same by stating that an M.L.a. does
     hold an office, which is one of the
     two   necessary   requirements   to
     attract the  definition of	 "public
     servant", as given in clause (viii)
     of the Act. Another requirement, as
     already mentioned,	 is  performance
     of public	duty as	 holder of  such
     office. This  aspect has been dealt
     with by Shri Rath in paragraph 7 of
     his written  note	wherein	 mention
     has    been    made  about	 various
     duties attached   to  the office of
     the M.L.A.,  as would  appear  from
     Chapter  III  of  Part  VI	 of  the
     Constitution  -   the  same  being,
     making of	laws, acting  conjointly
     to	   effectively	  control    the
     activities	  of	the   executive,
     approval of  the finance bill, etc.
     Indeed, no doubt can be entertained
     in this  regard in view of what was
     stated in paragraph 59 of Antulay's
     case, which is as below:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_200">	  ".....it   would   be	  rather
     difficult to  accept an unduly wide
     submission	 that	M.L.A.	is   not
     performing any public duty. However
     it is unquestionable that he is not
     performing any  public duty  either
     directed by  the Government  or for
     the   Government.	 He   no   doubt
     performs public duty cast on him by
     the    Constitution     and     his
     electorate.  He   thus   discharges
     constitutional functions.....""
</blockquote><p id="p_268">Having held  that a  member of	a Legislative assembly was a
public servant	under the  said Act,  the Orissa  High Court
went on	 to consider  which authority  was competent to give
sanction for  his prosecution.	That is an aspect with which
we are not immediately concerned and we shall revert to this
judgment later.
</p><p id="p_269">     We think that the view of the Orissa High Court that  a
member of  a Legislative  Assembly is  a public	 servant  is
correct. Judged	 by the	 test enunciated by Lord Atkin in Mc
Millan v. Guest and adopted by Sikri, J, in Kanta Kathuria's
case, the  position of	a member   of  Parliament, or  of  a
Legislative   Assembly,	  is   subsisting,   permanent	 and
substantive; it	 has an	 existence independent of the person
who fills  it and  it is  filled in succession by successive
holders. The  seat of  each constituency  is  permanent	 and
substantiative. It is filled, ordinarily for the duration of
the legislative	 term, by  the successful  candidate in	 the
election for the constituency. When  the legislative term is
over, the seat is filled by the successful candidate at the
 next  election. There	is, therefore, no doubt in our minds
that a	member of  Parliament, or of a Legislative Assembly,
holds an  office and  that he  is  required  and  authorised
thereby to  carry out  a public duty. In a word, a member of
Parliament, or	of  a  Legislative  Assembly,  is  a  public
servant for the purposes of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_270">     This brings  us to	 the issue  of	sanction  under	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_613">Section 19</a>  of the  said Act. The Section has
been quoted,  Sub-section (1) opens with the words "No court
shall  take   cognizance  of  an  offence  punishable  under
<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_614">Sections 7</a>,  <a href="/doc/990066/" id="a_615">10</a>, <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_616">11</a>, <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_617">13</a> and <a href="/doc/1228205/" id="a_618">15</a>. Secondly, the person charged
must be	 a public  servant at the point of time the court is
asked to  take cognizance; that is the material time for the
purposes of  the Section. Thirdly, the sanction must proceed
cognizance; it	must be	 prior sanction.  Fourthly, and this
from the  point of  view of this judgement is most material,
the Section  covers all	 public servants. In order words, if
any public  servant is	charged with  an offence  punishable
under the  aforesaid sections,	the  court  shall  not	take
cognizance in  the absence  of sanction.  That	the  Section
applies to all public servants	is also clear from the three
clauses of sub-section(1). Clause (a) says that the sanction
must be	 of the	 Central Government  in the case of a public
servant who  is employed  in connection	 with the affairs of
the Union  and is  not removable from his  office save by or
with the   sanction  of the  Central Government.  Clause (b)
says that  the sanction must be of a State Government in the
case of	 a public servant who is employed in connection with
the affairs   of  that State  and is  not removable from his
office save by or with the consent of that State Government.
Clause (c)  says that  the sanction in the case of any other
public servant	must be of the authority competent to remove
him from   his	office. Clause	(c) is the basket into which
all public  servants, other  than those covered by the terms
of clauses (a) and (b), fall
     Upon the  plain language  of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_619">Section
19</a>, analysed  above, the  argument of  the learned  Attorney
General that  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_620">Section  19</a> are  applicable
only to a public servant who is removable from his office by
an authority competent to do so must fail.
</p><p id="p_271">     In	 support  of  the  argument,  the  learned  Attorney
General relied	upon the  judgment of  this  Court  in	<a href="/doc/811423/" id="a_621">S.A.
Venkataraman vs. The State</a>, 1958 S.C.R. 1040, in which, with
reference to the provisions of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_622">Section 6</a> of the 1947 Act, it
was observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_201">	  " When  the provisions  of s.6
     of	 the  Act  are	examined  it  is
     manifest that  two conditions  must
     be fulfilled  before its provisions
     become applicable.	 One is that the
     offences	mentioned  therein  must
     be committed  by a	 public	 servant
     and the  other is	that that person
     is employed  in connection with the
     affairs of the Union or a State and
     is not  removable from  his  office
     save by or with the sanction of the
     Central  Government  or  the  State
     Government or  is a  public servant
     who is  removable from  his  office
     by any  other competent  authority.
     Both  these  conditions	must  be
     present to	 prevent  a  court  from
     taking  cognizance	 of  an	 offence
     mentioned in  the	section	 without
     the  previous   sanction	of   the
     Central  Government  or  the  State
     Government	  or	the    authority
     competent	to   remove  the  public
     servant from  his office. If either
     of these conditions is lacking, the
     essential	 requirements	of   the
     section are  wanting and provisions
     of the  section do not stand in the
     way of  a court  taking  cognizance
     without a previous sanction."
</blockquote><p id="p_272">The appellant  was a  public servant  who had been dismissed
from service  consequent upon  a departmental inquiry. After
his dismissal  he was  charged with  the offence of criminal
misconduct under  the 1947  Act and convicted. The appellant
contended that	no court  could have taken cognizance of the
charge against him because there was no prior sanction under
<a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_623">Section 6</a> of the 1947 Act. This Court found, as aforestated,
that for  the applicability  of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_624">Section 6</a> two conditions had
to be  fulfilled, namely,  (i) the  offence should have been
committed by a public servant and (ii) the public servant is
removable from	his office  by the  Central Government	or a
State Government   or a competent authority. This Court held
that sanction  was not	a pre-requisite to the cognizance of
the   offence with  which  the	appellant  was	charged	 and
conditions were	 not satisfied	because, when  cognizance of
the offence  was taken,	 the appellant	had ceased  to be  a
public servant.	 That the appellant was a public servant was
not in	dispute; that no sanction had been obtained was also
not  in	 dispute.  This	 Court	was  not  concerned  with  a
situation in  which there was a public servant but there was
no authority  competent to  remove him	from his office. The
observations of	 this Court   quoted  above were made in the
context of  the facts of the case and relative thereto. They
cannot be  examined de hors the facts and read as supporting
the proposition	 that  the  provisions	of  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_625">Section  19</a>	 are
applicable only	 to a  public servant  who is removable from
his office  by an authority competent to do so and, if there
is no  authority competent  to remove  a public servant from
his office,  the embargo  arising under	 <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_626">Section 19</a>  is	 not
attracted and <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_627">Section 19</a> does not come in the way of a court
taking cognizance.  In any  event,  we	cannot,	 with  great
respect, agree	that  the  observations	 fully	analyse	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_628">Section 19</a>. We have set out above how we read
it; as we read it, it applies to all who are public servants
for the purposes of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_273">     It is  incorrect to  say that  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_629">Section 19</a>	contemplates
that for  every public	servant there  must be	an authority
competent to remove him from his office and that, therefore,
the effort   must  be to  identify that authority. But if no
authority can  be identified in the case of a public servant
or a  particular category  of public servant, it cannot lead
to the	conclusion that	 was urged on behalf of the accused,
namely, that  he is  not a  public servant  or this is not a
category of  public servant  within the	 meaning of the said
Act. We	 have  found,  based  on  the  language	 of  <a href="/doc/1122694/" id="a_630">Section
2(c)(viii)</a>  read   with	 <a href="/doc/655475/" id="a_631">Section   2(b)</a>,  that	 members  of
Parliament are public servants. That finding, based upon the
definition  section,   must  apply  to	the  phrase  'public
servant' wherever  it occurs  in the  said  Act.  It  cannot
change if  it be found that there is no authority  competent
to remove  members of  Parliament from	office.	  Members of
Parliament would,  then, not  be liable to be prosecuted for
offences under	the said  Act other  than those	 covered  by
<a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_632">sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/990066/" id="a_633">10</a>, <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_634">11</a>,<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_635">13</a> and <a href="/doc/1228205/" id="a_636">15</a>.
</p><p id="p_274">     The Attorney General drew our attention in this context
to the	conclusion of  the Orissa  High Court in the case of
Habibullah Khan	 aforementioned. The Orissa High Court found
that there  was no  authority  which  could  grant  previous
sanction, as  contemplated by  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_637">Section 19</a> of the Act, in the
case of	 a member  of a	 Legislative Assembly.	Counsel, the
High Court  recorded, did  not contend that even if there be
no person  competent to	 give  sanction	 for  prosecuting  a
member	of  a  Legislative  Assembly  under  the  said	act,
nonetheless sanction  for his prosecution had to be obtained
because	 he  was  a  public  servant.  The  High  Court	 was
satisfied that	although "an  M.L.A. would  come within	 the
fold of	 the definition	 of 'public  servant', as  given  in
<a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_638">Section 2(c)</a>  of the  Act, he  is not  the type	 of  'public
servant' for  whose  prosecution  under	 the  Act,  previous
sanction as  required by <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_639">Section 19</a> is necessary. We require
realise	 the  anomaly  of  our	conclusion,  because  though
<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_640">Section 19</a>  of the  Act makes  no  distinction	between	 one
public servant	and another  for  the  purpose	of  previous
sanction, we  have made	 so. But  this is  a result which we
could not have truly and legally avoided."
</p><p id="p_275">     We do  not think that the view of the Orissa High Court
stated above is correct. Since <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_641">Section 6</a> of the 1947 Act and
<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_642">Section 19</a>  of the  said Act make no distinction between one
public servant	and another  for  the  purpose	of  previous
sanction, the conclusion must be that where the	 Court finds
that there  is no  authority competent	 to  remove a public
servant,  that	public	servant	 cannot	 be  prosecuted	 for
offences punishable  under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_643">Sections 7</a>,<a href="/doc/990066/" id="a_644">10</a>,<a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_645">11</a>,<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_646">13</a> and <a href="/doc/1228205/" id="a_647">15</a> of the
said Act  because there	 is no	authority  that can sanction
such prosecution.
</p><p id="p_276">     This Court	 in the	 case of  <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_648">K. Veeraswami	 v. Union of
India and  others</a>,  [1991]  3  S.C.R.  189,  considered	 the
applicability  of the 1947 Act to a Judge of a High Court or
the Supreme  Court. A  case under  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_649">Section
5(2)</a> read  with <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_650">Section	 5(1)(e)</a> of  the 1947  Act had	been
registered against  the appellant,  the Chief  Justice of  a
High Court,  and on 28th February, 1976, an F.I.R. was filed
in the	Court of  Special Judge.  The appellant	 retired  on
attaining the  age of  superannuation on 8th April, 1976. On
15th December,	1977 ,	a charge sheet was filed and process
was issued  for appearance  of the  appellant. The appellant
moved the  High Court  to quash	 the proceedings.  The	High
Court dismissed	 the application  but granted certificate of
fitness to  appeal. This  Court, by  a	 majority, concluded
that a	Judge of  a High  Court and  the Supreme Court was a
public servant	within the  meaning of <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_651">Section 2</a> if the 1947
Act.  A	 prosecution  against  him  could  be  lodged  after
obtaining the  sanction of  the	 competent  authority  under
<a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_652">Section 6</a>  of the  1947 Act. For this purpose, the President
of India  was the  authority to	 give previous	sanction. No
criminal case  could be registered against a Judge of a High
Court unless  the Chief Justice of India was consulted. Such
consultation was  necessary also  at the  stage of examining
whether sanction  for prosecution  should be  granted, which
should be guided by and in accordance with the advice of the
Chief Justice  of India. Specifically, the majority view was
that a	public servant	could  not  be	prosecuted  for	 the
offences specified  in <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_653">Section	6</a> of  the 1947	 Act  unless
there was  prior sanction  for prosecution  from a competent
authority. A  Judge of	the superior  courts  squarely	fell
within the  purview of	the 1947 Act. The second requirement
under clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1338074/" id="a_654">Section 6(1)</a> was that for the purpose of
granting sanction  for his  prosecution	 there	must  be  an
authority and  the authority  must be  competent   to remove
him. It	 was, therefore,  "now necessary  to  identify	such
authority......".
</p><p id="p_277">     The learned  Attorney General  laid  stress  upon	this
observation. He submitted that the court should identify the
authority competent  to remove	a member of Parliament, or a
State Legislature,  from his  office if it found such member
to be  a public	 servant within	 the meaning of <a href="/doc/519055/" id="a_655">Section 2(c)</a>
and did	 not accept  his contention  that the  provisions of
<a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_656">Section 19</a> did not apply, there being no authority competent
to remove  such member	from his  office. In other words, it
was the	 alternative  submission  of  the  learned  Attorney
General that there was an authority competent to remove such
member from  his office	 :  in	the  case  of  a  member  of
Parliament it  was the President and in the case of a member
of a  State Legislature it was the Governor of the State. We
shall address ourselves to the submission in a moment.
</p><p id="p_278">     The passage in Veeraswamy's case relied upon by learned
counsel for  the appellants  is contained  in the dissenting
judgment of Verma, J.

     competent	 authority    to   grant
     sanction for prosecution in case of
     all  the  public  servants	 falling
     within  the  purview  of  the  Act.
     Admittedly, such  previous sanction
     is a condition precedent for taking
     cognizance of an offence punishable

     who  is   prosecuted   during   his
     continuance  in   the  office.   It

     (1) of  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_658">Section 6</a>.	 It follows that
     the  holder   of  an  office,  even
     though    a     'public	servant'
     according to  the definition in the
     Act, who  does not	 fall within any
     of the  clauses (a),  (b) or (c) of
     sub-section (1)  of <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_659">Section  6</a> must
     hold to  be outside  the purview of
     the   Act	  since	  this	 special
     enactment was  not enacted to cover
     that category  of	public	servants
     inspite or	 the wide  definition of
     'public servant'  in the  Act. This
     is the  only manner  in which these
     provisions	 of   the  Act	 can  be
     harmonized and  given full	 effect.
     The scheme	 of the	 Act is	 that  a
     public  servant   who  commits  the
     offence of	 criminal misconduct, as
     defined in	 the several  clauses of
     sub-section(1) of	<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_660">Section 5</a>,   can
     be punished in accordance with sub-
     section (1)  of <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_661">Section  5</a>, can  be
     punished in  accordance  with  sub-
     section (2)  of  <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_662">Section  5</a>,  after
     investigation of the offence in the
     manner  prescribed	  and  with  the
     previous sanction	of the competent
     authority obtained	 under <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_663">Section 6</a>
     of the  act in  a	trial  conducted
     according	 to    the    prescribed
     procedure. The  grant  of	previous
     sanction under  <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_664">Section 6</a>	being  a
     condition	 precedent    for    the
     prosecution  of  a	 public	 servant
     covered by	 the Act, it must follow
     that the  holder of  an office  who
     may be  a public  servant according
     to	 the   wide  definition	 of  the
     expression in  the	 Act  but  whose
     category for  the grant of sanction
     for prosecution is not envisaged by
     <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_665">Section 6</a>	of the	Act,  is outside
     the  purview   of	the   Act,   not
     intended to  be covered by the act.
     This is  the only manner in which a
     harmonious	 constitution	of   the
     provisions of  the Act  can be made
     for the  purpose of  achieving  the
     object of that enactment."</blockquote>
<p id="p_280">     We are  unable, with respect, to share this view in the
dissenting  judgment.  It  does	 not  appear  to  take	into
reckoning the  fact that sanction is not a pre-requisite for
prosecution for	 all  offences	under  the  statute  but  is
limited	 to   those  expressly	specified  in  the  sanction
provision. Secondly,  the question  as to whether or  not  a
person is a public servant within the meaning of the statute
must be	 determined having  regard to  the definition  of  a
public servant	contained in  the statute.  If the person is
found to  be a	public servant	within the  meaning  of	 the
definition, he	must be	 taken to be a public servant within
the meaning   of  the definition,  he must  be taken to be a
public servant	for the	 purposes of  all provisions  in the
statute in  which the expression 'public servant' occurs. If
therefore, a  person is found to satisfy the requirements of
the definition	of a public servant, he must be treated as a
public servant	for the	 purposes of the sanction provision.
In our	opinion, it  cannot be hold, as a consequence of the
conclusion that	 there is  no authority	 competent to remove
from office  a person  who falls  within the  definition  of
public servant,	 that he  is not a public servant within the
meaning of  the statute.  Where a person is found to satisfy
the requirements  of the definition of a public servant, the
Court must,  as was  said by  the majority  in	Veeraswami's
case, attempt  to identify the authority competent to remove
him from  his office. The majority identified that authority
in the case of a Judge of a High Court and the Supreme Court
and did not need to consider the effect upon the prosecution
of not being able to find such authority.
</p><p id="p_281">     It is  convenient now  to notice  a submission  made by
Mr. Sibal  based upon  Veeraswami's case. He urged that just
as  this   court  had	there  directed	  that	no  criminal
prosecution should  be launched	 against a  Judge of  a High
Court or  the Supreme  Court without  first  consulting	 the
Chief Justice of India, so we should direct that no criminal
prosecution  should   be  launched   against  a	  member  of
Parliament without  first consulting  the  Speaker.  As	 the
majority judgment makes clear, this direction was considered
necessary to secure the independence of the judiciary and in
the light  of the "apprehension that the Executive being the
largest litigant  is likely  to abuse the power to prosecute
the Judges."  Members  of  Parliament  do  not	stand  in  a
comparable position.  They do  not have	 to decide day after
day disputes between the citizen  and the Executive. They do
not need  the additional  protection that the Judges require
to perform  their   constitutional duty	 of decision  making
without fear or favour.
</p><p id="p_282">     Before  we	  move	on   to	 consider   the	 alternative
submission  of	the  Attorney  General,	 we  must  note	 the
judgment in  <a href="/doc/811423/" id="a_666">S.A. Venkataraman	vs. The	 State</a>, 1958  S.C.R.
1040, upon which the learned Attorney General relied for his
first proposition, namely, that the provisions of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_667">Section 19</a>
do not apply to a public  servant in resect of whom there is
no authority  competent to  remove him	from his office. The
appellant Venkatraman  was a  public servant.  After he	 was
dismissed  from	  service  consequent  upon  a	departmental
inquiry, he  was charged  with criminal misconduct under the
1947 Act and was convicted. The contention before this Court
was that  the trial court could not have taken cognizance of
the offence because no sanction for the prosecution had been
produced before it. This Court held that no sanction for the
prosecution of	the appellant  was required  because  he was
not a  public servant  at the time cognizance of the offence
was taken.  The following  passage in  this Court's judgment
was relied upon :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_203">	  " It	was suggested  that  cl.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_204">     (c) in  s.6(1)  refers  to	 persons
     other than	 those mentioned in cls.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_205">     (a)  and	(b).   The   words   "is
     employed" are absent in this clause
     which would,  therefore, apply to a
     person  who  had  ceased  to  be  a
     public servant  though he was so at
     the time  of the  commission of the
     offence.  Clause	(c)  cannot   be
     construed	 in    this   way.   The
     expressions  "in	the  case  of  a
     person" and  "in the  case	 of  any
     other  person"   must  refer  to  a
     public servant having regard to the
     first paragraph of the sub-section.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_206">     Clauses  (a)  and	(b),  therefore,
     would cover  the case  of a  public
     servant   who    is   employed   in
     connection with  the affairs of the
     Union  or	 a  State   and	 is  not
     removable from  his office	 save by
     or with the sanction of the Central
     Government or  the State Government
     and cl.(c)	 would cover the case of
     any other	 public	 servant whom  a
     competent	authority  could  remove
     from his office. The more important
     words  in	 cl.  (c)  are	"of  the
     authority competent  to remove  him
     from his  office". A public servant
     who  has  ceased  to  be  a  public
     servant is	 not a	person removable
     from  any	office	by  a  competent
     authority. <a href="/doc/62140/" id="a_668">Section	 2</a>  of	the  Act
     states that  a public  servant, for
     the purpose  of the  Act,	means  a
     public servant  as defined	 in s.21<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_669">
     of the Indian Penal Code</a>. Under cl.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_207">     (c), therefore,  any one  who is  a
     public servant  at the time a court
     was asked	to take	 cognizance, but
     does   not	   come	   within    the
     description  of  a	 public	 servant
     under cls.	 (a) and (b), is accused
     of an  offence  committed by him as
     a public servant as specified in<a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_670"> s.
     6</a> would  be entitled to rely on the
     provisions	 of   that  section  and
     object to	the taking of cognizance
     without a previous sanction."</blockquote>
<p id="p_283">We do  not find	 in the passage anything that can assist the
Attorney General's  submission; rather,	 it is supportive of
the view  that we  have taken  and indicates  that the third
clause in  the sanction provision is a catch-all clause into
which all  public servants  who are not covered by the first
two clauses  fall. In  the  words,  to	prosecute  a  public
servant the  prior sanction  of the  authority competent  to
remove him is a must.
</p><p id="p_284">     For the  purposes of  appreciating	 argument  that	 the
President is  the authority  competent to remove a member of
Parliament from	 his office, Articles 101, 102 and 103 under
the head  "Disqualifications of	 Members" in  Chapter II  of
Part V	of the	Constitution need  to be  set out.  (Similar
provisions in  relation to members of State Legislatures are
contained in  Articles 190,  191 and 192 under the same head
in Chapter  III of  Part VI  of the  Constitution.) Articles

<p id="p_285">     By reason	 of <a href="/doc/319030/" id="a_673">Article 101(3)(a</a>), the seat of a  member
of Parliament  becomes vacant  if he  becomes subject to the
disqualifications   mentioned in  <a href="/doc/964829/" id="a_674">Article  102(1)</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_675">(2).</a>
Those disqualifications	 are the  holding of  an  office  of
profit under  the Union	 or State  Government, other than an
office declared	 by Parliament	by law not to disqualify the
holder; the  declaration by a competent court of unsoundness
of mind;  undischarged	insolvency;  the  citizenship  of  a
foreign State  or acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence
thereto;  and  disqualification	 under	any  law    made  by
Parliament or under the Tenth Schedule. Under the provisions
of <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_676">Article  103</a>, it  is only  if a  question  arises  as  to
whether a  member of Parliament has become subject to any of
the    disqualifications    aforementioned,    other	than
disqualification under the Tenth Schedule, that the question
is  referred   to  the	 President  for	 his  decision.	 The
President's decision  is final	but, before  giving it,	 the
President  has	 to  obtain  the  opinion  of  the  Election
Commission and has to act according to such opinion.
The question  for our  purposes is whether, having regard to
the terms  of <a href="/doc/1185201/" id="a_677">Article 101</a><a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_678">, 102</a> and <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_679">103</a>, the President can be
said to	 be the	 authority competent  to remove	 a member of
Parliament from	 his office.  It is  clear from	 <a href="/doc/1185201/" id="a_680">Article 101</a>
that the  seat of  a member  of	 Parliament  becomes  vacant
immediately   upon    his   becoming	subject	   to	 the
disqualifications, mentioned  in <a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_681">Article  102.</a> without more.
The removal  of a  member of  Parliament  is  occasioned  by
operation of  law and  is self	operative.  Reference to the
President under	 <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_682">Article 103</a>  is required only if a question
arises as  to whether a member of Parliament has earned such
disqualification; that	is to  say, if	it is  disputed. The
President would	 then have  to decide  whether the member of
Parliament   had    become   subject	to   the   automatic
disqualification contemplated  by  <a href="/doc/1185201/" id="a_683">Article  101.</a>  His  order
would	not remove the member of Parliament from his seat or
office but  would declare  that he  stood  disqualified.  It
would operate  not with	 effect from  the date upon which it
was made  but would  relate back  to the date upon which the
disqualification was  earned. Without,	therefore, having to
go into	 the connotation  of the  word "removal"  in service
law, it	 seems clear that the President cannot be said to be
the authority	competent  to remove a	member of Parliament
from his office.
</p><p id="p_286">     The Attorney  General submitted  that the scheme of the
said Act,  as compared	to the	1947 Act,  had undergone  an
important change  by reason  of	 the  introduction  of	sub-
section	 (3)  in  <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_684">Section  19</a>.	Sanction  was  no  longer  a
condition precedent.  A trial in the absence of sanction was
not a  trial without  inherent jurisdiction  or a nullity. A
trial without  sanction had  to be  upheld unless  there had
been a	failure of  justice. This  feature  has	 a  material
bearing on  the present	 case. The  trial  Court  had  taken
cognizance of  the charges  against the accused and the High
Court had  dismissed the  revision  petition  to  quash	 the
charges. In  the Light	of <a href="/doc/181/" id="a_685">Section  19(3)</a>, this Court should
not interdict  the charges,  particularly since	 a complaint
filed today  would not require sanction against	 most of the
accused. Having	 regard to  the effect	of our findings upon
the  accused,	it  is	 not  necessary	  to  consider	this
submission.
</p><p id="p_287">     We have,  as aforestated,	reached the  conclusion that
members of  Parliament and the State legislatures are public
servants liable to be prosecuted for offences under the said
Act but	 that they  cannot be  prosecuted for offences under

criminal court,	 the prosecuting  agency  shall	 obtain	 the
permission of the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha/Speaker of the
Lok Sabha,  as the  case may  be, I  have not  been able  to
persuade myself	 to  concur  with  the	reasonings  and	 the
finding in the judgment of Mr. Justice Agrawal that a member
of parliament  does not	 enjoy immunity under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_708">Article 105(2)</a>
or 105(3) of the Constitution from being prosecuted before a
criminal court	for an offence involving offer or acceptance
of bribe  for the  purpose of speaking or giving his vote in
Parliament or in any committee thereof.
</p><p id="p_297">     <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_709">Article 105</a>  of the  Constitution	deals  with  powers,
privileges etc.	 of the Houses of Parliament and the members
and committees	thereof.   Sub <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_710">article	(1)</a> of	<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_711">Article	 105</a>
makes it  evident that	subject to  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution and  rules and  standing orders  regulating the
procedure of Parliament, there shall be freedom of speech in
Parliament.   The provisions  of Sub-<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_712">article (1)</a> <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_713">Article 105</a>
indicates in  no uncertain  term that  the freedom of speech
guaranteed  under   sub	 <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_714">Article   (1)</a>	of  <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_715">Article  105</a>  is
independent  of	 the  freedom  of  speech  guaranteed  under
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_716">Article 19</a>  of the  Constitution and  such freedom of speech
under <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_717">Article  105 (1)</a>	is not inhibited or circumscribed by
the restrictions  under <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_718">Article	 105 (1)</a> is not inhibited or
circumscribed by  the restrictions  under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_719">Article  19</a> of the
Constitution.	In order  to ensure effective functioning of
Parliamentary democracy, there was a felt need that a Member
of Parliament  will have  absolute freedom in expressing his
views in  the deliberations  made in the door of Parliament.
Similarly he  must enjoy full freedom in casting his vote in
Parliament.
</p><p id="p_298">     The protections to be enjoyed by a Member of Parliament
as contained  in Sub  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_720">Article (2)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_721">Article 105</a> essentially
flows from  the freedom	 of  speech  guaranteed	 under	Sub-
<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_722">Article (1)</a>  of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_723">Article	 105.</a>  Both the Sub-articles (1) and
(2) compliment	each other  and indicate the true content of
freedom of  speech and freedom to exercise the right to vote
envisaged  in	<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_724">Article	 105</a>   of  the	Constitution.	 The
expression "in	respect of" appearing in several articles of
the Constitution  and in  some other  legislative provisions
has been  noticed in  a number	of decisions  of this Court.
The correct  interpretation of the expression "in respect of
can not	 be  made  under  any  rigid  formula  but  must  be
appreciated with  references to	 the context in which it has
been used and the purpose to be achieved under the provision
in question.   The  context  in	 which	the  expression	 "in
respect of"  has been used in sub <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_725">article (2)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_726">Article 105</a>
and the	 purpose for which the freedom of speech and freedom
to vote	 have been  guaranteed in sub <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_727">article (2)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_728">Article
105</a> do	not permit  any restriction  or curtailment  of such
right expressly	 given under sub <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_729">article (1)</a> and sub <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_730">article
(2)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_731">Article 105</a> of the Constitution.	 It must, however be
made clear  that the  protection under	sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_732">article  (2)</a>  of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_733">Article 105</a>  of the  Constitution must	relate to  the	vote
actually given	and speech  actually made in Parliament by a
Member of  Parliament.	 In any view, the protection against
proceedings in	court as  envisaged under Sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_734">article (2)</a> of
<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_735">Article 105</a>  must necessarily be interpreted broadly and not
in a  restricted manner.  Therefore, an action impugned in a
court proceeding  which has  a nexus  with the	vote cast or
speech made in Parliament must get the protection under sub-
<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_736">article (2)</a>  of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_737">Article 105.</a>  Sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_738">Article (3)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_739">Article 105</a>
provides for  other powers,  privileges and immunities to be
enjoyed by  a Member  of Parliament.   The  farmers  of	 the
Constitution did  not catalogue	 such powers, privileges and
immunities but	provided in  sub <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_740">article  (3)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_741">Article 105</a>
that until  such privileges are defined by the Parliament, a
member of  Parliament will enjoy such powers, privileges and
immunities which  had been  recognised to  be existing for a
member of  House of  Commons  at  the  commencement  of	 the
Constitution of	 India.	  As I	respectfully agree  with the
reasonings indicated  in the judgment of the learned brother
Mr. Justice  S.P. Bharucha  that in  the facts	of the case,
protection under  <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_742">Article 105(3)</a>  of the Constitution is not
attracted but  protection under	 Sub <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_743">article  (2)</a> of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_744">Article
105</a> is	available only	to those  accused, who as Members of
Parliament had	cast their  votes in  Parliament, I  refrain
from indicating	 separate  reasonings  in  support  of	such
finding.
