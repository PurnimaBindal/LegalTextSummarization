<p id="p_1">          Petitioner, who was appointed as a Multipurpose Health

Worker (Female) on 18.7.2007 in the State of Haryana, by way of

present writ petition has questioned the validity of Note 4 to Rule 8.127

of the Punjab Civil Services Rules Volume I Part I so far it restricts grant

of benefit of maternity leave to the birth of two living children. In this writ

petition, it has been prayed that by issuing writ in the nature of certiorari

Note 4 to the above said Rules be quashed being ultra vires to the

Constitution of India and contrary to the mandatory dictum of law laid in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                   2</span>




the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_1">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). Not

only the vires of the Note in question appended to Rule have been

assailed being contrary to the Act but it has also been urged that the

Note cannot sustain in the eyes of law being contrary to right of equality,

guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India as it

suffers from the vice of discrimination. Along with the above said two

thrust arguments, Executive Instructions issued by the Government of

Haryana which bring to an end the distinction of two living children born

before or after entering into the service have also been challenged.

Petitioner, who has conceived a child as a first one from the second

marriage has also contended that the child to be born first from the

second marriage, cannot be construed as third child to deny benefit of

maternity leave. Thus, this Court should hold interpretation of the

provisions of Rules by her employer as bad on the facts and law of the

case.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          Before we could formulate questions of law, which have been

posed to be answered by us, it will be necessary to note brief facts of

the case, various provisions of the Act and relevant Rules.

</p><p id="p_3">          Let us have the facts of the case at the first instance.

          The petitioner was appointed as a Multipurpose Health Worker

(female) on the recommendation of the Haryana Staff Selection

Commission, Panchkula vide appointment letter (Annexure P1) dated

18.7.2007. Before joining the Government service, the petitioner was

married to one Farukh Ali and two children were born from the wedlock,

who were earlier staying with the petitioner. According to petitioner,

marriage has been dissolved on 13.1.2010 by way of decree of divorce
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                    3</span>




granted by the District Judge, Family Court, Faridabad and thereafter

custody of the children is with their father. The decree of divorce was

made subject matter of challenge in the appeal before this Court. Vide

order dated 9.2.2011 (Annexure P2), passed by this Court, the decree of

divorce granted to the petitioner has attained finality. After the decree of

divorce was granted by the Court of the District Judge, Family Court,

Faridabad, the petitioner has solemnized marriage with one          Mukim

Khan on 27.4.2010. It is stated that from the second marriage, the

petitioner was expecting a child in March 2011. The petitioner had

applied for grant of maternity leave vide application (Annexure P5). On

16.2.2011, the respondent-State denied maternity leave to the petitioner

on the ground that she was already having two living children.

</p><p id="p_4">          Chapter VIII of Punjab Civil Services Rules Volume I Part-I

defines "Maternity Leave" and the same reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "8.127(1) The competent authority under Rule 8.23 may

             grant maternity leave to a female Government employee for

             a period not exceeding three months from the date of its

             commencement or to the end of six weeks from the date of

             confinement whichever is earlier. Leave salary equal to the

             pay drawn immediately before proceeding on leave shall be

             paid during maternity leave and it shall not be debited

             against the leave account."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">          Controversy in this case revolves around Note 4 appended to

this Rule and the same reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "Note 4 Maternity leave shall not be admissible to a

             female Government employee having more than two living

             children. In such cases leave of the kind due or extra

             ordinary leave will be allowed."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">          The respondents had issued Executive Instructions to clarify

the above said Note and on the basis thereof maternity leave had been

denied. The said Executive Instructions issued on 5.2.1993 (Annexure

R2) read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      "I am directed to address you on the subject cited

                      above and to say that a question has arisen as to

                      whether a female Govt. employee can avail of the

                      benefit of maternity leave when she has already two

                      living children before joining the Govt. service. The

                      matter has been considered by the Govt. and it is

                      accordingly, clarified that a female Govt. employee

                      who has already two living children before her entry

                      into Govt. service, is not entitled to the benefit of

                      maternity leave. In such cases, the deptts. may

                      consider granting leave of the kind due to the female

                      employees".</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">          As per this clarification, the benefit of maternity leave is to be

restricted to the two living children. In other words if these children are

born before the entry of an employee into Government service, she will

not be entitled to the benefit of maternity leave.

</p><p id="p_11">          In the context of above said legal position, we have heard

learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_12">          Arguments advanced by Mr. Rajesh Lamba, Advocate,

learned counsel for the petitioner, are as follows:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                    5</span>




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         a)        It is submitted that the act of the employer to deny

                   maternity leave to an employee having more than

                   two   living   children   is   arbitrary   and     cause

                   discrimination between two sets of women i.e. one

                   who is having two living children and another who is

                   having more than two children. It is stated that such

                   a classification is not permissible in law and is

                   violative of the principles of equality, enshrined in

                   Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         b)        Secondly, it is contended that to give effect to the

                   Directive Principles of State Policy especially <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_2">Article

                   42</a> of the Constitution of India which expects the

                   State to make       provisions for securing just and

                   humane condition of work and for grant of maternity

                   leave, the Central Government has enacted the Act

                   which is Socio Beneficial Act and the provisions of

                   the Act shall override all the Rules framed by the

                   Government. It is urged that the Rules framed by the

                   respondent-Government ought to be in consonance

                   with the Act and so far as the Rules overstep the

                   statutory provisions of the Act, they are to be

                   quashed being in derogation to the Central Statute.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         c)        Learned counsel for the petitioner has further

                   canvassed that the clarification dated 5.2.1993

                   (Annexure R2) which states that any employee who

                   was already having two living children before joining

                   the Government service is not entitled to maternity

                   leave is contrary to the Note 4 of the Rules and the

                   same cannot be termed as clarification, thus, the

                   Government instructions run counter to the Rules

                   and cannot sustain in the eyes of law.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         d)        Lastly, it is argued that since the child conceived and

                   expected to be born was the first child from the

                   second marriage, denial of maternity leave to the

                   petitioner will defeat the very purpose for which the

                   Act was enacted. It is urged that the Act intended to

                   empower      women     to   take    employment,        to

                   supplement income of the family and be equal

                   partner in the marriage. Pregnancy, delivery and

                   rearing of child should not confine women to home

                   and therefore to strengthen        the institution of

                   marriage benefit of maternity leave was thought

                   over. Learned counsel has submitted that failure of

                   first marriage and solemnization of second marriage

                   should not be looked upon while denying benefit of

                   maternity leave on the basis of first child from the

                   second marriage.</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">         Mr. Kulvir Narwal, Additional Advocate General, Haryana, has

vehemently contested the arguments advanced by learned counsel for

the petitioner. Broadly, his criticism to the above said arguments can be

summed up as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         a)        Mr. Narwal has urged that the Government in its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                   7</span>




                   right earnest is advocating small family norms in

                   order to control the ever increasing population in the

                   Country. It is stated that the Government through its

                   various functionaries/organs, propagates two child

                   norm as part of family planning and also gives

                   various   incentives    to   promote   this   objective.

                   Therefore, the Government is well within its rights to

                   restrict benefit of maternity leave to the birth of two

                   children and by doing so if            two classes of

                   employees one having two children and another

                   having more than two children emerge, such a

                   classification being reasonable is in consonance

                   with the Constitutional Scheme.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         b)        It is contended by the learned State counsel that

                   <a href="/doc/1960944/" id="a_3">Section 28</a> of the Act empowers the Government to

                   make Rules in carrying out the purposes of the Act

                   therefore, under Clause (k) of Sub Section (2) to

                   <a href="/doc/1960944/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of the Act, the Government can make

                   Rules or in respect of any other matter, which is to

                   be, or may be prescribed pertaining to maternity

                   benefit. It is stated that under the Rule making

                   power which vests in the Government under <a href="/doc/1960944/" id="a_5">Section

                   28</a>   of   the   Act,   necessary   provisions     were

                   incorporated in the Punjab Civil Services Rules as

                   applicable to the State of Haryana with regard to the

                   maternity and hospital leave.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">         c)        It is further stated that Instructions dated 5.2.1993

                   (Annexure R2) are only clarificatory in nature and

                   the Government through Executive Instructions can

                   always supplement the existing Rules.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">         d)        The Rules do not make distinction between the first

                   and second marriage and the benefits of the

                   maternity leave are restricted only to two living

                   children.   Therefore,     learned   counsel   for   the

                   petitioner has not confined to the legal provisions

                   and was unnecessarily sermonizing in didactic terms

                   as to what ought to be achieved by the Government

as under:-

               of writ jurisdiction. Note 4 below Rule 8.127(1) of the

               Punjab Civil Services Rules (Vol. I Part I), as applicable to

               Haryana and adopted by the Nigam clearly lays down that

               children. In such cases leave of the kind due or

</p><p id="p_19">          However, in Parkasho Devi's case (supra), the question of

classification between a woman employee having more than two

children or another woman employee having less than two children was

not considered. In that case, vires of the Rules in context of the Act were

also not considered. Furthermore, in Parkasho Devi's case (supra), a

Division Bench of this Court had also not deliberated on the issue as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                      10</span>




whether the classification of women employes, one having two children

and another having more than two children is just and appropriate and

whether the Government can create such a distinction. Classification

between the women having two children or more was considered by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1572027/" id="a_7">Javed and Others v. State of Haryana and

Others</a> (2003)8 Supreme Court Cases 369. The vires of the provisions

of Sections 175(1)(q) and 177(1) of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act,

1994, were questioned before the Hon'ble Apex Court. By these

provisions, persons having two living children were disqualified to hold

the office of the Sarpanch or a Panch of the Gram Panchayat. Such a

classification was assailed being ultra vires to the Constitution of India. It

was canvassed that the provision is arbitrary and hence violative of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and is also discriminatory. In

Javed's case (supra), it was held that even though <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India forbids class legislation, it does not forbid

reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. Relying upon

<a href="/doc/1905739/" id="a_10">Budhan Choudhary and Others v. The State of Bihar</a> 1955 AIR 191,

it was held that to satisfy the Constitutional contest of permissibility, two

conditions must be satisfied, namely (i) that the classification is founded

on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that

are grouped together from others left out of the group; and, (ii) that such

a differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved

by the Statute in question. The basis for classification may rest on

conditions which may be geographical or according to objects or

occupation or the like. In Javed's case (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court

noticed population scenario of the world and observed that increase in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> Civil Writ Petition No. 4229 of 2011                                 11</span>




the population of the Country is one of the major hindrances in the pace

of India's socio-economic progress. It marked the words of Bertand

Russell, "Population explosion is more dangerous than Hydrogen Bomb"

and upheld the provisions of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994,

saying State is competent to define its priority in enacting Policy or

enacting legislation. Thus, classification between two sets of women

employees having two children or more than two was held to be

reasonable. In Javed's case (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court relied

upon <a href="/doc/1903603/" id="a_11">Air India and Others v. Nergesh Meerza and Others</a> (1981)4

Supreme Court Cases 335 and upheld the rule which would terminate

the services of Air Hostesses on the third pregnancy with two existing

children, and held the rule to be salutary and reasonable. It was

observed as under:-

                   amended so as to terminate the services of an AH

                   which would be both salutary and reasonable for

                   two reasons. In the first place, the provision

                   would be in the larger interest of the health of the

                   AH concerned as also for the good upbringing of the

                   children. Secondly, as indicated above while dealing

                   with the rule regarding prohibition of marriage within

                   four years, same considerations would apply to a

                   bar of third pregnancy where two children are

                   already there because when the entire world is

                     faced with the problem of population explosion it will

                     not only be desirable but absolutely essential for

                     every country to see that the family planning

                     programme is not only whipped up but maintained at

                     sufficient levels so as to meet the danger of over

                     population which, if not controlled, may lead to

                     serious social and economic problems throughout

</p><p id="p_21">          Therefore, in view of the law laid by the Hon'ble Apex Court,

we are of the view that the State is well justified in making a distinction

between the two sets of women employees, one having two living

children and another having more than two living children.          Such a

classification being reasonable is having intelligible differentia to achieve

the object of family planning.

<p id="p_23">          Having held that the family planning is a part of National Public

Policy and the State to achieve this object can grant incentives and also

put restrictions upon the benefits which have to flow to the employees.

Our answer to the first question is in favour of the State. Now we have to

examine as to whether the mechanism to achieve this objective is in

place, in other words Note 4 to Rule 8.127 of the Punjab Civil Services

Rules Volume I Part I is in conflict or is in consonance with the

provisions of the Act.

to the period of woman's actual absence extending up to six weeks

the Act, the Government has powers to make Rules in respect of any

other matter which is to be or may be prescribed. <a href="/doc/1710455/" id="a_18">Section 27</a> of the Act

specifically states that there is no fetter on the Rule making power of the

organization so long as it is more beneficial to an employee than the one

envisaged in the Act. However, all rules which are inconsistent with the

<p id="p_28">          <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_20">The Act</a> nowhere restricts the benefit of payment of maternity

Civil Services Rules Volume I Part I, the State Government intended to

achieve a laudable object but such an object cannot be given effect to

till the establishments of the Government are amenable to the Act.

undertake issues which have become academic only.

State. Classification made on the basis of a number of children is

justifiable, however, question No.2 is answered in favour of the petitioner

as the rules framed by the Government are not in conformity with the

Act. Hence, till an amendment is carried in the Act, the rules framed by

the State Government will not curtail the benefit which had accrued to

the petitioner in view of the Act. Answers to questions No.3 and 4 are

not necessary for the present controversy, hence, are left open to be

answered in future as and when need arise.
