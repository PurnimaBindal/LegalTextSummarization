<p id="p_1">Heard on: 23 &amp; 24.11.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Judgment on: 24.11.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The Court: - The petitioner in this writ petition dated March 31, 2003 is
aggrieved by the award of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, Kolkata
dated January 9, 2003, Annexure P 9 at pp.122- 170.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      By an order dated December 27, 1980, Annexure P3 at p.30, the central
government referred an existing industrial dispute between the management of
Food Corporation of India and their workmen.                The reference was made in
exercise of power conferred by s.10(1)(d) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_2">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.
The dispute specified in the schedule to the order was as follows: -
</p><p id="p_5">      "Whether the action of the Joint Manager (Port Operation), Food
Corporation of India, Calcutta in dismissing Shri Niranjan Das Gupta and forty-
nine other workmen from service as per office order dated 28.3.1974 is legal,
proper and justified? If not, to what relief are the workmen entitled?"
</p>
<p id="p_6">      On receipt of notice from the tribunal the parties filed their respective
written statements.     In its written statement, Annexure P5 at pp.46-60, the
corporation has stated as follows. "The Corpn. craves leave to refer to and rely
upon material documents to establish the bonafide of the action taken by the
Corporation as well as to unfold the frivolity of the baseless allegations made by
Union. The Corporation craves leave to adduce evidence to establish the charges
against the concerned employees." (para.13). "The case of concerned workman is
not that of retrenchment but dismissal consequent upon commission of gross
 misconduct of getting appointment in a collusive manner without having
requisite competence." (para.19). "The concerned cases are not of retrenchment
but dismissal effected after thorough investigation into the matter and hence the
allegations regarding irregularity or motive do not arise." (para.20). "The
provisions of Se.25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, have not applicability
inasmuch as no retrenchment of the 50 workmen was effected and the
contention on this score is misconceived. There was no perverse motive behind
the dismissal from service." (para.21). "It is a case of dismissal for the
misconduct or securing employment (a) dishonestly (b) in a collusive way being
fully conscious of (c) inefficiency and incompetency." (para.21). "The Corporation,
therefore, submits that the learned Tribunal be pleased to hold in answer to the
issue under Reference that the Reference is not maintainable and in any event,
the dismissals of the workmen in the facts and circumstances of the case are
justified." (para.28).
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Before the tribunal the corporation raised the following four preliminary
points:-
</p><p id="p_8">      "(i) This second reference is bad in law because the Food Corporation of
India was not given any opportunity to be heard before making the order of
reference; (ii) The Association in question which is espousing the cause of the
concerned 50 workmen has no locus standi and no representative character and
hence it should be held that no industrial dispute exists; (iii) No dispute having
been raised by the Association with the management, the reference should be
held to be illegal; and (iv) The present reference being a delayed reference having
been made in 1981 in respect of the dispute of concerned workman in 1974
should be held to be invalid."
</p>
<p id="p_9">      By an order dated March 11, 1986, Annexure P 6 at p.61, the tribunal held
that there was no merit in the preliminary points. The corporation's writ petition,
registered as C.O. No.12456 (W) of 1986, challenging the order of the tribunal
dated March 11, 1986 was allowed by a judgment and order dated January 30,
1996, Annexure P7 at p.71. The petitioner's appeal, FMAT No.729 of 1996, was
allowed by the judgment and order dated August 4, 2000, Annexure P8 at p.108,
of the division bench that said as follows:-
</p><p id="p_10">       "In the instant case an allegation has been made that a fraud had been
practised in the matter of appointment by the appellant. It is, therefore, not a
case where the services had been terminated on the ground that the services of
the petitioners were not found to be satisfactory during the probationary period.
In fact in <a href="/doc/357605/" id="a_3">V.P. Ahuja -vs- State of Punjab &amp; Ors</a>., reported in AIR 2000 SC 1080
and <a href="/doc/1727116/" id="a_4">Dipti Prakash Banerjee -vs- Satvendra Nath Bose National Centre</a> for Basic
Sciences, Calcutta, reported in 1999 (3) SCC 60: AIR 1999 SC 983 : 1999 (1) JT
(SC) 396 : (1999 AIR SCW 605 : 1999 Lab IC 1114), it has clearly been held that
when the order is stigmatic, a probationer has also a right to be heard, and once
an order of dismissal is passed on such ground, the same can be questioned."
</p><p id="p_11">      Thereupon the tribunal recorded evidence adduced by the parties and
passed the impugned award recording in para.15 as follows: -
</p><p id="p_12">      "15......It has been contended on behalf of the management that the
termination, therefore, cannot be termed as stigmatic and it is a termination
simpliciter and, therefore, there is nothing illegal in the order of termination. The
wordings of the termination orders, Ext.M-3 series are very clear in which it has
been stated that the person concerned on probation is discharged from service
with effect from the forenoon of 1st. April, 1974 and in lieu of 30 days notice, he
will be paid one month's pay under sub-regulation 3(b) of Regulation 15 of the
Food Corporation of India Staff Regulation, 1971 as amended upto date. It has,
therefore, been submitted on behalf of the management that when the terms of
appointment were very clear that the appointments were on temporary basis
against temporary posts, terminable at any time and that the candidates were to
be treated on probation for a period of one year and also that the candidates were
supposed to appear for re-test, if required by the management, it goes to show
that the re-tests were taken fully in accordance with the terms and conditions of
service of these workmen. The management did not consider to remove them by
attaching any stigma to them, though there were complaints earlier against them
and after taking re-test, terminated the service of the employees who were not
found fit. Therefore, it is clearly a case of termination simpliciter and it cannot
be treated as either dismissal or retrenchment under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_5">Section 2(00)</a> of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947."
</p>
<p id="p_13">      The conclusion of the tribunal recorded in para.16 of the award is as
follows: -
</p><p id="p_14">       "16.In such a circumstance, the removal of the workman concerned from
service cannot be termed as illegal and invalid. The reference is decided
accordingly and it is held that the workmen concerned are not entitled to any
relief what-so-ever.",

      The corporation is contesting the writ petition and it has filed an opposition
dated June 25, 2003. In para.13 of the opposition, it has stated as follows: -
</p><p id="p_15">      "...........so it was a case dismissal for their inefficiency and incompetency."
       Mr Dutta, counsel for the petitioner, has argued that when the dispute
referred to the tribunal was whether the dismissal of the workmen concerned by
the corporation was justified, the tribunal has examined a case whether it was a
case of dismissal or termination simpliciter, and has held that the removal of the
workmen from services was justified. His submission is that in the face of the
dispute specified in the schedule to the order of reference and the cases of the
parties stated in their respective written statements, the tribunal had no
jurisdiction to examine a third case whether it was a case of dismissal or
termination simpliciter.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      He has relied on the provisions of s.10(4) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_6">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,
1947 and the decisions in <a href="/doc/1718782/" id="a_7">Shankar Chakravarti v. Britannia Biscuit Co. &amp; Anr</a>.,

</p>
<p id="p_17">      Senior counsel for the corporation has argued that since the workmen
whose services were terminated had obtained employment by practising fraud
and fraud unravells everything, in the facts and circumstances of the case
appearing from the evidence adduced by parties, the tribunal was fully justified
in concluding that it was not a case of dismissal casting stigma, but a case of
termination simpliciter, and hence the removal of the workmen from the services
of the corporation was justified. Resuming arguments, Mr Chattopadhyay, junior
counsel for the corporation, has carried them on saying that in view of the
evidence, the tribunal was authorised to reach a conclusion that it was not a
case of dismissal of the workmen from the services of the corporation, but a case
of termination simpliciter.
</p><p id="p_18">       The provisions of s.10(4) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_13">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 are as
follows: -
</p><p id="p_19">       "(4) Where in an order referring an industrial dispute to a Labour
Court,Tribunal or National Tribunal under this section or in a subsequent order,
the appropirate Government has specified the points of dispute for adjudication,
the Labour Court or the Tribunal or the National Tribunal, as the case may be,
shall confine its adjudication to those points and matters incidental thereto."
</p>
<p id="p_20">      <a href="/doc/1718782/" id="a_14">In Shankar Chakravarti v. Britannia Biscuit Co. &amp; Anr</a>., 1979 (II) L.L.J.
194 (SC) their Lordships of the Supreme Court held (para.31): -
</p><p id="p_21">       "It is well settled that allegation which is not pleaded, even if there is
evidence in support of it, cannot be examined because the other side has no
notice of it and if entertained it would tantamount to granting an unfair
advantage to the first mentioned party. We are not unmidful of the fact that
pleadings before such bodies have not to be read strictly, but it is equally true
that the pleadings must be such as to give sufficient notice to the other party of
the case it is called upon to meet. This view expressed in Tin Printers 9 (<a href="/doc/795659/" id="a_15">P) Ltd. v.
Industrial Tribunal</a>, [1967-II L.L.J. 667]; at p.680 commands to us. The rules of
fair play demand where a party seeks to establish a contention which if proved
would be sufficient to deny relief to the opposite side, such a contention has to be
specifically pleaded and then proved. But if there is no pleading there is no
question of proving something which is not pleaded. This is very elementary."

<p id="p_22">      <a href="/doc/483734/" id="a_16">In Pottery Mazdoor Panchayat v. The Perfect Pottery Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., 1979
Lab.I.C. 827 (SC) it was held (para.11) by the Supreme Court: -
</p><p id="p_23">      "Having heard a closely thought out argument made by Mr. Gupta on
behalf of the appellant, we are of the opinion that the High Court is right in its
view on the first question. The very terms of the references show that the point
of dispute between the parties was not the fact of the closure of its business by
the respondent but the propriety and justification of the respondent's decision to
close down the business. That is why the references were expressed to say
whether the proposed closure of the business was proper and justified. In other
words, by the references the Tribunals were not called upon by the Government
to adjudicate upon the question as to whether there was in fact a closure of
business or whether under the pretence of closing the business the workers were
locked out by the management. The references being limited to the narrow
question as to whether the closure was proper and justified, the Tribunals by the
very terms of the references, had no jurisdiction to go behind the fact of closure
and inquire into the question whether the business was in fact closed down by
the management."
</p><p id="p_24">       <a href="/doc/1305957/" id="a_17">In Mahendra L. Jain &amp; Ors. v. Indore Development Authority &amp; Ors</a>., AIR
2005 SC 1252 their Lordships of the Supreme Court held (para.34): -
</p><p id="p_25">      "..........Furthermore the Labour Court having derived its jurisdiction from
the reference made by the State Government, it was bound to act within the four
corners thereof. It could not enlarge the scope of the reference nor could deviate
therefrom. A demand which was not raised at the time of raising the dispute
could not have been gone into by the Labour Court being not the subject-matter
thereof."
</p>
<p id="p_26">      In Workmen rep. by South Eastern Roadways Workmen's <a href="/doc/1202078/" id="a_18">Union &amp; Anr. v.
VIII Industrial Tribunal &amp; Ors</a>., 2005 (II)LLJ 1020 (Cal)(DB) their Lordships of the
division bench held (para.8):-
</p><p id="p_27">       "This question cannot be gone into in view of the scope and ambit of
reference, which was the only question so far as closure is concerned as to
whether it was real or not. Whether the closure was justified or closure was
invalid was not the question, which was referred to. The Tribunal while
adjudicating the dispute cannot travel beyond the scope of the reference. It is
only the question or the dispute that has been referred to the Tribunal by the
Government the Tribunal has to confine its jurisdiction. The jurisdiction to
adjudicate is conferred on the Tribunal only by reason of an order of reference
under <a href="/doc/760439/" id="a_19">Section 10(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Therefore, neither the
Tribunal nor the Court can consider issues, which are not referred to the
Tribunal."
</p>
<p id="p_28">      <a href="/doc/1283123/" id="a_20">In State Bank of Bikaner &amp; Jaipur v. Om Prakash Sharma</a>, 2006 (II) LLJ
1046 (SC) their Lordships of the Supreme Court held (para.14):-
</p><p id="p_29">        "In the instant case, the Award of the Labour Court suffers from an
illegality, which appears on the face of the record. The jurisdiction of the Labour
Court emanated from the order of the reference. It could not have passed an
order going beyond the terms of the reference. While passing the Award, if the
Labour Court exceeds its jurisdiction, the Award must be held to be suffering
from a jurisdictional error. It was capable of being corrected by the High Court in
exercise of its power of judicial review. The High Court, therefore, clearly fell in
error in refusing to exercise its jurisdiction."
</p>
<p id="p_30">      <a href="/doc/344776/" id="a_21">In Sinclairs Hotels &amp; Transportation Limited &amp; Anr. v. State of West Bengal
&amp; Ors</a>., 2008 (2) CHN 858 (Cal)(DB) their Lordships of the division bench held
(para.10):-
</p><p id="p_31">      "We have gone through the judgments referred to above. The principle of
law laid down by the Hon'ble Court is settled principle of law. The ratio of all the
judgments supports the contention of the learned Advocate of the
 respondent/workman that the Industrial Tribunal cannot travel beyond the
ambit and scope of the issues referred to it for adjudication."
</p>
<p id="p_32">      It is, therefore, evident that in view of the provisions of s.10(4) of the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_22">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 and the law declared by the Supreme Court, a
tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate any point of dispute other than the
ones, and matters incidental thereto, specified in the order of reference. Here the
dispute referred was whether the dismissal of the workmen by the management
of the corporation was justified. Hence the tribunal was to proceed on the basis
that the corporation had dismissed the workmen from services. As a matter of
fact, the corporation also stated a case in its written statement in justification of
the dismissal of the workmen.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      Whether the actions of the corporation amounted to termination simpliciter
or dismissal of the workmen was not a point of dispute referred to the tribunal.
At the time of arguments the corporation, however, sought to impress upon the
tribunal that its actions actually amounted to termination simpliciter, not
dismissal for misconduct. It is evident that the tribunal was swayed by the
arguments, and that, consequently, it adjudicated a dispute that was never
referred to it. The tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by adjudicating a dispute that
was not referred to it, and answering a question that it was not supposed to
answer.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      I repeat that in view of the point of dispute specified in the schedule to the
order of reference that was not challenged by the corporation contending that the
appropriate government referred a point of dispute that could not be referred on
the facts of the case, the tribunal was required to adjudicate whether the
dismissal of the workmen was justified; and if not, then to what relief the
workmen were entitled. I am, therefore, of the view that the impugned award
cannot be sustained, and that the tribunal should be directed to adjudicate only
the point of dispute referred to it on the basis of the evidence already adduced by
the parties.
</p><p id="p_35">       For these reasons, I allow the writ petition, set aside the impugned award
and direct the tribunal to adjudicate only the point of dispute referred to it on the
basis of the evidence already recorded, but after giving the parties fresh
opportunity of hearing, and make a fresh award within six weeks from the date of
communication of this order. There shall be no order for costs.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      Urgent certified xerox of this order, if applied for, shall be supplied to the
parties within three days from the date of receipt of the file by the section
concerned.
