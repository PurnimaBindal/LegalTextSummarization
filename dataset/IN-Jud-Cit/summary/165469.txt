The appellant, a limited liability company incorporated under the English Companies Act, has a subsidiary in India called Ruston Hornsby (India) Ltd.
The appellee, Ruston Hornsby (India) Ltd., was sued by the appellant for infringement of its trademark "RUSTAM INDIA."
However, the High Court held that the use of the words "RUSTAM INDIA" was not an infringement because the plaintiff's engines were manufactured in England and the defendant's engines were manufactured in India.
Whether the use of the words "RUSTAM INDIA" by the appellee constituted trademark infringement and whether the appellant is entitled to an injunction and damages.
The distinction between an infringement action and a passing off action is important.
The action for infringement is a statutory right.
The common law courts, however, adhered to their view that fraud was necessary until the Judicature Acts, by fusing law and equity, gave the equitable rule the victory over the common law rule.
The High Court held that the use of the words "RUSTAM INDIA" by the appellee did not constitute trademark infringement.
The appellant has not appealed this decision and, therefore, cannot challenge it.
However, the appellant is entitled to an injunction restraining the appellee and its agents from selling or advertising for sale of engines, machinery or accessories under the name of "RUSTAM" or "RUSTAM INDIA."
The appellant is also granted a decree for nominal damages to the extent of Rs 100.
The appeal is allowed with costs to the above extent.
