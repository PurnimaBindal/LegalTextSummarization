<p id="p_1">    Accused in C.C.4/2010 of Principal Sessions

Court,   Ernakulam    are    the   petitioners.

Crl.M.C.2317/2010 is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of

Code  of  Criminal   Procedure  to  quash   the

cognizance taken for the offence under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">section

499</a> punishable under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_3">sections 500</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_4">120B</a>, <a href="/doc/1820068/" id="a_5">501</a>

and <a href="/doc/1495647/" id="a_6">502</a> of Indian Penal Code, on    Annexure II

complaint filed by the Public Prosecutor under

<a href="/doc/822867/" id="a_7">section 199(2)</a> of  Code of Criminal Procedure.

Crl.M.C.2493/2010 is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_8">section 482</a> of

Code of Criminal Procedure to declare that

Annexure  VII  order  granting    sanction  for

institution of the complaint, taken cognizance

in C.C.4/2010 is insufficient and invalid and

therefore to quash the proceedings as there is

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010        2

no sanction as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1901955/" id="a_9">section 199(4)</a> of

Code of Criminal Procedure.             Public Prosecutor

filed       Annexure      II   complaint   alleging   that

petitioners          published  articles   in   Samakalika

Malayalam         Varika    which   contained   defamatory

statements        against   the  Minister  of  Industries,

Government of Kerala.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.     Learned      counsel   appearing   for    the

petitioners and learned Additional Director General

of Prosecution were heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.         Learned    counsel  appearing   for   the

petitioners, based on the order taking cognizance

by      Sessions Judge, Ernakulam dated 22.4.2010,

argued that learned Sessions Judge has not applied

his mind as only the complaint was perused and not

the defamatory articles.         It was argued that    the

question whether the complaint was filed within the

statutory period was also not properly taken into

consideration and in any case the order of sanction

was not perused as the sanction is to prosecute

only on one article. Learned           counsel  relied on

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010         3

the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/223504/" id="a_10">Indian Express

Newspapers (Bombay) Private Ltd and Others v. Union

of    India     and     others</a>  (1985) 1   SCC  641),  <a href="/doc/304068/" id="a_11">Life

Insurance Corporation of India v. Prof.Manubhai D.

Shah</a> (AIR 1993 SC 171), <a href="/doc/729621/" id="a_12">Ramoji Rao, Chairman Ramoji

Group of Companies and another v. State of A.P</a>.

(2006) 8 SCC 321), <a href="/doc/1845526/" id="a_13">P.C. Joshi and another v. The

State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (AIR 1961 SC 387), <a href="/doc/1833908/" id="a_14">Gour

Chandra Rout and          another v. The Public Prosecutor,

Cuttack</a> (AIR 1963 SC 1198) and argued that          freedom

of the press was not taken into consideration and

if    the      articles     were  properly  read,   learned

Sessions Judge would have found that it was only a

fair     criticism of the conduct of the Minister and

not an attempt to defame the          Minister and  learned

Sessions Judge should not have taken cognizance.

Learned counsel also submitted that the sanction

order does not show that the authority granting

sanction perused the entire articles stated in the

complaint and instead it is clear that only one

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010        4

article was perused and in such circumstances based

on the         sanction order, learned Sessions Judge

should not have taken cognizance of the offence

against all the accused.          Relying on the document

produced       by    the  petitioners to  show  that the

concerned weekly was despatched on 19.10.2009,        it

was argued that if that be so, the complaint was

not fild within the period of six months from th

date of publication as provided under <a href="/doc/27007/" id="a_15">section 199</a>

and therefore the cognizance taken was bad.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.     Learned    Additional  Director  General of

Prosecution relied on the decision of the Apex

Court in <a href="/doc/49086800/" id="a_16">Major Som Nath v. Union of India</a> (AIR 1971

SC    1910),      <a href="/doc/1386753/" id="a_17">Shatrughna   Prasad  Sinha  v.  Rajbhau

Surajmal Rathi</a> and Others (1996 SCC (Cri) 1310),

<a href="/doc/1946272/" id="a_18">Balraj Khanna v. Moti Ram</a> (AIR 1971 SC 1389),

<a href="/doc/1506133/" id="a_19">Sewakram Sobhani v. R.K.Karanjia, Chief Editor,

Weekly Blitz and others</a> (1981) 3 SCC 208) and

argued      that     there is   no  reason to  quash  the

cognizance taken. It was           pointed out that   as

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010         5

provided under <a href="/doc/1304423/" id="a_20">section 237</a> of Code of Criminal

Procedure, a Sessions court taking              cognizance

under sub section          (2) of <a href="/doc/27007/" id="a_21">Section 199</a>,  shall try

the case          in accordance with the procedure for

trial and warrant cases instituted otherwise than

on    a    police       report  before  a  Magistrate and

therefore         petitioners     could  raise   all  the

contentions raised herein and seek an order of

discharge under <a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_22">section 245(1)</a> of Code of Criminal

Procedure.        Learned Additional Director General of

Prosecution also pointed out that the sanction

order     shows      that     entire  weekly as  such  was

examined and the            authority granted sanction to

prosecute all the accused as sought for in the

complaint and therefore the order of sanction to

prosecute all the accused as sought and hence it is

valid.       It is also pointed out that the complaint

was filed within the period of six months as

provided under sub section (5) of <a href="/doc/27007/" id="a_23">Section 199</a> and

in    such     circumstances     there  is  no  reason to

interfere with the order.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.      On hearing the learned counsel and the

learned Additional Director General of Prosecution,

I do not find that it is for this court to analyse

the     articles        to find   whether  they   contain

defamatory statements or not. So also the validity

of the sanction order or the question whether the

complaint was filed within the period of limitation

are      not to be decided in this petition under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_24">section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The

order taking cognizance        show that learned Sessions

Judge     had     taken   all  the  relevant  facts  into

consideration and applied his mind and had taken

cognizance of the offences having satisfied that

there exists a prima facie case to proceed further.

Petitioners         are   entitled  to   raise  all   the

contentions including the question whether            the

articles contain any         defamatory materials or not

and if so       whether the accused are to be prosecuted

and whether the order of sanction is sufficient to

prosecute all the accused and whether the complaint

was filed within the period provided under sub

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010       7

section (5) of <a href="/doc/27007/" id="a_25">Section 199</a> and seek an order of

discharge as provided under <a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_26">section 245(1)</a> of Code

of Criminal Procedure. As the learned Sessions

Judge has to try the case in accordance with       the

procedure for trial of warrant cases otherwise than

on police report, necessarily in the presence of

the petitioners, witnesses are to be examined as

provided under <a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_27">section 244</a>.         Petitioners are at

liberty to cross -examine or not to cross examine

the witnesses at that stage.        After recording the

evidence of the complainant,         petitioners could

very well seek an order of discharge under <a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_28">section

245(1)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure, raising all

the contentions raised herein.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6. Learned counsel then submitted that presence

of the petitioners may not be insisted for the

purpose of claiming an order of discharge under

<a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_29">section 245(1)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure.       If

petitioners file an application under <a href="/doc/1245435/" id="a_30">section 205</a>

of Code of Criminal Procedure to dispense with

their      personal     presence, for the  purpose   of

Crl.M.C.2317 &amp; 2493/2010    8

recording the evidence of the complainant      under

<a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_31">section 244</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure and to

seek an order of discharge under <a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_32">section 245(1)</a>,

learned Sessions Judge shall not insist for their

presence.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Petitions are disposed accordingly.
