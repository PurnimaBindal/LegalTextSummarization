</p><p id="p_3">                               Brief facts of the case are that marriage between petitioner and

                  respondent was solemnized on 22.04.2004.               After the marriage,

                  petitioner and respondent started residing at Delhi as husband and wife

                  and from the wedlock a daughter, namely, Gosmi was born on

                  24.12.2006 at Ambala City.           It is alleged that respondent again

                  conceived a child and thereafter misunderstanding appears to have arisen

                  between the parties. As per the allegations of the respondent, petitioner

                  and his family started harassing the respondent.            As a result of

                  misunderstanding, respondent along with the child left the matrimonial

                  home of the petitioner and started residing with her parents. Thereafter

                  the respondent filed a petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_3">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage

                  Act (hereinafter referred to as 'the HMA') in the Court of District Judge,

                  Family Court, Ambala. Along with the petition an application under

                  Section 24 of the HMA was filed. The petitioner appeared and filed

                  reply to the said application.       It is pertinent to mention here that

                  petitioner is B.Com, MBA and respondent is M.Com, MBA (PGDBM).

                  the application under Section 24 of the HMA, respondent has pleaded

                  that she has to maintain herself and her minor daughter and prayed for

                  grant of maintenance pendente lite at the rate of ` 15,000/- per month

                  besides litigation expenses to the tune of ` 22,000/-. In reply to the said

                  application, petitioner pleaded that the application is not maintainable as

                  respondent-wife is getting entire maintenance for herself and the child

                  under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_4">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. She is a well-educated and is alleged to be

                  working with Ashirwaad Institute, Chandigarh, prior to marriage and

                  allegedly even now imparting tuition and earning enough to maintain

                  herself and prayed that application should be dismissed. The Family

                  Court, after considering the material on record has come to the

                  conclusion that the respondent-wife and minor daughter are residing

                  together at Ambala and awarded maintenance pendente lite as well as

                  litigation expenses as aforesaid.         It has also been ordered that

                  maintenance awarded under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_5">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. should be adjusted.

<p id="p_5">                               Petitioner in person vehemently contended that application

                  award of maintenance awarded under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_8">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. was concealed

                  from learned trial court and as such respondent is not entitled to any

                  relief. In support of his contention petitioner relied upon <a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_9">MCD vs. State

                  of Delhi</a>, 2005 SCC (Crl.) 1322 and <a href="/doc/1770523/" id="a_10">S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P)

                  Ltd. vs. State of Bihar and others</a>, (2004) 7 SCC 166. Petitioner further

                  contended that respondent is a well-educated lady and she was earlier

                  working and now she is imparting tuitions and doing other works and

                  earning handsome amount; as such she is not entitled to any

                  maintenance.   It is further argued by the petitioner that even if the

                  respondent chooses not to work out of her own sweet will, she cannot be

                  permitted to take advantage of her own deeds. It is well-established

                  maxim of Anglo Saxon jurisprudence that no person can be allowed to

                  incapacitate himself or herself.     Petitioner further contended that

                  although respondent is saying that she has no source of income and is

                  unable to maintain herself but she is filing and contesting as many as ten

                  cases and as such it cannot be believed that she is not earning anything.

                  Petitioner further submitted that under <a href="/doc/81155499/" id="a_11">Section 12</a> of the Legal Services

                  Authorities Act, 1987, women are entitled to free legal aid and can seek

                  the help from the legal aid service and further argued that the conduct of

                  respondent is such that she does not deserve any maintenance pendente

                  lite. Petitioner further contended that petition under Section 13 of the

                  HMA is lingering on since long and unwanted adjournments have been

                  given and matter should have been decided within the stipulated period.

                               On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent

                  vehemently opposed the contentions raised by the petitioner and

                  submitted that award of maintenance under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_12">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. does not

                  bar filing of application under personal laws, including proceedings

                  under Section 13 of the HMA. The application under Section 24 of the

                  HMA is maintainable and it is only for a limited period i.e. it continues

                  only during the pendency of the proceedings under the HMA. Learned

                  counsel for the respondent further contended that before marriage even if

                  the respondent was employed at Ashirwad Institute, Chandigarh but after

                  marriage she had to leave Chandigarh and started residing with the

                  petitioner at Delhi and it was at the instance of the petitioner that

                  respondent left her job as she was not permitted to continue with her

                  erstwhile job at Chandigarh. Petitioner is a qualified person and was

                  working with a firm. The spirit behind Section 24 of the HMA is to

                  boost the morale of the victim spouse with enough strength to fight the

                  unequal battle with the dominating spouse. The basic purpose is to

                  provide immediate financial assistance to save the wife from destitution.

                  Learned counsel for the respondent further contended that even the

                  petitioner is not paying the maintenance awarded under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_13">Section 125</a>

                  Cr.P.C. and is harassing the respondent.

                  Section 24 of the HMA is not maintainable is concerned, the same is

                  mis-conceived. The contention of the petitioner that respondent is not

                  entitled to claim maintenance pendente lite owing to proceedings under

                  <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_14">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C., is erroneous. Although order has been passed in

                  the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_15">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. but the petitioner is not

                  paying the maintenance regularly rather unnecessarily dragging the

                  respondent to the courts of law. Admittedly the right of the wife and the

                  minor child to claim maintenance is an incidence of status of matrimony.

                  The relationship of husband and wife is admitted. The spouse is entitled

                  to maintenance according to the circumstances of the case and keeping

                  in view the source of income of either of the spouse. Husband is bound

                  to maintain wife and the children specially when the wife is not having

                  any source of income. It is pertinent to mention that right conferred

                  under Section 24 of the HMA is in the nature of a special right arising on

                  initiation of proceedings under the HMA and during the pendency of the

                  proceedings by one or the other party to the marriage. In exercise of

                  right under Section 24 of the HMA either husband or the wife, as the

                  case may be, can seek an order for payment of expenses of the

                  proceedings and a monthly sum sufficient for his or her support. Thus it

                  is clear that the right under Section 24 of the HMA is not made available

                  generally to the parties to the marriage. The right is conferred under the

                  specific Section of the HMA and is in the nature of statutory right.

                  with the hope and expectation that she would get quick and speedier

                  relief in those proceedings by way of maintenance for herself and the

                  child. Initiation of proceedings under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_17">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. and Section

                  24 of the HMA, at the best, can be said to be two different modes for

                  maintenance which are statutorily conferred under the HMA.            The

                  purpose behind Section 24 of the HMA is that the dominating party to

                  the matrimonial dispute should not take undue and unfair advantage of

                  vulnerable position of other spouse. The object behind Section 24 of the

                  HMA makes it clear that the enforcement of right under any other

                  provision of law will not defeat the right of the aggrieved party; as such

                  the contention cannot be sustained.    Maintenance under Section 24 of

                  the HMA is a statutory right. This Court in <a href="/doc/1085135/" id="a_18">Surjit Kaur vs. Tirath

                  maintenance under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_24">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C., even if she had been allowed

                  maintenance under Section 24 of the HMA. There is no concealment of

                  the 125 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.P.C</a>. proceedings by the respondent in application under

                  Section 24 of the HMA. Once the petitioner is a party, he is fully aware

                  of the facts. The Family court has already mentioned that maintenance

                  awarded under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_26">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. shall be adjusted towards

                  maintenance granted under Section 24 of the HMA.

</p><p id="p_8">                               Further contention of the petitioner is that respondent is in a

                  position to litigate as a number of cases are pending and besides this, she

                  can get the help of legal aid advocate. So far as the pendency of cases

                  and defending the same is concerned, the destitute respondent-wife has

                  been unnecessarily subjected to litigation. Section 24 of the HMA and

                  <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_27">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. are in the nature of welfare and social security

                  legislation to avoid the legal battle waged by the dominating spouse.

                  Therefore, so far as this contention is concerned, respondent has been

                  compelled to defend the litigation by the circumstances, which are

                  apparently created by the petitioner and it will be ultimately decided by

                  the trial court after perusal of the evidence of both the parties. It is not

                  necessary that legal aid counsel should be given as a matter of right or

                  party should go for that. The party has right to choose the counsel

                  according to his/her choice. In view of this, this contention is also not

                  acceptable and is, thus, rejected.

                  Civil Revision No.1767 of 2013


                               So far as the contention of the petitioner that respondent is

                  M.Com, MBA is concerned, admittedly she is not working. Earlier she

                  was working and she had left the job because the petitioner started

                  residing at Delhi and there is a long distance between Delhi and

                  Chandigarh.       It appears that with a purpose to fulfil the marital

                  obligations she had left the job at the instance of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_10">                               It would be appropriate to mention here that while awarding

                  maintenance pendente lite various factors are taken into account; such as

                  status of the parties, reasonable need of the claimant, income and

                  property of the claimant, number of persons to be maintained, liability, if

                  any. Admittedly, in the present case, petitioner was getting sufficient

                  amount of ` 35,000/- per month in the year 2006. With the passage of

                  time and experience certainly petitioner will be having much more pay

                  which petitioner has intentionally withheld and not brought on record to

                  show his real income. In such circumstances guess work can be made by

                  the court.       Family Court after taking into consideration all the

                  circumstances has passed the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_11">                               I have perused the judgments referred to by the petitioner. As

                  aforesaid, various factors are taken into account before awarding

                  maintenance.       Maintenance pendente lite is a question which is

                  determined in the light of particular facts and circumstances of the case

                  and the rule is very flexible and wider powers are vested in the court to

                  use it with a purpose to do substantive justice.

                  Civil Revision No.1767 of 2013


                               Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/796258/" id="a_28">Smt. Jasbir Kaur Sehgal vs. The

                  District Judge Dehradun and others</a>, AIR 1997 SC 3397 had the

                  occasion to consider the issue regarding award of maintenance under

                  Section 24 of the HMA. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that considering

                  the diverse claims made by the parties one inflating the income and the

                  other suppressing, an element of conjecture and guess work does enter

                  for arriving at the income of the husband. It cannot be done by any

                  mathematical precision. Admittedly the respondent-wife is staying with

                  her parents along with a minor child. In these circumstances, petitioner

                  is obliged under the law and statutes to make payments towards their

                  maintenance which in fact is also his social obligation.

</p><p id="p_12">                               So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the

                  respondent that 38 unnecessary adjournments have been granted in

                  petition under Section 13 of the HMA is concerned, Family Court will

                  look into the same and make an endeavour to dispose of the petition after

                  affording adequate opportunity of leading evidence to the parties, if that

                  is so, at the earliest.
