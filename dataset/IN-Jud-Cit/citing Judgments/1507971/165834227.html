marketing of various hair and skin care products, health foods,

etc. We are concerned in the present case particularly with the

Plaintif's trademark 'NIHAR', which the Plaintif uses, with or

without addition/s to it, for marketing its Amla Hair Oil

products('Nihar range of trademarks'). The Plaintif claims to be

a market leader (by sales in volume). According to the Plaintif,

about 42.6% of Amla Hair Oil sold in the market comes under

the Plaintif's Nihar range of trademarks. The Plaintif's case is

not only that the product, namely, Amla Hair Oil, is marketed

under NIHAR range of trademarks but the bottles in which the

product is sold come in particular size, shape, features,

contours and confguration. It is submitted that these elements

are distinctive and unique to the product marketed by the

Plaintif. It is submitted that the Plaintif has also designed

distinctive labels for NIHAR range of Amla Hair Oil to go with

the particular shape and size of the bottles referred to above.

The Plaintif has obtained registration for the particular label,

which is used on its bottles with the same shape. The Plaintif's

case is that it has acquired great reputation and goodwill in

NIHAR range of products, all of which are Amla Hair Oil. The

reputation and goodwill is not only in the trademark NIHAR,

with or without additional word/s, but also in the distinctive

shape, size and contours of the bottles used for marketing the

goods. The Plaintif's grievance is that the Defendant, who is a

rival manufacturer and marketer of Amla Hair Oil, advertises its

goods in newspapers and other media comparing them with

other rival products, terming them as 'cheap oil' or in Hindi

'sasta tel' which are said to cause hair loss or breakage; the

Defendant thereby disparages these latter products as bad

quality        products.           The   Plaintif's     case      is     that       these

advertisements create an unmistakable impression that the

rival products referred to therein, which are described as

cheap, are the Plaintif's products. It is submitted that the

Plaintif's products are cheaper than the Defendant's. It is

submitted that the distinctive shape, size and contours of the

bottles, in which the Plaintif markets its products, are to be

found in the bottle of 'cheap oil' displayed in the advertisement

and which is said to be harmful to hair, causing hair fall or

breakage. The Plaintif's case is that these advertisements are

issued with a malicious intent to slander or disparage the

Plaintif's NIHAR range of Amla Hair Oil and gain unjustly by

promoting the Defendant's own hair oil by denigrating or

showing          in a poor light the Plaintif's product. The case, in

short, is a case of injurious falsehood and disparagement of

goods.

<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3.                As this Court has noted in its ad-interim order in this

matter passed on 4 December, 2019 and as afrmed by the

Defendant in its afdavit in reply dated 21 January, 2020, the

Defendant does not any more use the original advertisements,

which are complained of in the plaint, but has changed the

shape, size, contours, etc. of the rival bottle of 'cheap oil',

which is now shown in the advertisement for comparison with

the Defendant's product. The Defendant has placed sample

advertisements on record as Exhibits 'A1' and 'A2' to its

afdavit in reply. Rival cases of the parties are, thus, to be

assessed not in the light of the original ofending ads, which

form part of the Plaint, but in the context of the new ads now

proposed by the Defendant as indicated in its afdavit in reply

to the Interim Application.

for the Plaintif, submits that the Hindi words 'sasta tel' or the

English words 'cheap oil' used respectively in Hindi and English

versions of the new advertisements nevertheless suggest a

clear reference to the Plaintif's products. Learned Counsel

submits that the intention of the Defendant was always to

compare its product with the rival product of the Plaintif. In

support of this submission, it is submitted that originally, the

shape, size and contours of the bottle used in the ofending

advertisements for disparaging goods were unmistakably of the

Plaintif's bottles. Learned Counsel submits that 'with prejudice'

ofer made by the Defendant at the time of the ad-interim

application and the suggestion now made in its afdavit in

reply to the Interim Application clearly amount to an admission

on its part that the original bottle used in the disparaging

advertisements was meant to be the Plaintif's bottle. Learned

Counsel also submits that the test reports, which are produced

with the original afdavit of the Defendant (afdavit dated 3

December, 2019), to oppose the ad-interim application, only

indicate tests carried out for comparing the two products, that

is to say, the Plaintif's Amla Hair Oil and Defendant's Amal

Hair Oil. Learned Counsel submits that having regard to the

dates of these test reports, it is apparent that they were

obtained          even       prior     to   the    Plaintif's       complaint       about

disparaging advertising. Learned Counsel submits that this also

underscores            the      Defendant's        intention        to    denigrate      or

disparage the Plaintif's goods in its advertisements.


</p><p id="p_10">5.                I am afraid none of the circumstances cited by Mr.

Tulzapurkar supports his submission in any real sense. Making

of a 'with prejudice' ofer at the ad-interim stage, followed by

adoption and publication of new advertisements, does not

imply any admission on the Defendant's part that the original

product used in the so-called disparaging advertisements was

the Plaintif's product. It may, on the other hand, be suggested

that what this indicates is that the Defendant is not interested

in disparaging any particular product, let alone the Plaintif's

Amla Hair Oil. The shape, size and contours of the bottle of rival

product          shown          for    disparagement           in        the   ofending

advertisements do not matter; they do not seem to be of any

material           importance.          The        sense   conveyed            in      the

advertisement, as submitted by learned Counsel for the

Defendant, may well be of cautioning of discerning purchasers

that there may be products of a cheap variety, assuming that

the word 'cheap' here implies nothing but a product of lesser

price; they, however, may not be good for hair; they may lead

to hair fall or hair breakage. The customer is asked to beware

of these products and informed about the superior quality of

the Defendant's product in comparison. In keeping with this

broad sense, the Defendant has readily ofered to change the

shape, size and contours of the bottle of disparaged product in

the advertisements. The above may be an equally ftting

explanation for the conduct of the Defendant referred to by

learned Counsel for the Plaintif. There is no admission here

that the original product shown in the advertisement for

comparing with the Defendant's product was the Plaintif's

bottle of Amla Hair Oil.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">6.                Even        the      other    circumstance       cited       by      Mr.

Tulzapurkar, namely, the test reports produced with the

afdavit         in    reply       to   the     ad-interim   application        showing

comparison only between the Plaintif's and the Defendant's

rival products, does not support the Plaintif's case. That may

be due to several factors as submitted by Mr. Dhond, learned

Senior Counsel appearing for the Defendant. It may well be



Laxmi                                                                               Pg 7 of

because the Defendant would have anticipated a legal action

on the part of the Plaintif. Indeed, the Defendant had even

proceeded to fle a caveat to protect itself from any such

action. The parties have been in Court already on the basis of

rival promotion campaigns. It may well be that the Defendant

was preparing a ground for defending any such anticipated

action. It is by no means an admission on its part that the idea

behind the advertising campaign was to denigrate or disparage

the Plaintif's goods.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">7.       Mr. Tulzapurkar, alternatively, submits that even if the

product named in the disparaging advertisement may not be

seen as the Plaintif's product, going either by the trademark or

the shape, size or contours of the bottle, so long as the

disparagement is of all products which are cheaper in terms of

price, it is a disparagement of a whole class of goods, namely,

cheaper goods, and in as much as the Plaintif's goods fall

within this class, there is a cause of action unto the Plaintif. Mr.

Dhond counters this submission by suggesting that the word

'cheap' is really used here in the sense of an inferior product

and not necessarily a product of lesser price. Mr. Tulzapurkar


Laxmi                                                                    Pg 8 of

rejoins by submitting that even if the words 'cheap oil', or in

Hindi 'sasta tel', may imply products both of an inferior grade

as suggested by the Defendant as also products of less price as

is the Plaintif's case, the words used are clearly tricky and

capable of conveying the meaning of a cheaper variety of oil in

terms of price to the consumers or the public and if that is so,

it is nothing but a case of disparagement of a whole class of

goods and since the Plaintif's product falls within this class,

there is a cause of action. Learned Counsel relies on the

Supreme Court decision in the case of Lakhanpal National

Ltd. Vs. MRTP Commission1 and a Division Bench decision

of our Court in Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing

Federation Limited Vs. Hindustan Unilever Limited 2 in

support of his submission.

<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">8.                    First of all, this Court cannot persuade itself to

believe that in substance, the impression sought to be

conveyed to an ordinary man on the street or buyer of the

goods in question is that all products of 'Amla Hair Oil', which

are priced lesser than the Plaintif's 'Amla Hair Oil', are inferior

in quality or that they lead to hair fall or hair breakage. That

certainly, in my opinion, is not the impression meant to be

conveyed or is likely to be conveyed to a reasonable man on

the street or an ordinar/y consumer of the subject goods. The

Defendant, of course, as I have noted above, may be said to

have meant to use the words 'cheap oil' or 'sasta tel' as

suggestive of lesser price and not necessarily of inferior quality.

It is, certainly arguable, as Mr. Tulzapurkar suggests, that the

word here conveys both meanings; it may, in fact, in that sense

have been used tongue in cheek; but it, by no means, suggests

that what the advertisement disparages are products of lesser

price as a class. What the advertisement, taken at its plain face

value, conveys is that there could be products which are cheap

(that is, of lesser price), but the consumers better beware -

these might be cheap, not just in terms of price, but even in

terms of quality; these might yet be harmful and lead to

conditions such as hair fall or hair breakage. In comparison, the

Plaintif's products are shown as 'True Amla', that is to say, of a

purer variety. There is no disparagement in this of the whole

range of cheaper (in terms of price) variety of amla hair oil

generally, much less of any one product in particular, or, for


Laxmi                                                                    Pg 10 of

that matter, the Plaintif's amla hair oil. All that this suggests is

that      the      Defendant,          in   its    advertisements,         calls     upon

consumers to pay more attention to quality rather than go

merely by price. The disparagement, in other words, if at all

there is any, is of products, which are 'cheap', not just in terms

of price, but also of quality. It may well be that both senses of

the word 'cheap' or 'sasta' are invoked in the present case to

convey the above. Ambivalence such as this, refected in the

copy, actually lends literary merit or artistic value or adds

punch to the advertisement. There is no suggestion here, as

Mr. Tulzapurkar suggests, that all products of lesser price are

generally inferior, much less that the Plaintif's product in

particular is inferior.

Federation Ltd. (supra) decided by the Division Bench of our

court are entirely distinguishable. That was a case where the

television commercials produced by the defendants claimed

that ice creams marketed by the defendants under its brand

name 'Amul' were produced by using 100% milk, whereas

frozen desserts were manufactured by using vanaspati tel,

which is hydrogenated vegetable oil, considered generally to be

unhealthy in Indian society. It was submitted by the Plaintif

that for preparing its frozen desserts, the Plaintif was not using

vanaspati in its products, but edible vegetable oil. It was the

grievance          of     the     Plaintif that   the   impugned         television

commercials denigrated frozen desserts as a class and on a

misrepresentation that they contained 100% vanaspati. The

Division Bench accepted the plaintif's case, holding that it had

no manner of doubt that the particular TV commercials

complained of had the efect of disparaging frozen desserts in

general and dissuading customers from using them and the

plaintif's product being a frozen dessert, the commercials

amounted to disparagement of the plaintif's product. Whilst

Single Judge of our court (B.R. Gavai, J., as the learned Judge

then was) had referred to the case of Dabur India Ltd.

(supra). In Dabur India Ltd., the sum and substance of the

impugned advertisement was said to evoke the memory of 'Lal

Dant Manjan Powder' marketed by the Plaintif. Though the

product name of the plaintif was not mentioned it it, the red

container and the bottle used in the advertisement was

identical with the one used by the plaintif. The court had

observed in Dabur                      India   Ltd.   that the advertisement

campaign in visual media had an immediate impact on the

minds of viewers as well as possible purchasers of the

deleterious efect of red powder used for cleaning teeth, which

one could identify with the plaintif's product. The court

observed that no one could disparage a class or genre of

products, within which the plaintif's product fell, though the

latter's       product        was      not   specifcally    identifed          for     such

disparagement.               Delhi     High    Court's     decision       in     Reckit

Benckiser (India) Ltd. (supra) was also rendered in the

context of the facts of that case where, though the name of the

soap was not indicated for disparagement, the colours, the

contours and the overall shape of the soap used in the

advertisement clearly evoked the memory of the plaintif's

product and these elements, coupled with the particular colour

of packaging material used by the adversary in its commercial,

gave a clear impression that the bar of soap shown in the

advertisement, going by its particular colour, shape and

contours and the wrapper or packaging used for it, was the

plaintif's soap. The court considered that there could be soaps

of the same colour, soaps of the same shape and soaps

packaged in the same colour wrappers, but the plaintif's was

the only soap with a combination of all three elements, that is

to say, the particular colour (orange), the particular shape

(curved oval) and the particular colour of packaging (green).

The court had, in the premises, no manner of doubt that the

particular bar of soap disparaged in the advertisement referred

to the plaintif's soap and none else. In Annamalayar

Agencies's case, the plaintif's product, namely, "Parachute

Coconut Oil", was bottled in blue colour bottles, whereas the

defendant's product was bottled in green colour bottles. Every

suggestion was made by the defendant in the impugned

advertisement for denigrating the product coming in blue

bottle. In these facts, Madras High Court observed that the

advertisement clearly made a suggestion and sent a message

to television viewers and buyers of coconut oil that blue bottle

products were inferior to the green bottle products, which were

marketed by the defendant and that accordingly, there was a

case of colourable disparagement. The case of Reckitt &amp;

Colman of India Ltd. (supra) decided by Calcutta High Court

also proceeded on a more or less similar footing. The Plaintif's

product in that case, marketed under the trade mark 'Robin

Blue', was disparaged by the defendant in its advertisement,

which used the word 'blue' for disparaging the product. The

Court was of the view that though the word used for depicting

the product was 'Blue', it was difcult to hold that the reference

was not to 'Robin Blue'. The facts of all these cases are clearly

distinguishable from the facts of the present case. The shape,

size, colour or contours of the bottle of disparaged product

shown in the impugned advertisement cannot be said to be

evoking, in any real sense, the memory of the plaintif's

product. Even, for that matter, the reference to 'Cheap Amla

Hair Oil' cannot be said to evoke the memory of the Plaintif's

product. As I have noted above, it is difcult to hold that what

are disparaged in the impugned advertisement are lesser price

products as a class. So also, the Plaintif has not shown at this

prima facie stage that the phrases 'cheap hair oil' or 'sasta tel'

used in the advertisement were indeed an idea associated

solely with the plaintif's product. It is difcult to say, on the

basis of materials produced before the court, that the reference

to 'cheap hair oil' or 'sasta tail' evokes the memory of the

plaintif's hair oil.
