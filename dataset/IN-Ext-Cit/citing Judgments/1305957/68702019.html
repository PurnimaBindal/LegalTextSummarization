HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE CHANDER SHEKHAR

CHANDER SHEKHAR, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.    The petitioner has filed the present petition under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India to set aside and quash the Award dated
07.03.2005 passed by the Presiding Officer, Industrial Tribunal-II, Delhi (in
short, called „the Tribunal‟).
</p><p id="p_2">2.    I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have also gone
through the written synopsis filed by them.
</p><p id="p_3">      The claim of the workmen and written statement of the Management
as noticed by the Tribunal is as follow:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "2. In statement of claim it is submitted that the claimants are
      permanent employees of Hotel Corporation of India Ltd., Chefair
      Flight Catering and are being represented by Hotel Corporation
      of India Karamchari Union. It is submitted that the management
      is having its several units situated at Indira Gandhi International

       Airport, Gurgaon Road, New Delhi. The pay and allowance of
      the claimant have undergone change/revision from time to time
      persuasion of wage negotiation between the management and
      union. It is submitted that there is a settlement on 3.11.2000
      between the management and union to some of the term and
      condition of the service of workmen including the pay and
      allowances and the settlement was duly registered with Govt. of
      NCT of Delhi on 11.5.2001. It is submitted that settlement makes
      a provision for providing up to a maximum of three stagnation
      increments to those employees who are stagnated. The
      management has decided to grant stagnation increment in every
      year of service w.e.f. 1.2.1997 and the same was given for a
      period of one year, however, after one year the management has
      withdrawn the same and the payment made was recovered from
      the employees. It is submitted that the management has failed to
      implement the provision of the settlement and did not grant the
      revised scale w.e.f. 1.2.1997 for every year increment. It is
      submitted that the management has illegally withheld the revised
      pay scales of the workmen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      3.      Management has filed the written statement in which it is
      submitted that the management and union arrived at an amicable
      settlement and signed a memorandum of understanding on
      3.11.2000. The said settlement was registered on 5.11.2000 and
      it came into force w.e.f. 1.2.1997. In the settlement it was
      provided that in case of employee who are stagnated upto a
      maximum of 3 stagnation increment will be given for those who
      reach the maximum of their pay scale. It is submitted that the
      stagnation increment was given to the employees, however, the
      said increment was rectified as per provisions, laid down in
      Regulation No.46 of Employees Service Regulation, which read
      as under:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   "Subject to the general conditions laid down in
            Regulation No.44(1) and the provisions of sub-regulation
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            (ii) hereof, the employees of such categories as may be
            specified by the Corporation for a secretary increment of
            every three year's service from the date on which they reach
            the maximum of their grade."</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             It is submitted that as per General Clause (2) of General
      Conditions of settlement, the union has agreed that all the
      employees will refund any excess amount received by them. The
      employees in their individual capacity also gave their
      undertaking to that effect. It is denied that the management in
      any way has reduced the basic pay of the employees, however,
      appropriate rectifications were made in regard to stagnation
      increment. It is submitted that the management has fully
      implemented the provisions of the agreement and accordingly
      revised pay scale has been implemented. It is submitted that the
      management has not withheld the revised pay scale of the
      workman as alleged."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">3.    Ms. Kritika, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
Tribunal went beyond its jurisdiction after having answered in the negative
that the workmen be given stagnation increment each year, when it further
held that the Management is required to be directed to give three stagnation
increments to the workmen alternatively within six years.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that the Tribunal not
only exceeded its jurisdiction but also went beyond the Reference by stating
that the workmen be given stagnation increment in alternative years within a
span of six years i.e. once in every two years, rather than sticking to answer
whether the workmen are entitled for the stagnation every year or not.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    Learned counsel for the petitioner also relied upon judgments titled as
<a href="/doc/1305957/" id="a_1">Mahendra L. Jain and Others v. Indore Development Authority and
Others</a>, (2005) 1 SCC 639 and <a href="/doc/1283123/" id="a_2">State Bank of Bikaner &amp; Jaipur v. Om
Prakash Sharma</a>, (2006) 5 SCC 123.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner also put reliance upon Clause 46 (i)
of Hotel Corporation of India Employees‟ Service Regulation which reads
as under:-
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                         Page 3 of 15</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "46(i) Subject to the general conditions laid down in regulation
      44(i) into the provisions of sub regulation (ii) hereof, the
      employees of such category as may be specified by the
      corporation for a secondary increment for every 3 years service
      from the date of which they reach the maximum of their grade."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.    Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent has drawn the attention
of this Court towards Memorandum of Settlement dated 03.11.2000
(Annexure -I). Relevant portion of Clause (1) (a) of the Settlement reads as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "In case of employees who are stagnated upto a maximum of 3
      stagnation increments will be given for those who reach the
      maximum of their scales."</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">      Learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that Memorandum
of Settlement makes a provision for providing upto a maximum of three
stagnation increments to those employees who reach at maximum of their
scales. The Management had decided to grant stagnation increment in every
year of service w.e.f. 1.2.1997 and the same was given for a period of one
year, however, after one year, the Management had withdrawn the same
and the payment already made was also recovered from the employees.
</p><p id="p_10">8.    The aforesaid pleadings clearly demonstrate that the case of the
workmen is that they have been given stagnation increment in one year.
However, no case was made out by the parties, more specifically, in the
statement of claim by the workmen/respondent that the stagnation
increment be given in alternate years, i.e. once in every two years or that the
Management was required to give three stagnation increments to the
workmen alternatively within six years. It is also not the case of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                          Page 4 of 15</span>
 respondent on the record that the stagnation increment was given in
alternate years, i.e. once in every two years. The respondent seems to be
aware about the statutory limitation in this behalf in view of the settlement
arrived at between the Management and the Union which was exhibited as
Ex.MW1/1, the relevant portion of which has already been extracted above.
</p><p id="p_11">9.    The Management has relied upon in its written statement before the
Industrial Tribunal, the Regulation No.46 (i) of the Employees‟ Service
Regulation which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "46(i) Subject to the general conditions laid down in
           Regulation No.44(1) and the provisions of sub-regulation
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           (ii) hereof, the employees of such categories as may be
           specified by the Corporation for a secondary increment of
           every three year's service from the date on which they reach
           the maximum of their grade."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">10.   It was also submitted in the written statement that as per general
Clause (ii) of the General Conditions of Settlement, the Union has agreed
that all the employees will refund any excess amount received by them. The
employees in their individual capacity also gave their undertaking to that
effect. It was denied that the Management, in any way, has reduced the
basic pay of the employees; however, appropriate rectifications were made
in regard to stagnation increment. It was also submitted in the written
statement that the Management has fully implemented the provisions of the
agreement and accordingly, the revised pay scale has been implemented.
The Management has not withheld the revised pay scale of the workmen, as
alleged.
</p><p id="p_13">11.   Learned counsels for the parties, on the query of the Court, stated that
the Memorandum of Settlement is still in force. Learned counsel for the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                         Page 5 of 15</span>
 petitioner submitted that the terms and conditions of the settlement stand
implemented and are being complied with. Consequently, the benefits are
being given/ paid by the petitioner to the respondent. Counsel further
submitted that in total, three stagnation increments are being given by the
petitioner to the respondent as per their entitlement after every three years,
i.e., once in every three years, in terms of Regulations 46(i) and 46(ii) of the
Staff Regulation of the Hotel Corporation of India Employees‟ Service
Regulations. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, submitted that
the Management has not paid stagnation increment to the respondent as per
their entitlement. Counsels for the parties submitted that it is/was not stated
anywhere in the pleadings or written submissions or the arguments of the
Management/Petitioner that the case of the Management is that the
stagnation increment is given in alternate years, i.e., once in two years, as
stated in the Impugned Award dated 07.03.2005.
</p><p id="p_14">12.   Now, let me examine the law regarding the Reference and the
constructions thereof.   In the matter of <a href="/doc/483734/" id="a_3">Pottery Mazdoor Panchayat v.
Perfect Pottery Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1979 SC 1356, the Supreme Court has
held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "11. Having heard a closely thought out argument made by Mr.
      Gupta on behalf of the appellant, we are of the opinion that the
      High Court is right in its view on the first question. The very
      terms of the references show that the point of dispute between
      the parties was not the fact of the closure of its business by the
      respondent but the propriety and justification of the
      respondent's decision to close down the business. That is why
      the references were expressed to say whether the proposed
      closure of the business was proper and justified. In other
      words, by the references, the Tribunals were not called upon by
      the Government to adjudicate upon the question as to whether



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                          Page 6 of 15</span>
       there was in fact a closure of business or whether under the
      pretence of closing the business the workers were locked out by
      the management. The references being limited to the narrow
      question as to whether the closure was proper and justified, the
      Tribunals by the very terms of the references, had no
      jurisdiction to go behind the fact of closure and inquire into the
      question whether the business was in fact closed down by the
      management."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">13.   In the matter of <a href="/doc/92021/" id="a_4">Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. The
Workmen and Ors</a>., AIR 1967 SC 469, while dealing with <a href="/doc/506329/" id="a_5">Section 10(4)</a> of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short, called „the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_6">ID Act</a>‟), the Supreme
Court held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "10. Proceeding in the order in which the arguments were
      addressed, we propose to deal with issues 3 and 4 first.
      Under s. 10(1) (d) of the Act, it is open to the appropriate
      Government when it is of opinion that any industrial dispute
      exists to make an order in writing referring "the dispute or any
      matter appearing to be connected with, or relevant to, the
      dispute....... to a Tribunal for adjudication." Under s.
      10(4) "where in an order referring an industrial dispute to a
      Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal under this section
      or in a subsequent order, the appropriate Government has
      specified the points of dispute for adjudication, the Labour
      Court or the Tribunal or the National Tribunal, as the case may
      be, shall confine its adjudication to those points and matters
      incidental thereto."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      11. From the above it therefore appears that while it is open to
      the appropriate Government to refer the dispute or any matter
      appearing to be connected therewith for adjudication, the
      Tribunal must confine its adjudication to the points of dispute
      referred and matters incidental thereto. In other words, the
      Tribunal is not free to enlarge the scope of the dispute referred
      to it but must confine its attention to the points specifically
      mentioned and anything which is incidental thereto. The word



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                         Page 7 of 15</span>
       'incidental' means according to Webster's New World
      Dictionary:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">              "happening or likely to happen as a result of or in
              connection with something more important; being an
              incident; casual; hence, secondary or minor, but
              usually associated:"
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      12. "Something incidental to a dispute" must therefore mean
      something happening as a result of or; in connection with the
      dispute or associated with the dispute. The dispute is the
      fundamental thing while something incidental thereto is an
      adjunct to it. Something incidental, therefore, cannot cut at the
      root of the main thing to which it is an adjunct. In the light of
      the above, it would appear that the third issue was framed on
      the basis that there was a strike and there was a lock-out 'and it
      was for the Industrial Tribunal to examine the facts and
      circumstances leading to the strike and the lockout and to come
      to a decision as to whether one or the other or both were
      justified. On the issue as framed it would not be open to the
      workmen to question the existence of the strike, or, to the
      Management to deny the declaration of a lock-out. The parties
      were to be allowed to lead evidence to show that the strike was
      not justified or that the lock-out was improper. The third issue
      has also a sub-issue, namely, if the lock-out was not legal,
      whether the workmen were entitled to wages for the period of
      the lock-out. Similarly, the fourth issue proceeds on the basis
      that there was a sit-down-strike in the Swatantra Bharat Mills
      on 23-2-1966 and the question referred was as to the propriety
      or legality of the same. It was not for any of the Unions to
      contend on the issues as framed that there was no sit-down
      strike. On their success on the plea of justification of the sit-
      down strike depended their claim to wages for the period of the
      strike.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      .....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      26. So far as the fourth proposition is concerned, Mr. Chari
      argued that the Tribunal had to examine the pleadings of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WP(C) No.5719 of 2006                                         Page 8 of 15</span>
       parties to see whether there was a strike at all. In our opinion,
      the Tribunal must, in any event, look to the pleadings of the
      parties to find out the exact nature of the dispute, because in
      most cases the order of reference is so cryptic that it is
      impossible to cull out therefrom the various points about which
      the parties were at variance leading to the trouble. In this case,
      the order of reference was based on the report of the
      Conciliation Officer and it was certainly open to the
      Management to show that the dispute which had been referred
      was not an industrial dispute at all so as to attract jurisdiction
      under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_7">Industrial Disputes Act</a>. But the parties cannot be
      allowed to go a stage further and contend that the foundation of
      the dispute mentioned in the order of reference was non-
      existent and that the true dispute was something else. Under<a href="/doc/506329/" id="a_8"> s.
      10(4)</a> of the Act it is not competent to the Tribunal to entertain
      such a question."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">14.   Taking into consideration the scope of <a href="/doc/506329/" id="a_9">Section 10(4)</a> of the ID Act and
the construction thereof, the Supreme Court, way back in 1962, in the matter
of <a href="/doc/468790/" id="a_10">Express Newspapers Ltd. v. Their Workers and Staff &amp; Ors</a>., 1962 SC
(1) LLJ 227, held as under:

      of the Industrial Tribunal in dealing with industrial disputes
      referred to it under S.10 is limited by S.10 (4) to the points
      specifically mentioned in the reference and matters incidental
      thereto, the appropriate Government should frame the relevant
      orders of reference carefully and the questions which are
      intended to be tried by the Industrial Tribunal should be so
      worded as to leave no scope for ambiguity or controversy. An
      order of reference hastily drawn or drawn in a casual manner
      often gives rise to unnecessary disputes and thereby prolongs
      the life of industrial adjudication which must always be
      avoided."

<p id="p_17">15.   An examination of <a href="/doc/506329/" id="a_11">Section 10(4)</a> of the ID Act clearly shows that the
Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal is required to confine its adjudication to

 the points of disputes referred and the matter incidental thereto.
</p><p id="p_18">16.   It is not in dispute that the Industrial Tribunal do derive its jurisdiction
from the Reference made by the State Government while being bound to act
within the four corners thereof and it could not and cannot enlarge the scope
of the Reference nor can/could deviate therefrom. A demand which was not
raised at the time of raising the dispute could not have gone into by the
Industrial Tribunal being not the subject matter thereof. The Reference in
this matter was quite specific in the following terms:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">      "Whether workmen who have reached the maximum of their
      pay-scales are entitled to stagnation increment each year upto a
      maximum of three increments as per memo of settlement dtd.

      respect?"

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      "34. We have noticed the provisions of the Act and the Rules.
      No case was made out by the Appellants herein in their
      statements of claim that they became permanent employees in

      a claim was put forward even in the demand raising the
      industrial dispute. Presumably, the Appellants were aware of the
      statutory limitations in this behalf. Furthermore, the Labour
      Court having derived its jurisdiction from the reference made by
      the State Government, it was bound to act within the four-corners
      thereof. It could not enlarge the scope of the reference nor could

 are entitled to stagnation increment each year upto a maximum of three
increments as per the Memorandum of Settlement and secondly, if so, what
directions are necessary in this respect.
</p><p id="p_21">19.   The aforesaid Reference clearly lays down in its terms that in case the
workmen are entitled to stagnation increment each year, then only in that
eventuality, the words „if so‟ indicate, what directions would be necessary in
that respect. The Reference does not in any manner lays down or asks for
what directions, if it is not so held, may be given or are necessary. The word
„if so‟ is in continuity and in conjunction with the first part in terms of the
Reference and cannot be read in isolation or separately; rather it has to be
read as such, in continuity and conjointly. Accordingly, this Court is not
convinced with the findings of the Industrial Tribunal to the extent, as
argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that the stagnation
increment is required to be given in alternate years, i.e. once in every two
years, and on the basis thereof, holding that the Management is required to
be directed to give three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively
within six years, as these findings are incidental to the first part of the
Reference. It is always open to the appropriate Government to refer the
dispute or any matter appearing to be connected therewith for adjudication,
however, the Tribunal must confine its adjudication to the points of dispute
referred and matters incidental thereto. In other words, the Tribunal is not
free to enlarge the scope of the dispute referred to it but must confine its
attention to the points specifically mentioned and anything which is
incidental thereto.
</p><p id="p_22">20.   The case of the workmen is that they be given stagnation increment
every year and the same demand and dispute were raised by them. The

 Government on the basis thereof made the Reference and referred the
dispute for adjudication. The Reference having been limited to the narrow
question as to whether the workmen who have reached the maximum of
their pay-scales are entitled to stagnation increment each year upto a
maximum of three increments as per the Memorandum of Settlement and if
so, what directions are necessary in this respect, the Tribunal by the very
terms of the Reference, had no jurisdiction to go further and enlarge the
Reference by holding that the Management was required to be directed to
give three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively within six

SCC 123, the Supreme Court has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">         "12. In the instant case, the Award of the Labour Court suffers
         from an illegality, which appears on the face of the record. The
         jurisdiction of the Labour Court emanated from the order of the
         reference. It could not have passed an order going beyond the
         terms of the reference. While passing the Award, if the Labour
         Court exceeds its jurisdiction, the Award must be held to be
         suffering from a jurisdictional error. It was capable of being
         corrected by the High Court in exercise of its power of judicial
         review. The High Court, therefore, clearly fell in error in
         refusing to exercise its jurisdiction. The Award and the
         judgment of the High Court, therefore, cannot be sustained.
         Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the
         High Court is set aside. The award is set aside to the extent of
         order of reinstatement with back wages. The writ petition filed
         by the appellant in the High Court is, thus, allowed."

       of jurisdiction, violation of the principles of natural justice or
      any error of law apparent on the face of the record. .....The

      basis of the material before it."

<p id="p_25">23.   In the case titled as <a href="/doc/1029422/" id="a_14">Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radha Krishan</a>, AIR 1964
SC 477, the Supreme Court has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      ".......writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of
      jurisdiction committed by inferior courts or tribunals; these are
      cases where orders are passed by inferior courts or tribunals
      without jurisdiction, or in excess of it, or as a result of failure to
      exercise jurisdictions. A writ can similarly be issued where in
      exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the Court or Tribunal
      acts illegally or improperly, as for instance, it decides a
      question without giving an opportunity to be heard to the party
      affected by the order, or where the procedure adopted in
      dealing with the dispute is opposed to principles of natural
      justice. There is, however, no doubt that the jurisdiction to issue
      a writ of certiorari is a supervisory jurisdiction and the Court
      exercising it is not entitled to act as an appellate Court. This
      limitation necessarily means that findings of fact reached by the
      inferior Court or Tribunal as a result of the appreciation of
      evidence cannot be reopened or questioned in writ proceedings.
      An error of law which is apparent on the face of the record can
      be corrected by a writ, but not an error of fact, however grave
      it may appear to be. In regard to a finding of fact recorded by
      the Tribunal, a writ of certiorari can be issued if it is shown
      that in recording the said finding, the. Tribunal had
      erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence,
      or had erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which has
      influenced the impugned finding. Similarly, if a finding of fact is
      based on no evidence, that would be regarded as an error of
      law which can be corrected by a writ of certiorari. In dealing
      with this category of cases, however, we must always bear in
      mind that a finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal cannot be
      challenged in proceedings for a writ of certiorari on the ground

       that the relevant and material evidence adduced before the
      Tribunal was' insufficient or inadequate to sustain the
      impugned finding. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence led
      on a point and the inference of fact to be drawn from the said
      finding are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and
      the said points cannot be agitated before a writ court. It is
      within these limits that the jurisdiction conferred on the High
      Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Art. 226</a> to issue a writ of certiorari can be
      legitimately exercised (vide <a href="/doc/1450722/" id="a_16">Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmed
      Ishaque</a>....."

<p id="p_26">24.   The Tribunal, in this case, has decided correctly so far as first part of
the Reference is concerned that the workmen are not entitled to stagnation
increment each year. To this extent, there is no dispute. However, the
Tribunal has gone further and stated that the Management is required to be
directed to give three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively
within six years. No such dispute has been referred to the Tribunal. In other
words, the Tribunal has been called upon to just answer whether workmen
who have reached the maximum of their pay-scales are entitled to stagnation
increment each year upto a maximum of three increments and if so, what
directions are necessary in this respect? The direction of the Tribunal as
contained in the later part that the Management is required to be directed to
give three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively within six
years, cannot be termed as incidental, hence, the same is beyond the scope of
Reference and must be struck down.
</p><p id="p_27">25.   The Tribunal, in my opinion, has committed an error while answering
the Reference holding that the Management is required to be directed to give
three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively within six years, as
is also evident from the submissions made by the learned counsels for the

 parties that it is/was not stated anywhere in the pleadings or the written
submissions or the arguments of the Management/Petitioner that the case of
the Management is that the stagnation increment is given in alternate years,
i.e., once in two years, as stated in the Impugned Award dated 07.03.2005.
</p><p id="p_28">26.   Consequently, the Rule is made absolute and the writ petition filed by
the petitioner is allowed. The Award dated 07.03.2005 is quashed and set-
aside to the extent of holding that the Management is required to be directed
to give three stagnation increments to the workmen alternatively within six
years, i.e. once in every two years. The parties shall bear their own costs.
