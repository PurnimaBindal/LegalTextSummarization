A.   Introduction

     In a parliamentary democracy where human rights are

placed on a high pedestal and a rights-oriented Constitution is

sought to be interpreted, it becomes the obligation on the part of

the Constitutional Courts to strike a balance between emphatic

hermeneutics on progressive perception of the provisions of the

Constitution on the one hand and the self-imposed judicial

restraint founded on self-discipline on the other hand, regard

being had to the nature and character of the article that falls for

interpretation and its constitutional vision and purpose. The

Courts never allow a constitutional provision to be narrowly

construed keeping in view the principle that the Constitution is a

living document and organic which has the innate potentiality to

take many a concept within its fold. The Courts, being alive to

their constitutional sensibility, do possess a progressive outlook

having   a   telescopic    view   of   the   growing    jurisprudence.

Nonetheless,   occasions    do    arise   where   the   constitutional

consciousness is invoked to remind the Court that it should not

be totally oblivious of the idea, being the final arbiter of the

Constitution, to strike the requisite balance whenever there is a

necessity, for the founding fathers had wisely conceived the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 4</span>


in various articles of the grand fundamental document. In the

present case, this delicate balance is the cardinal issue, as it

seems to us, and it needs to be resolved in the backdrop of both

the principles. The factual score that has given rise to the present

reference to be dealt with by us is centered on the issue as to

whether a Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) report can be

placed reliance upon for adjudication of a fact in issue and also

for what other purposes it can be taken aid of. That apart, to

arrive at the ultimate conclusion, we will be required to navigate

and steer through certain foundational fundamentals which take

within its ambit the supremacy of the Constitution, constitutional

limitations, separation of powers, power of judicial review and

self-imposed restraint, interpretation of constitutional provisions

in many a sphere, the duty of parliamentary committee in various

democracies and also certain statutory provisions of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2">Indian

Evidence Act</a>, 1872 (for brevity, ―the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_3">Evidence Act</a>‖).

B.   The factual background

</p><p id="p_5">2.   The initial debate and deliberation before the two-Judge

Bench that was hearing the instant Writ Petitions had focussed

around the justifiability of the action taken by the Drugs

Controller General of India and the Indian Council of Medical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               5</span>


Research (ICMR) pertaining to the approval of a vaccine, namely,

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) manufactured by the Respondent

No. 7, M/s. GlaxoSmithKline Asia Pvt. Ltd., and the Respondent

No. 8, MSD Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, for preventing

cervical cancer in women and the experimentation of the vaccine

was done as an immunisation by the Governments of Gujarat

and Andhra Pradesh (before bifurcation, the State of Andhra

Pradesh, eventually the State of Andhra Pradesh and the State of

Telangana) with the charity provided by the Respondent No. 6,

namely, PATH International. Apart from the aforesaid issue, the

grievance with regard to the untimely death of certain persons

and the grant of compensation on the foundation that there had

been experiment of the drugs on young girls who had not reached

the   age   of   majority   without   the   consent    of   their

parents/guardians was also highlighted. Be it stated, it was also

projected that women, though being fully informed, had become

victims of the said vaccination. In essence, the submissions were

advanced pertaining to the hazards of the vaccination and

obtaining of consent without making the persons aware of the

possible after effects and the consequences of the administration
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 6</span>


of such vaccine. The two-Judge Bench had passed certain orders

from time to time with which we are not presently concerned.

</p><p id="p_6">3.    In the course of hearing before the two-Judge Bench,

learned counsel for the writ petitioners had invited the attention

of the Bench to a report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee

(PSC) and the Court had directed the Governments to file

affidavits regarding the steps taken keeping in view the various

instructions given from time to time including what has been

stated in the report of the PSC. Certain affidavits were filed by the

respondents stating about the safety of the vaccination and the

steps taken to avoid any kind of hazard or jeopardy. That apart,

the allegations made in the writ petitions were also controverted.

B.1   The Reference

</p><p id="p_7">4.    When the matter stood thus, learned senior counsel for the

respondent No. 8, MSD Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., and learned

Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India

submitted that this Court, while exercising the power of judicial

review or its expansive jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article 32</a> of the

Constitution of India dealing with public interest litigation,

cannot advert to the report of the PSC and on that basis, exercise

the power of issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus and issue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                     7</span>


directions. The assistance of learned Attorney General was also

sought keeping in view the gravity of the issue involved. After

hearing the matter, the two-Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/130511429/" id="a_5">Kalpana Mehta

and others v. Union of India and others</a>                    1   thought it

appropriate to refer it to a Constitution Bench under <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_6">Article

145(3)</a> of the Constitution and in that regard, the Division Bench

expressed thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         ―72. The controversy has to be seen from the
         perspective of judicial review. The basic principle of
         judicial review is to ascertain the propriety of the
         decision making process on the parameters of
         reasonableness and propriety of the executive
         decisions. We are not discussing about the
         parameters pertaining to the challenge of
         amendments       to   the    Constitution     or    the
         constitutionality of a statute. When a writ of
         mandamus is sought on the foundation of a factual
         score, the Court is required to address the facts
         asserted and the averments made and what has
         been stated in oppugnation. Once the Court is
         asked to look at the report, the same can be
         challenged by the other side, for it cannot be
         accepted without affording an opportunity of being
         heard to the Respondents. The invitation to contest
         a Parliamentary Standing Committee report is likely
         to disturb the delicate balance that the Constitution
         provides between the constitutional institutions. If
         the Court allows contest and adjudicates on the
         report, it may run counter to the spirit of privilege of
         Parliament which the Constitution protects.</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">         73. As advised at present, we are prima facie of the
         view that the Parliamentary Standing Committee

1   (2017) 7 SCC 307
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 8</span>


     report may not be tendered as a document to
     augment the stance on the factual score that a
     particular activity is unacceptable or erroneous.
     However, regard being had to the substantial
     question of law relating to interpretation of the
     Constitution involved, we think it appropriate that
     the issue be referred to the Constitution Bench
     under <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_7">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution.‖

</p><p id="p_10">5.   Thereafter, the two-Judge Bench framed the following

questions for the purpose of reference to the Constitution Bench:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     ―73.1. (i) Whether in a litigation filed before this
     Court either under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_8">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_9">Article 136</a> of the
     Constitution of India, the Court can refer to and
     place reliance upon the report of the Parliamentary
     Standing Committee?</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">     73.2. (ii) Whether such a Report can be looked at for
     the purpose of reference and, if so, can there be
     restrictions for the purpose of reference regard
     being had to the concept of parliamentary privilege
     and the delicate balance between the constitutional
     institutions that Articles 105, 121 and 122 of the
     Constitution conceive?‖

     Because of the aforesaid reference, the matter has been

placed before us.
</p>
<p id="p_13">C.   Contentions of the petitioners

</p><p id="p_14">6.   At the very outset, it is essential to state that the argument

has been advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners that the lis raised neither relates to parliamentary

privileges as set out in <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_10">Article 105</a> of the Constitution nor does it

pertain to the concept of separation of powers nor does it require
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                9</span>


any adjudication relating to the issue of mandamus for the

enforcement of the recommendations of the PSC report. What is

suggested is that the Court should not decide the controversy as

per the facts stated in the report of the PSC treating it to be

conclusive; rather the Court should take judicial notice of the

same as provided under <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_11">Section 57(4)</a> of the Evidence Act. It is

also urged that the Court has the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_12">Article 32</a> of

the Constitution to conduct an independent inquiry being

assisted by the Court Commissioners and also give direction for

production of the documents from the executive. It is put forth in

simplest terms that the petitioners are entitled to bring the facts

stated in the report to the notice of the Court and persuade the

Court to analyse the said facts and express an opinion at

variance with the report, for the proceedings in the Court are

independent of the PSC report which only has persuasive value.

Emphasising the concept of ―judicial notice‖, it is propounded

that the scope of judicial review does not rest on a narrow

spectrum and the Court under the Constitution is within its

rights to draw factual and legal conclusions on the basis of wide

spectrum of inputs and materials including what has been stated

in the PSC report.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                 10</span><p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">7.    The aforesaid submission, as is noticeable, intends to

convey that no constitutional debate should be raised with regard

to reliance on the report of PSC and the Court should decide

without reference to the concepts of parliamentary privilege,

separation of powers and comity of institutions. The argument,

in entirety, put forth by the petitioners is not founded on the said

bedrock inasmuch as Mr. Colin Gonsalves and Mr. Anand

Grover, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, have

argued that the Constitutional Court in exercise of the power of

judicial review can take note of at the report of the PSC and also

rely upon the said report within the constitutional parameters

and   the   proposition   does   not   invite   any   constitutional

discordance.    It is further contended that the concept of

parliamentary privilege is enshrined under <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_13">Article 105</a> of the

Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech within the

House during the course of the proceedings of the House and the

said freedom has been conferred to ensure that the members of

Parliament express themselves freely in Parliament without fear

of any impediment of inviting any civil or criminal proceedings.

The initial part of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_14">Article 105</a> confers, inter alia,

immunity to the members of Parliament from civil and criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                11</span>


proceedings before any court in respect of ‗anything said‘ or ‗any

vote given‘ by members of Parliament in the Parliament or any

Committee thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8.   It is argued that this being the position, the factual score of

the instant case does not invite the wrath of violation of

parliamentary privilege which <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_15">Article 105</a> seeks to protect. It is

because the limited issue that emerges in the present case is to

see the Parliamentary Standing Committee reports.             Thus,

looking at the report for arriving at the truth by the Court in its

expansive jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_16">Article 32</a> of the Constitution

remotely touches the concept of privilege under <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_17">Article 105</a> of the

Constitution. It is further canvassed that the facts that have been

arrived at by the Parliamentary Committee are of immense

assistance for the adjudication of the controversy in question and

in such a situation, it is crystal clear that the purpose of the

petitioners is not to file a civil or criminal case against any

member of the Parliament or any member of the Standing

Committee.    Therefore, the violation of parliamentary privilege

does not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_18">9.   Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that this

Court is neither called upon to comment expressly or otherwise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                12</span>


on the report nor a writ of mandamus has been sought for

enforcement of the recommendations in the report. It is brought

on record so that the Court can look at the facts stated therein

and arrive at a just conclusion in support of other facts.

D.   Contentions of the respondents

</p><p id="p_19">10. Both the facets of the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel appearing for the petitioners have been seriously

opposed by Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for

India, Mr. Harish N. Salve, Mr. Gourab Banerji and Mr. Shyam

Divan, learned senior counsel appearing for the contesting

respondents. Their basic propositions are grounded, first on

constitutional provisions which prescribe the privilege of the

Parliament and how the report of a PSC is not amenable to

contest and the limited reliance that has been placed by this

Court on the report of PSC or the speech of a Minister on the

floor of the legislature only to understand the provisions of a

statute in certain context and second, the limited interpretation

that is required to be placed on the words ―judicial notice‖ as

used in <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_18">Section 57(4)</a> of the Evidence Act regard being had to the

context. It is urged by them that allowing contest and criticism of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                 13</span>


the report would definitely create a stir in the constitutional

balance.
</p>
<p id="p_20">11. It is also highlighted that in a public interest litigation, the

Court has relaxed the principle of locus standi, encouraged

epistolary jurisdiction, treated the petitioner as a relator, required

the parties on certain occasions not to take an adversarial

position and also not allowed technicalities to create any kind of

impediment in the dispensation of justice but the said category of

cases cannot be put on a high pedestal to create a concavity in

the federal structure of the Constitution or allow to place a

different kind of interpretation on a constitutional provision

which will usher in a crack in the healthy spirit of the

Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_21">12. We shall refer to the arguments and the authorities cited by

both sides in the course of our deliberation. Suffice it to mention,

the fundamental analysis has to be done on the base of the

constitutional provisions, the constitutional values and the

precedents. To address the issue singularly from the prism of

<a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_19">Section 57(4)</a> of the Evidence Act, we are afraid, will tantamount

to over simplification of the issue. Therefore, the said aspect shall

be addressed to at the appropriate stage.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                               14</span><p id="p_22">


</p><p id="p_23">E.       Supremacy of the Constitution

</p><p id="p_24">13. The Constitution of India is the supreme fundamental law

and all laws have to be in consonance or in accord with the

Constitution.           The    constitutional        provisions     postulate   the

conditions for the functioning of the legislature and the executive

and prescribe that the Supreme Court is the final interpreter of

the Constitution. All statutory laws are required to conform to

the fundamental law, that is, the Constitution. The functionaries

of the three wings, namely, the legislature, the executive and the

judiciary, as has been stated in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_20">His Holiness Kesavananda

Bharati Sripadagalvaru v.                      State of Kerala and another</a> 2,

derive their authority and jurisdiction from the Constitution. The

Parliament has the exclusive authority to make laws and that is

how the supremacy of the Parliament in the field of legislation is

understood.         There      is   a     distinction   between     parliamentary

supremacy          in    the    field     of    legislation   and    constitutional

supremacy. The Constitution is the fundamental document that

provides for constitutionalism, constitutional governance and

also sets out morality, norms and values which are inhered in

various articles and sometimes are decipherable from the


2   AIR 1973 SC 1461 : (1973) 4 SCC 225
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                   15</span>


constitutional silence. Its inherent dynamism makes it organic

and, therefore, the concept of ―constitutional sovereignty‖ is

sacrosanct. It is extremely sacred and, as stated earlier, the

authorities get their powers from the Constitution.       It is ―the

source‖. Sometimes, the constitutional sovereignty is described

as the supremacy of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_25">14. <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_21">In State of Rajasthan and others v. Union of India and

others</a>      3   , Bhagwati, J. (as his Lordship then was), in his

concurring opinion, stated that the Constitution is suprema lex,

the paramount law of the land and there is no department or

branch of government above or beyond it.       The learned Judge,

proceeding further, observed that every organ of the government,

be it the executive or the legislature or the judiciary, derives its

authority from the Constitution and it has to act within the limits

of its authority. Observing about the power of this Court, he

ruled that this Court is the ultimate interpreter of the

Constitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate task of

determining what is the power conferred on each branch of the

Government, whether it is limited, and if so, what are the limits

and whether any action of that branch transgresses such limits.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    16</span>


He further observed that it is for this Court to uphold the

constitutional       values   and   to   enforce   the   constitutional

limitations, for it is the essence of the rule of law. Elaborating the

said concept, Sabharwal, C.J. in I.R. Coelho (Dead) by LRs. v.

State of T.N.4, speaking for the nine-Judge Bench, held that the

supremacy of the Constitution embodies that constitutional

bodies are required to comply with the provisions of the

Constitution. It also mandates a mechanism for testing the

validity of legislative acts through an independent organ, viz., the

judiciary.
</p>
<p id="p_26">15. Be it noted, in the aforesaid case, a distinction was drawn

between parliamentary and constitutional sovereignty. Speaking

on the same, the Bench opined that our Constitution was framed

by a Constituent Assembly which was not Parliament. It is in the

exercise of law-making power by the Constituent Assembly that

we have a controlled Constitution. Articles 14, 19 and 21

represent the foundational values which form the bedrock of the

rule of law. These are the principles of constitutionality which

form the basis of judicial review apart from the rule of law and

separation of powers.

necessary to appreciate what precisely is meant by constitutional

limitation. <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_22">In State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar5</a>, this

Court, in the context of freedom of speech and expression

conferred by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_23">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, applied the

principle of constitutional limitation and opined that where a law

purports to authorise the imposition of restrictions on a

fundamental          right   in     a   language   wide   enough   to   cover

restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally

permissible legislative action affecting such right, it is not

possible to uphold it even so far as it may be applied within the

constitutional limits, as it is not severable. So long as the

possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the

Constitution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly

unconstitutional           and     void.     The   emphasis   was   laid   on

constitutional limitation. <a href="/doc/775246/" id="a_24">In K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v.

State of Orissa</a> 6 , the Court adverted to the real purpose of

legislation and colourable legislation and, in that context,

expressed that when a scrutiny is made, it may appear that the

real purpose of a legislation is different from what appears on the

face of it. It would be a colourable legislation only if it is shown

that the real object is different as a consequence of which it lies

within the exclusive field of another legislature.

</p><p id="p_31">18. Dwelling upon the legal effect of a constitutional limitation

of legislative power with respect to a law made in derogation of

that limitation, the Court in <a href="/doc/1300072/" id="a_25">Deep Chand v. State of Uttar

Pradesh</a> and others7 reproduced a passage from Cooley‘s book

on ―Constitutional Limitation‖ (Eighth Edition, Volume I) which is

to the following effect:-

         constitutional conditions.‖

         Thereafter,       the    Constitution   Bench   referred   to   the

observations of the Judicial Committee in Queen v. Burah 8

wherein it was observed that whenever a question as to whether

the legislature has exceeded its prescribed limits arises, the

courts of justice determine the said question by looking into the

terms of the instrument which created the legislative powers

affirmatively and which restricted the said powers negatively.

The Constitution Bench also referred to the observations of the

Judicial        Committee        in   Attorney-General   for   Ontario    v.

Attorney-General for Canada 9 which were later on lucidly

explained by Mukherjea, J., (as he then was) in K.C. Gajapati

Narayan Deo (supra) to the effect that if the Constitution

distributes the legislative powers amongst different bodies which

have to act within their respective spheres marked out by specific

legislative entries or if there are limitations on the legislature in

the form of fundamental rights, the question will arise as to

whether, in a particular case, the legislature has transgressed the

limits of its constitutional power in respect of the subject matter

of the statute or in the method of making it.

</p><p id="p_34">19. Recently, in <a href="/doc/157174084/" id="a_26">Binoy Viswam v. Union of India</a> and others10

this Court, while dealing with the exercise of sovereign power of

the Centre and the States in the context of levy of taxes, duties

and fees, observed that the said exercise of power is subject to

constitutional limitation. It is imperative to remember that our

Constitution has, with the avowed purpose, laid down the powers

exercised by the three wings of the State and in exercise of the

said power, the authorities are constitutionally required to act

within their spheres having mutual institutional respect to realize

the constitutional goal and to see that there is no constitutional

transgression. The grammar of constitutional limitation has to be

perceived as the constitutional fulcrum where control operates

among the several power holders, that is, legislature, executive

and judiciary. It is because the Constitution has created the

three organs of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_35">20. Under the Constitution, the Parliament and the State

legislatures have been entrusted with the power of law making.

Needless to say, if there is a transgression of the constitutional

limitation, the law made by the legislature has to be declared

ultra vires by the Constitutional Courts.            That power has been

conferred on the Courts under the Constitution and that is why,

we have used the terminology ―constitutional sovereignty‖. It is

an accepted principle that the rule of law constitutes the core of

our Constitution and it is the essence of the rule of law that the

exercise of the power by the State, whether it be the legislature or

the executive or any other authority, should be within the

constitutional limitations.

21. Having          stated   about     constitutional    sovereignty   and

</pre><p id="p_36">constitutional limitation, we may presently address the issue as

to how the Constitution of India has been understood in the

context of division of functions of the State.             <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_27">In Smt. Indira

Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain</a> and another11, Beg, J., in

his      concurring     opinion,     quoted   what      M.C.   Setalvad,   a

distinguished jurist of India, had said in ―The Common Law in

India‖ (The Hamlyn Lectures), 12th Series, 1960.               We think it

appropriate to reproduce the paragraph in entirety:-

</p><p id="p_37">        ―The Constitution divides the functions of the Union
        into the three categories of executive, legislative and

11   1975 Supp. SCC 1

         judicial functions following the pattern of the British
         North America Act and the Commonwealth of
         Australia Act. Though this division of functions is
         not based on the doctrine of separation of powers as
         in the United States yet there is a broad division of
         functions between the appropriate authorities so
         that, for example, the legislature will not be entitled
         to arrogate to itself the judicial function of
         adjudication. ‗The Indian Constitution has not
         indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of
         powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of
         the different parts or branches of the Government
         have      been    sufficiently   differentiated    and
         consequently it can very well be said that our
         Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by
         one organ or part of the State, of functions that
         essentially belong to another.‘ (See: <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_28">Rai Saheb Ram
         Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> 12 ). This will no
         doubt strike one accustomed to the established
         supremacy of Parliament in England as unusual. In
         the course of its historical development Parliament
         has performed and in a way still performs judicial
         functions. Indeed the expression ‗Court of
         Parliament‘ is not unfamiliar to English lawyers.
         However, a differentiation of the functions of
         different departments is an invariable feature of all
         written Constitutions. The very purpose of a written
         Constitution is the demarcation of the powers of
         different departments of Government so that the
         exercise of their powers may be limited to their
         particular fields. In countries governed by a written
         Constitution, as India is, the supreme authority is
         not Parliament but the Constitution. Contrasting it
         with the supremacy of Parliament, Dicey has
         characterised it as the supremacy of the
         Constitution.‖

</p><p id="p_38">22. The doctrine of separation of powers has become concrete in

the Indian context when the Court in Kesavananda Bharati’s

case treated the same as a basic feature of the Constitution of

India. <a href="/doc/596084/" id="a_29">In State of Himachal Pradesh v. A Parent</a> of a Student

of Medical College, Simla and others13, this Court ruled that it

is entirely a matter for the executive branch of the Government to

decide whether or not to introduce any particular legislation. Of

course, any member of the legislature can also introduce

legislation but the Court certainly cannot mandate the executive

or any member of the legislature to initiate legislation, howsoever

necessary or desirable the Court may consider it to be. That is

not a matter which is within the sphere of the functions and

duties allocated to the judiciary under the Constitution. The

Court further observed that it cannot usurp the functions

assigned to the legislature under the Constitution and it cannot

even indirectly require the executive to introduce a particular

legislation or the legislature to pass it or assume to itself a

supervisory role over the law-making activities of the executive

and the legislature. <a href="/doc/148776173/" id="a_30">In State of Tamil Nadu v. State of Kerala

separation of powers, stated that even without express provision

of the separation of powers, the doctrine of separation of powers

is an entrenched principle in the Constitution of India. The

doctrine of separation of powers informs the Indian constitutional

structure and it is an essential constituent of the rule of law.

</p><p id="p_39">23. <a href="/doc/693176/" id="a_31">In Bhim Singh v. Union of India</a> and others15, the Court,

for understanding the concept of separation of powers, observed

that two aspects must be borne in mind. One, that separation of

powers is an essential feature of the Constitution and secondly,

that in modern governance, a strict separation is neither possible

nor desirable. Nevertheless, till this principle of accountability is

preserved, there is no violation of separation of powers and the

same is founded on keen scrutiny of the constitutional text. The

Constitution does not strictly prohibit overlap of functions and, in

fact, provides for some overlap in a parliamentary democracy.

What it prohibits is such exercise of function of the other branch

which results in wresting away of the regime of constitutional

accountability.

Union of India 17 and <a href="/doc/1358116/" id="a_33">State of Maharashtra and others v.

Raghunath Gajanan Waingankar</a> 18 , the Court applied the

principle       of    restraint,     acknowledging        and   respecting   the

constitutional limitation upon the judiciary to recognize the

doctrine of separation of powers and restrain itself from entering

into the domain of the legislature. Elaborating further, this Court

in <a href="/doc/47602/" id="a_34">Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club and another v.

Chander          Hass     and      another</a>      19   observed that under our

have their own broad spheres of operation and each organ must

have respect for the others and must not encroach into each

others‘ domain, otherwise the delicate balance in the Constitution

will be upset, and there will be a reaction.

</p><p id="p_41">25. <a href="/doc/1225520/" id="a_35">In Asif Hameed and others v. State of Jammu and

function within their own spheres demarcated under the

Constitution. It further ruled that the Constitution trusts the

judgment of these organs to function and exercise their discretion

by strictly following the procedure prescribed therein. The

functioning of democracy depends upon the strength and

independence of each of its organs. The Legislature and the

Executive, the two facets of people's will, have all the powers

including that of finance. The judiciary has no power over the

sword or the purse. Nonetheless, it has power to ensure that the

aforesaid two main organs of the State function within the

constitutional limits. It is the sentinel of democracy. Judicial

review is a powerful weapon to restrain unconstitutional exercise

of power by the legislature and the executive. The expanding

horizon of judicial review has taken in its fold the concept of

social and economic justice. The exercise of powers by the

legislature and executive is subject to judicial restraint and the

only check on the exercise of power by the judiciary is the self

imposed discipline of judicial restraint.

</p><p id="p_42">26. In I.R. Coelho (supra), adverting to the issue of separation

of powers, the nine-Judge Bench referred to the basic structure

doctrine laid down in Kesavananda Bharati (supra) by the

majority and the reiteration thereof in Indira Nehru Gandhi

(supra) and reproduced a passage from Alexander Hamilton‘s

book ―The Federalist‖ and eventually held:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       ―67. The Supreme Court has long held that the
       separation of powers is part of the basic structure of
       the Constitution. Even before the basic structure
       doctrine became part of constitutional law, the
       importance of the separation of powers on our
       system of governance was recognised by this Court
       in Special Reference No. 1 of 1964.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_43">27. From the above authorities, it is quite vivid that the concept

of constitutional limitation is a facet of the doctrine of separation

of powers. At this stage, we may clearly state that there can really

be no strait-jacket approach in the sphere of separation of powers

when issues involve democracy, the essential morality that flows

from the Constitution, interest of the citizens in certain spheres

like   environment,    sustenance      of   social   interest,   etc.   and

empowering the populace with the right to information or right to

know in matters relating to candidates contesting election. There

can be many an example where this Court has issued directions

to the executive and also formulated guidelines for facilitation

and in furtherance of fundamental rights and sometimes for the

actualization and fructification of statutory rights.

</p><p id="p_44">H.       Power of judicial review

</p><p id="p_45">28.       While focussing on the exercise of the power of judicial

review, it has to be borne in mind that the source of authority is

the Constitution of India.          The Court has the adjudicating

authority to scrutinize the limits of the power and transgression

of such limits. The nature and scope of judicial review has been

succinctly stated in <a href="/doc/505842/" id="a_36">Union of India and another v. Raghubir

Singh (Dead</a>) by LRs. etc.21 by R.S. Pathak, C.J. thus:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         ―….. The range of judicial review recognised in the
         superior judiciary of India is perhaps the widest and
         the most extensive known to the world of law. …
         With this impressive expanse of judicial power, it is
         only right that the superior courts in India should
         be conscious of the enormous responsibility which
         rest on them. This is specially true of the Supreme
         Court, for as the highest Court in the entire judicial
         system the law declared by it is, by <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_37">Article 141</a> of
         the Constitution, binding on all courts within the
         territory of India.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">And again:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         ―Legal compulsions cannot be limited by existing
         legal propositions, because there will always be,
         beyond the frontiers of the existing law, new areas
         inviting judicial scrutiny and judicial choice-making
         which could well affect the validity of existing legal
         dogma. The search for solutions responsive to a
         changed social era involves a search not only among
         competing propositions of law, or competing
         versions of a legal proposition, or the modalities of
         an     indeterminacy     such    as     ‗fairness‘  or

     outside the ruling law, corresponding to the
     empirical knowledge or accepted values of present
     time and place, relevant to the dispensing of justice
     within the new parameters.‖

     The aforesaid two passages lay immense responsibility on

the Court pertaining to the exercise of the power keeping in view

the accepted values of the present. An organic instrument

requires the Court to draw strength from the spirit of the

Constitution.   The   propelling    element   of   the   Constitution

commands the realization of the values. The aspiring dynamism

of the interpretative process also expects the same.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">29. This Court has the constitutional power and the authority

to interpret the constitutional provisions as well as the statutory

provisions. The conferment of the power of judicial review has a

great sanctity as the Constitutional Court has the power to

declare any law as unconstitutional if there is lack of competence

of the legislature keeping in view the field of legislation as

provided in the Constitution or if a provision contravenes or runs

counter to any of the fundamental rights or any constitutional

provision or if a provision is manifestly arbitrary.

</p><p id="p_48">30. When we speak about judicial review, it is also necessary to

be alive to the concept of judicial restraint. The duty of judicial

review which the Constitution has bestowed upon the judiciary is

not unfettered; it comes within the conception of judicial

restraint. The principle of judicial restraint requires that judges

ought to decide cases while being within their defined limits of

power. Judges are expected to interpret any law or any provision

of the Constitution as per the limits laid down by the

Constitution.

<p id="p_49">31. <a href="/doc/993880/" id="a_38">In S.C. Chandra and others v. State of Jharkhand and

and others23 is quite instructive. In the said case, a prayer was

made before this Court to issue directions for appropriate

amendment in the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956.

Repelling the submission, the Court held that it is purely a

matter of policy which is for the elected representatives of the

this regard. The Court further observed that this Court cannot

constitutional scheme, the Parliament and legislative assemblies

exercise sovereign power to enact law and no outside power or

authority can issue a direction to enact a particular kind of

legislation. While so holding, the Court referred to the decision in

Supreme Court Employees’ <a href="/doc/20720737/" id="a_40">Welfare Association v. Union of

a legislature to enact a particular law and similarly when an

executive authority exercises a legislative power by way of a

legislature, such executive authority cannot be asked to enact a

law which it has been empowered to do under the delegated

authority.

judicial restraint cannot and should not be such that it amounts

to judicial abdication and judicial passivism. The Judiciary

cannot abdicate the solemn duty which the Constitution has

placed on its shoulders, i.e., to protect the fundamental rights of

the citizens guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. The

Constitutional Courts cannot sit in oblivion when fundamental

rights of individuals are at stake. Our Constitution has conceived

the Constitutional Courts to act as defenders against illegal

intrusion        of     the   fundamental   rights   of   individuals.   The

without an iota of hesitation or apprehension, when the

fundamental rights of individuals are in jeopardy. Elucidating on

the said aspect, this Court in <a href="/doc/635617/" id="a_47">Virendra Singh and others v.

<p id="p_52">34. While interpreting fundamental rights, the Constitutional

Courts should remember that whenever an occasion arises, the

Courts have to adopt a liberal approach with the object to infuse

lively spirit and vigour so that the fundamental rights do not

suffer.      When we say so, it may not be understood that while

interpreting       fundamental   rights,   the   Constitutional   Courts

should altogether depart from the doctrine of precedents but it is

the obligation of the Constitutional Courts to act as sentinel on

the principles of constitutional limitation, separation of powers

and the spheres of judicial review, it is necessary to dwell upon

the concept of constitutional interpretation. <a href="/doc/139734870/" id="a_52">In S.R. Bommai and

is necessary to direct the political parties within the purview of

the constitutional umbrella to strongly adhere to constitutional

values. There is no denial of the fact that the judiciary takes note

of the obtaining empirical facts and the aspirations of the

generation that are telescoped into the future. If constitutional

provisions have to be perceived from the prism of growth and

development in the context of time so as to actualize the social

and political will of the people that was put to in words, they have

to be understood in their life and spirit with the further

v. Income Tax Officer</a> and another33 has lucidly expressed that

our Constitution charges the various organs of the State with

affirmative responsibilities of protecting the welfare and the

security of the nation. Legislative powers are granted to enable

the accomplishment of the goals of the nation. The powers of

judicial review are granted in order to ensure that legislative and

executive powers are used within the bounds specified by the

Constitution. The powers referred by the Constitution and

implied and borne by the constitutional text have to be perforce

admitted. Nevertheless, the very essence of constitutionalism is

also that no organ of the State may arrogate to itself powers

beyond what is specified by the Constitution. Speaking on the

duty of the judiciary, the Court has opined that judicial restraint

is necessary in dealing with the powers of another coordinate

branch of the Government; but restraint cannot imply abdication

of the responsibility of walking on that edge. Stressing on the

facet of interpreting any law, including the Constitution, the

Court observed that the text of the provision under consideration

would be the primary source for discerning the meanings that

inhere in the enactment. It has also been laid down that in the

light of the serious issues, it would always be prudent, as a

matter of constitutional necessity, to widen the search for the

true meaning, purport and ambit of the provision under

consideration. No provision, and indeed no word or expression, of

the Constitution exists in isolation—they are necessarily related

to, transforming and, in turn, being transformed by other

provisions, words and phrases in the Constitution. Therefore, the

Court went on to say:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     ―38. Our Constitution is both long and also an
     intricate matrix of meanings, purposes and
     structures. It is only by locating a particular

         that constitutional matrix could one hope to be able
         to discern its true meaning, purport and ambit. As
         Prof. Laurence Tribe points out:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                 ―[T]o understand the Constitution as a legal

             it is: a constitutive text that purports, in the name
             of the people…, to bring into being a number of
             distinct but inter-related institutions and
             practices, at once legal and political, and to
             define the rules governing those institutions and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">38. The Constitution being an organic document, its ongoing

interpretation is permissible. The supremacy of the Constitution

is essential to bring social changes in the national polity evolved

with the passage of time. The interpretation of the Constitution is

a difficult task. While doing so, the Constitutional Courts are not

only required to take into consideration their own experience over

time, the international treaties and covenants but also keep the

doctrine of flexibility in mind. It has been so stated in <a href="/doc/104249035/" id="a_54">Union of

India v. Naveen Jindal</a> and another35. In S.R. Bommai (supra)

exigencies requiring an expansive reading of liberties and

freedoms to preserve human rights under the Rule of Law. It has

been further observed that the interpretation of the Constitution

cannot        be       frozen   by   its   original   understanding,   for   the

Constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve to meet

the aspirations and challenges of the present and the future. The

circumstances and values but also in such a way that the

circumstances and values of the present generation are given

expression in its provisions. The Court has observed that

constitutional interpretation is as much a process of creation as

one of discovery. Thus viewed, the process of interpretation ought

to meet the values and aspirations of the present generation and

it has two facets, namely, process of creation and discovery. It

has to be remembered that while interpreting a constitutional

provision, one has to be guided by the letter, spirit and purpose

of the language employed therein and also the constitutional

silences or abeyances that are discoverable. The scope and

discovery has a connection with the theory of constitutional

implication. Additionally, the interpretative process of a provision

of a Constitution is also required to accentuate the purpose and

<p id="p_61">I.1      Interpretation of fundamental rights

</p><p id="p_62">41. While adverting to the concept of the duty of the Court, we

shall focus on the interpretative process adopted by this Court in

respect of fundamental rights.                 In the initial years, after the

Constitution came into force, the Court viewed each fundamental

right as separate and distinct. That apart, the rule of restrictive

interpretation was applied. The contours were narrow and

limited.       It is noticeable from the decision in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_57">A.K. Gopalan v.

State of Madras</a> 38 .            The perception changed when the Court

focussed on the actual impairment caused by the law rather than

the literal validity of the law as has been observed in I.R. Coelho

(supra).       I.R. Coelho referred to <a href="/doc/513801/" id="a_58">Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v.

disapproved the view point in A.K. Gopalan and reflected upon

<a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_62">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a> and another44 which reads

thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">         ―The law, must, therefore, now be taken to be well
         settled that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_63">Article 21</a> does not exclude <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_64">Article 19</a>
         and that even if there is a law prescribing a
         procedure for depriving a person of ‗personal liberty‘
         and there is consequently no infringement of the
         fundamental right conferred by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_65">Article 21</a>, such law,
         insofar as it abridges or takes away any
         fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_66">Article 19</a> would have to
         meet the challenge of that article.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_63">42. The Court reproduced a passage from the opinion expressed

by Krishna Iyer, J. which stated that the proposition is

indubitable that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_67">Article 21</a> does not, in a given situation, exclude

<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_68">Article 19</a> if both the rights are breached.

</p><p id="p_64">43. In I.R. Coelho (supra), the Court clearly spelt out that post-

Maneka Gandhi, it is clear that the development of fundamental

rights had been such that it no longer involves the interpretation

of rights as isolated protections which directly arise but they

collectively form a comprehensive test against the arbitrary

exercise of powers in any area that occurs as an inevitable

consequence.           The     Court       observed   that   the   protection   of

42   (1975) 3 SCC 198 : (1975) 1 SCR 778
43   (1975) 2 SCR 832 : (1975) 2 SCC 81

fundamental rights has been considerably widened.                  In that

context, reference had been made to <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_69">M. Nagaraj and others v.

Union of India and others</a> 45 wherein it has been held that a

fundamental             right   becomes    fundamental   because   it   has

foundational value. That apart, one has also to see the structure

of the article in which the fundamental value is incorporated.

Fundamental right is a limitation on the power of the State. A

Constitution and, in particular, that of it which protects and

which entrenches fundamental rights and freedoms to which all

persons in the State are to be entitled is to be given a generous

and purposive construction. The Court must interpret the

Constitution in a manner which would enable the citizens to

enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest measure.

I.2      Interpretation of other constitutional provisions

</p><p id="p_65">44. In this regard, we may note how the Constitution Benches

have applied the principles of interpretation in relation to other

constitutional provisions which are fundamental to constitutional

governance and democracy. <a href="/doc/27274070/" id="a_70">In B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. and

another</a> 46 , while deciding a writ of quo warranto, the majority

ruled that if a non-legislator could be sworn in as the Chief

Minister under <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_71">Article 164</a> of the Constitution, then he must

satisfy the qualification of membership of a legislator as

postulated under <a href="/doc/614870/" id="a_72">Article 173.</a> I.R. Coelho (supra), while deciding

the doctrine of implied limitation and referring to various

opinions stated in Kesavananda Bharati (supra) and <a href="/doc/1939993/" id="a_73">Minerva

Mills Ltd. and others v. Union of India</a> and others47, ruled

that the principle of implied limitation is attracted to the sphere

of constitutional interpretation.
</p>
<p id="p_66">45. <a href="/doc/199141576/" id="a_74">In Manoj Narula v. Union of India</a> 48 , the Court, while

interpreting <a href="/doc/1532170/" id="a_75">Article 75(1)</a> of the Constitution, opined that reading

of implied limitation to the said provision would tantamount to

prohibition or adding a disqualification which is neither expressly

stated nor impliedly discernible from the provision. Eventually,

the majority expressed that when there is no disqualification for a

person against whom charges have been framed in respect of

heinous or serious offences or offences relating to corruption to

contest the election, it is difficult to read the prohibition into

<a href="/doc/1532170/" id="a_76">Article 75(1)</a> by interpretative process or, for that matter, into

<a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_77">Article 164(1)</a> to the powers of the Prime Minister or the Chief

Minister in such a manner. That would come within the criterion


47   (1980) 3 SCC 625
48   (2014) 9 SCC 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                           44</span>


of eligibility and would amount to prescribing an eligibility

qualification and adding a disqualification which has not been

stipulated         in   the      Constitution.    In    the   absence     of    any

constitutional           prohibition       or    statutory    embargo,         such

disqualification cannot be read into <a href="/doc/1532170/" id="a_78">Article 75(1)</a> or <a href="/doc/381339/" id="a_79">Article 164(1)</a>

of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_67">46. Another aspect that was highlighted in Manoj Narula

(supra) pertained to constitutional implication and it was

observed that the said principle of implication is fundamentally

founded on rational inference of an idea from the words used in

the      text.    The     concept     of   legitimate    deduction   is    always

recognised. <a href="/doc/29141701/" id="a_80">In Melbourne Corporation v. Commonwealth</a> 49 ,

Dixon, J. opined that constitutional implication should be based

on considerations which are                     compelling. Mason, C.J., in

Australian Capital Television Pty. Limited and others and

the State of New South Wales v. The Commonwealth of

Australia and another 50 [Political Advertising case], has

ruled that there can be structural implications which are

―logically or practically necessary for the preservation of the

integrity of that structure‖. Any proposition that is arrived at

50   [1992] 177 CLR 106 (Aust)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                45</span>


taking this route of interpretation must find some resting pillar or

strength on the basis of certain words in the text or the scheme

of the text. In the absence of the same, it may not be permissible

for a Court to deduce any proposition as that would defeat the

legitimacy of reasoning. A proposition can be established by

reading a number of articles cohesively, for that will be in the

domain of substantive legitimacy. Elaborating further, the Court

proceeded to state that the said process has its own limitation for

the Court cannot rewrite a constitutional provision. To justify the

adoption of the said method of interpretation, there has to be a

constitutional foundation.
</p>
<p id="p_68">47. <a href="/doc/1903935/" id="a_81">In Kuldip Nayar and others v. Union of India</a> and

others51, a Constitution Bench, while interpreting <a href="/doc/1864214/" id="a_82">Article 80</a> of

the Constitution of India, relied upon a passage from <a href="/doc/91294/" id="a_83">G.

Narayanaswami v. G. Pannerselvam</a> and others52. The said

authority clearly lays down that Courts should interpret in a

broad and generous spirit the document which contains the

fundamental law of the land. The Court observed that it may be

desirable to give a broad and generous construction to the

constitutional provisions, but while doing so, the rule of ―plain

52   (1972) 3 SCC 717

meaning‖ or ―literal‖ interpretation, which remains ―the primary

rule‖, has also to be kept in mind. In the context of <a href="/doc/622840/" id="a_84">Article 80(4)</a>

of the Constitution in the context of ―the representatives of each

State‖, the Court repelled the argument that it is inherent in the

expression ―representative‖ that he/she must first necessarily be

an elector in the State. It ruled that the ―representative‖ of the

State is the person chosen by the electors who can be any person

who, in the opinion of the electors, is fit to represent them.

</p><p id="p_69">48. The Court, in <a href="/doc/4572688/" id="a_85">Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal

Sheth and another</a> 53 , ruled that it is to be remembered that

when the Court interprets a constitutional provision, it breathes

life into the inert words used in the founding document. The

problem before the Constitutional Court is not a mere verbal

problem. ―Literalness‖, observed Frankfurter, J., ―may strangle

meaning‖ and he went on to add in <a href="/doc/41737370/" id="a_86">Massachusetts Bonding &amp;

Insurance Co. v. United States54</a> that ―there is no surer way to

misread a document than to read it literally.‖ The Court cannot

interpret a provision of the Constitution by making ―a fortress out

of the dictionary‖. The significance of a constitutional problem is

vital, not formal: it has to be gathered not simply by taking the


53   (1977) 4 SCC 193
54   352 U.S. 128 (1956)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                              47</span>


words and a dictionary, but by considering the purpose and

intendment of the framers as gathered from the context and the

setting in which the words occur. The difficulty of gathering the

true intent of the law giver from the words used in the statute

was expressed by Holmes, J. in a striking and epigrammatic

fashion when he said: ―Ideas are not often hard but the words are

the devil55‖ and this difficulty is all the greater when the words to

be construed occur in a constitutional provision, for, as pointed

out by Cardozo, J., ―the process of constitutional interpretation is

in the ultimate analysis one of reading values into its clauses.‖

</p><p id="p_70">49. In this backdrop, it is necessary to state that the Court has

an enormous responsibility when it functions as the final arbiter

of the interpretation of the constitutional provision.

Constitution and constitutional limitation, separation of powers,

area of fundamental rights but are fundamental for constitutional

governance and the duty of the Court is not to transgress the

constitutional boundaries. We may immediately add that in the

case at hand, we are not concerned with the interpretation of

such constitutional provisions which have impact on the

fundamental rights of the citizens. We are concerned with the

interpretation of certain provisions that relate to parliamentary

privilege and what is protected by the Constitution in certain

articles. This situation has emerged in the context of the Court‘s

role to rely upon the reports of Parliamentary Standing

Committees in the context of the constitutional provisions

contained in Articles 105 and 122.

<p id="p_72">J.   A perspective on the role of Parliamentary Committees

</p><p id="p_73">51. It is necessary to understand the role of the parliamentary

standing Committees or ad hoc committees. They are constituted

with certain purposes. The formation of committee has history.

"Committees have been described as a primary organizational

device whereby legislatures can accommodate an increase in the

number of bills being introduced, while continuing to scrutinize

legislation; handle the greater complexity and technical nature of

bills under review without an exponential growth in size; develop

"division      of     labours"       among        members         for     considering

legislation...."56.
</p>
<p id="p_74">52. Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States,

was quoted as saying in 1885 that ―it is not far from the truth to

say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition,

whilst Congress in its Committee rooms is Congress at work57‖.

This is because most of the work of Congress was referred to

committees for detailed review to inform debate on the floor of the

House.

<p id="p_75">53. Former U.S. Representative James Shannon commented

during a 1995 conference on the role of committees in Malawi's

legislature:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "Around the world there is a trend to move
       toward more reliance on committees to conduct the
       work of parliament, and the greatest reason for this
       trend is a concern for efficiency. The demands on a
       modern parliament are numerous and it is not
       possible for the whole house to consider all the
       details necessary for performing the proper function
       of a legislature.58"

</p><p id="p_77">54. Lord Campion in his book59 has explained the dual sense in

which the word "Committee" was used in old parliamentary

language:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">         "In early days it is not the body as a whole but each
         single member that is meant by the term, 'the body
         is described as the committee' to whom the bill is
         committed. The formation of the terms is the same
         as that of any other English word which denotes the
         recipient in a bilateral relation of obligation, such as
         trustee, lessee, nominee, appointee. The body is
         usually referred to in the old authorities as
         'committee'. But it was not long before it became
         usual to describe the totality of those to whom a bill
         was referred as a 'committee' in an abstract sense.
         In both the English word emphasis the idea of
         delegation and not that of representation in which
         the German word aussehuss expresses."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">55. The utility of a Committee has been succinctly expressed by

Lord Beaconsfield60:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">         "I do not think there is anyone who more values the
         labour of parliamentary committees than myself.
         They obtain for the country an extraordinary mass
         of valuable information, which probably would not
         otherwise be had or available, and formed, as they
         necessarily are, of chosen men their reports are
         pregnant with prudent and sagacious suggestion for
         the improvements of the administration of affairs."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_79">56. The importance of Committees in today's democracy has

further been detailed thus61:-
</p>
<p id="p_80">

60   Lord Beaconsfield in Hansard, 3rd Series, Vol.235 (1877) p. 1478

         "Committees may not be of much service in the
         more spectacular aspect of these democratic
         institutions, and they might not be of much use in
         shaping fundamental policy, or laying down basic
         principles of government. But they are absolutely
         indispensable for the detailed work of supervision
         and control of the administration. Not infrequently,
         do they carry out great pieces of constructive
         legislation of public economy. Investigation of a
         complicated social problem, prior to legislation,
         maybe and is frequently carried out by such
         legislative committees, the value of whose service
         cannot be exaggerated. They are useful for obtaining
         expert advice when the problem is a technical one
         involving several branches within an organization,
         or when experts are required to advise upon a
         highly technical problem definable within narrow
         limits. The provision of advice based on an inquiry
         involving the examination of witnesses is also a task
         suitable for a committee. The employment of small
         committees, chosen from the members of the House,
         for dealing with some of the items of the business of
         the House is not only convenience but is also in
         accordance with the established convention of
         Parliament. This procedure is particularly helpful in
         dealing with matters which, because of their special
         or technical nature, are better considered in detail
         by a committee of House. Besides expediting
         legislative business, committees serve other useful
         services. Service on these committees keeps the
         members adequately supplied with information,
         deepens their insight into affairs and steady their
         judgment, providing invaluable training to aspirants
         to office, and the general level of knowledge and
         ability in the legislature rises. Committees properly
         attuned to the spirit and forms parliamentary
         government can serve the country well as the eyes
         and ears and to some extent the brain of the
         legislature, the more so since the functions and

      day."
</p>
<p id="p_82">57. Also, in the said book, the following observations have been

made with respect to the functions of Committees:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "As the committee system developed in the
      course of time the various functions of these bodies
      were differentiated into a few fixed types and a
      standard of size appropriate to each of these
      functions was also arrived at. These committees are
      appointed for a variety of purposes. One of the
      major purposes for which committees are appointed
      is the public investigation of problems out of the
      report upon which legislation can be built up.
      Secondly, committees are appointed to legislate.
      Bills referred to such committees are thoroughly
      discussed and drafted before they become laws.
      Example of such committees are the select
      committees in the Indian Legislature. Thirdly,
      committees are appointed to scrutinize and control.
      These committees are entrusted with the task of
      seeing whether or how a process is being performed,
      and by their conduct of this task they serve to
      provide the means of some sort of control over the
      carrying out of the process."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">58. Today parliamentary committee systems have emerged as a

creative way of parliaments to perform their basic functions. They

serve as the focal point for legislation and oversight. In a number

of parliaments, bills, resolutions and matters on specific issues

are    referred   to   specific   committees   for   debate    and

recommendations are made to the House for further debate.

Parliamentary committees have emerged as vibrant and central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                 53</span>


institutions   of   democratic   parliaments   of   today's   world.

Parliaments across the globe set up their own rules on how

committees are established, the composition, the mandate and

how chairpersons are to be selected but they do have certain

characteristics in common. They are usually a small group of

MPs brought together to critically review issues related to a

particular subject matter or to review a specific bill. They are

often   expected      to   present    their    observations     and

recommendations to the Chamber for final debate.

</p><p id="p_84">59. Often committees have a multi-party composition. They

examine specific matters of policy or government administration

or performance. Effective committees have developed a degree of

expertise in a given policy area, often through continuing

involvement and stable memberships. This expertise is both

recognized and valued by their colleagues. They are able to

represent diversity as also reconcile enough differences to sustain

recommendations for action. Also, they are important enough so

that people inside and outside the legislature seek to influence

outcomes by providing information about what they want and

what they will accept. Furthermore, they provide a means for a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                  54</span>


legislative body to consider a wide range of topics in-depth and to

identify politically and technically feasible alternatives.

K.     International position of Parliamentary Committees

</p><p id="p_85">60. Before we proceed to dwell upon the said aspect in the

Indian context, we think it apt to have a holistic view of the role

of Parliamentary Standing Committees in a parliamentary

democracy.
</p>
<p id="p_86">61. History divulges that Parliamentary Standing Committees

have been very vital institutions in most of the eminent

democracies such as USA, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,

etc. Over the years, the committee system has come to occupy

importance in the field of governance.
</p>
<p id="p_87">K.1 Parliamentary Committees in England

</p><p id="p_88">62. British parliamentary history validates that parliamentary

committees have existed in some form or the other since

the 14th century. Perhaps the committee system originated with

the ‗triers and examiners of petitions‘ – they were individual

members selected for drawing up legislations to carry into effect

citizens‘ prayers that were expressed through petitions. By the

middle of the 16th century, a stable committee system came

into   existence. These     Parliamentary    committees       are sub-

legislative organizations each consisting of small number of

Members          of     Parliament      from     the House     of   Commons,

or peers from the House of Lords, or a mix of both appointed to

deal with particular areas or issues; most are made up of

members of the Commons. 62 The majority of parliamentary

committees are Select Committees which are designed to:-

               agencies;

               workings and rules of the House.

<p id="p_89">63. The         other    committees       such     as    ―Departmental   Select

Committees‖ are designed to oversee and examine the work

of individual         government         departments,        ―Topical    Select

Committee‖ examines contemporary issues of significance and

―Internal Select Committees‖ have responsibility with respect to

the day-to-day running of Parliament.63 It helps the Parliament to

have a very powerful network of committees to ensure executive

accountability.

volume and complexity of its work, the Senate divides its tasks

among 20 permanent committees, 4 joint committees and

occasionally          temporary        committees.         Although         the    Senate

committee          system       is   similar      to    that    of    the    House      of

Representatives, it has its own guidelines within which each

committee adopts its own rules.                        This creates considerable

variation among the panels. The chair of each committee and a

majority of its members represent the majority party. The chair

primarily controls a committee‘s business. Each party assigns its

own members to committees, and each committee distributes its

members among its sub-committees.64 The Senate places limits

on the number and types of panels any one senator may serve on

and chair. Committees receive varying levels of operating funds

and employ varying numbers of aides.                           Each hires its own

staff.      The majority party controls most committee staff and

resources, but a portion is shared with the minority.

</p><p id="p_93">65. The role and responsibilities of Parliamentary committees in

the United States of America are as follows:-

</p><p id="p_94">(i)      As     “little   legislatures,”       committees         monitor         on-going

governmental operations, identify issues suitable for legislative


64   See https://www.britannica.com/topic/Congress-of-the-United-States for details.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                        57</span>


review, gather and evaluate information and recommend courses

of action to their parent body.
</p>
<p id="p_95">(ii)    The Committee membership enables members to develop

specialized knowledge of the matters under their jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_96">(iii)   Standing       committees            generally      have       legislative

jurisdiction.      Sub-committees         handle specific areas of the

committee‘s work. Select and joint committees generally handle

oversight or housekeeping responsibilities.65

</p><p id="p_97">(iv) Several thousand bills and resolutions are referred to

committees during each 2-year Congress. Committees select a

small percentage for consideration, and those not addressed

often receive no further action. The bills that committees report

help to set the Senate‘s agenda.
</p>
<p id="p_98">66. When a committee or sub-committee favours a measure, it

usually takes four actions: first it asks relevant executive

agencies for written comments on the measure; second, it holds

hearings to gather information and views from non-committee

experts and at committee hearings, these witnesses summarize

submitted statements and then respond to questions from the

65 Other types of committees deal with the confirmation or rejection of presidential
nominees. Committee hearings that focus on the implementation and investigation of
programs are known as oversight hearings, whereas committee investigations examine
allegations of wrongdoing.

senators; third, a committee meets to perfect the measure

through amendments, and non-committee members sometimes

attempt to influence the language; and fourth, when the language

is agreed upon, the committee sends the measure back to the full

Senate, usually along with a written report describing its

purposes and provisions. A committee‘s influence extends to its

enactment of bills into law. A committee that considers a

measure will manage the full Senate‘s deliberation on it. Also, its

members will be appointed to any conference committee created

to reconcile its version of a bill with the version passed by the

House of Representatives.

K.3 Parliamentary Committees in Canada

</p><p id="p_101">67. The Parliament in Canada also functions through various

standing    committees      established   by Standing    Orders of

the House of Commons or the Senate. It studies matters referred

to it by special order or, within its area of responsibility in the

Standing Orders, may undertake studies on its own initiative.

There are presently 23 standing committees (including two

standing joint committees) in the House and 20 in the Canadian

Senate. 66 They, in general, examine the administration, policy

developments          and      budgetary         estimates       of        government

departments and agencies. Certain standing committees are also

given mandates to examine matters that have implications such

as official languages policy and multiculturalism policy.

K.4 Parliamentary Committees in Australia

</p><p id="p_102">68. The primary object of parliamentary committees in Australia

is to perform functions which the Houses themselves are not well

fitted to perform, i.e., finding out the facts of a case, examining

witnesses,       sifting     evidence,       and      drawing         up     reasoned

conclusions. Because of their composition and method of

procedure, which is structured but generally informal compared

with the Houses, committees are well suited to the gathering of

evidence from expert groups or individuals. 67 In a sense, they

'take Parliament to the people' and allow organisations and

individuals to participate in policy making and to have their views

placed on the public record and considered as part of the

decision-making process. Not only do committee inquiries enable


66 Special committees (sometimes called select committees), e. g., the Special Joint
Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada,
are sometimes established by the       House to study specific issues or to investigate
public opinion on policy decisions. They are sometimes called task forces but should not
be        confused       with       government        TASK          FORCES.          See

Members to be better informed about community views but in

simply undertaking an inquiry, the committee may promote

public debate on the subject at issue. The all-party composition

of most committees and their propensity to operate across party

lines are important features.68 This bipartisan approach generally

manifests itself throughout the conduct of inquiries and the

drawing up of conclusions. Committees oversee and scrutinise

the        Executive   and   contribute   towards   a   better-informed

administration and government policy-making process.              69   In

respect of their formal proceedings, committees are microcosms

and extensions of the Houses themselves, limited in their power

of inquiry by the extent of the authority delegated to them and

governed for the most part in their proceedings by procedures

and practices which reflect those which prevail in the House by

which they were appointed.

<p id="p_103">L.         Parliamentary Committees in India

</p><p id="p_104">69. Having reflected upon the parliamentary committees and

their role in other democracies, we may now proceed to deal

with the parliamentary committees in India. The long freedom

struggle in India was not just a movement to achieve freedom

from British rule. It was as much a movement to free ourselves

from the various social evils and socio-economic inequities and

discriminations, to lift the deprived and the downtrodden from

the sludge of poverty and to give them a stake in the overall

transformation of the country. It was with this larger national

objective that a democratic polity based on parliamentary

system was conceived and formally declared in 1936 as ―the

establishment of a democratic state,‖ a sovereign state which

would promote and foster ―full democracy‖ and usher in a new

social and economic order.
</p>
<p id="p_107">70. The founding fathers of the Constitution perceived that

such a system would respond effectively to the problems arising

from our diversity as also to the myriad socio-economic factors

that the nation was faced with. With that objective, in the

political system that we established, prominence was given to

the Parliament, the organ that directly represents the people

and as such accountable to them.
</p>
<p id="p_108">71. At this juncture, we may look at the origin and working of

the Parliamentary Committee. The committee system in India, as

has   been   stated   in   ―The   Committee   System   in   India   :

Effectiveness in Enforcing Executive Accountability‖, Hanoi

Session, March 2015, is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     ―The origin of the committee system in India can be
     traced back to the Constitutional Reforms of 1919.
     The Standing Orders of the Central Legislative
     Assembly provided for a Committee on Petitions
     relating to Bills, Select Committee on Amendments
     of Standing Orders, and Select Committee on Bills.
     There was also a provision for a Public Accounts
     Committee and a Joint Committee on a Bill. Apart
     from Committees of the Legislative Assembly,
     Members of both Houses of the Central Legislature
     also served on the Standing Advisory Committees
     attached to various Departments of the Government
     of India. All these committees were purely advisory
     in character and functioned under the control of the
     Government with the Minister in charge of the
     Department acting as the Chairman of the
     Committee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     After the Constitution came into force, the position
     of the Central Legislative Assembly changed
     altogether and the committee system underwent
     transformation. Not only did the number of
     committees increase, but their functions and
     powers were also enlarged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     By their nature, Parliamentary Committees are of
     two kinds: Standing Committees and Ad hoc
     Committees. Standing Committees are permanent
     and regular committees which are constituted from
     time to time in pursuance of the provisions of an
     Act of Parliament or Rules of Procedure and
     Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. The work of
     these Committees is of continuous nature. The
     Financial Committees, Departmentally Related
     Standing Committees (DRSCs) and some other
     Committees come under the category of Standing
     Committees. Ad hoc Committees are appointed for a

     specific purpose and they cease to exist when they
     finish the task assigned to them and submit a
     report. The principal Ad hoc Committees are the
     Select and Joint Committees on Bills. Railway
     Convention Committee, Joint Committee on Food
     Management in Parliament House Complex, etc.
     also come under the category of Ad hoc
     Committees.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_109">72. In the said document, it has been observed thus in respect

of the Standing Committees of Parliament:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">     ―Standing Committees are those which are
     periodically elected by the House or nominated by
     the Speaker, Lok Sabha, or the Chairman, Rajya
     Sabha, singly or jointly and are permanent in
     nature. In terms of their functions, Standing
     Committees may be classified into two categories.
     One category of Committees like the Departmentally
     Related Standing Committees (DRSCs), Financial
     Committees, etc., scrutinise the functioning of the
     Government as per their respective mandate. The
     other category of Committees like the Rules
     Committee, House Committee, Joint Committee on
     Salaries and Allowances, etc. deal with matters
     relating to the Houses and members.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_110">73. The functions of the Parliament in modern times are not

only diverse and complex in nature but also considerable in

volume and the time at its disposal is limited. It cannot,

therefore, give close consideration to all the legislative and other

matters that come up before it. A good deal of its business is,

therefore, transacted in the Committees of the House known as

Parliamentary Committees. Parliamentary Committee means a

Committee which is appointed or elected by the House or

nominated by the Speaker and which works under the direction

of the Speaker and presents its report to the House or to the

Speaker.

<p id="p_111">74. Founded on English traditions, the Indian Parliament‘s

committee system has a vital role in the parliamentary

democracy. Generally speaking, the Parliamentary committees

are of two kinds; standing committees and ad hoc committees.

Standing Committees are permanent and regular committees

which are constituted from time to time in pursuance of the

provisions of an Act of Parliament or Rules of Procedure and

Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. The work of these

Committees is of continuous nature. The Financial Committees,

Department Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) and some

other Committees too come under the category of Standing

Committees. The ad hoc Committees are appointed for specific

purposes as and when the need arises and they cease to exist as

soon as they complete the work assigned to them.                              70   The

parliamentary committees are invariably larger in size and are

recommendatory in nature. Be it stated, there are 24 Department

70The principal Ad hoc Committees are the Select and Joint Committees on Bills. Railway
Convention Committee, Joint Committee on Food Management in Parliament House
Complex etc also come under the category of ad hoc Committees.

Related Standing Committees covering under their jurisdiction all

the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India. Each of

these Committees consists of 31 Members - 21 from Lok Sabha

and 10 from Rajya Sabha to be nominated by the Speaker, Lok

Sabha and the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, respectively. The term of

office of these Committees does not exceed one year.

    Sabha

</p><p id="p_112">75. A close look at the functioning of these committees

discloses the fact that the committee system is designed to

enlighten Members of Parliament (MPs) on the whole range of

governmental    action     including defence,   external    affairs,

industry and commerce, agriculture, health and finance. They

offer opportunities to the members of the Parliament to realize

and comprehend the dynamics of democracy. The members of

Parliament receive information about parliamentary workings as

well as perspective on India‘s strengths and weaknesses

through   the   detailed    studies   undertaken    by     standing

committees. Indian parliamentary committees are a huge basin

of information which are made available to the Members of

Parliament in order to educate themselves and contribute ideas

to strengthen   the      parliamentary   system    and     improve
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                    66</span>


governance. The committee system is designed to enhance

the capabilities    of   Members         of   Parliament    to   shoulder

greater responsibilities and broaden their horizons.

</p><p id="p_113">76. As has been stated in the referral judgment with regard to

the Parliamentary Committee, we may usefully refer to the Rules

of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha (for short

‗the   Rules‘).   Rule   2   of   the    Rules defines     ―Parliamentary

Committee‖. It reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       ―2. (1) … ―Parliamentary Committee‖ means a
       Committee which is appointed or elected by the
       House or nominated by the Speaker and which

       presents its report to the House or to the Speaker
       and the Secretariat for which is provided by the Lok
       Sabha Secretariat.‖

</p><p id="p_121">78. Rules 77 and 78 of the Rules read as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     ―77. (1) After the presentation of the final report of a
     Select Committee of the House or a Joint Committee
     of the Houses, as the case may be, on a Bill, the
     member in charge may move—

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">       (a) that the Bill as reported by the Select

       Committee or to a new Joint Committee with the
       concurrence of the Council, either—

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       Provided that any member may object to any
       such motion being made if a copy of the report

        be made.

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">     (2) If the member in charge moves that the Bill as
     reported by the Select Committee of the House or
     the Joint Committee of the Houses, as the case may
     be, be taken into consideration, any member may
     move Motions after presentation of Select/ Joint
     Committee reports. 39 as an amendment that the
     Bill be re-committed or be circulated or recirculated
     for the purpose of eliciting opinion or further
     opinion thereon.

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">     78. The debate on a motion that the Bill as reported
     by the Select Committee of the House or the Joint

     taken into consideration shall be confined to
     consideration of the report of the Committee and
     the matters referred to in that report or any
     alternative suggestions consistent with the principle
     of the Bill.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_122">79. Rule 270 of the Rules, which deals with the functions of the

Parliamentary Committee meant for Committees of the Rajya

Sabha, is relevant. It reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     ―270. Functions.— Each of the Standing
     Committees shall have the following functions,
     namely—
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">     (a) to consider the Demands for Grants of the
     related Ministries/Departments and report thereon.
     The report shall not suggest anything of the nature
     of cut motions;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">     (b) to examine Bills, pertaining to the related
     Ministries/Departments, referred to the Committee
     by the Chairman or the Speaker, as the case may
     be, and report thereon;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">     (c) to consider the annual reports of the
     Ministries/Departments and report thereon; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     (d) to consider national basic long-term policy
     documents presented to the Houses, if referred to
     the Committee by the Chairman or the Speaker, as
     the case may be, and report thereon:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">     Provided that the Standing Committees shall not
     consider matters of day-to-day administration of the
     related Ministries/Departments.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_123">80. Rule 271 provides for the applicability of provisions relating

to functions. Rule 274 deals with the report of the Committee.

The said Rule reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">     ―274. Report of the Committee.— (1) The report of
     the Standing Committee shall be based on broad
     consensus.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">     (2) Any member of the Committee may record a
     minute of dissent on the report of the Committee.
     (3) The report of the Committee, together with the
     minutes of dissent, if any, shall be presented to the
     Houses.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_124">81. Rule 274(3) is extremely significant, for it provides that the

report of the Committee together with the minutes of the dissent,

if any, is to be presented to the House. Rule 277 stipulates that

the report is to have persuasive value. In this context, Rule 277 is

worth quoting:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">     ―277. Reports to have persuasive value.— The
     report of a Standing Committee shall have
     persuasive value and shall be treated as considered
     advice given by the Committee.‖‖

         The aforesaid rule makes it quite vivid that the report of the

Committee is treated as an advice given by the Committee and it

is meant for the Parliament.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">M.       Parliamentary privilege

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">82. Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Ed., 1990, p. 1197, defines

―privilege‖ as "a particular and peculiar benefit or advantage

enjoyed by a person, company, or class, beyond the common

advantages of other citizens. An exceptional or extraordinary

power or exemption. A peculiar right, advantage, exemption,

power, franchise, or immunity held by a person or class, not

generally possessed by others."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_125">83. Parliamentary privilege is defined by author Erskine May in

Erskine May's Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and

Usage of Parliament:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">           ―Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar
           rights enjoyed by each House collectively... and by
           Members of each House individually, without
           which they could not discharge their functions,
           and which exceed those possessed by other bodies
           or individuals. Thus privilege, though part of the
           law of the land, is to a certain extent an exemption
           from the general law.‖71

</blockquote><p id="p_126">84. The concept of Parliamentary Privilege has its origin in

Westminster, Britain in the 17th century with the passage of the

71   May, 22nd ed., p. 65. For other definitions of privilege, see Maingot, 2nd ed., pp. 12-3.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                        72</span>


Bill of Rights in 1689. Article IX of the Bill of Rights, which laid

down the concept of Parliamentary Privilege, reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">             ―That the freedom of speech and debates or
             proceedings in Parliament ought not to be
             impeached or questioned in any court or place
             out of Parliament.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_127">85. Parliamentary Privilege was introduced to prevent any

undue interference in the working of the Parliament and thereby

enable the members of the Parliament to function effectively and

efficiently       without       unreasonable   impediment.   Till   date,

Parliamentary Privilege remains an important feature in any

parliamentary democracy. The concept of Parliamentary Privilege

requires a balancing act of two opposite arguments as noted by

Thomas Erskine May:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">             ―On the one hand, the privileges of Parliament
             are rights 'absolutely necessary for the due
             execution of its powers'; and on the other, the
             privilege of Parliament granted in regard of
             public service 'must not be used for the danger
             of the commonwealth.‖72

M.1 Parliamentary privilege under the Indian Constitution

</blockquote><p id="p_128">86. Having dealt with the role of the Parliamentary Standing

Committee or Parliamentary Committees, it is necessary to

understand the status of Parliamentary Committee and the

privileges it enjoys in the Indian context. <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_87">Article 105</a> of the
72   Erskine May 24th Edition Pg. 209
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                 73</span>


Constitution   of   India,   being   relevant   in   this   context,   is

reproduced below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">     “<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_88">Article 105.</a> Powers, privileges, etc of the
     Houses of Parliament and of the members and
     committees thereof
     (1) Subject to the provisions of this constitution and
     the rules and standing orders regulating the
     procedure of Parliament, there shall be freedom of
     speech in Parliament
     (2) No member of Parliament shall be liable to any
     proceedings in any court in respect of anything said
     or any vote given by him in Parliament or any
     committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable
     in respect of the publication by or under the
     authority of either House of Parliament of any
     report, paper, votes or proceedings
     (3) In other respects, the powers, privileges and
     immunities of each House of Parliament, and of the
     members and the committees of each House, shall
     be such as may from time to time be defined by
     Parliament by law, and, until so defined shall be
     those of that House and of its members and
     committees immediately before the coming into
     force of Section 15 of the Constitution (Forty fourth
     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_89">Amendment) Act</a> 1978
     (4) The provisions of clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall
     apply in relation to persons who by virtue of this
     Constitution have the right to speak in, and
     otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, a
     House of Parliament or any committee thereof as
     they apply in relation to members of Parliament.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_129">87. Sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_90">article (2)</a> of the aforesaid Article clearly lays the

postulate that no member of Parliament shall be made liable to

any proceedings in any court in respect of anything he has said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                74</span>


in the committee.    Freedom of speech that is available to the

members on the floor of the legislature is quite distinct from the

freedom which is available to the citizens under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_91">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of

the Constitution. Members of the Parliament enjoy full freedom in

respect of what they speak inside the House. <a href="/doc/986670/" id="a_92">Article 105(4)</a>

categorically stipulates that the provisions of clauses (1), (2)

and (3) shall apply in relation to persons, who by virtue of this

Constitution, have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take

part in the proceedings of, a House of the Parliament or any

committee thereof as they apply in relation to the members of the

Parliament. Thus, there is complete constitutional protection. It

is worthy to note that <a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_93">Article 118</a> provides that each House of the

Parliament may make rules for regulating, subject to the

provisions of this Constitution, its procedure and the conduct of

its business. Condignly analysed, the Parliament has been

enabled by the Constitution to regulate its procedure apart from

what has been stated directly in the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_130">88. <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_94">Article 105</a> of the Constitution is read mutatis mutandis

with <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_95">Article 194</a> of the Constitution as the language in both the

articles is identical, except that <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_96">Article 105</a> employs the word

―Parliament‖ whereas <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_97">Article 194</a> uses the words ―Legislature of a

State‖. Therefore, the interpretation of one of these articles would

invariably apply to the other and vice versa.

</p><p id="p_131">89. In U.P. Assembly case [Special Reference No. 1 of 1964]73,

the controversy pertained to the privileges of the House in

relation to the fundamental rights of the citizens. The decision

expressly started that the Court was not dealing with the internal

proceedings of the House. We may profitably reproduce two

passages from the said judgment:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">         ―108. … The obvious answer to this contention is
         that we are not dealing with any matter relating to
         the internal management of the House in the
         present proceedings. We are dealing with the power
         of the House to punish citizens for contempt alleged
         to have been committed by them outside, the four
         walls of the House, and that essentially raises
         different considerations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">               x         x          x           x          x

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_55">         141. In conclusion, we ought to add that
         throughout our discussion we have consistently
         attempted to make it clear that the main point
         which we are discussing is the right of the House to
         claim that a general warrant issued by it in respect
         of its contempt alleged to have been committed by a
         citizen who is not a Member of the House outside
         the four walls of the House, is conclusive, for it is on
         that claim that the House has chosen to take the
         view that the Judges, the Advocate, and the party
         have committed contempt by reference to their
         conduct in the habeas corpus petition pending

     before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High
     Court. …‖

</blockquote><p id="p_132">90. The Court further observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">     ―43. … In this connection it is necessary to
     remember that the status, dignity and importance
     of these two respective institutions, the Legislatures
     and the Judicature, are derived primarily from 'the
     status dignity and importance of the respective
     causes that are assigned to their charge by the
     Constitution. These two august bodies as well as
     the Executive which is another important
     constituent of a democratic State, must function not
     in antinovel nor in a spirit of hostility, but
     rationally, harmoniously and in a spirit of
     understanding within their respective spheres, for
     such harmonious working of the three constituents
     of the democratic State alone will help the peaceful
     development, growth and stabilization of the
     democratic way of life in this country.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_133">91. In the said case, the Court was interpreting <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_98">Article 194</a> of

the Constitution and, in that context, it held:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">     ―31. … While interpreting this clause, it is necessary
     to emphasis that the provisions of the Constitution
     subject to which freedom of speech has been
     conferred on the legislators, are not the general
     provisions of the Constitution but only such of them
     as relate to the regulation of the procedure of the
     Legislature. The rules and standing orders may
     regulate the procedure of the Legislature and some
     of the provisions of the Constitution may also
     purport to regulate it; these are, for instance,
     Articles 208 and 211. The adjectival clause
     "regulating the procedure of the Legislature" governs
     both the preceding clauses relating to "the
     provisions of the Constitution" and "the rules and
     standing orders." Therefore, clause (1) confers on
     the legislators specifically the right of freedom of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                77</span>


     speech subject to the limitation prescribed by its
     first part. It would thus appear that by making this
     clause subject only to the specified provisions of the
     Constitution, the Constitution-makers wanted to
     make it clear that they thought it necessary to
     confer on the legislators freedom of speech
     separately and, in a sense, independently of Art.</blockquote><p id="p_134">
</p><p id="p_135">     19(1)(a). If all that the legislators were entitled to
     claim was the freedom of speech and expression
     enshrined in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_99">Art. 19(1)(a</a>), it would have been
     unnecessary to confer the same right specifically in
     the manner adopted by <a href="/doc/679324/" id="a_100">Art. 194(1);</a> and so, it would
     be legitimate to conclude that <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_101">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> is not
     one of the provisions of the Constitution which
     controls the first part of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_102">Art. 194</a>.‖

     Proceeding further, the Court went on to say that clause (2)

emphasises the fact that the said freedom is intended to be

absolute and unfettered. Similar freedom is guaranteed to the

legislators in respect of the votes they may give in the Legislature

or any committee thereof. Interpreting clause (3), the Court ruled

that the first part of this clause empowers the Legislatures of the

States to make laws prescribing their powers, privileges and

immunities; the latter part provides that until such laws are

made, the Legislatures in question shall enjoy the same powers,

privileges and immunities which the House of Commons enjoyed

at the commencement of the Constitution. The Constitution-

makers, the Court observed, must have thought that the

Legislatures would take some time to make laws in respect of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                 78</span>


their powers, privileges and immunities. During the interval, it

was clearly necessary to confer on them the necessary powers,

privileges and immunities. There can be little doubt that the

powers, privileges and immunities which are contemplated by

clause (3) are incidental powers, privileges and immunities which

every Legislature must possess in order that it may be able to

function effectively, and that explains the purpose of the latter

part of clause (3). The Court stated that all the four clauses of

<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_103">Article 194</a> are not in terms made subject to the provisions

contained in Part III. In fact, clause (2) is couched in such wide

terms that in exercising the rights conferred on them by clause

(1), if the legislators by their speeches contravene any of the

fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III, they would not be

liable for any action in any court. It further said:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">     ―36. … In dealing with the effect of the provisions
     contained in clause (3) of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_104">Article 194</a>, wherever it
     appears that there is a conflict between the said
     provisions and the provisions pertaining to
     fundamental rights, an attempt win have to be
     made to resolve the said conflict by the adoption of
     the rule of harmonious construction. …‖

</blockquote><p id="p_136">92. Dealing with the plenary powers of the legislature, the Court

ruled that these powers are controlled by the basic concepts of

the written Constitution itself and can be exercised within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                 79</span>


legislative fields allotted to their jurisdiction by the three Lists

under the       Seventh Schedule; but beyond        the   Lists, the

Legislatures cannot travel. They can no doubt exercise their

plenary legislative authority and discharge their legislative

functions by virtue of the powers conferred on them by the

relevant provisions of the Constitution; but the basis of the power

is the Constitution itself. Besides, the legislative supremacy of

our Legislatures including the Parliament is normally controlled

by the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution. If the

Legislatures step beyond the legislative fields assigned to them,

or while acting within their respective fields, they trespass on the

fundamental rights of the citizens in a manner not justified by

the relevant articles dealing with the said fundamental rights,

their legislative actions are liable to be struck down by the Courts

in India. Therefore, it is necessary to remember that though our

Legislatures have plenary powers, yet they function within the

limits prescribed by the material and relevant provisions of the

Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_137">93. Adverting to <a href="/doc/1690488/" id="a_105">Article 212(1)</a> of the Constitution, the Court

held that the said Article seems to make it possible for a citizen to

call in question in the appropriate court of law the validity of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                                     80</span>


proceedings inside the legislative chamber if his case is that the

said proceedings suffer not from mere irregularity of procedure,

but from an illegality. If the impugned procedure is illegal and

unconstitutional, it would be open to be scrutinised in a court of

law, though such scrutiny is prohibited if the complaint against

the procedure is no more than this that the procedure was

irregular. That again is another indication which may afford some

assistance in construing the scope and extent of the powers

conferred on the House by <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_106">Article 194(3).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_138">94. <a href="/doc/20615895/" id="a_107">In Raja Ram Pal v. Hon</a>’ble Speaker, Lok Sabha and

others 74 , the Court, after referring to U.P. Assembly case

(Special Reference No. 1 of 1964), observed that the privileges

of the Parliament are rights which are ―absolutely necessary for

the due execution of its powers‖ which are enjoyed by individual

members as the House would not be able to perform its functions

without unimpeded use of the services of its members and also

for the protection of its members and the vindication of its own

authority and dignity. The Court, for the said purpose, referred

to      May‘s      Parliamentary   Practice.   Parliamentary   privilege

conceptually protects the members of Parliament from undue

domain regard being had to the idea of sustenance of legislative

functionalism. The aforesaid protection is absolute.

M.2 Judicial review of parliamentary proceedings and its
    privilege

</p><p id="p_139">95. Commenting upon the effect of parliamentary privilege, the

House of Lords in the case of Hamilton v. Al Fayed75 pointed

out that the normal impact of parliamentary privilege is to

prevent the Court from entertaining any evidence, cross-

examination or submissions which challenge the veracity or

propriety of anything done in the course of parliamentary

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_140">96. With regard to the role of the Court in the context of

parliamentary           privileges,     Lord     Brougham,         in   the   case   of

Wellesley v. Duke of Beaufort                      76   , has opined that it is

incumbent upon the Courts of law to defend their high and

sacred duty of guarding themselves, the liberties and the

properties of the subject, and protecting the respectability and

the very existence of the Houses of Parliament themselves,

against wild and extravagant and groundless and inconsistent

notions of privilege.

</p><p id="p_142">97. The 1999 UK Joint Committee report offers a useful

analysis of the respective roles to be played by the Parliament

and the Courts in advancing the law of parliamentary privilege:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">         "There may be good sense sometimes in leaving well
         alone when problems have not arisen in practice.
         Seeking to clarify and define boundaries may stir up
         disputes where currently none exists. But
         Parliament is not always well advised to adopt a
         passive stance. There is merit, in the particularly
         important areas of parliamentary privilege, in
         making the boundaries reasonably clear before
         difficulties arise. Nowadays people are increasingly
         vigorous in their efforts to obtain redress for
         perceived wrongs. In their court cases they press
         expansively in areas where the limits of the courts'
         jurisdiction are not clear. Faced with demarcation
         problems in this jurisdictional no-man's land, the
         judges perforce must determine the position of the
         boundary. If Parliament does not act, the courts
         may find themselves compelled to do so."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_143">98. With respect to the position of parliamentary privileges and

the role of the Courts in Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada

in the case of New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia

(Speaker of the House of Assembly)77 opined that the Canadian

legislative bodies possess such inherent privileges as may be

necessary to their proper functioning and that the said privileges

are part of the fundamental law of the land and are, hence,

constitutional. Further, the Court observed that the Courts have


77   [1993] 1 SCR 319
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                83</span>


the power to determine if the privilege claimed is necessary to the

capacity of the legislature to function, but have no power to

review the correctness of a particular decision made pursuant to

the privilege. In the case of Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney

General)78, the Court has held that in order to prevent abuses in

the guise of privilege from trumping legitimate Charter interests,

the Courts must inquire into the legitimacy of a claim of

parliamentary privilege.
</p>
<p id="p_144">99. With respect to the review of parliamentary privilege, Lord

Coleridge, C.J., in the case of Bradlaugh v. Gossett79, observed

that the question as to whether in all cases and under all

circumstances the Houses are the sole judges of their own

privileges is not necessary to be determined in this case and that

to allow any review of parliamentary privilege by a court of law

may lead and has led to very grave complications. However, the

Law Lord remarked that to hold the resolutions of either House

absolutely beyond any inquiry in any court of law may land in

conclusion not free from grave complications and it is enough to

say that in theory the question is extremely hard to solve.

79   (1884) 12 QBD 271 (D)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                      84</span>


</p><p id="p_145">100. Sir William Holdsworth in his book 80 has also made the

following observations with regard to review of Parliamentary

privileges:-
</p>
<p id="p_146">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">          'There are two maxims or principles which govern
          this subject. The first tells us that 'Privilege of
          Parliament is part of the law of the land;' the second
          that 'Each House is the judge of its own privileges'.
          Now at first sight it may seem that these maxims
          are contradictory. If privilege of Parliament is part of
          the law of the land its meaning and extent must be
          interpreted by the courts, just like any other part of
          the law; and therefore, neither House can add to its
          privileges by its own resolution, any more than it
          can add to any other part of the law by such a
          resolution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">             On the other hand if it is true that each House is
          the sole judge of its own privileges, it might seem
          that each House was the sole judge as to whether or
          no it had got a privilege, and so could add to its
          privileges by its own resolution. This apparent
          contradiction is solved if the proper application of
          these two maxims is attended to. The first maxim
          applies to cases like Ashby v. White and Stockdale
          v. Hansard (A), in which the question al issue was
          the existence of a privilege claimed by the House.</blockquote><p id="p_147">

</p><p id="p_148">          This is a matter of law which the courts must
          decide, without paying any attention to a resolution
          of the House on the subject. The second maxim
          applies to cases like that of the <a href="/doc/26071083/" id="a_108">Sheriff of Middlesex
          (B), and Bradlaugh v. Gosset (D</a>), in which an
          attempt was made to question, not the existence but
          the mode of user of an undoubted privilege. On this
          matter the courts will not interfere because each
          House is the sole judge of the question whether,

</p><p id="p_150">     when or how it will use one of its undoubted
     privileges."
</p>
<p id="p_151">101. At this juncture, it is fruitful to refer to Articles 121 and 122

of the Constitution. They read as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">     “121. Restriction on discussion in Parliament:
     No discussions shall take place in Parliament with
     respect to the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme
     Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his
     duties expect upon a motion for presenting an
     address to the President praying for the removal of
     the Judge as hereinafter provided.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">     122. Courts not to inquire into proceedings of
     Parliament:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_64">     (1) The validity of any proceedings in Parliament
     shall not be called in question on the ground of any
     alleged irregularity of procedure.
     (2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom
     powers are vested by or under this Constitution for
     regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or
     for maintaining order, in Parliament shall be subject
     to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the
     exercise by him of those powers.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_152">102. As we perceive, the        aforesaid Articles are extremely

significant as they are really meant to state the restrictions

imposed by the Constitution on both the institutions.

</p><p id="p_153">103. In Raja Ram Pal (supra), a Constitution Bench, after

referring to U.P. Assembly case [Special        Reference No. 1 of

1964] (supra), opined:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">     ―267. Indeed, the thrust of the decision was on the
     examination of the power to issue unspeaking
     warrants immune from the review of the courts, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                               86</span>


    not on the power to deal with contempt itself. A
    close reading of the case demonstrates that the
    Court treated the power to punish for contempt as a
    privilege of the House. Speaking of the legislatures
    in India, it was stated: [U.P. Assembly case (Special
    Reference No. 1 of 1964),

      ―125. There is no doubt that the House has the
      power to punish for contempt committed outside
      its chamber, and from that point of view it may
      claim one of the rights possessed by a court of
      record.‖
                                 (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">    268. Speaking of the Judges‘ power to punish for
    contempt, the Court observed: [U.P. Assembly case
    (Special Reference No. 1 of 1964),]

       ―We ought never to forget that the power to
    punish for contempt large as it is, must always be
    exercised      cautiously,      wisely      and  with
    circumspection. Frequent or indiscriminate use of
    this power in anger or irritation would not help to
    sustain the dignity or status of the court, but may
    sometimes affect it adversely. Wise Judges never
    forget that the best way to sustain the dignity and
    status of their office is to deserve respect from the
    public at large by the quality of their judgments, the
    fearlessness, fairness and objectivity of their
    approach, and by the restraint, dignity and
    decorum which they observe in their judicial
    conduct. We venture to think that what is true of the
    judicature is equally true of the legislatures.‖

And again:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">    ―269. It is evident, therefore, that in the opinion of
    the Court in U.P. Assembly case (Special Reference
    No. 1 of 1964), legislatures in India do enjoy the
    power to punish for contempt. It is equally clear
    that while the fact that the House of Commons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                87</span>


     enjoyed the power to issue unspeaking warrants in
     its capacity of a court of record was one concern,
     what actually worried the Court was not the source
     of the power per se, but the ―judicial‖ nature of
     power to issue unspeaking warrant insofar as it was
     directly in conflict with the scheme of the
     Constitution whereby citizens were guaranteed
     fundamental rights and the power to enforce the
     fundamental rights is vested in the courts. It was
     not the power to punish for contempt about which
     the    Court    had    reservations. Rather,    the
     abovequoted passage shows that such power had
     been accepted by the Court. The issue decided
     concerned the non-reviewability of the warrant
     issued by the legislature, in the light of various
     constitutional provisions.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">104. After referring to various other decisions, the Court

summarized the principles relating to the parameters of judicial

review in relation to exercise of parliamentary provisions. Some of

the conclusions being relevant for the present purpose are

reproduced below:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">     ―(a) Parliament is a coordinate organ and its views
     do deserve deference even while its acts are
     amenable to judicial scrutiny;

     absolutism and it being the cardinal principle of our
     Constitution that no one, howsoever lofty, can claim
     to be the sole judge of the power given under the
     Constitution, mere coordinate constitutional status,
     or even the status of an exalted constitutional
     functionaries, does not disentitle this Court from
     exercising its jurisdiction of judicial review of
     actions which partake the character of judicial or
     quasi-judicial decision;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">     (c) The expediency and necessity of exercise of

determination of the legislative authority and not for
determination by the courts;
</blockquote><p id="p_154">(d) The judicial review of the manner of exercise of

</p><p id="p_157">(g) While the area of powers, privileges and
immunities of the legislature being exceptional and
extraordinary its acts, particularly relating to
exercise thereof, ought not to be tested on the
traditional parameters of judicial review in the same
manner as an ordinary administrative action would
be tested, and the Court would confine itself to the
acknowledged parameters of judicial review and
within the judicially discoverable and manageable
standards, there is no foundation to the plea that a
legislative body cannot be attributed jurisdictional
error;

the validity of the action of the legislature
trespassing on the fundamental rights conferred on

it is the duty of this Court to examine the merits of
the said contention, especially when the impugned

</p><p id="p_171">105. The aforesaid summarization succinctly deals with the

judicial review in the sense that the Constitutional Courts are not

prevented from scrutinizing the validity of the action of the

legislature trespassing on the fundamental rights conferred on

the citizens; that there is no absolute immunity to the

parliamentary    proceeding    under    <a href="/doc/1653644/" id="a_116">Article   105(3)</a>   of   the

Constitution; that the enforcement of privilege by the legislature

can result in judicial scrutiny though subject to the restrictions

contained in other constitutional provisions such as Articles 122

and 212; that <a href="/doc/953264/" id="a_117">Article 122(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1690488/" id="a_118">Article 212(1)</a> prohibit the

validity of any proceedings in the legislature from being called in

question in a court merely on the ground of irregularity of

procedure, and the proceedings which may be tainted on account

of substantive or gross illegality or unconstitutionality are not

protected from judicial scrutiny.
</p>
<p id="p_172">106. We are presently concerned with the interpretation of two

constitutional provisions, namely, Articles 122 and 105. It has

been submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the

petitioners that the reports of parliamentary committees have

various facets, namely, statement of fact made to the committee,

statement of policy made to the committee, statements of fact
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                 91</span>


made by Members of Parliament in Parliament and inference

drawn from facts and findings of fact and law and, therefore, the

Court is required to pose the question as to which of the above

aspects of the Parliamentary Committee Reports can be placed

reliance upon. The contention is structured on the foundation

that committee reports are admissible in evidence and in public

interest litigation in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_119">Article 32</a> for

interpreting the legislation and directing the implementation of

constitutional or statutory obligation by the executive.

N.       Reliance on parliamentary proceedings as external aids

</p><p id="p_173">107.       A Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1586918/" id="a_120">R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay81</a>,

after referring to various decisions of this Court and development

in the law, opined that the exclusionary rule is flickering in its

dying embers in its native land of birth and has been given a

decent burial by this Court. The Constitution Bench further

observed that the basic purpose of all canons of the Constitution

is to ascertain with reasonable certainty the intention of the

Parliament and for the said purpose, external aids such as

reports of special committee preceding the enactment, the

existing state of law, the environment necessitating enactment of


81   (1984) 2 SCC 183
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">                                 92</span>


a legislation and the object sought to be achieved, etc. which the

Parliament held the luxury of availing should not be denied to the

Court whose primary function is to give effect to the real

intention of the legislature in enacting a statute. The Court was

of the view that such a denial would deprive the Court of a

substantial and illuminating aid to construction and, therefore,

the Court decided to depart from the earlier decisions and held

that reports of committees which preceded the enactment of a

law, reports of Joint Parliamentary Committees and a report of a

commission set up for collecting information can be referred to as

external aids of construction.
</p>
<p id="p_174">108. In this regard, we may also usefully state that the speeches

of Ministers in Parliament are referred to on certain occasions for

limited purposes. A Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_121">State of West Bengal

v. Union of India82</a> has opined that it is, however, well settled

that the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying a Bill,

when introduced in Parliament, cannot be used to determine the

true meaning and effect of the substantive provisions of the

statute. They cannot be used except for the limited purpose of

understanding the background and the antecedent state of


82   AIR 1963 SC 1241
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                93</span>


affairs leading up to the legislation. The same cannot be used as

an aid to the construction of the enactment or to show that the

legislature did not intend to acquire the proprietary rights vested

in the State or, in any way, to affect the State Governments‘

rights as owners of minerals. A statute, as passed by the

Parliament, is the expression of the collective intention of the

legislature as a whole, and any statement made by an individual,

albeit a Minister, of the intention and objects of the Act cannot be

used to cut down the generality of the words used in the statute.

</p><p id="p_175">109. <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_122">In K.P. Varghese v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam</a> and

another83, the Court, while referring to the budget speech of the

Minister, ruled that speeches made by members of legislatures on

the floor of the House where a Bill for enacting a statutory

provision is being debated are inadmissible for the purpose of

interpreting the statutory provision. But the Court made it clear

that the speech made by the mover of the Bill explaining the

reasons for introducing the Bill can certainly be referred to for

ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied and the object

and the purpose of the legislation in question. Such a view, as

per the Court, was in consonance with the juristic thought not


83   (1981) 4 SCC 173

only in the western countries but also in India as in the exercise

of interpretation of a statute, everything which is logically

relevant should be admitted. Thereafter, the Court acknowledged

a few decisions of this Court where speeches made by the

Finance Minister were relied upon by the Court for the purpose of

ascertaining the reason for introducing a particular clause.

British Courts has been criticized by jurists as artificial and there

is a strong case for whittling down the said rule. The Court was of

the view that the trend of academic opinion and practice in the

European system suggests that the interpretation of a statute

being an exercise in the ascertainment of meaning, everything

which is logically relevant should be admissible which implies

that although such extrinsic materials shall not be decisive, yet

they should at least be admissible. Further, the Court took note

of the fact that there is authority to suggest that resort should be

had to these extrinsic materials only in case of incongruities and

ambiguities. Where the meaning of the words in a statute is

plain, then the language prevails, but in case of obscurity or lack

of      harmony        with   other   provisions   and   in   other   special

circumstances, it may be legitimate to take external assistance to

determine the object of the provisions, the mischief sought to be

remedied, the social context, the words of the authors and other

allied matters.

reports or speeches have been referred to or not referred to for

the purposes indicated therein and when the meaning of a

the passing of the legislation can be looked into in order to

ascertain the intention of the legislature. It is because the reports

</blockquote><p id="p_181">114. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Vasil 92 relied on

parliamentary materials to interpret the phrase ―unlawful object‖

in Section 212(c) of the Canadian Criminal Code. Speaking for

the majority, Justice Lamer (as he then was) said:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">         ―Reference to Hansard is not usually advisable.
         However, as Canada has, at the time of codification,
         subject to few changes, adopted the English Draft
         Code of 1878, it is relevant to know whether Canada
         did so in relation to the various sections for the
         reasons advanced by the English Commissioners or
         for reasons of its own.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">         Indeed, a reading of Sir John Thompson's
         comments in Hansard of April 12, 1892, (House of
         Commons Debates, Dominion of Canada, Session
         1892, vol. I, at pp. 1378-85) very clearly confirms
         that all that relates to murder was taken directly
         from the English Draft Code of 1878. Sir John
         Thompson explained the proposed murder sections
         by frequently quoting verbatim the reasons given by
         the Royal Commissioners in Great Britain, and it is
         evident that Canada adopted not only the British
         Commissioners' proposed sections but also their
         reasons.‖

recommended the taking over of Sapru House on the ground of

declining standard of the Institution.   Further, this Court took

note that it had already pointed out in an earlier part of this

judgment that in the present case, successive parliamentary

committees had found substance in the complaints received that

an institution of national importance        was suffering from

mismanagement and maladministration and in pursuance of

such PSC report, the Central Government acted on such findings.

</p><p id="p_184">116. In Kuldip Nayar (supra), certain amendments in the

<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_131">Representation of the People Act</a>, 1951 were challenged which

had the effect of adopting an open ballot system instead of a

secret ballot system for elections to the Rajya Sabha. Defending

the amendment, the Union of India submitted a copy of a Report

of the Ethics Committee of the Parliament which recommended

the open ballot system for the aforesaid purpose. The Committee

had noted the emerging trends of cross voting in elections for

Rajya Sabha and Legislative Councils in the State. It also made a

reference to rampant allegations that large sums of money and

other considerations encourage the electorate to vote in a

particular manner sometimes leading to defeat of official

candidates belonging to their own political party. In this context,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                 99</span>


the Court took note of the recommendations of the Committee

Report while testing the vires of the impugned amendment.

</p><p id="p_185">117. From the aforesaid, it clear as day that the Court can take

aid of the report of the parliamentary committee for the purpose

of appreciating the historical background of the statutory

provisions and it can also refer to committee report or the speech

of the Minister on the floor of the House of the Parliament if there

is any kind of ambiguity or incongruity in a provision of an

enactment. Further, it is quite vivid on what occasions and

situations the Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports or the

reports of other Parliamentary Committees can be taken note of

by the Court and for what purpose. Relying on the same for the

purpose of interpreting the meaning of the statutory provision

where it is ambiguous and unclear or, for that matter, to

appreciate the background of the enacted law is quite different

from referring to it for the purpose of arriving at a factual finding.

That may invite a contest, a challenge, a dispute and, if a contest

arises, the Court, in such circumstances, will be called upon to

rule on the same.
</p>
<p id="p_186">118. In the case at hand, what is urged by the learned counsel

for the petitioners is that though no interpretation is involved, yet
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                100</span>


they can refer to the report of the Parliamentary Standing

Committee to establish a fact which they have pleaded and

asserted in the writ petition. According to them, the committees

are constituted to make the executive accountable and when the

public interest litigation is preferred to safeguard the public

interest, the report assumes great significance and it is extremely

necessary to refer to the same to arrive at the truth of the

controversy. In such a situation, they would contend that the

question of aid does not relate to any kind of parliamentary

privilege. It is the stand of the petitioners that they do not intend

to seek liberty from the Parliament or the Parliamentary

Committee to be questioned or cross examined. In fact, reliance

of the report has nothing to do with what is protected by the

Constitution under <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_132">Article 105.</a> The court proceedings are

independent of the Parliament and based on multiple inputs,

materials and evidence and in such a situation, the parties are at

liberty to persuade the Court to come to a determination of facts

and form an opinion in law at variance with the parliamentary

committee report. The learned counsel for the petitioners would

further submit that advancing submissions relying on the report

would not come within the scope of parliamentary privilege.

O.   <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_133">Section 57(4)</a> of the Indian Evidence Act

</p><p id="p_187">119. The learned counsel for the petitioners propound that under

committee report can be judicially taken note of as such report

comes within the ambit of the said provision.

</p><p id="p_188">120. To appreciate the stand, it is necessary to scan the relevant

sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_135">Section 57</a> of the Evidence Act.     It reads as

follows:-

</blockquote><p id="p_189">121. <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_136">Section 57</a> is a part of Chapter III of the Evidence Act which

deals with "Facts which need not be proved". <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_137">Section 57</a> rests on

the assumption that the facts scripted in the thirteen sub-

sections are relevant under any one or more Sections of

Chapter II which deals with "relevancy of facts". Thus, <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_138">Section 57</a>,

by employing the words "shall", casts an obligation upon the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">                                  102</span>


Courts to take judicial notice of the said facts. <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_139">Section 57</a>, sub-

section (4) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_140">Evidence Act</a> casts an obligation on the Courts

to take judicial notice of the course of proceedings of Parliament.

</p><p id="p_190">122. This Court, in <a href="/doc/1045974/" id="a_141">Sole Trustee Lok Shikshana Trust v.

Commissioner of Income Tax, Mysore</a> 95 , has observed that

<a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_142">Section 57</a>, sub-section (4) enjoins upon the Courts to take

judicial notice of the course of proceedings of Parliament on the

assumption that it is relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_191">123. There can be no dispute that parliamentary standing

committee report being in the public domain is a public

document. Therefore, it is admissible under <a href="/doc/1227984/" id="a_143">Section 74</a> of the

Evidence Act and judicial notice can be taken of such a

document as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_144">Section 57(4)</a> of the Evidence Act.

There can be no scintilla of doubt that the said document can be

taken on record.        As stated earlier, it can be taken aid of to

understand and appreciate a statutory provision if it is unclear,

ambiguous or incongruous.          It can also be taken aid of to

appreciate what mischief the legislative enactment intended to

avoid. Additionally, it can be stated with certitude that there can

be a fair comment on the report and a citizen in his own manner


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">95</span>
     (1976) 1 SCC 254
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">                                 103</span>


can advance a criticism in respect of what the report has stated.

Needless to emphasise that the right to fair comment is

guaranteed to the citizens. It is because freedom of speech, as

permissible within constitutional parameters, is essential for all

democratic institutions. Fair comments show public concern and,

therefore, such comments cannot be taken exception to. That is

left to public opinion and perception on which the grand pillar of

democracy    is     further   strengthened.      And,   in    all    such

circumstances, the question of parliamentary privilege would not

arise.
</p>
<p id="p_192">124. In the case at hand, the controversy does not end there

inasmuch as the petitioners have placed reliance upon the

contents of the parliamentary standing committee report and the

respondents submit that they are forced to controvert the same.

Be it clearly stated, the petitioners intend to rely on the contents

of the report and invite a contest. In such a situation, the Court

would be duty bound to afford the respondents an opportunity of

being heard in consonance with the principles of natural justice.

This, in turn, would give rise to a very peculiar situation as the

respondents would invariably be left with the option either to: (i)

accept,   without    contest,   the    opinion    expressed     in    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">                                  104</span>


parliamentary standing committee report and the facts stated

therein; or (ii) contest the correctness of the opinion of the

parliamentary standing committee report and the facts stated

therein. In the former scenario, the respondents at the very least

would be put in an inequitable and disadvantageous position. It

is in the latter scenario that the Court would be called upon to

adjudicate the contentious facts stated in the report. Ergo,

whenever a contest to a factual finding in a PSC Report is likely

and probable, the Court should refrain from doing so. It is one

thing to say that the report being a public document is

admissible in evidence, but it is quite different to allow a

challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_193">125. It is worthy to note here that there is an intrinsic difference

between parliamentary proceedings which are in the nature of

statement of a Minister or of a Mover of a bill made in the

Parliament for highlighting the purpose of an enactment or, for

that matter, a parliamentary committee report that had come into

existence    prior   to   the   enactment            of     a    law   and    a

contestable/conflicting    matter       of        ―fact‖     stated    in    the

parliamentary    committee      report.      It     is     the   parliamentary

proceedings falling within the former category of which Courts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                                  105</span>


are enjoined under <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_145">Section 57</a>, sub-section (4) to take judicial

notice of, whereas, for the latter category of parliamentary

proceedings, the truthfulness of the contestable matter of fact

stated during such proceedings has to be proved in the manner

known to law.
</p>
<p id="p_194">126. This again brings us to the hazardous zone wherein taking

judicial notice of parliamentary standing committee reports for a

factual finding will obviously be required to be proved for

ascertaining the truth of a contestable matter of fact stated in the

said report.
</p>
<p id="p_195">127. Taking     judicial notice   of    the   Parliamentary Standing

Committee report can only be to the extent that such a report

exists. As already stated, the said report can be taken aid of for

understanding the statutory provision wherever it is felt so

necessary or to take cognizance of a historical fact that is

different from a contest. The word ―contest‖, according to Black‘s

Law Dictionary, means to make defence to an adverse claim in a

Court of law; to oppose, resist or dispute; to strive to win or hold;

to controvert, litigate, call in question, challenge to defend. This

being the meaning of the word ―contest‖, the submission to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                               106</span>


adjudge the lis on the factual score of the report is to be

negatived.

Parliamentary Committee Report under the Chairmanship of K.P.

Tewari which had dealt with the question of abolishing the

contract labour system and regularizing the services of the

catering cleaners. The Committee had, inter alia, recommended

that the government should consider direct employment of

formation of new four Zones; the Standing Committee Report of

zones on the basis of work load, efficiency and effective

management and the Rakesh Mohan Committee Report which

had suggested that the formation of additional zones would be of

dubious merit and would add substantial cost and be of little

value to the system.

others98, the education policy framed by NCERT was challenged

by the petitioners. This Court while dealing with the said issue,

referred, in extensio, to the Parliamentary committee report which

had made several recommendations in this regard. After so

referring to the report, the Court was of the view that if the

recommendations made by the Parliamentary Committee are

accepted by the NCERT and are sought to be implemented, it

cannot be stated that its action is arbitrary or unjustified.

</p><p id="p_201">131. <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_149">In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a> and others99, this Court

referred to the report of the Standing Committee of Parliament on

Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas which expressed concern over the

phenomenal            rise   of   air    pollution   and   made   some

recommendations. The Court, in this case, made it clear that it

had mentioned the report only for indicating that the Government

was and is proactively supporting the reduction of vehicular

pollution by controlling the emission norms and complying with

the Bharat Stage standards.

<p id="p_202">132. In Lal Babu Priyadarshi v. Amritpal Singh 100 , while

dealing with a Trade Mark case under various sections of the

Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_150">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 [repealed by the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_151">Trade

Marks Act</a>, 1999 (47 of 1999), this Court referred to the Eighth

Report on the Trade Marks Bill, 1993 submitted by the

Parliamentary Standing Committee which was of the opinion that

any symbol relating to Gods, Goddesses or places of worship

should not ordinarily be registered as a trade mark.

</p><p id="p_203">133. The petitioners have also referred to other cases such as

<a href="/doc/366376/" id="a_152">Gujarat Electricity Board v. Hind Mazdoor Sabha</a> and

others101, <a href="/doc/99335142/" id="a_153">Modern Dental College and Research Centre and

<a href="/doc/304052/" id="a_154">Krishan Lal Gera v. State of Haryana</a> and others103 wherein

also this Court has made a passing reference to reports of the

Parliament Standing Committees.
</p>
<p id="p_204">134. We have, for the sake of completeness, noted the decisions

relied upon by the petitioners to advance their stand. But it is

condign to mention here that in the abovereferred cases, the

question of contest/challenge never emerged. In all the cases, the

situation never arose that warranted any contest amongst the

competing parties for arriving at a particular factual finding.

That being the position, the said judgments, in our considered

opinion, do not render any assistance to the controversy in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_205">135. We have distinguished the said decisions, as we are

disposed to think that a party can always establish his case on

101   (1995) 5 SCC 27
102   (2016) 7 SCC 353
103   (2011) 10 SCC 529
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">                               110</span>


the materials on record and the Court can independently

adjudicate the controversy without allowing a challenge to

Parliamentary Standing Committee report. We think so as the

Court has a constitutional duty to strike a delicate balance

between the legislature and judiciary. It is more so when the

issue does not involve a fundamental right that is affected by

parliamentary action. In such a situation, we may deal with the

concept of jurisprudential foundational principle having due

regard to constitutional conscience. The perception of self-evolved

judicial restraint and the idea of jurisprudential progression has

to be juxtaposed for a seemly balance. There is no strait-jacket

formula for determining what constitutes judicial restraint and

judicial progressionism. Sometimes, there is necessity for the

Courts to conceptualise a path that can be a wise middle path.

The middle course between these two views is the concept of

judicial engagement so that the concept of judicial restraint does

not take the colour of judicial abdication or judicial passivism.

Judicial engagement requires that the Courts maintain their

constitutional obligation to remain the sentinel on qui vive. It

requires a vigilant progressive judiciary for the rights and

liberties of the citizens to be sustained. Thus, as long as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                   111</span>


decision of a Court is progressive being in accord with the theory

of judicial engagement, the approach would be to ensure the

proper discharge of duty by the Constitutional Courts so as to

secure the inalienable rights of the citizens recognized by the

Constitution. A Constitutional Court cannot abdicate its duty to

allow injustice to get any space or not allow real space to a

principle that has certain range of acceptability. Stradford C.J.,

speaking the tone and tenor in Jajbhay v Cassim 104 , has

observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">         "Now the Roman-Dutch law, which we must apply,
         is a living system capable of growth and
         development to allow adaptation to the increasing
         complexities and activities of modern civilised life.
         The instruments of that development are our own
         Courts of law. In saying that, of course, I do not
         mean that it is permissible for a Court of law to
         alter the law; its function is to elucidate, expound
         and apply the law. But it would be idle to deny that
         in the process of the exercise of those functions
         rules of law are slowly and beneficially evolved."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_206">136.       In Miranda v. Arizona105, the Supreme Court of United

States observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">         'That the Court's holding today is neither compelled
         nor even strongly suggested by the language of the
         Fifth Amendment, is at odds with American and
         English legal history, and involves a departure from
         a long line of precedent does not prove either that

       the Court has exceeded its powers or that the Court
       is wrong or unwise in its present reinterpretation of
       the Fifth Amendment. It does, however, underscore
       the obvious -- that the Court has not discovered or
       found the law in making today's decision, nor has it
       derived it from some irrefutable sources; what it has
       done is to make new law and new public policy in
       much the same way that it has in the course of
       interpreting other great clauses of the Constitution.
       This is what the Court historically has done. Indeed,
       it is what it must do, and will continue to do until
       and unless there is some fundamental change in
       the constitutional distribution of governmental
       powers."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_207">137. In the Indian context, this Court has recognized the

comprehensive, progressive and engaging role of Constitutional

Courts in a catena of judgments starting from <a href="/doc/551554/" id="a_155">Lakshmi Kant

Pandey v. Union of India106</a>, <a href="/doc/1031794/" id="a_156">Vishaka and others v. State of

others110. In all these judgments, the dynamic and spirited duty

of the Supreme Court has been recognized and it has been

highlighted that this Court ought not to shy away from its

primary responsibility of interpreting the Constitution and other

statutes in a manner that is not only legally tenable but also

facilitates the progress and development of the avowed purpose of

the rights-oriented Constitution. The Constitution itself being a

dynamic, lively and ever changing document adapts to the

paradigm of epochs. That being the situation, it is also for this

Court to take a fresh look and mould the existing precepts to suit

the new emerging situations. Therefore, the Constitutional Courts

should always adopt a progressive approach and display a

dynamic and spirited discharge of duties regard being had to the

concepts of judicial statesmanship and judicial engagement, for

they subserve the larger public interest. In the case at hand, the

constitutional obligation persuades us to take the view that the

Parliamentary Standing Committee Report or any Parliamentary

Committee Report can be taken judicial notice of and regarded as

admissible in evidence, but it can neither be impinged nor

challenged nor its validity can be called in question.

</pre><p id="p_220">of the Constitution in 2012 and 2013 have placed into focus the process

adopted for licensing vaccines1 to prevent cervical cancer. The petitioners

allege that the process of licensing was not preceded by adequate clinical trials

to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Nearly twenty four thousand

adolescent girls are alleged to have been vaccinated in Gujarat and before its

bifurcation, in Andhra Pradesh without following safeguards. The trials are

alleged to have been conducted under the auspices of a project initiated by the

Sixth respondent. The drugs are manufactured and marketed by the Seventh

and Eighth respondents. Each of them produces pharmaceuticals. The petition

calls into question the role of the Drugs Controller General of India and the

Indian Council of Medical Research. The administration of the vaccine is alleged

to have resulted in serious health disorders. Deaths were reported.

2          On 12 August 2014, a Bench of two judges formulated the questions

which would have to be addressed in the course of the proceedings.2 They are:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">                     “(i) Whether before the drug was accepted to be used as a
                          vaccine in India, the Drugs Controller General of India and
                          the ICMR had followed the procedure for said introduction?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">                     (ii) What is the action taken after the Parliamentary Committee
                          had submitted the 72nd Report on 30.8.2013?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_81">                     (iii) What are the reasons for choosing certain places in Gujarat
                           and Andhra Pradesh?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">                     (iv) What has actually caused the deaths and other ailments
                          who had been administered the said vaccine?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_83">                     (v) Assuming this vaccine has been administered, regard being
                          had to the nature of the vaccine, being not an ordinary one,
                          what steps have been taken for monitoring the same by the
                          competent authorities of the Union of India, who are
                          concerned with the health of the nation as well as the State
                          Governments who have an equal role in this regard?

                          proper consent has been              taken    from their
                          parents/guardians, as we have been apprised at the Bar
                          that the young girls had not reached the age of majority?</blockquote><p id="p_221">

</p><p id="p_222">                     (vii) What protocol is required to be observed/followed,
                          assuming this kind of vaccination is required to be carried
                          out?”



3          At the hearing, the petitioners relied upon the 81st Report of the

Parliamentary Standing Committee dated 22 December 2014. The petitioners

sought to place reliance on the Report so as to enable the Court to be apprised

of the facts and to facilitate its conclusions and directions. This was objected to.



4          The issue which arose before the Court was whether a report of a

Parliamentary Standing Committee can be relied upon in a public interest


2   Writ Petition (Civil) No. 558 of 2012

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">                                                       3</span>

litigation under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_165">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_166">Article 226.</a> If it could be adverted to, then an allied

issue was the extent to which reliance could be placed upon it and its probative

value. The then Attorney General for India, in response to a request for

assistance, submitted that reports of Parliamentary Standing Committees are

at best an external aid to construction, to determine the surrounding

circumstances or historical facts for understanding the mischief sought to be

remedied by legislation. The Union government urged that reports of

Parliamentary Standing Committees are meant to guide the functioning of its

departments and are a precursor to debates in Parliament. However, those

reports (it was urged) cannot be utilized in court nor can they be subject to a

contest between litigating parties.
</p>
<p id="p_223">

5          In an order dated 5 April 2017, a two judge Bench of this Court adverted

to Articles 105 and 122 of the Constitution and observed thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">                    “69. The purpose of referring to the aforesaid Articles is that
                    while exercising the power of judicial review or to place reliance
                    on the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee, the
                    doctrine of restraint has to be applied by this Court as required
                    under the Constitution. What is argued by the learned counsel
                    for the petitioners is that there is no question of any kind of
                    judicial review from this Court or attributing anything on the
                    conduct of any of the members of the Committee, but to look
                    at the report for understanding the controversy before us. The
                    submission “looking at the report,” as we perceive, is nothing
                    but placing reliance thereupon. The view of a member of
                    Parliament or a member of the Parliamentary Standing
                    Committee who enjoys freedom of speech and expression
                    within the constitutional parameters and the rules or
                    regulations framed by Parliament inside Parliament or the
                    Committee is not to be adverted to by the court in a lis.”3

6          The referring order notes that when a mandamus is sought, the Court has

to address the facts which are the foundation of the case and the opposition, in

response. If a Court were to be called upon to peruse the report of a

Parliamentary Standing Committee, a contestant to the litigation may well seek

to challenge it. Such a challenge, according to the Court, in the form of “an

invitation to contest” the report of a Parliamentary Committee “is likely to disturb

the delicate balance that the Constitution provides between the constitutional

institutions”. Such a contest and adjudication would (in that view) be contrary to

the privileges of Parliament which the Constitution protects. Hence according

to the Court:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_86">                      “73…we are prima facie of the view that the Parliamentary
                      Standing Committee report may not be tendered as a
                      document to augment the stance on the factual score that a
                      particular activity is unacceptable or erroneous. “



A substantial question involving the interpretation of the Constitution having

arisen, two questions have been referred to the Constitution Bench under <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_167">Article

B       Submissions


7       Leading the submissions on behalf of the petitioners, Mr Harish Salve,

learned Senior Counsel underscored the importance of three constitutional

principles:
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_6">(i)     Privileges of Parliament;
(ii)    Comity of institutions; and
(iii)   Separation of powers.


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_89">Based on them, the submission is that reference to what transpires in a

co-equal constitutional institution must be circumspect and consistent with due

deference to and comity between institutions. Freedom of speech and

expression is implicit in the working of every institution and it is that institution

alone which can regulate its own processes. In Parliament, what speakers state

is controlled by the House or, as the case may be, by its Committee and a

falsehood in Parliament is punishable by that institution alone. It has been urged

that if what is stated in a report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee were to

be impeached in a court of law, that would affect the control of the Committee

and of Parliament itself. The functions performed by Parliament and by the

judiciary as two co-equal branches are, it is urged, completely different.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_224">Parliamentary business is either for the purpose of enforcing accountability of

the government or to enact legislation. The function of judicial institutions is

adjudicatory. Courts resolve a lis on objective satisfaction and have a duty to

                                                                           PART B


act judicially. Courts would not, it has been urged, receive as evidence of facts

any material whose truth or integrity cannot be assailed in court.



8      On the above conceptual foundation, Mr Salve urged that the report of a

Parliamentary Standing Committee can be relied upon in a judicial proceeding

in two exceptional situations:
</p>
<p id="p_225">(i)   Where it becomes necessary for the court to examine the legislative history

      of a statutory provision;
</p>
<p id="p_226">(ii) As a source from which the policy of the government, as reflected in the

      statements made by a Minister before the House can be discerned; and

</p><p id="p_227">(iii) Reports    of   Parliamentary   Standing   Committees    are   meant    for

      consideration before Parliament and can only be regarded as “considered

      advice” to the House.
</p>
<p id="p_228">Except in the two situations enumerated above, no petition seeking a

mandamus can be brought before the court on the basis of such a report for the

reason that (i) No right can be founded on the recommendation of a House

Committee; and (ii) Relying on such a report may result in a challenge before

the court, impinging upon Parliamentary privileges.



9      Mr K K Venugopal, the learned Attorney General for India has supported

the adoption of a rule of exclusion, based on the privileges of the legislature,

separation of powers and as a matter of textual interpretation of the

Constitution. In his submission:
</p>
<p id="p_229">I          Committees of Parliament being an essential adjunct to Parliament, and

           their reports being for the purpose of advising and guiding Parliament in

           framing laws and the executive for framing policies, it would be a breach

           of privilege of Parliament to judicially scrutinize and/or review these

           reports for any purpose whatsoever;
</p>
<p id="p_230">II         The broad separation of powers, which is a part of the basic structure of

           the Constitution of India, would prevent Courts from subjecting the reports

           of Parliamentary Standing Committees to scrutiny or judicial review; and

III        A conjoint reading of Articles 105 and 122 of the Constitution would

           establish that, expressly or by necessary implication, there is a bar on the

           Courts from scrutinizing or judicially reviewing the functioning or reports of

           the Committees of Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_231">

10         Refuting the submissions which have been urged by the Attorney General

and on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned

Senior Counsel urges that there can be no objection to reliance being placed

on the Report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee where (as in the present

case) there is no attempt

</p><p id="p_232">    (i)     to criticize Parliament;
</p>

</pre><p id="p_233">(iii)   to breach a privilege of the legislating body.



The Report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee is (it is urged) relied upon

only for the court to seek guidance from it. The court may derive such support

in whichever manner it may best regard in the interest of justice, to advance a

cause which has been brought in a social action litigation. According to Mr

Gonsalves, the core of the submission (urged by Mr Salve) is that because his

clients object to the findings in the Report, it becomes a contentious issue. Mr

Gonsalves submits that this Court should not allow what in substance is an

argument for a black out against the highest court taking notice of the report in

its PIL jurisdiction. The submission is that the Court need not treat any of the

facts contained in the Report as conclusive except those that are permitted by

<a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_170">Section 57</a> of the Indian Evidence Act 1872. No mandamus is sought that the

recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee be enforced. The Court, it

has been urged, will not be invited to comment upon the Report even if it were

not to agree with the contents of the Report. Learned Counsel urged that the

legislative function of Parliament is distinct from the oversight which it exercises

over government departments. An issue of parliamentary privileges arises when

the court makes a member of Parliament or of a Parliamentary Committee liable

in a civil or criminal action for what is stated in Parliament. Such is not the

position here. Mr Gonsalves submitted that in significant respects, our

Constitution marks a historical break from the English Parliamentary tradition.

India has adopted the doctrine of constitutional supremacy and not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">                                         9</span>
                                                                               PART B


Parliamentary sovereignty, as in the UK. Hence, cases decided under the

English Common Law cannot be transplanted, without regard to context, in

Indian jurisprudence on the subject. The unrestrained use of parliamentary

privileges, it has been urged, stands modified in the Indian context, which is

governed by constitutional supremacy. In matters involving public interest or

issues of a national character, both the institutions – Parliament and the courts

– must act together. As a matter of fact, Parliament has placed the Report of its

Standing Committee in the public domain. It is ironical, Mr Gonsalves urges,

that in the present case, it is the executive which seeks to protect itself from

disclosure in the guise of parliamentary privileges. Finally, it has been urged

that the public interest jurisdiction is not adversarial and constitutes a distinctly

Indian phenomenon. Where the fulfilment and pursuit of a constitutional goal,

national purpose or public interest is in issue, both Parliament and the judiciary

will act in comity. No issue arises here in relation to the separation of powers or

breach of Parliamentary privilege. On the contrary, it has been submitted that

the approach of the respondents is not in accordance with the march of

transparency in our law.

11    Mr Anand Grover, learned Senior Counsel submitted that if there is no

dispute that a certain statement was made before Parliament or, as the case

may be, a Parliamentary Standing Committee, such a statement can be relied

upon as a fact of it being stated in Parliament. The truth of the statement is, in

the submission of the learned Senior Counsel, another and distinct issue. The

Report is uncontentious not as regards the truth of its contents but of it having

been made. The court in the exercise of its power of judicial review will not hold

that an inference drawn by a Parliamentary Committee is wrong. But the court

can certainly look at a statement where there is no dispute of it having been

made.

             of, a House of Parliament or any committee thereof as they

14    The first major principle which emerges from <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_172">Article 105</a> is that it expects,

recognizes and protects the freedom of speech in Parliament. Stated in a

sentence, the principle enunciates a vital norm for the existence of democracy.

Parliament represents collectively, through the representative character of its

members, the voice and aspirations of the people. Free speech within the

Parliament is crucial for democratic governance. It is through the fearless

expression of their views that Parliamentarians pursue their commitment to

those who elect them. The power of speech exacts democratic accountability

from elected governments. The free flow of dialogue ensures that in framing

legislation and overseeing government policies, Parliament reflects the diverse

views of the electorate which an elected institution represents.



15    The Constitution recognizes free speech as a fundamental right in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_173">Article

19(1)(a).</a> A separate articulation of that right in <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_174">Article 105(1)</a> shows how

important the debates and expression of view in Parliament have been viewed

by the draftspersons. <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_175">Article 105(1)</a> is not a simple reiteration or for that matter,

a surplusage. It embodies the fundamental value that the free and fearless

exposition of critique in Parliament is the essence of democracy. Elected

                                                                                      PART C


members of Parliament represent the voices of the citizens. In giving expression

to the concerns of citizens, Parliamentary speech enhances democracy. <a href="/doc/885308/" id="a_176">Article

105(1)</a> emphasizes free speech as an institutional value, apart from it being a

part of individual rights. Elected members of the legislature continue to wield

that fundamental right in their individual capacity. Collectively, their expression

of opinion has an institutional protection since the words which they speak are

spoken within the portals of Parliament. This articulated major premise is

however subject to the provisions of the Constitution and is conditioned by the

procedure of Parliament embodied in its rules and standing orders. The

recognition in clause (1) that there shall be freedom of speech in Parliament is

effectuated by the immunity conferred on Members of Parliament against being

liable in a court of law for anything said or for any vote given in Parliament or a

committee. Similarly, a person who publishes a report, paper, votes or

proceedings under the authority of Parliament is protected against liability in

any court. In other respects – that is to say, on matters other than those falling

under clause (1) and (2), Parliament has been empowered to define the powers,

privileges and immunities of each of its Houses and of its members and

committees. Until Parliament does so, those powers, privileges and immunities

are such as existed immediately before the enforcement of the 44th amendment

to the Constitution5. Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_177">Article 105</a> widens the scope of the protection

by making it applicable “in relation to persons” who have a right to speak in or

to take part in the proceedings before the House or its committees. The



5   The Constitution (44th amendment) Act, 1978 came into force from 20 June, 1979.

protection afforded to Members of Parliament is extended to all such persons

as well. Committees of the Houses of Parliament are established by and under

the authority of Parliament. They represent Parliament. They are comprised

within Parliament and are as much, Parliament.



16    <a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_178">Article 118</a> deals with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">            “118.(1) Each House of Parliament may make rules for
            regulating, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, its

<blockquote id="blockquote_93">            (2) Until rules are made under clause (1), the rules of
            procedure and standing orders in force immediately before the
            commencement of this Constitution with respect to the
            Legislature of the Dominion of India shall have effect in relation
            to Parliament subject to such modifications and adaptations as
            may be made therein by the Chairman of the Council of States
            or the Speaker of the House of the People, as the case may
            be.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">            (3) The President, after consultation with the Chairman of the
            Council of States and the Speaker of the House of the People,
            may make rules as to the procedure with respect to joint sittings

            preside.”



The procedure and conduct of business of Parliament are governed by the rules

made by each House. The rule making authority is subject only to the provisions

of the Constitution. Until rules are framed, the procedure of Parliament was to

be governed by the rules of procedure and Standing Orders which applied to

the legislature of the Dominion of India immediately before the commencement

of the Constitution (subject to adaptations and modifications).                  Rules of

ground of an irregularity or procedure. In a similar vein, a Member of Parliament

or an officer vested with authority under the Constitution to regulate the

procedure or the conduct of business (or to maintain order) in Parliament is

immune from being subject to the jurisdiction of any Court for the exercise of

those powers. Those who perform the task – sometimes unenviable – of

maintaining order in Parliament are also protected, to enable them to discharge

their functions dispassionately.

19    The provisions contained in Chapter II of Part V are mirrored, in the case

of the State Legislatures, in Chapter III of Part VI. The corresponding provisions

20    The fundamental principle which the Constitution embodies is in terms of

its recognition of and protection to the freedom of speech in Parliament.

Freedom of speech has been entrenched by conferring an immunity against

holding a Member of Parliament liable for what has been spoken in Parliament

or for a vote which has been tendered. The freedom to speak is extended to

other persons who have a right to speak in or take part in the proceedings of

Parliament. Parliament is vested with the authority to regulate its procedures

and to define its powers, privileges and immunities. The same protection which

the Committees constituted by each House. Parliament has been vested with a

complete and exclusive authority to regulate its own procedure and the conduct

of its business.

engrafted provisions to ensure institutional comity between Parliament and the

judiciary. Under <a href="/doc/598239/" id="a_185">Article 121</a>, the conduct of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of

a High Court in the discharge of duties cannot be discussed in Parliament

                 wide range of functions on the House’s behalf. Most notably
                 they have become over recent years the principal mechanism
                 by which the House discharges its responsibilities for the
                 scrutiny of government policy and actions. Increasingly this
                 scrutiny work has become the most widely recognized and
                 public means by which Parliament holds government Ministers
                 and their departments to account.”



The scope of deliberations or inquiries before a Select Committee is defined in

the order by which the committee is appointed. When a Bill is referred to a

Select Committee, the Bill constitutes the order of reference7. Select

committees are a microcosm of the House. During the course of their work,

Select Committees rely upon documentary and oral evidence8:

<blockquote id="blockquote_98">                 “Once received by the committee as evidence, papers
                 prepared for a committee become its property and may not be
                 published without the express authority of the committee.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_99">                 Some committees have agreed to a resolution at the beginning

Evidence which has been collected during the course of an inquiry is published

with the report of the committee9:

<blockquote id="blockquote_100">                 “It is usual practice of committees to publish the evidence

                 report to which the evidence is relevant. In the case of longer
                 inquiries, the evidence may be separately published during the
                 course of the inquiry. In such cases, however, that evidence
                 may be published again with the report. Additionally,

publication of evidence and empowers the Committee to direct that the

evidence or a summary be laid on the table. Evidence tendered before the

Select Committee can only be published after it has been laid on the table. The

Select Committee prepares its report on the Bill referred to it, under Rule 90.

Under Rule 91, the report of the Select Committee on a Bill, together with

minutes of dissent, is presented to the Rajya Sabha by the Chairperson of the

Committee. Under Rule 92, the Secretary General must print every report of a

Select Committee. The report together with the Bill proposed by the Select

Committee has to be published in the Gazette. The rules contemplate the

procedure to be followed in the Rajya Sabha for debating and discussing the

report and for considering amendments, leading up to the eventual passage of

the Bill. In a manner similar to reference of Bills originating in the Rajya Sabha

to Select Committees, Bills which are transmitted from the Lok Sabha to the

Rajya Sabha may be referred to a Select Committee under Rule 125, if a motion

for that purpose is carried.

Department related Parliamentary Standing Committees are Committees of the

Houses of Parliament. The Committees can regulate their procedure for

requiring the attendance of persons and for the production of documents. The

Committees can hear experts or special interests. These Committees ensure

parliamentary oversight of the work of the ministries/departments of

government. As a part of that function, each Committee considers demands for

grants, examines Bills which are referred to it, considers the annual reports of

the ministry/department and submits reports on national long-term policy

documents, when they have been referred for consideration. The reports of

these Committees are published and presented to the Houses of Parliament.

E.1   UK Decisions


26    In the UK, a body of law has evolved around the immunity which is

</pre><p id="p_260">afforded to conduct within or in relation to statements made to Parliament

against civil or criminal liability in a court of law. The common law also affords

protection against the validity of a report of a Select Committee being

challenged in a court.
</p>
<p id="p_261">

27    <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_189">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights, 1689 declares that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_108">             “..That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in
             Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any
             court or place out of Parliament…”



Construed strictly, the expression “out of Parliament” will effectively squelch any

discussion of the proceedings of Parliament, outside it. This would compromise

to the need for debate and discussion on matters of governance in a

democracy. Hence, there has been an effort to bring a sense of balance: a

balance which will ensure free speech within Parliament but will allow a free

expression of views among citizens. Both are essential to the health of

democracy.

<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_190">Article 9</a> has provided the foundation for a line of judicial precedent in the

English Courts. In 1884, the principle was formulated In Bradlaugh v

Gossett12:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">                 “The House of Commons is not subject to the control of Her
                 Majesty’s Courts in its administration of that part of the Statute
                 law which has relation to its internal procedure only. What is
                 said or done within its walls cannot be inquired into a court of
                 law. A resolution of the House of Commons cannot change the
                 law of the land. But a court of law has no right to inquire into
                 the propriety of a resolution of the House restraining a member
                 from doing within the walls of the House itself something which
                 by the general law of the land he had a right to do.”



In Dingle v Associated Newspapers Ltd13, the above formulation was held to

constitute “a clear affirmation of the exclusive right of Parliament to regulate its

own internal proceedings”. Applying that principle, the Queen’s Bench Division

ruled that the report of a Select Committee of the House of Commons could not

be impugned outside Parliament. This principle was applied in Church of

Scientology of California v Johnson-Smith14, when an action for libel was

brought against a Member of Parliament for a statement made during the

course of a television interview. In order to refute the defendants’ plea of fair

comment, the plaintiff sought to prove malice by leading evidence of what had

taken place in Parliament. Rejecting such an attempt, the court adverted to the

following statement of principle in Blackstone:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">                 “The whole of the law and custom of Parliament has its origin
                 from this one maxim, “that whatever matter arises concerning
                 either House of Parliament ought to be examined, discussed,
                 and adjudged in that House to which it relates, and not
                 elsewhere.”

Reiterating that principle, the court held:</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_111">                   “…what is said or done in the House in the course of any
                   proceedings there cannot be examined outside Parliament for
                   the purpose of supporting a cause of action even though the
                   cause of action itself arises out of something done outside the
                   House.”



The decision involved a libel action brought against a Member of Parliament for

a statement made outside. The court rejected an attempt to rely upon what was

stated in Parliament to establish a case of malice against the defendant.

<p id="p_263">28         In Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart15, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held

for the House of Lords that there was a valid reason to relax the conventional

rule of exclusion under which reference to Parliamentary material, as an aid to

statutory construction, was not permissible. The learned Law Lord held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">                   “In my judgment, subject to the questions of the privileges of
                   the House of Commons, reference to Parliamentary material
                   should be permitted as an aid to the construction of legislation
                   which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of which
                   leads to an absurdity. Even in such cases references in court
                   to Parliamentary material should only be permitted where such
                   material clearly discloses the mischief aimed at or the
                   legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure
                   words.”



Holding that such a relaxation would not involve the court criticizing what has

been said in Parliament since the court was only giving effect to the words used

by the Minister, the court held that the exclusionary rule should be relaxed to

permit reference to Parliamentary materials where:

                   the statements relied upon are clear.”



29         The decision of the Privy Council in Richard William Prebble v

Television New Zealand (“Prebble”)16 arose from a case where, in a

television programme transmitted by the defendant, allegations were levelled

against the Government of New Zealand, involving the sale of state owned

assets to the private sector while the plaintiff was the Minister of the department.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_264">In his justification, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had made statements

in the House calculated to mislead. Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that the

defendant was precluded from questioning a statement made by the plaintiff

before the House of Parliament. The principle was formulated thus:

                   one manifestation, viz. that the courts and Parliament are both
                   astute to recognize their respective constitutional roles. So far
                   as the courts are concerned they will not allow any challenge

<blockquote id="blockquote_119">The Defamation Act, 1996 (UK) contained a provision in <a href="/doc/1544801/" id="a_197">Section 13</a> under which

an individual litigant in a defamation case could waive Parliamentary privilege.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_265">The report of the Joint Committee observed that the provision “undermined the

basis of privilege: freedom of speech was the privilege of the House as a whole

and not of the individual Member in his or her own right, although an individual

Member could assert and rely on it.” The waiver provision was deleted on the

ground that the privilege belongs to the House and not to an individual member.

The impact of the provisions of Section 13 of the Defamation Act, 1996 was

dealt with in a 2011 decision of the House of Lords in Hamilton v AI Fayed

(“Hamilton”)18. The defendant had alleged that as a Member of Parliament, the

plaintiff had accepted cash from him for asking questions on his behalf in the

House of Commons. The plaintiff commenced an action for defamation against

the defendant, waiving his parliamentary privileges pursuant to Section 13 of

the Defamation Act, 1996. Lord Browne-Wilkinson dwelt on parliamentary

privileges, which prohibit the court from questioning whether a witness before

Parliament had misled it. The House of Lords held that any attempt to cross-

examine the defendant to the effect that he had lied to a Parliamentary

committee when he had stated that he had paid money for questions would

have infringed parliamentary privileges. However, under <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_198">Section 13</a>, the plaintiff

could waive his own protection from Parliamentary privilege. The consequence

was thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">             “The privileges of the House are just that. They all belong to
             the House and not to the individual. They exist to enable the
             House to perform its functions. Thus <a href="/doc/1544801/" id="a_199">section 13(1)</a> accurately
             refers, not to the privileges of the individual MP, but to “the
             protection of any enactment or rule of law” which prevents the
             questioning of procedures in Parliament. The individual MP
             enjoys the protection of parliamentary privileges. If he waives
             such protection, then under <a href="/doc/1544801/" id="a_200">section 13(2)</a> any questioning of
             parliamentary      proceedings      (even    by     challenging
             “findings…made about his conduct”) is not to be treated as a
             breach of the privileges of Parliament.”



The effect of <a href="/doc/1544801/" id="a_201">Section 13</a> was that if a Member of Parliament waived the

protection, an assail of proceedings before Parliament would not be regarded

as a breach of privilege.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_266">30    The decision in Hamilton is significant for explaining precisely the

relationship between parliamentary privilege and proceedings in a Court which

seek to challenge the truth or propriety of anything done in parliamentary

proceedings. As the Court holds:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_121">             “The normal impact of parliamentary privilege is to prevent the
             court from entertaining any evidence, cross-examination or
             submissions which challenge the veracity or propriety of
             anything done in the course of parliamentary proceedings.</blockquote><p id="p_267">
</p><p id="p_268">             Thus, it is not permissible to challenge by cross-examination in
             a later action the veracity of evidence given to a parliamentary
             committee.”



But for the provisions of <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_202">Section 13</a>, evidence by Hamilton that he had not

received money for questions would come into conflict with the evidence

tendered by AI Fayed which was accepted by the Parliamentary Committees.

Hence it would have been impermissible to cross-examine Al Fayed to the effect

that he had falsely stated before the Parliamentary Committees that he had paid

money for questions. Such a consequence was obviated by the waiver

provisions of <a href="/doc/808094/" id="a_203">Section 13</a>.

31         In Toussaint v Attorney General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

(“Toussaint”)19, the Privy Council dealt with a case where a claim was brought

against the government by an individual claiming that the acquisition of his land

was unlawful. In support, he referred to a speech of the Prime Minister in

Parliament and a transcript taken from the video-tape of a televised debate. The

submission was that the true reason for the acquisition of the land, as evident

from the speech of the Prime Minister, was political. Adverting to Prebble, Lord

Mance, speaking for the Privy Council, noted that there were three principles

involved: the need to ensure the free exercise of powers by the legislature on

behalf of the electors; the need to protect the interest of justice; and the interest

of justice in ensuring that all relevant evidence is available to the courts. The

Privy Council held that it was permissible to rely upon the speech of the Prime

Minister though the attempt was to demonstrate an improper exercise of power

for extraneous purposes. As Lord Mance observed:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">                   “In such cases, the minister’s statement is relied upon to

                   although the aim and effect is to show that such conduct

            Browne-Wilkinson at p 639 A. The Joint Committee expressed
            the view that Parliament should welcome this development, on
            the basis that “Both parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review
            have important roles, separate and distinct, in a modern
            democratic society” (para 50) and on the basis that “The
            contrary view would have bizarre consequences”, hampering
            challenges to the “legality of executive decisions… by ring-
            fencing what ministers said in Parliament, and making
            “ministerial decisions announced in Parliament…less readily
            open to examination than other ministerial decisions”: para 51.</blockquote><p id="p_270">
</p><p id="p_271">            The Joint Committee observed, pertinently, that

                 “That would be an ironic consequence of
                 <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_204">article 9.</a> Intended to protect the integrity of the
                 legislature from the executive and the courts,
                 <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_205">article 9</a> would become a source of protection
                 of the executive from the courts.””



The Prime Minister’s statement in the House was “relied on for what it says,

rather than questioned or challenged”. This was permissible.



32    Toussaint is an important stage in the development of the law. A

statement made in Parliament by a Minister could be relied upon, not just to

explain the history of a law. Where there is a challenge to the exercise of

governmental authority on the ground that it is actuated by extraneous reasons,

a statement by a Minister in Parliament could be used in court in regard to

conduct outside Parliament. The challenge is not to a statement made in

Parliament but to governmental action outside. The statement would be relevant

to question an abuse of power by government.

33         In Regina (Bradley and Others) v Secretary of State for Work and

Pensions (Attorney General intervening)20, the Court of Appeal visited the

statement in Prebble that Section 16(3) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act,

1987 in Australia declared the true effect of <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_206">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights and

that <a href="/doc/1073892/" id="a_207">Section 16(3)</a> contained “the true principle to be applied” in the case.

Holding that the dictum in Prebble appears to be too wide, it was held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_123">                  “…But paragraph (c), if read literally, is extremely wide. It would

                  submissions rightly state, have been cited in a number of

                        made in Parliament without in any way
                        ‘questioning’ what has been said in Parliament,
                        without giving rise to difficulties inherent in treating
                        such statements as indicative of the will of

                  I therefore do not treat the text of paragraph(c) of the Australian

<blockquote id="blockquote_127">34         The decision of the Administrative Court in the UK in Office of

Government Commerce v Information Commissioner (Attorney General

intervening)21 involved a case where a department of government had carried

out reviews into an identity card programme. The case involved a claim for the

disclosure of information. The Court observed that the law of parliamentary

privilege is based on two principles: the need for free speech in Parliament and

separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">                   “...the law of parliamentary privilege is essentially based on two
                   principles. The first is the need to avoid any risk of interference
                   with free speech in Parliament. The second is the principle of
                   the separation of powers, which in our constitution is restricted
                   to the judicial function of government and requires the
                   executive and the legislature to abstain from interference with
                   the judicial function, and conversely requires the judiciary not
                   to interfere with or to criticise the proceedings of the legislature.
                   These basic principles lead to the requirement of mutual
                   respect by the courts for the proceedings and decisions of the
                   legislature and by the legislature (and the executive) for the
                   proceedings and decisions of the courts.

<blockquote id="blockquote_130">                   The above principles lead to the conclusion that the courts

                   lack of accuracy in the proceedings of Parliament. Such
                   allegations are for Parliament to address, if it thinks fit, and if
                   an allegation is well founded any sanction is for Parliament to
                   determine. The proceedings of Parliament include

             parliamentary questions and answers. These are not matters
             for the courts to consider.”



Yet, the Court also noticed the limitation of the above principles, when

proceedings in Parliament are relied upon simply as relevant historical facts or

to determine whether the legislation is incompatible with the European

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights which was embodied in the

<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_208">Human Rights Act</a> 1998 (“HRA”) in the UK. In that context the Court observed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_131">             “However, it is also important to recognise the limitations of
             these principles. There is no reason why the courts should not
             receive evidence of the proceedings of Parliament when they
             are simply relevant historical facts or events; no “questioning”
             arises in such a case… Similarly, it is of the essence of the
             judicial function that the courts should determine issues of law
             arising from legislation and delegated legislation. Thus, there
             can be no suggestion of a breach of parliamentary privilege if
             the courts decide that legislation is incompatible with the
             European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
             Fundamental Freedoms: by enacting the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_209">Human Rights Act</a>
             1998…”



The Court held that the conclusions of the report of a Committee that had led to

legislation could well be relied upon since the purpose of the reference is either

historical or made with a view to ascertaining the mischief at which the

legislation was aimed. If the evidence given to a Committee is uncontentious –

the parties being in agreement that it is true and accurate - there could be no

objection to it being taken into account. What the Tribunal could not do was to

refer to contentious evidence given to a Parliamentary Committee or the finding

of the Committee on an issue which the Tribunal had to determine.

35         The decision indicates a calibrated approach to Parliamentary privilege

consistent with the enactment of the HRA. The doctrine of incompatibility

envisages a role for courts in the UK to assess the consistency of the provisions

of law with reference to the standards of the European Convention.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_272">Parliamentary supremacy does not allow the court to strike down legislation.

Yet the emergence of standards under the HRA has allowed for a distinct

adjudicatory role: to determine the compatibility of domestic law with reference

to European Convention standards, adopted by the HRA. To hold that this has

not altered the role of courts vis-à-vis Parliamentary legislation would be to miss

a significant constitutional development.



Wheeler v The Office of the Prime Minister22 was a case where there was a

challenge to a decision brought by the government to give notice of the intention

of the UK to participate in the Council Framework Decision on the European

arrest warrants. It was claimed that the government was precluded from issuing

a notification of its intention without holding a referendum. Holding that the plea

would breach Parliamentary privilege the Court held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_133">                  “…In substance, however, the claim is that, unless the House
                  of Commons organises its business in a particular way, and
                  arranges for a vote in a particular form, the courts must
                  intervene and either grant a declaration or issue an order
                  prohibiting the government from taking certain steps unless
                  and until there is such a vote. In my judgment, that would
                  involve the courts impermissibly straying from the legal into the

<p id="p_273">In Wilson v First County Trust Ltd23 the House of Lords observed that the

<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_210">Human Rights Act</a> 1998 had obligated the Court to exercise a new role in

respect of primary legislation. Courts were required to evaluate the effect of

domestic legislation upon rights conferred by the European Convention and

where necessary; to make a declaration of incompatibility. While doing so, the

Court would primarily construe the legislation in question. Yet, the practical

effect of a statutory provision may require the court to look outside the statute.

The court would be justified in looking at additional background information to

understand the practical impact of a statutory measure on a Convention right

and decide upon the proportionality of a statutory provision. In that context, the

Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_134">                  “This additional background material may be found in

                  other member of either House in the course of a debate on a
                  Bill, the courts must also be able to take this into account. The

36         The decision of the Privy Council in Owen Robert Jennings v Roger

Edward Wyndham Buchanan24 arose from the Court of Appeal in New

Zealand. The judgment recognises that while the protection conferred by <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_212">Article

9</a> of the Bill of Rights should not be whittled away, yet as the Joint Committee

on Parliamentary privileges (Chaired by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead) observed,

freedom to discuss parliamentary proceedings is necessary in a democracy:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_135">                 “Freedom for the public and the media to discuss parliamentary

                 choose within Parliament.”

Media reporting of Parliamentary proceedings, the Court held, has been an

important instrument of public debate. Hence the freedom of the Members of

Parliament to discuss freely within its portals must be weighed with the freedom

of the public to discuss and debate matters of concern to them:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_136">             “As it is, parliamentary proceedings are televised and
             recorded. They are transcribed in Hansard. They are reported
             in the press, sometimes less fully than parliamentarians would
             wish. They form a staple of current affairs and news
             programmes on the radio and television. They inform and
             stimulate public debate. All this is highly desirable, since the
             legislature is representative of the whole nation. Thus, as the
             Joint Committee observed in its executive summary (page 1):</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_137">                   “This legal immunity is comprehensive and
                   absolute. <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_213">Article 9</a> should therefore be confined to
                   activities justifying such a high degree of
                   protection, and its boundaries should be clear.””



These observations reflect a concern to define the boundaries of the immunities

under <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_214">Article 9</a> in clear terms. While recognizing the absolute nature of the

immunity, its boundaries must “be confined to activities justifying such a high

degree of protection”. The right of Members of Parliament to speak their minds

in Parliament without incurring a liability is absolute. However, that right is not

infringed if a member, having spoken and in so doing defamed another person,

thereafter chooses to repeat his statement outside Parliament. In such

circumstances, the privilege may be qualified. While it is necessary that the

legislature and the courts do not intrude into the spheres reserved to the other,

a reference to Parliamentary records to prove that certain words were in fact

uttered is not prohibited.</blockquote><p id="p_277">

</p><p id="p_278">             “In a case such as the present, however, reference is made to

             certain words were uttered. The claim is founded on the later
             extra-parliamentary statement. The propriety of the member’s
             behaviour as a parliamentarian will not be in issue. Nor will his
             state of mind, motive or intention when saying what he did in
             Parliament.”




37    The evolution of the law in the UK indicates the manner in which the

protection under <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_215">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights has been transformed. There are

essentially three principles which underlie the debate. The first is the importance

of the freedom of speech in Parliament. The absolute protection which is

afforded to what is done or spoken by a Member of Parliament in Parliament is

an emanation of the need to protect freedom of speech in Parliament. The

second principle which is at work is the separation of powers between

Parliament and the courts. This principle recognizes that liability for a falsehood

spoken in Parliament lies within the exclusive control of Parliament. A Member

of Parliament cannot be held to account in a court of law for anything which is

said or spoken in Parliament. A speech in Parliament would not attract either a

civil or criminal liability enforceable in a court of law. The third principle

emphasises that debates in Parliament have a public element. Public debate is

the essence of and a barometer to the health of democracy. Though the

privilege which attaches to a speech in Parliament is absolute, the immunity

extends to those activities within Parliament, which justify a high degree of

protection. As Parliamentary proceedings have come to be widely reported,

published and televised, the common law has come to recognize that a mere

reference to or production of a record of what has been stated in Parliament

does not infringe <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_216">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights. In other words, a reference to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">                                              39</span>
                                                                              PART E


Parliamentary record to prove a historical fact that certain words were spoken

is not prohibited. What is impermissible is to question the truthfulness or veracity

of what was stated before Parliament in any forum including a court, outside

Parliament. Nor can a Member of Parliament be cross-examined in a

proceeding before the court with reference to what was stated in Parliament.

The validity of an Act of Parliament or of the proceedings of a Parliamentary

Committee cannot be questioned in a court in the UK. The enactment of the

<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_217">Human Rights Act</a> has led to a recognition that in testing whether a statutory

provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may become necessary for

the court to adjudge the practical effects of a law. To do so, the court may

legitimately have reference to background material which elucidates the

rationale for the law, the social purpose which it has sought to achieve and the

proportionality of its imposition. In order to understand the facets of the law

which bear upon rights protected under the European Convention, the court

may justifiably seek recourse to statements of ministers, policy documents and

white papers to find meaning in the words of the statute. The law in the UK has

hence developed to recognize that free speech in Parliament and separation of

powers must be placed in a scale of interpretation that is cognizant of the need

to protect the democratic rights of citizens.

speech in Parliament, the principle of separation of powers and the concomitant

protection afforded to members from being held liable for what is spoken in

Parliament. Principles grounded in the common law in the UK have not

remained just in the realm of common law. The Constitution, in recognizing

many of those principles imparts sanctity to them in a manner which only the

text of a fundamental written charter for governance can provide. Separation

of powers is part of the basic structure. Our precedent on the subject notices

the qualitative difference between Parliamentary democracy in the UK and in

India. The fundamental difference arises from the supremacy of the Indian

Constitution which subjects all constitutional authorities to the mandate of a

written Constitution.

39      The locus classicus on the subject of parliamentary privileges is the

seven-judge Bench decision in Re: Powers, Privileges and Immunities of

House to construe <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_218">Article 194(3)</a> and to determine the width of the privileges,

powers and immunities enables the House to determine questions relating to

the existence and extent of its powers and privileges, unfettered by the views

of the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Gajendragadkar, held that it was necessary

to determine whether even in the matter of privileges, the Constitution confers

on the House a sole and exclusive jurisdiction. The decision recognizes that

federal structure and the supremacy of the Constitution is fundamental to

preserving the delicate balance of power between constituent units:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_138">             “38. …it is necessary to bear in mind one fundamental feature
             of a federal constitution. In England, Parliament is sovereign;
             and in the words of Dicey, the three distinguishing features of
             the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty are that Parliament
             has the right to make or unmake any law whatever; that no
             person or body is recognized by the law of England as having
             a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament, and
             that the right or power of Parliament extends to every part of
             the Queen’s dominions. On the other hand, the essential
             characteristic of federalism is “the distribution of limited
             executive, legislative and judicial authority among bodies
             which are co-ordinate with and independent of each other”.
             The supremacy of the Constitution is fundamental to the
             existence of a federal State in order to prevent either the
             legislatures of the federal unit or those of the member States
             from destroying or impairing that delicate balance of power
             which satisfied the particular requirements of States which are
             desirous of union, but not prepared to merge their individuality
             in a unity. This supremacy of the constitution is protected by
             the authority of an independent judicial body to act as the
             interpreter of a scheme of distribution of powers. Nor is any
             change possible in the constitution by the ordinary process of
             federal or State legislation. Thus the dominant characteristic of
             the British Constitution cannot be claimed by a federal
             constitution like ours”.

The minority view was of Justices S C Agrawal and Dr A S Anand. In construing

the scope of the immunity conferred by <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_221">Article 105(2</a>), Justice Bharucha

adverted to judgments delivered by courts in the United Kingdom (including

those of the Privy Council noted earlier27). Interpreting <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_222">Article 105(2</a>), Justice

Bharucha observed thus:

(who were members of the legislature) to defeat a motion of no confidence by

obtaining illegal gratification in pursuance of which bribes were given and

motivation. The submission of the Attorney General for India that the protection

under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_227">Article 105(2)</a> is limited to court proceedings and to a speech that is given

or a vote that is cast was not accepted by the Constitution Bench for the

following reasons:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_140">                    “136. It is difficult to agree with the learned Attorney General
                    that though the words “in respect of” must receive a broad
                    meaning, the protection under <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_228">Article 105(2)</a> is limited to court
                    proceedings that impugn the speech that is given or the vote
                    that is cast or arises thereout or that the object of the protection
                    would be fully satisfied thereby. The object of the protection is
                    to enable Members to speak their mind in Parliament and vote
                    in the same way, freed of the fear of being made answerable
                    on that account in a court of law. It is not enough that Members
                    should be protected against civil action and criminal
                    proceedings, the cause of action of which is their speech or
                    their vote. To enable Members to participate fearlessly in
                    parliamentary debates, Members need the wider protection of
                    immunity against all civil and criminal proceedings that bear a
                    nexus to their speech or vote. It is for that reason that a
                    Member is not “liable to any proceedings in any court in respect
                    of anything said or any vote given by him”. <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_229">Article 105(2)</a> does
                    not say, which it would have if the learned Attorney General
                    were right, that a Member is not liable for what he has said or
                    how he has voted. While imputing no such motive to the
                    present prosecution, it is not difficult to envisage a Member
                    who has made a speech or cast a vote that is not to the liking
                    of the powers that be being troubled by a prosecution alleging
                    that he had been party to an agreement and conspiracy to
                    achieve a certain result in Parliament and had been paid a
                    bribe.”28



The view of the minority was that the offence of bribery is made out against a

bribe taker either upon taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in

a certain manner. Following this logic, Justice SC Agrawal held that the criminal

liability of a Member of Parliament who accepts a bribe for speaking or giving a

vote in Parliament arises independent of the making of the speech or the giving

of the vote and hence is not a liability “in respect of anything said or any vote

given” in Parliament. The correctness of the view in the judgment of the majority

does not fall for consideration in the present case. Should it become necessary

in an appropriate case in future, a larger bench may have to consider the issue.

While Parliament has the power to expel a member for a contempt committed,

the doctrine of “exclusive cognizance” adopted in the UK has no application in

India which is governed by a written Constitution. Though Parliament is

possessed of a plentitude of powers, it is subject to terms of legislative

competence and to the restrictions imposed by fundamental rights. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_233">Article 21</a> is

attracted when the liberty of a Member of Parliament is threatened by

imprisonment in execution of a parliamentary privilege. Fundamental rights can

parliamentary privilege in India from decided cases in the UK. The fundamental

difference between the two systems lies in the fact that parliamentary

sovereignty in the Westminster form of government in the UK has given way, in

the Indian Constitution, to constitutional supremacy. Constitutional supremacy

mandates that every institution of governance is subject to the norms embodied

in the constitutional text. The Constitution does not allow for the existence of

absolute power in the institutions which it creates. Judicial review as a part of

the basic features of the Constitution is intended to ensure that every institution

acts within its bounds and limits. The fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens

are an assurance of liberty and a recognition of the autonomy which inheres in

every person. Hence, judicial scrutiny of the exercise of parliamentary privileges

is not excluded where a fundamental right is violated or a gross illegality occurs.

In recognizing the position of Parliament as a coordinate institution created by

the Constitution, judicial review acknowledges that Parliament can decide the

expediency of asserting its privileges in a given case. The Court will not

supplant such an assertion or intercede merely on the basis of an irregularity of

procedure. But where a violation of a constitutional prescription is shown,

judicial review cannot be ousted.

 45       Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the

 judiciary covers a large swathe of constitutional history spanning the writings of

 Montesquieu and Blackstone, to the work of Dicey and Jennings.

 Gerangelos (2009) laments that in the UK, parliamentary sovereignty has

 prevented the principle of separation from emerging as a judicially enforceable

 standard35:

<blockquote id="blockquote_146">                  “Britain’s unwritten constitution and the influence of Diceyan
                  orthodoxy, emphasising parliamentary sovereignty and a fusion
                  of powers which did not countenance judicial invalidation of
                  legislative action, has meant that the separation of powers has
                  not become a source of judicially-enforceable constitutional
                  limitations. The precise status of the doctrine has varied from
                  time to time and the extent to which the doctrine nevertheless
                  provides some restraint on legislative interference with judicial
                  process cannot be determined with precision. It can be said,
                  however, that constitutional entrenchment of the separation
                  doctrine has not been part of the Westminster constitution

                  been the maintenance of judicial independence in terms of

                    power in a functional sense.”



The impact of the doctrine is seen best in terms of the institutional

independence of the judiciary from other organs of the state. The doctrine is

stated to have been overshadowed in the UK “by the more dominant

constitutional principles of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law”. For

instance, in the UK, Ministers of Crown are both part of the executive and

members of the Parliament. Until the Constitutional Reform Act, 2005 the Lord

Chancellor was a member of the Cabinet and was eligible to sit as a judge in

the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. The Judicial Committee of the

House of Lords was the highest court, even though the House constituted the

Upper House of the legislature. In the enforcement of parliamentary privileges,

the House exercises judicial functions. Delegated legislation enables the

executive to exercise legislative functions.



46         Many contemporary scholars have differed on the normative importance

of the doctrine of separation. One view is that while a distinct legislature,

executive and judiciary can be identified as a matter of practice, this is not a

mandate of the unwritten Constitution. The statement that there is a separation

is construed to be descriptive and not normative36. On the other hand, other

scholars regard the doctrine as “a fundamental underlying constitutional

principle which informs the whole British constitutional structure”37. Yet, even

scholars who emphasise the importance of the separation of powers in the UK

acknowledge that the Constitution does not strictly observe such a separation.

Courts in the UK do not possess a direct power of judicial review to invalidate

legislation though, with the enactment of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_241">Human Rights Act</a>, the doctrine of

incompatibility has become an entrenched feature of the law. Gerangelos

(supra) states that “the most that can be said is that the separation of powers

does play an influential role as a constitutional principle, but as a non-binding

one”.38 He cites Professor Robert Stevens39:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_147">                    “In modern Britain the concept of the separation of powers is
                    cloudy and the notion of the independence of the judiciary
                    remains primarily a term of constitutional rhetoric. Certainly its
                    penumbra, and perhaps even its core, are vague. No general
                    theory exists, although practically the English have developed
                    surprisingly effective informal systems for the separation of
                    powers; although it should never be forgotten that the system
                    of responsible government is based on a co-mingling of the
                    executive with the legislature. The political culture of the United
                    Kingdom, however, provides protections for the independence
                    of the judiciary, which are missing in law.”



The importance of the principle of separation essentially lies in the

independence of the judiciary. The protections in the Act of Settlement 1701

have now been reinforced in the Constitutional Reform Act, 2005. Though the

supremacy of Parliament is one of the fundamental features in the UK and the

unwritten Constitution does not mandate a strict separation of powers, it would

be difficult to regard a state which has no control on legislative supremacy as a

of law and constitutionalism govern society there may yet be fundamental

principles inhering in the nature of the polity, which can be enforced by the

judiciary even against Parliament, in the absence of a written Constitution 41. In

other words, even in the context of an unwritten Constitution, the law has a

certain internal morality as a part of which it embodies fundamental notions of

47      The interpretation of the doctrine of separation of powers has evolved

from being a “one branch – one function approach”42 with limited exceptions, to

a concept which involves an integration of the ‘division of work’ and ‘checks and

accountability of each wing of the State, while ensuring concerted action in

respect of the functions of each organ for good governance in a democracy.

The doctrine of separation of power has developed to fulfill the changing needs

of society and its growing necessities. Many of these considerations are

significantly different from those which were prevalent when Montesquieu

originally formulated the doctrine.

thus:
</p>
<p id="p_297">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_148">                “[a] ‘pure doctrine’ of the separation of powers might be
                formulated in the following way: It is essential for the
                establishment and maintenance of political liberty that the
                government be divided into three branches or departments, the
                legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. To each of these
                three branches, there is a corresponding identifiable function
                of government, legislative, executive, or judicial. Each branch
                of the government must be confined to the exercise of its own
                function and not allowed to encroach upon the functions of the
                other branches. Furthermore, the persons who compose these
                three agencies of government must be kept separate and
                distinct, no individual being allowed to be at the same time a
                member of more than one branch. In this way, each of the
                branches will be a check to the others and no single group of
                people will be able to control the machinery of the State.”45




This definition becomes important to facilitate an understanding of the

reconstructed and modern view on separation of powers vis-à-vis its traditional

understanding. Vile essentially proposes that ‘division of labor’ and ‘checks and

balances’ are intrinsic to the theory of separation of powers. In his view, a

scheme of checks and balances would involve a degree of mutual supervision

among the branches of government, and may therefore result in a certain

amount of interference by one branch into the functions and tasks of the other. 46

Aileen Kavanagh, has presented a scholarly analysis of separation of powers

in a chapter titled ‘The Constitutional Separation of Powers’.47 She concurs

with the view expressed by MJC Vile that separation of powers includes two

components, that of ‘division of labour’ and ‘checks and balances’. These two

components are strengthened by the deep-rooted ethos of coordinated

institutional effort and joint activity between branches of the government in the

interest of good governance.48 Instead of an isolated compartmentalization of

branches of government, she highlights the necessary independence,

interdependence, interaction and interconnection between these branches in a

complex interactive setting.49 Kavanagh acknowledges that in view of the

stronghold of the pure doctrine over our understanding of separation of powers,

the idea of a collective enterprise between the branches of the government for

the purpose of governing may seem jarring. However, she argues that this idea

of “branches being both independent and interdependent-distinct but

interconnected-also has some pedigree in canonical literature.”50 Kavanagh

thus opines that the tasks of law-making, law-applying and law-executing are

collaborative in nature, necessitating co-operation between the branches of the

government in furtherance of the common objective of good governance.

Kavanagh explains this as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_299">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_149">                 “In some contexts, the interaction between the branches will be
                 supervisory, where the goal is to check, review and hold the
                 other to account. At other times, the interaction will be a form
                 of cooperative engagement where the branches have to
                 support each other’s role in the joint endeavor.”51

in a State. He proposes that separation of powers is not just a principle involving

the division of labour and the distribution of power but also includes inter-

institutional relationships between the three branches when carrying out their

distinct roles as part of a joint enterprise. This is in order to facilitate, what

Waldron called the ‘Principle of Institutional Settlement’.52 Further, inter-

institutional comity, which is the respect that one branch of the state owes to

another, is also a significant factor, which calls for collaboration among

branches of the government to ensure that general public values such as

welfare, autonomy, transparency, efficiency and fairness are protected and

secured for the benefit of citizens.53

Thus, in a comparative international context, authors have accepted separation

of powers to widely include two elements: ‘division of labour’ and ‘checks and

balances’. The recent literature on the subject matter encourages inter-

institutional assistance and aid towards the joint enterprise of good governance.

The current view on the doctrine of separation of powers also seeks to

incorporate mutual supervision, interdependence and coordination because the

ultimate aim of the different branches of the government, through their distinct

functions is to ensure good governance and to serve public interest, which is

essential in the background of growing social and economic interests in a

49      Eoin Carolan’s book titled ‘The New Separation of Powers’ (2009)

reflects an attempt to reshape the traditional doctrine of separation, to make it

relevant to the practical realities of modern government. He notes that while the

tripartite separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary

had “conceptual simplicity with an impeccable academic pedigree” 54, the

doctrine has obvious limitations in the sense that it does not satisfactorily

explain the emergence and growth of the modern administrative State we see

today. The author contends that an institutional theory like the separation of

powers can no longer be accepted in its original form if it cannot account for

this ‘significant tranche of government activity’. Among the characteristics of the

modern administrative State is that public power is exercised in a decentralized

manner and on an ever-growing discretionary basis.55

The shared growth of administrative powers of the bureaucracy in the modern

state defies the tripartite division. Therefore, a realistic modern application of

the theory is necessary. The modern system of government has grown in ways

previously thought unfathomable, and now encompasses a breadth and

diversity previously unseen. Government today is characterized by the increase

in powers of its agencies and the rapid growth of organizations which can

neither be classified as exclusively public or private bodies. These modern

systems of government and the existence and rapid rise of supranational

organizations defy the traditional three- way division of powers. Administrative

bodies are not defined by a uniform design, and exercise institutional fluidity in

a manner which has come to characterize the administrative state’s

organizational complexity: In a single instance, they exercise powers and

perform functions that might have been formerly classified as executive, judicial

or legislative in nature.56 In this view, the modern State is distinctly different from

Locke’s seventeenth century Model and Montesquieu’s eighteenth century

ideas:

<p id="p_305">
</p><p id="p_306">                 “The state is now dirigiste, discretionary, and broadly
                 dispersed.”57



50       Carolan thus proposes that to be suitable, a theory of institutional justice

must be rooted in the principle of non-arbitrariness. He believes that a more

suitable approach of classification of institutions would be not by functions, but

by constituencies, and the sole constituency in this legal framework is the

individual citizen. Carolan’s proposed model places emphasis on the exercise

of power on the basis of inter-institutional dialogue which ensures that a

communicative process has taken place58. Carolan describes his model thus:

                  “The prescribed institutional structure operates by inter-organ
                  mingling instead of separation. Individual decisions are
                  delivered at the end of a multi institutional process, the central
                  concern of which is to organize, structure, manage, and—
                  crucially—ensure the input of all relevant institutional interests.
                  On this model, the government and the courts are presented
                  as providing an orienting framework within which
                  administrative decision-making will occur. These first-order
                  organs function at the level of macro-social organization,
                  adopting general measures which are expected to advance
                  their constituent social interest. The government specifies the
                  actions it feels are required (or requested) to enhance the
                  position of the collective. The courts, for their part, insist on the
                  process precautions necessary to secure individual protection.
                  Issues of informational efficacy and non-arbitrariness combine
                  to ensure, however, that these provisions are not
                  particularized.”65




While the autonomy of the administration is respected as a vital institutional

process, corrective measures are required where an institution has strayed

outside the range of permissible outcomes. He speaks of a collaborative

process of exercising power, with the judiciary acting as a restraining influence

on the arbitrary exercise of authority.

A Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu v State of Kerala68

ruled on the importance of separation as an entrenched constitutional principle.

The court held:
</p>
<p id="p_315">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_159">                “126.1. Even without express provision of the separation of
                powers, the doctrine of separation of powers is an entrenched
                principle in the Constitution of India. The doctrine of separation
                of powers informs the Indian constitutional structure and it is
                an essential constituent of rule of law. In other words, the
                doctrine of separation of power though not expressly engrafted
                in the Constitution, its sweep, operation and visibility are
                apparent from the scheme of Indian Constitution. Constitution
                has made demarcation, without drawing formal lines between
                the three organs—legislature, executive and judiciary. In that
                sense, even in the absence of express provision for separation
                of powers, the separation of powers between the legislature,
                executive and judiciary is not different from the Constitutions of
                the countries which contain express provision for separation of
                power.”69



52      The doctrine of separation restrains the legislature from declaring a

judgment of a court to be void and of no effect. However, in the exercise of its

law making authority, a legislature possessed of legislative competence can

enact validating law which remedies a defect pointed out in a judgment of a

court. While the legislature cannot ordain that a decision rendered by the court

is invalid, it may by enacting a law, take away the basis of the judgment such

53      In State of UP v Jeet S Bisht71, the Court held that the doctrine of

separation of powers limits the “active jurisdiction” of each branch of

government. However, even when the active jurisdiction of an organ of the

State is not challenged, the doctrine allows for methods to be used to prod and

communicate to an institution either its shortfalls or excesses in discharging its

duty. The court recognized that fundamentally, the purpose of the doctrine is to

act as a scheme of checks and balances over the activities of other organs.

<p id="p_316">The Court noted that the modern concept of separation of powers subscribes

to the understanding that it should not only demarcate the area of functioning

of various organs of the State, but should also, to some extent, define the

minimum content in that delineated area of functioning.

54        The constitutional validity of the Members of Parliament Local Area

Development (“MPLAD”) Scheme, which allocates funds to MPs for

development work in their constituencies was considered by a Constitution

Bench of this Court in Bhim Singh v Union of India73. The challenge was that

by entrusting funds to MPs, the Scheme vests governmental functions in

legislators and violates the separation of powers. The Court held that while the

concept of separation of powers is not found explicitly in a particular

constitutional provision, it “is inherent in the polity the Constitution has adopted”.

The Constitution Bench perceived that there is a link between separation and

the need to ensure accountability of each branch of government. While the

Constitution does not prohibit overlapping functions, what it prohibits is the

exercise of functions by a branch in a way which “results in wresting away of

the regime of constitutional accountability.” The Court held that by allowing

funds to be allocated to Members of Parliament for addressing the development

needs of their constituencies, the MPLAD Scheme does not breach the doctrine

of separation of powers. The administration of the scheme was adequately

supervised by district authorities.

the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 under which a multi-member selection

committee for the appointment of the Lokpal is to consist, among others, of the

Leader of the Opposition. A Bill for amending the provisions of the Act was

referred to a parliamentary committee which proposed the inclusion of the

leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha as a member, in lieu of

the Leader of the Opposition in the selection committee. The grievance of the

petitioners was that despite the enactment of the law, its provisions had not

been implemented. It was urged that even if there is no recognized Leader of

the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the leader of the single largest opposition party

should be inducted as a part of the Selection Committee. Justice Ranjan Gogoi

speaking for this Court held thus:

58         While assessing the impact of the separation of powers upon the present

controversy, certain precepts must be formulated. Separation of powers

between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary is a basic feature of the

Constitution. As a foundational principle which is comprised within the basic

structure, it lies beyond the reach of the constituent power to amend. It cannot

be substituted or abrogated. While recognizing this position, decided cases

indicate that the Indian Constitution does not adopt a separation of powers in

the strict sense. Textbook examples of exceptions to the doctrine include the

power of the executive to frame subordinate legislation, the power of the

legislature to punish for contempt of its privileges and the authority entrusted to

the Supreme Court and High Courts to regulate their own procedures by framing

rules. In making subordinate legislation, the executive is entrusted by the

legislature to make delegated legislation, subject to its control. The rule making

power of the higher judiciary has trappings of a legislative character. The power

of the legislature to punish for contempt of its privileges has a judicial character.

These exceptions indicate that the separation doctrine has not been adopted in

the strict form in our Constitution. But the importance of the doctrine lies in its

postulate that the essential functions entrusted to one organ of the state cannot

be exercised by the other. By standing against the usurpation of constitutional

powers entrusted to other organs, separation of powers supports the rule of law

and guards against authoritarian excesses. Parliament and the State

Legislatures legislate. The executive frames policies and administers the law.

The judiciary decides and adjudicates upon disputes in the course of which facts

are proved and the law is applied. The distinction between the legislative

function and judicial functions is enhanced by the basic structure doctrine. The

legislature is constitutionally entrusted with the power to legislate. Courts are

not entrusted with the power to enact law. Yet, in a constitutional democracy

which is founded on the supremacy of the Constitution, it is an accepted

principle of jurisprudence that the judiciary has the authority to test the validity

of legislation. Legislation can be invalidated where the enacting legislature lacks

legislative competence or where there is a violation of fundamental rights. A

law which is constitutionally ultra vires can be declared to be so in the exercise

of the power of judicial review. Judicial review is indeed also a part of the basic

features of the Constitution. Entrustment to the judiciary of the power to test the

validity of law is an established constitutional principle which co-exists with the

separation of powers. Where a law is held to be ultra vires there is no breach of

parliamentary privileges for the simple reason that all institutions created by the

Constitution are subject to constitutional limitations. The legislature, it is well

settled, cannot simply declare that the judgment of a court is invalid or that it

stands nullified. If the legislature were permitted to do so, it would travel beyond

the boundaries of constitutional entrustment. While the separation of powers

prevents the legislature from issuing a mere declaration that a judgment is

erroneous or invalid, the law-making body is entitled to enact a law which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_219">                                        68</span>

remedies the defects which have been pointed out by the court. Enactment of

a law which takes away the basis of the judgment (as opposed to merely

invalidating it) is permissible and does not constitute a violation of the

separation doctrine. That indeed is the basis on which validating legislation is

permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_326">

59    This discussion leads to the conclusion that while the separation of

powers, as a principle, constitutes the cornerstone of our democratic

Constitution, its application in the actual governance of the polity is nuanced.

The nuances of the doctrine recognize that while the essential functions of one

organ of the state cannot be taken over by the other and that a sense of

institutional comity must guide the work of the legislature, executive and

judiciary, the practical problems which arise in the unfolding of democracy can

be resolved through robust constitutional cultures and mechanisms. The

separation doctrine cannot be reduced to its descriptive content, bereft of its

normative features. Evidently, it has both normative and descriptive features. In

applying it to the Indian Constitution, the significant precept to be borne in mind

is that no institution of governance lies above the Constitution. No entrustment

of power is absolute.

of the court as an adjudicator of disputes? In assessing the issue, it must be

remembered, that parliamentary committees owe their existence to Parliament.

They report to Parliament. They comprise of the members of Parliament. Their

work consists of tendering advice to the legislature. A parliamentary committee

does not decide a lis between contesting disputants nor does it perform an

adjudicatory function. A committee appointed by the House can undoubtedly

receive evidence, including expert evidence, both oral and documentary. A

Select Committee may be appointed by the House to scrutinize a Bill. When the

committee performs its task, its report is subject to further discussion and

debate in the House in the course of which the legislative body would decide as

to whether the Bill should be enacted into law. The validity of the advice which

is tendered by a parliamentary committee in framing its recommendations for

legislation cannot be subject to a challenge before a court of law. The advice

tendered is, after all, what it purports to be: it is advice to the legislating body.

The correctness of or the expediency or justification for the advice is a matter

to be considered by the legislature and by it alone.



61    Department related standing committees are constituted by Parliament to

oversee the functioning of ministries/departments of government. It is through

the work of these committees that Parliament exacts the accountability of the

executive. It is through the work of these committees that Parliament is able to

assess as to whether the laws which it has framed are being implemented in

letter and spirit and to determine the efficacy of government policies in meeting

the problems of the day.
</p>
<p id="p_329">

62      The contents of the report of a parliamentary committee may have a

bearing on diverse perspectives. It is necessary to elucidate them in order to

determine whether, and if so to what extent, they can form the subject matter of

consideration in the course of adjudication in a court.            Some of these

perspectives are enumerated below:
</p>
<p id="p_330">(i)     The report of a parliamentary committee may contain a statement of

        position by government on matters of policy;

</p><p id="p_331">(ii)    The report may allude to statements made by persons who have deposed

        before the Committee;
</p>
<p id="p_332">(iii)   The report may contain inferences of fact including on the performance

        of government in implementing policies and legislation;

</p><p id="p_333">(iv)    The report may contain findings of misdemeanor implicating a breach of

        duty by public officials or private individuals or an evasion of law; or

</p><p id="p_334">(v)     The report may shed light on the purpose of a law, the social problem

        which the legislature had in view and the manner in which it was sought

        to be remedied.
</p>
<p id="p_335">

63      The use of parliamentary history as an aid to statutory construction is an

area which poses the fewest problems. In understanding the true meaning of

the words used by the legislature, the court may have regard to the reasons

which have led to the enactment of the law, the problems which were sought to

be remedied and the object and purpose of the law. For understanding this, the

court may seek recourse to background parliamentary material associated with

the framing of the law. In his seminal work on the Interpretation of Statutes,

Justice G P Singh notes that the traditional rule of exclusion in English Courts

has over a period of time been departed from in India as well to permit the court

to have access to the historical background in which the law was enacted.

Justice G P Singh79 notes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_163">                    “The Supreme Court, speaking generally, to begin with,
                    enunciated the rule of exclusion of Parliamentary history in the
                    way it was traditionally enunciated by the English Courts, but
                    on many an occasion, the court used this aid in resolving
                    questions of construction. The court has now veered to the
                    view80 that legislative history within circumspect limits may be
                    consulted by courts in resolving ambiguities. But the courts still
                    sometimes, like the English courts, make a distinction between
                    use of a material for finding the mischief dealt with by the Act
                    and its use for finding the meaning of the Act. As submitted
                    earlier this distinction is unrealistic and has now been
                    abandoned by the House of Lords.”



64         Reports of parliamentary committees may contain a statement of position

by government on matters of policy. There is no reason in principle to exclude

recourse by a court to the report of the committee at least as a reflection of the

fact that such a statement was made before the committee. Similarly, that a

statement was made before the committee - as a historical fact - may be taken

note of by the court in a situation where the making of the statement itself is not

a contentious issue.

65    In matters involving public interest which come up before the court, a

grievance is often made of the violation of the fundamental rights of persons

who by reason of poverty, ignorance or marginalized status are unable to seek

access to justice. Public interest litigation has been perceived as social action

litigation because a relaxation of the rules of standing has enabled constitutional

courts to reach out to those who have suffered discrimination and prejudice.

Whatever be the source of such discrimination – the feudal and patriarchal

structures of Indian society being among them – public interest litigation has

enabled courts to develop flexible tools of decision making and pursue

innovative remedies. The writ of continuing mandamus is one of them. In the

process, the violation of the fundamental rights of those groups of citizens who

may not be able to seek access to justice is sought to be remedied. Public

interest litigation has emerged as a powerful tool to provide justice to the

marginalized. In matters involving issues of public interest, courts have been

called upon to scrutinize the failure of the state or its agencies to implement law

and to provide social welfare benefits to those for whom they are envisaged

under legislation. Courts have intervened to ensure the structural probity of the

system of democratic governance. Executive power has been made

accountable to the guarantee against arbitrariness (<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_251">Article 14</a>) and to

fundamental liberties (principally Articles 19 and 21).



66    Committees of Parliament attached to ministries/departments of the

government perform the function of holding government accountable to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_224">                                        73</span>
                                                                              PART G


implement its policies and its duties under legislation. The performance of

governmental agencies may form the subject matter of such a report. In other

cases, the deficiencies of the legislative framework in remedying social wrongs

may be the subject of an evaluation by a parliamentary committee. The work

of a parliamentary committee may traverse the area of social welfare either in

terms of the extent to which existing legislation is being effectively implemented

or in highlighting the lacunae in its framework. There is no reason in principle

why the wide jurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_252">Article 226</a> or of this Court

under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_253">Article 32</a> should be exercised in a manner oblivious to the enormous

work which is carried out by parliamentary committees in the field. The work of

the committee is to secure alacrity on the part of the government in alleviating

deprivations of social justice and in securing efficient and accountable

governance. When courts enter upon issues of public interest and adjudicate

upon them, they do not discharge a function which is adversarial.               The

constitutional function of adjudication in matters of public interest is in step with

the role of parliamentary committees which is to secure accountability,

transparency and responsiveness in government. In such areas, the doctrine of

separation does not militate against the court relying upon the report of a

parliamentary committee. The court does not adjudge the validity of the report

nor for that matter does it embark upon a scrutiny into its correctness. There is

a functional complementarity between the purpose of the investigation by the

parliamentary committee and the adjudication by the court. To deprive the court

of the valuable insight of a parliamentary committee would amount to excluding


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">                                         74</span>
                                                                             PART G


an important source of information from the purview of the court. To do so on

the supposed hypothesis that it would amount to a breach of parliamentary

privilege would be to miss the wood for the trees. Once the report of the

parliamentary committee has been published it lies in the public domain. Once

Parliament has placed it in the public domain, there is an irony about the

executive relying on parliamentary privilege. There is no reason or justification

to exclude it from the purview of the material to which the court seeks recourse

to understand the problem with which it is required to deal. The court must look

at the report with a robust common sense, conscious of the fact that it is not

called upon to determine the validity of the report which constitutes advice

tendered to Parliament. The extent to which the court would rely upon a report

must necessarily vary from case to case and no absolute rule can be laid down

in that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_337">

67    There may, however, be contentious matters in the report of a

parliamentary committee in regard to which the court will tread with

circumspection. For instance, the report of the committee may contain a finding

of misdemeanor involving either officials of the government or private

individuals bearing on a violation of law. If the issue before the court for

adjudication is whether there has in fact been a breach of duty or a violation of

law by a public official or a private interest, the court would have to deal with it

independently and arrive at its own conclusions based on the material before it.

Obviously in such a case the finding by a Parliamentary Committee cannot


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_226">                                         75</span>

constitute substantive evidence before the court. The parliamentary committee

is not called upon to decide a lis or dispute involving contesting parties and

when an occasion to do so arises before the court, it has to make its

determination based on the material which is admissible before it. An individual

whose conduct has been commented upon in the report of a parliamentary

committee cannot be held guilty of a violation on the basis of that finding. In

Jyoti Harshad Mehta v The Custodian81, this Court held that a report of the

Janakiraman committee could not have been used as evidence by the Special

Court. The court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_164">                  “57. It is an accepted fact that the reports of the Janakiraman

In Onkar Nath v The Delhi Administration85, another Bench of three judges

elaborated upon <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_261">Section 57(4)</a>. Justice YV Chandrachud, speaking for the

Court, held thus:
</p>
<p id="p_341">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_169">                “6. One of the points urged before us is whether the courts
                below were justified in taking judicial notice of the fact that on
                the date when the appellants delivered their speeches a
                railway strike was imminent and that such a strike was in fact
                launched on May 8, 1974. <a href="/doc/973062/" id="a_262">Section 56</a> of the Evidence Act
                provides that no fact of which the Court will take judicial notice
                need be proved. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_263">Section 57</a> enumerates facts of which the
                Court “shall” take judicial notice and states that on all matters
                of public history, literature, science or art the Court may resort
                for its aid to appropriate books or documents of reference. The
                list of facts mentioned in <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_264">Section 57</a> of which the Court can take
                judicial notice is not exhaustive and indeed the purpose of the
                section is to provide that the Court shall take judicial notice of
                certain facts rather than exhaust the category of facts of which
                the Court may in appropriate cases take judicial notice.</blockquote><p id="p_342">
</p><p id="p_343">                Recognition of facts without formal proof is a matter of
                expediency and no one has ever questioned the need and
                wisdom of accepting the existence of matters which are
                unquestionably within public knowledge. (See Taylor, 11th
                Edn., pp. 3-12; Wigmore, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_265">Section 2571</a>, footnote; Stephen's

                Codes, Vol. II, p. 887.) Shutting the judicial eye to the existence
                of such facts and matters is in a sense an insult to
                commonsense and would tend to reduce the judicial process
                to a meaningless and wasteful ritual. No court therefore insists
                on formal proof, by evidence, of notorious facts of history, past
                or present. The date of poll, the passing away of a man of
                eminence and events that have rocked the nation need no
                proof and are judicially noticed. Judicial notice, in such matters,
                takes the place of proof and is of equal force.”86

70    In finding an answer to the questions in reference, this Court must of

necessity travel from a literal and perhaps superficial approach, to an

understanding of the essence of what the Constitution seeks to achieve. At one

level, our Constitution has overseen the transfer of political power from a

colonial regime to a regime under law of a democratic republic. Legitimizing the

transfer of political power is one, but only one facet of the Constitution. To focus

upon it alone is to miss a significant element of the constitutional vision. That

vision is of about achieving a social transformation. This transformation which

the Constitution seeks to achieve is by placing the individual at the forefront of

its endeavours. Crucial to that transformation is the need to reverse the

philosophy of the colonial regime, which was founded on the subordination of

the individual to the state.    Liberty, freedom, dignity and autonomy have

meaning because it is to the individual to whom the Constitution holds out an

assurance of protecting fundamental human rights. The Constitution is about

empowerment. The democratic transformation to which it aspires places the

individual at the core of the concerns of governance. For a colonial regime,

individuals were subordinate to the law. Individuals were subject to the authority

of the state and their well-being was governed by the acceptance of a destiny

wedded to its power. Those assumptions which lay at the foundation of colonial

rule have undergone a fundamental transformation for a nation of individuals

governed by the Constitution. The Constitution recognises their rights and

entitlements. Empowerment of individuals through the enforcement of their

rights is the essence of the constitutional purpose. Hence, in understanding the

issues which have arisen before the Court in the present reference, it is well to

remind ourselves that since the Constitution is about transformation and its

vision is about empowerment, our reading of precepts drawn from a colonial

past, including parliamentary privilege, must be subjected to a nuance that

facilitates the assertion of rights and access to justice. We no longer live in a

political culture based on the subordination of individuals to the authority of the

State.         Our interpretation of the Constitution must reflect a keen sense of

awareness of the basic change which the Constitution has made to the polity

and to its governance.

71         A distinguished South African Judge, Albie Sachs has spoken of the

importance of understanding the value of constitutional transformation. In his

book titled ‘The Strange Alchemy of Life and Law’89, explaining the role of the

constitutional court, Sachs has this to say:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_172">                    “It is difficult to analyse the impact that court decisions have on
                    actual historical events. It may well be that the publicity given
                    to the case, and the evidence and arguments presented had
                    more impact on public life than did the actual decision. Yet any
                    amount of forensic combat, however bitter and prolonged, is
                    better than a single bullet. Submitting the harsh conflicts of our
                    times to legal scrutiny – conducted transparently and in the
                    light of internationally accepted values of fairness and justice –
                    was a telling rebuttal of mercenarism and violence, whether
                    from or against the State. It responded in a practical way to
                    the immediate issues, and at the same time induced
                    governments, judiciaries, and law enforcement agencies in
                    three countries to engage with each other and carefully
                    consider their powers and responsibilities under the
                    international law. It reaffirmed to the South African public that
                    we were living in a constitutional democracy in which all
                    exercises of power were subject to constitutional control.</blockquote><p id="p_346">
</p><p id="p_347">                    It said something important about the kind of country in which

89   Justice Albie Sachs, The Strange Alchemy of Life and Law (Oxford University Press 2009) pages 32-33.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_232">                                                       81</span>

            we lived and about the importance of principled and reasoned
            debate. It underlined that we had moved from a culture of
            authority and submission to the law, to one of justification
            and rights under the law.”    (emphasis supplied)



72    In India, no less than in South Africa it is important to realise that citizens

live in a constitutional democracy in which every exercise of power is subject

to constitutional control. Every institution of the State is subject to the

Constitution. None lies above it. The most important feature of Sachs’ vision

relevant to our Constitution is that Indian society must move “from the culture

of authority and submission to the law, to one of justification and rights under

the law”.
</p>
<p id="p_348">

73    Once we place the fulfilment of individual rights and human freedoms at

the forefront of constitutional discourse, the resolution of the present case

presents no difficulty. Individuals access courts to remedy injustice. As

institutions which are committed to the performance of a duty to facilitate the

realisation of human freedom, High Courts as well as this Court are under a

bounden obligation to seek and pursue all information on the causes of

injustice. Where the work which has been performed by a coordinate

constitutional institution – in this case a Parliamentary Committee, throws light

on the nature of the injustice or its causes and effects, constitutional theory

which has to aid justice cannot lead us to hold that the court must act oblivious

to the content of the report. History and contemporary events across the world

are a reminder that black-outs of information are used as a willing ally to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_233">                                          82</span>

totalitarian excesses of power. They have no place in a democracy. Placing

reliance on the report of a Parliamentary Committee does not infringe

parliamentary privilege. No Member of Parliament is sought to be made liable

for what has been said or for a vote tendered in the course of a debate. The

correctness or validity of the report of a Parliamentary Committee is not a

matter which can be agitated before the Court nor does the Court exercise such

a function. Where an issue of fact becomes contentious, it undoubtedly has to

be proved before a court independently on the basis of the material on the

record. In other words, where a fact referred to in the report of the Parliamentary

Committee is contentious, the court has to arrive at its own finding on the basis

of the material adduced before it.
</p>
<p id="p_349">

74    Parliamentary Committees are an intrinsic part of the process by which

the elected legislature in a democracy exacts accountability on the part of the

government.      Department related Parliamentary Standing Committees

undertake the meticulous exercise of scrutinizing the implementation of law,

including welfare legislation and the performance of the departments of the

State. The purpose of law is to promote order for the benefit of the citizen and

to protect rights and entitlements guaranteed by the Constitution and by statute.

Access to justice as a means of securing fundamental freedoms and realizing

socio-economic entitlements is complementary to the work of other organs of

the State. The modern doctrine of separation of powers has moved away from

a ‘one organ – one function’ approach, to a more realistic perspective which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_234">                                        83</span>
                                                                            PART H


recognizes the complementarity in the work which is performed by institutions

of governance. Judicial review is founded on the need to ensure accountable

governance in the administration of law as an instrument of realizing the rights

guaranteed by the Constitution. If the function of judicial review in facilitating

the realization of socio-economic rights is construed in the context of the

modern notion of separation of powers, there is no real conflict between the

independence of the judicial process and its reliance on published reports of

Parliamentary Committees. Ultimately it is for the court in each case to

determine the relevance of a report to the case at hand and the extent to which

reliance can be placed upon it to facilitate access to justice. Reports of

Parliamentary Committees become part of the published record of the State.

As a matter of principle, there is no reason or justification to exclude them from

the purview of the judicial process, for purposes such as understanding the

historical background of a law, the nature of the problem, the causes of a social

evil and the remedies which may provide answers to intractable problems of

governance. The court will in the facts of a case determine when a matter which

is contentious between the parties would have to be adjudicated upon

independently on the basis of the evidence adduced in accordance with law.



In the circumstances, the reference is answered by holding that:

</p><p id="p_350">(i)   As a matter of principle, there is no reason why reliance upon the report

      of a Parliamentary Standing Committee cannot be placed in proceedings

      under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_272">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_273">Article 136</a> of the Constitution;

</p><p id="p_351">(ii)    Once the report of a Parliamentary Committee has been published,

        reference to it in the course of judicial proceedings will not constitute a

        breach of parliamentary privilege;

<p id="p_352">(iii)   The validity of the report of a Parliamentary Committee cannot be called

        into question in the court. No Member of Parliament or person can be

        made liable for what is stated in the course of the proceedings before a

        Parliamentary Committee or for a vote tendered or given; and

</p><p id="p_353">(iv)    When a matter before the court assumes a contentious character, a

        finding of fact by the court must be premised on the evidence adduced

        in the judicial proceeding as explained in paragraphs 67 and 73.


75      The issues framed for reference are accordingly answered.


76      The proceedings may now be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice for

assignment of the case for disposal.

Parliament   as   well   as   those   who   appear   before   the

legislative   privileges   of   the   members   as   well   as   of

the   Houses.   <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_276">Article   105</a>   sub­clause   (2)   of   the

Constitution   of   India   provides   that   no   member   of

Parliament   shall   be   liable   to   any   proceedings   in   any

the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in

evidence   taken   by   a   Parliamentary   Committee.   A

committee of Parliament is part of Parliament.

 

</p><p id="p_376">11. The principal submission which has been canvassed

by   Shri   Salve   is   that   there   being   legislative

privilege of all acts done in the Parliament including

report   of   Parliamentary   Committee,   the   report   cannot

be   challenged   in   a   Court   of   Law.   He   submits   that

reliance   of   a   Parliamentary   Committee   Report   also

involves   a   challenge   to   the   report   by   other   parties.

No adjudication can be entertained by this Court with

regard   to   a   Parliamentary   Committee   Report,   hence

reliance placed by the petitioner on the Parliamentary

Committee Report is misplaced.

Parliament'   protection   from   being   'impeached   or

questioned' in any 'court or place out of Parliament'.

He   submits   that   Indian   Parliament   is   conferred   the

same   privileges   which   are   enjoyed   by   the   House   of

Commons,   hence   Parliamentary   Committee   Report   can

neither be relied nor questioned in any Court of Law.

Shri   Salve   referred   to   various   English   cases   and

several   judgments   of   this   Court   which   shall   be

</p><p id="p_380">13. Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General also

contends   that   Parliamentary   Reports   cannot   be   relied

in  Court. He submits  that although there is no  rigid

separation of powers in the three wings of States but

each   wing   of   the   States   works   in   its   own   sphere.

Parliament   is   supreme   in   its   proceedings   which

proceedings cannot be questioned in any Court of Law.

that all wings of the States have to work in their own

spheres so as not to entrench upon the sphere allotted

a   report   of   Parliamentary   Committee   is   a   sensitive

issue   of   jurisdiction   between   Courts   and   Parliament

which   should   be   avoided   by   this   Court.     When   the

courts   cannot   adjudicate   on   Parliamentary   Committee

Report, what is the use of looking into it. Referring

to   Section   57(4)   of   the   Evidence   Act,   1872   which

provides that the Court shall take judicial notice of

the proceedings of the Parliament and the Legislature

established under any law for the time being in force,

he   submits   that   the   substitutions   were   made   in   sub­

clause  (4) of Section 57 by Adaptation  Order  of 1950

which were orders issued by the President and were not

amendments   made   by   Parliament   in   Section   57.  He

submits   that   by   Adaptation   Order   various   words   which

were   earlier   used   in   Evidence   Act,   1872   were   changed

after adoption of Constitution which cannot be treated

to   be   an   act   done   by   conscious   deliberation   of

Legislature. He submits that historical facts as well

as   statement   of   Minister   in   Parliament   can   be   used

with   which   there   cannot   be   any   quarrel.   He,   however,

submits   that   inferences   in   Parliamentary   Committee

Report   are   not   acceptable.   He   submits   that   when   any

litigant   wants   to   prove   a   fact,   he   has   to   search

material and produce evidence and he cannot be allowed

to   take   a   shortcut   by   placing   reliance   on   the

Parliamentary   Committee   Report.   Parliamentary

Committee Report, is, in a manner, a speech.   <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_279">Article

105</a> of the Constitution does not make any distinction

with reports which can be termed to as Social Welfare

Reports   or   other   kinds   of   reports.   He   submits   that

there   is   total   bar   in   looking   into   the   Reports   of

Parliament   based   on   separation   of   power   and   express

provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_280">Article   105(2)</a>   and   <a href="/doc/986670/" id="a_281">105(4)</a>   of   the

Constitution of India. The very fact that Speaker can

say ‘no’ with regard to any parliamentary material, it

has   to   be   assumed   that   they   operate   as   total   bar   on

use   of   parliamentary   material   as   evidence.   The

the   Parliamentary   Committee   Report.             The   Writ

Petitioner   seeks   nothing   which   may   give   rise   to   any

facts stated in Parliamentary Report to be conclusive

A.   PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES


</p><p id="p_397">23. The   origin   and   evolution   of   parliamentary

privilege   is   traceable   from   High   Court   of   British

Parliament.     In   the   early   period   of   British   History,

the High Court of Parliament assisted the Crown in his

judicial   functions.     The   High   Court   of   Parliament

started sitting in two parts i.e.   House of Lords and

House of Commons.   Gradually, both the Houses claimed

various privileges which were recognised.  Some of the

privileges   were   claimed   by   both   the   Houses   as   rights

from   ancient   times   and   some   of   the   privileges   were

statutorily   recognised.   A   significant   parliamentary

privilege   is   recognised   and   declared   by   Article   IX.

Bill   of   Rights,   1688   which   conferred   on   'proceedings

in   Parliament   protection   from   being   'impeached'   or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_258">                                                                   22</span>

'questioned' in any court or place out of Parliament'.

By   the   end   of   19th  Century   most   of   the   parliamentary

privileges of House of Commons were firmly established

and recognised by the Courts also.

<p id="p_398">
</p><p id="p_399">24. Erskine   May       in   his   treaties        'Parliamentary

Practice',   Twenty­fourth   Edition'   has   elaborately

dealt with the privileges of Parliament and all other

related   aspects.   In   Chapter   XII   of   the   Book,   Erskine

May states about what constitutes the privilege:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_178">     “Parliamentary   privilege   is   the   sum   of
     certain   rights   enjoyed   by   each   House
     collectively as a constituent part of the
     High Court of Parliament; and by Members
     of each House individually, without which
     they could not discharge their functions,
     and which exceed those possessed by other
     bodies   or   individuals.   Some   privileges
     rest   solely   on   the   law   and   custom   of
     Parliament,   while   others   have   been
     defined by stature.” 


</blockquote><p id="p_400">25. The   term   'parliamentary   privilege'   refers   to   the

immunity and powers possessed by each of the Houses of

the   Parliament   and   by   the   Members   of   the   Parliament,

which   allow   them   to   carry   out   their   parliamentary

functions   effectively.   Enumerating   few   rights   and

immunities Erskine May states:
</p>
<p id="p_401">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_179">    "Certain   rights   and   immunities   such   as
    freedom from arrest or freedom of speech
    belong primarily to individual Members of
    each   House   and   exist   because   the   House
    cannot   perform   its   functions   without
    unimpeded   use   of   the   services   of   its
    Members.   Other   rights   and   immunities,
    such as the power to punish for contempt
    and   the   power   to   regulate   its   own
    constitution,   belong   primarily   to   each
    House   as   a   collective   body,   for   the
    protection   of   its   Members   and   the
    vindication   of   its   own   authority   and
    dignity.   Fundamentally,   however,   it   is
    only   as   a   means   to   the   effective
    discharge of the collective functions of
    the House that the individual privileges
    are   enjoyed   by   Members.   The   Speaker   has
    ruled   that   parliamentary   privilege   is
    absolute. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_180">    When   any   of   these   rights   and   immunities
    is   disregarded   or   attacked,   the   offence
    is   called   a   breach   of   privilege,   and   is
    punishable   under   the   law   of   Parliament.
    Each   House   also   claims   the   right   to
    punish contempts, that is, actions which,
    while   not   breaches   of   any   specific
    privilege,   obstruct   or   impede   it   in   the
    performance   of   its   functions,   or   are
    offences   against   its   authority   or
    dignity,   such   as   disobedience   to   its
    legitimate   commands   or   libels   upon
    itself, its Members or its officers. The
    power   to   punish   for   contempt   has   been
    judicially   considered   to   be   inherent   in
    each   House   of   Parliament   not   as   a
    necessary   incident   of   the   authority   and

privileges', states following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_181">     "1076.      Claim   to   rights   and   privileges.
     The   House   of   Lords   and   the   House   of
     Commons   claim   for   their   members,   both
     individually   and   collectively,   certain
     rights and privileges which are necessary
     to   each   House,   without   which   they   could
     not discharge their functions, and which
     exceed   those   possessed   by   other   bodies
     and   individuals.   In   1705   the   House   of
     Lords   resolved   that   neither   House   had
     power   to   create   any   new   privilege   and
     when   this   was   communicated   to   the
     Commons, that House agreed. Each House is
     the   guardian   of   its   own   privileges   and
     claims to be the sole judge of any matter
     that may arise which in any way impinges
     upon them, and, if it deems it advisable,

respects.   The   said   clause   is   in   two
parts. The first part empowers Parliament
to define, by law, the powers, privileges
and   immunities   of   each   House   of
Parliament   and   of   the   Members   and   the
committees   of   each   House.   In   the   second
part,   which   was   intended   to   be
transitional   in   nature,   it   was   provided
that until they are so defined by law the
said   powers,   privileges   and   immunities
shall be those of the House of Commons in
the United Kingdom and of its Members and
committees   at   the   commencement   of   the
Constitution. This part of the provision
was   on   the   same   lines   as   the   provisions
contained in Section 49 of the Australian
Constitution   and   Section   18   of   the
Canadian   Constitution.   Clause   (3),   as
substituted by the Forty­fourth Amendment
of   the   Constitution,   does   not   make   any
change   in   the   content   and   it   only   seeks
to omit future reference to the House of
Commons   of   Parliament   in   the   United
Kingdom while preserving the position as
it stood on the date of the coming into
force of the said amendment.”

</p><p id="p_462">51. The   Reports   of   the   Parliamentary   Standing

Committees and other decisions and resolutions of the

Parliament are published under the authority of House.

Publication of proceedings of Parliament serves public

purpose.     Members   of   British   Parliament   in   earlier

years   had   treated   publication   of   its   proceedings   as

breach   of   privilege.   However,   subsequently,   the

Members   of   British   Parliament   have   permitted   the

publication   of   its   proceedings   in   Hansard.     As   early

     public,   who   have   the   deepest   interest   in
     knowing   what   passes   within   their   walls,
     seeing that on what is there said and done,
     the   welfare   of   the   community   depends.   Where
     would be our confidence in the government of
     the   country   or   in   the   legislature   by   which
     our laws are framed, and to whose charge the
     great interests of the country are committed,

     the   knowledge   of   the   nation?   How   could   the
     communications between the representatives of
     the people and their constituents, which are
     so   essential   to   the   working   of   the
     representative   system,   be   usefully   carried

     petitioning   on   all   measures   pending   in
     parliament,   the   undoubted   right   of   the
     subject,   if   the   people   are   to   be   kept   in
     ignorance of what is passing in either house?
     Can any man bring himself to doubt that the
     publicity   given   in   modern   times   to   what
     passes   in   parliament   is   essential   to   the

     practically, each house not only permits, but
     also sanctions and encourages, the publication
     of   its   proceedings,   and   actually   gives   every
     facility to those who report them. Individual
     members correct their speeches for publication
     in   Hansard   or   the   public   journals,   and   in
     every   debate   reports   of   former   speeches
     contained therein are constantly referred to.
     Collectively,   as   well   as   individually,   the
     members   of   both   houses   would   deplore   as   a
     national   misfortune   the   withholding   their
     debates from the country at large. Practically

held that  the  correctness of the findings  in the JPC

will   ultimately   depend   on   the   entire   view   of   the

matter.  Following   was   observed   in   paragraph   5   of   the

judgment:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_252">                 “5....The Report of JPC has recorded
            that   there   was   an   arrangement   between

            which the Banks were assured of a return
            of 15%. It was something like a minimum
            guaranteed return offered by the brokers
            to   the Banks.   As   stated   above,   the
            Report   has   given   findings   on   certain
            banking   and   market   practices   which   led
            to   the   financial   irregularities   in
            security   transactions.   In   that   context,
            the   JPC   examined   various   Officers   of
            the Banks and   the   brokers.   After
            recording   their   evidence,   as   stated
            above,   JPC   came   to   the   conclusion   that

            facilities,   margin   trading   and   15%
            arrangement.   To   this   extent,   the
            findings of JPC can be read as evidence
            in   the   present   matter.   However,   the
            question   as   to   whether   the   suit

         arrangement, has  not been found by JPC.
         There   is   no   finding   to   the   effect   that
         the suit transaction was part of such an
         arrangement. Therefore, I am of the view
         that Can Bank Mutual Fund is entitled to
         tender   the   Report   of   JPC   as   evidence
         only   to   establish   that   there   was   a   15%
         arrangement   between  Standard   Chartered
         Bank  and   HPD.   The   issue   as   to   whether
         the suit transaction was a part of such
         a   practice/arrangement   will   have   to   be
         established   independently   by   Can   Bank
         Mutual  Fund.  However, in  order  to prove
         that   issue,   the   Report   will   be   one   of
         the   important   pieces   of   evidence.   At

G.   NATURE   AND   EXTENT   OF   PARLIAMENTARY   PRIVILEGES
REGARDING REPORTS OF COMMITTEES OF BRITISH PARLIAMENT


</p><p id="p_496">74. In   the   Constituent   Assembly   Debates   on   draft

<a href="/doc/284788/" id="a_341">Article   85   (now   <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_342">Article   105</a>   of   the   Constitution   of

India)</a>  and draft <a href="/doc/1295106/" id="a_343">Article  169 (now <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_344">Article 194</a> of the

Constitution   of   India</a>),   various   members   have   brought

amendments and prayed that privileges of the House of

the   Parliament   be   enumerated   and   the   Constitution

should   not   refer   to   House   of   Commons   of   the   United

Kingdom   for   referring   to   its   privileges.     Dr.   B.R.

Ambedkar   in   his   reply   in   the   Constituent   Assembly

Debates on 03.06.1949 stated as follows:­

      “It   seems   to   me,   if   the   proposition   was
      accepted   that   the   Act   itself   should
      enumerate   the   privileges   of   Parliament,   we
      would have  to follow  three  courses.  One  is
      to adopt them in the Constitution, namely to
      set   out   in   detail   the   privileges   and
      immunities of Parliament and its members. I
      have   very   carefully   gone   over   May's
      Parliamentary   Practice   which   is   the   source
      book   of   knowledge   with   regard   to   the
      immunities   and   privileges   of   Parliament.   I
      have   gone   over   the   index   to   May's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_300">                                                                    64</span>

      Parliamentary   Practice   and   I   have   noticed
      that practically 8 or 9 columns of the index
      are devoted to the privileges and immunities
      of Parliament. So that if you were to enact
      a   complete   code   of   the   privileges   and
      immunities of Parliament based upon what May
      has to say on this subject, I have not the
      least doubt in my mind that we will have to
      add   not   less   than   twenty   or   twenty­five
      pages relating to immunities and privileges
      of   Parliament.   I   do   not   know   whether   the
      Members   of   this   House   would   like   to   have
      such   a   large   categorical   statement   of
      privileges   and   immunities   of   Parliament
      extending over twenty or twenty­five pages.
      That   I   think   is   one   reason   why   we   did   not
      adopt that course.”    


</p><p id="p_497">75. The draft article was finally approved maintaining

the   reference   to   House   of   Commons   in   regard   to   other

privileges.  Thus, the privileges which our Parliament

and State Legislatures enjoy are privileges enjoyed by

House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the time of

commencement of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_498">

</p><p id="p_499">76. In early period of history of British Parliament,

at   the   commencement   of   every   Parliament,   it   has   been

the custom, the Speaker sought by humble petition the

rights and privileges.   The petitions were granted by

Her   Majesty’s   by   conferring   upon   the   power,   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_301">                                                               65</span>

privileges asked for.  In subsequent period, the Common

started insisting that the privileges are inherent in

the House.  The first major recognition and acceptance

of Parliamentary privileges found reflected in the Bill

of Rights, 1688.   The Bill of Rights, 1688 was an Act

declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and

settling the succession of the Crown. Article IX of the

Bill of Rights provides as follows:–

     “Freedom   of   Speech   ­   That   the   freedom   of
     speech   and   debates   or   proceedings   in
     Parliament   ought   not   to   be   impeached   or
     questioned   in   any   court   or   place   out   of
     Parliament:”


</p><p id="p_500">77. The   above   declaration   made   in   Bill   of   Rights

thereafter   has   been   firmly   established   and   till   date

enjoyed by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

Erskine   May  in   'Parliamentary   Practice,   24th  Edition'

while dealing with privileges of freedom of speech says

following with regard to the Bill of Rights:­

     “Article   IX   of   the   Bill   of   Rights   1689
     confers   on   ‘proceedings   in   Parliament’
     protection   from   being   ‘impeached   or
     questioned’ in any ‘court or place out of
     Parliament’.   Except   in   the   limited
     circumstances   mentioned   below,   none   of
     these critical terms is defined, so that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_302">                                                                66</span>

     it   has   often   fallen   to   the   courts   to
     arrive at judgments about their meaning,
     against   the   background   of   parliamentary
     insistence on the privilege of exclusive
     cognizance of proceedings (see above) and
     concern   that   judicial   interpretation
     should   not   narrow   the   protection   of
     freedom   of   speech   which   article   IX
     affords.” 


</p><p id="p_501">78. There   is   no   doubt   that   reports   of   the   Standing

Committee   of   the   Parliament   are   also   Parliamentary

proceedings.  Participation of members of Parliament in

normal   course   is   usually   by   a   speech   but   their

participation   in   Parliamentary   proceedings   is   not

limited to speaking only.  Participation of members of

the   Parliament   is   also   by   various   other   recognised

forms   such   as   voting,   giving   notice   of   a   motion,

presenting   a   petition   or   submitting   a   report   of   a

Committee, the modern forms of expression by which the

wish   and   will   of   Parliamentarians   is   expressed.     The

report submitted by Standing Committee of Parliament is

also   another   form   of   expression.   Thus,   the

Parliamentary   privileges   which   are   contained   in   Sub­

clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_345">Article 105</a> to individual Parliamentary

member are also extended by virtue of Sub­clause (3) of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_303">                                                                 67</span>

<a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_346">Article 105</a> to the Parliamentary Committee Reports. The

Parliamentary   privileges   contained   in   Article   IX   of

Bill   of   Rights   thus   also   protect   the   Parliamentary

Standing Committee Reports. In this Context, references

to   few   English   cases   are   relevant.     The   case   of

Stockdale   Vs.   Hansard,   9   A.D.   &amp;   E.2   Page   1112  is

referred.     The   case   was   an   action   for   a   publication

defaming the plaintiff’s character by imputing that he

had published an obscene libel. Following was stated by

Lord Denmen, C.J. 
</p>
<p id="p_502">     “Thus the privilege of having their debates
     unquestioned,   though   denied   when   the
     members   began   to   speak   their   minds   freely
     in   the   time   of   Queen   Elizabeth,   and
     punished   in   its   exercise   both   by   that
     princess   and   her   two   successors,   was   soon
     clearly   perceived   to   be   indispensable   and
     universally   acknowledged.   By   consequence,
     whatever is done within the walls of either
     assembly must pass without question in any
     other   place.   For   speeches   made   in
     parliament by a member to the prejudice of
     any   other   person,   or   hazardous   to   the
     public   peace,   that   member   enjoys   complete
     impunity.....” 


</p><p id="p_503">79. Another   judgment   which   needs   to   be   noted   is

Bradlaugh   V.   Gossett   (1884)   12   Q.B.D.   271.    The

plaintiff   Bradlaugh   was   a   duly elected burgess to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_304">                                                                68</span>

serve in the House of Commons.  The House resolved that

the   Serjeant­at­arms   shall   exclude   Mr.   Bradlaugh   from

the House until he shall engage not further to disturb

the   proceedings   of   the   House.  Lord   Coleridge,   C.J.

stated as follows:­    

     “.....What is said or done within the walls
     of Parliament cannot be inquired into in a
     court of law. On this point all the judges
     in   the   two   great   cases   which   exhaust   the
     learning   on   the   subject,   —   Burdett   v.
</p><p id="p_504">     Abbott   14   East   ,   1,   148   and   Stockdale   v.
</p><p id="p_505">     Hansard 9 Ad &amp; E 1 ; — are agreed, and are
     emphatic.   The   jurisdiction   of   the   Houses
     over   their   own   members,   their   right   to
     impose   discipline   within   their   walls,   is
     absolute and exclusive. To use the words of
     Lord   Ellenborough,   “They   would   sink   into
     utter   contempt   and   inefficiency   without
     it.”


</p><p id="p_506">80. Another   case   in   which   question   of   Parliamentary

privilege   with   respect   to   Parliamentary   report   of   a

select committee of House of Commons was involved was

the case of Dingle Vs Associated Newspapers Ltd. &amp; Ors.

(1960) 2 Q.B. 405.   The plaintiff sued for damages for

libels   appearing   in   the   issues   of   the   Daily   Mail

Newspaper.   The plaintiff alleged that the defendants

falsely   and   maliciously   printed   and   published   an

article   concerning   the   circumstances   in   which   the

shares   in   Ardwick   Cemetery   Ltd.   were   acquired   by   the

Manchester   Corporation.     A   Committee   of   the   House   of

Commons   has   also   submitted   a   report   that   the

Corporation   obtained   the   shares   by   presenting   a   one­

sided view, which failed to disclose the true position

of the company on a break­up.

<p id="p_507">

</p><p id="p_508">81. Pearson, J.  Referring to Bill of Rights, 1688 and

the case of Bradlaugh V. Gossett said following:­

     “....Reference   was   made   to   the   Bill   of
     Rights,   1688,   s.   1,   <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_347">art.9</a>,   on   freedom   of
     speech,   which   provides:   “That   the   freedom

     Parliament   ought   not   to   be   impeached   or
     questioned   in   any   court   or   place   out   of
     parliament.”

     Reference   was   also   made   to   Bardlaugh   v.
</p><p id="p_509">     Gossett,   and   it   is   sufficient   to   read   a
     short   portion   of   the   headnote:   “The   House
     of Commons is not subject to the control of
     Her Majesty’s Courts in its administration
     of that part of the statute law which has

     walls   of   the   House   itself   something   which
     by   the   general   law   of   the   land   he   had   a

     of   the   exclusive   right   of   Parliament   to
     regulate its own internal proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_512">     That was one of the points put forward and,
     in   my   view,   it   is   quite   clear   that   to
     impugn   the   validity   of   the   report   of   a
     select   committee   of   the   House   of   Commons,
     especially   one   which   has   been   accepted   as
     such   by   the   House   of   Commons   by   being
     printed   in   the   House   of   Commons   Journal,
     would be contrary to section 1 of the Bill
     of   Rights.    No  such  attempts   can  properly
     be made outside Parliament.....”


</p><p id="p_513">82. Another judgment which also related to proceeding

in   Parliament   is  Church   of   Scientology   of   California

Vs. Johnson­Smith (1972) 1 Q.B. 522.  Referring earlier

judgment   in  Dingle   Vs.   Associated   Newspapers,  Browne,

J. said following:­

     “The   most   recent   case   to   which   I   was
     referred   was   Dingle   Vs.   Associated
     Newspapers   Ltd.   (1960)   2   Q.B.   405.     The
     plaintiff’s   claim   in   that   case   was   in
     respect of an article which had appeared in
     a newspaper which he said was defamatory of
     him.     It   was   held   in   that   case   that   the
     court   could   not   inquire   into   the   validity
     of   a   select   committee   of   the   House   of
     Commons on which the article complained of
     had   apparently   been   partly   based.     The
     invalidity suggested in that case seems to
     have been a suggestion that there was some
     sort   of   procedural   defect   in   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_307">                                                                 71</span>

     proceedings   of   the   committee,   which   of
     course   is   quite   a   different   set   of   facts
     from the present case.  But it seems to me
     that it really involved the same principle
     as   is   involved   in   this   case.     As   I
     understand   it   the   plaintiff   there   was
     trying   to   question   proceedings   in
     Parliament   in   order   to   support   in   certain
     respects   his   case   based   on   a   libel
     published   outside   Parliament   and   was   held
     not entitled to do that.   By analogy with
     this   case   it   seems   to   me   that   the
     plaintiff’s   here   are   trying   to   use   what
     happened in Parliament in order to support
     a   part   of   their   case   in   respect   of   this
     libel   published   outside   Parliament   in   the
     television broadcast.
</p>
<p id="p_514">     I   am   quite   satisfied   that   in   these
     proceedings it is not open to either party
     to   go   directly,   or   indirectly,   into   any
     question   of   the   motives   or   intentions   of
     the   defendant   or   Mr.   Hordern   or   the   then
     Minister  of  Health   or  any  other  Member   of
     Parliament in anything they said or did in
     the House.....”     


</p><p id="p_515">83. What was held in the above cases clearly establish

that it is now well settled that proceedings undertaken

in   the   Parliament   including   a   report   of   the   Standing

Committee cannot be challenged before any Court.   The

word   'challenge'   includes   both   'impeaching'   and

'questioning' the Parliamentary Committee Reports.



</p><p id="p_516">84. After   having   noticed   the   nature   and   extent   of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_308">                                                                  72</span>

<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_348">Article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights (1688), we now proceed

to   consider   the   question,   as   to   whether,   use   of

parliamentary   materials   including   Standing   Committee

as   enshrined   in   the   <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_349">Article   9</a>   of   Bill   of   Rights

(1688).   The   most   important   judgment   to   be   noticed   in

the above regard is the judgment of House of Lords in

<a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_350">Pepper   (Inspector   of   Taxes)   v.   Hart</a>   and   related

appeals, 1993(1) All ER 42.   A Seven Member Committee

of   House   of   Lords   heard   the   case   looking   to   the

importance of the issue raised.  The opinion expressed

by   the  Lord   Browne­Wilkinson  was   concurred   by   all

except one. The two questions which arose in the case,

were   noticed   in   following   words   by   Lord   Browne

Wilkinson:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_254">           “....However,   in   the   circumstances
           which   I   will   relate,   the   appeals
           have   also   raised   two   questions   of
           much wider importance. The first is
           whether   in   construing   ambiguous   or
           obscure   statutory   provisions   your
           Lordships should relax the historic
           rule that the courts must not look
           at   the   parliamentary   history   of
           legislation   or   Hansard   for   the
           purpose   of   construing   such

          whether,   if   reference   to   such
          materials   would   otherwise   be
          appropriate,   it   would   contravene
          SI,   art   9   of   the   Bill   of   Rights
          (1688)   or   parliamentary   privilege

</blockquote><p id="p_517">85. Lord   Wilkinson   also  considered   <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_351">Article  9</a>  of  Bill

of Rights (1688), in the context that whether such use

of   parliamentary   materials   will   contravene   the

parliamentary   privilege.   The   argument   of   learned

Attorney   General   that   the   use   of   parliamentary

material by the courts shall amount to questioning of

the freedom of speech or debate, was repelled holding

that the court would be giving effect to what was said

and   done   there.     Considering   the   aforesaid   following

was stated by the House of Lords:

<p id="p_521">      In   my   judgment,   the   plain

subjected   to   any   penalty,   civil   or
criminal,   for   what   they   said   and
were able, contrary to the previous
assertions   of   the   Stuart   monarchy,
to discuss what they, as opposed to
the   monarch,   chose   to   have
discussed.   Relaxation   of   the   rule
will   not   involve   the   courts   in
criticising   what   is   said   in
Parliament.   The   purpose   of   looking
at Hansard will not be to construe
the words used by the minister but
to give effect to the words used so
long   as   they   are   clear.   Far   from
questioning   the   independence   of
Parliament   and   its   debates,   the

in the above case has held that decision in Pepper Vs.

Hart   (supra)  removed   from   the   law   an   irrational

exception.       Before   the   decision   in  Pepper   Vs.   Hart

(supra)  a   self­imposed   judicial   rule   excluded   use   of

that   the   Court   may   properly   use   the   ministerial   and

other statements made in Parliament without in any way

questioning   what   has   been   said   in   Parliament.

Following was laid down in Para 60:­

     “....What is important is to recognise there
     are   occasions   when   courts   may   properly   have

House of Lords where Article IX of Bill of Rights and

Parliamentary privileges in context of use in Court of

statement   made   by   Prime   Minister   during   Parliamentary

debate   came   for   consideration.     It   was   held   that

Article IX of Bill of Rights precludes the impeaching

or   questioning   in   Court   or   out   of   Parliament   of   the

freedom   of   speech   and   debates   or   proceedings   in

Parliament.  It was held that giving a literal meaning

will   lead   to   absurd   consequences.     In   Para   10,

following was stated by House of Lords:­ 

     “Against this background, the Board turns to
     <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_355">article 9</a> of the Bill of Rights and the wider
     common   law   principle   identified   in   Prebble

     questioning in court or out of Parliament of

     concerned with the proposed use in court of a
     statement made during a parliamentary debate.
     But it notes in passing that the general and
     somewhat obscure wording of <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_357">article 9</a> cannot

    Parliament"   would   otherwise   have   "absurd
    consequences", e.g. in preventing the public
    and   media   from   discussing   and   criticising

    the   Joint   Committee   on   Parliamentary
    Privilege,   paragraph   91   (United   Kingdom,
    Session 1998­1999, HL Paper 43­I, HC 214­I).
    On   the   other   hand,   <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_358">article   9</a>   does   not
    necessarily represent the full extent of the
    parliamentary privilege recognised at common
    law. As Lord Browne­Wilkinson said in Prebble
    case at p. 332, there is in addition:

       viz.   that   the   courts   and   Parliament
       are   both   astute   to   recognise   their
       respective   constitutional   roles.   So
       far   as   the   courts   are   concerned   they
       will   not   allow   any   challenge   to   be

        decisions   announced   in   Parliament   less
        readily   open   to   examination   than   other
        ministerial   decisions"(para   51).   The
        Joint   Committee   observed,   pertinently,
        that

             "That   would   be   an   ironic

EWHC   2062   (Admin)  was   a   case   where   objection   to

receiving evidence report of Treasury Select Committee

was   raised.     In   Para   5   of   the   judgment,   objection

raised   on   behalf   of   the   Speaker   of   the   House   was

noticed.  Para 5 is to the following effect:­

        “The   Speaker   of   the   House   of   Commons
        intervened   because   of   the   Claimants’
        reliance   in   these   proceedings   on
        evidence   given   to   Committees   of   the
        House   and   on   a   report   of   the   Treasury
        Select   Committee.     It   was   submitted   on

Parliamentary   material   was   considered   in   detail   while

referring to judgment of House of Lords in Touissant’s

(supra).   It   was   held   that   there   is   no   basis   for

distinguishing   between   statement   of   minister   in   the

House   and   statement   made   to   a   Select   Committee.

Following   was   held   in   Para   117,   124   and   125   of   the

judgment:­

         “117.   In   my   judgment,   the   first   two   of
         these   propositions   are   too   widely
         stated.   I   see   no   basis   for
         distinguishing   between   what   a   Minister
         says   in   the   House   of   Commons   (or   the
         House of Lords), which may be considered
         by the Court in a case such as Toussaint
         ,   and   what   he   or   she   says   to   a   Select
         Committee.   Whether   what   is   said   by   an
         official   should  be   received  in   evidence
         must   depend   on   the   circumstances:   what
         he   says,   his   authority,   and   the   reason
         for which it is sought to rely on it. In
         general,   the   opinion   of  a   Parliamentary
         Committee   will   be   irrelevant   to   the
         issues   before   the   Court   (as   in   R
         (Bradley) v Secretary of State for Work
         and   Pensions   [2007]   EWHC   242   (Admin)
         and, as will be seen, the present case),
         and   accordingly   I   do   not   think   it
         sensible   to   seek   to   consider   the
         admissibility of such a report in a case
         in which its contents are relevant.

<p id="p_549">         124. The efficacy or otherwise of APD as

         is   to   be   determined   on   the   basis   of
         evidence   and   argument   before   the   Court,

        and  not  on   the  basis  of  the  opinion  of
        anyone whose evidence is not before the
        Court. There is, however, no reason why
        the Claimants cannot take from what has
        been   said   to   or   by   a   Select   Committee
        points that can be put before the Court.
</p><p id="p_550">        For   example,   what   was   said   by   the
        Financial   Secretary   to   the   Treasury   to

        is   not   rocket   science,   but   something
        that would be obvious to anyone who gave
        the   matter   some   thought.   The   points   he

           than   take   note   of   the   fact   that   a
           certain statement was made in the House
           on   a   certain   date.   It   would   have   to

           This, in  my judgment, would be contrary

in  Pepper   (Inspector   of   Taxes)   V   Hart   (supra).  House

purpose for which the reference is made. In paragraph

62 of the judgment following has been held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_271">                "62.   Generally,   however,   I   do   not

          reports   of   parliamentary   select

          whether   there   is   any   breach   of

accepted.   All   references   to   Parliamentary   proceedings

and materials do not amount to breach of privilege to

invite contempt of Parliament. When a party relies on

any   fact   stated   in   the   report   as   the   matter   of

on  reliance on  such report. However,  no party can be

allowed   to   'question'   or   'impeach'   report   of

Parliamentary   Committee.   The   Parliamentary   privilege

that   it   shall   not   be   impeached   or   questioned   outside

the Parliament shall equally apply both to a party who

files claim in the court and other who objects to it.

Both parties cannot impeach or question the report. In

so   far   as   the   question   of   unfair   disadvantage   is

concerned, both the parties are fee to establish their

claim   or   objection   by   leading   evidence   in   the   court

and   by   bringing   materials   to   prove   their   point.   The

court has the right to decide the 'lis'  on the basis

of   the   material   and   evidence   brought   by   the   parties.

Any   observation   in   the   report   or   inference   of   the

Committee   cannot   be   held   to   be   binding   between   the

parties   or   prohibit   either   of   the   parties   to   lead

evidence to prove their stand in court of law. Unfair

disadvantage stands removed in the above manner.

materials   in   a   Court   of   Law   as   evidence.     The

Parliamentary materials which are public documents can

be   submitted   before   the   Court   without   taking   any

permission from Parliament.  Thus, no exception can be

taken   in   producing   Reports   of   Parliament   Committee

before a Court of Law.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1874,

which regulates the admission of evidence in Court of

Law,   also   refers   to   proceedings   in   Parliament   as   a

public   document   of   which   Court   shall   take   Judicial

notice.     All   these   factors   lead   us   to   conclude   that

there is no violation of any Parliamentary privilege in

337,  the   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   speaking

through  Krishna   Iyer,   J.  stated   that   'Anglo­American

jurisprudence,   unlike   other   systems,   has   generally

frowned   upon   the   use   of   parliamentary   debates   and

Special Court, committed a serious illegality insofar

as   he   relied   upon   the   Janakiraman   Committee   Report,

which was wholly inadmissible in evidence. The learned

relying   on   the   said   Report   passed   order.   In   this

context,   observations   were   made   in   paragraph   57   that

the report can  be admissible only for the purpose of

tracing   the   legal   history   of   the   Act   alone   and   the

contents   of   the   report   should   not   have   been   used   by

the   learned   Judge   as   evidence.   This   Court   also   took

not considered. In paragraph 58 following was stated:

Judge ought to have considered the evidence which were

produced by the appellants and only reliance placed on

the   evidence   of   Janakiraman   Committee   Report   was

           ago that for preservation of liberty and

           essential   to   vest   separate   powers   in
           three different organs. In Federalist 47,
           48,   and   51,   James   Madison   details   how   a
           separation   of   powers   preserves   liberty
           and   prevents   tyranny.   In   The   Federalist
           47,   Madison   discusses   Montesquieu's
           treatment of the separation of powers in
           the Spirit of Laws (Book XI, Chapter 6).
           There Montesquieu writes, 

                 "When   the   legislative   and   executive
           powers are united in the same person, or
           in   the   same   body   of   Magistrates,   there
           can be no liberty.... Again, there is no
           liberty,   if   the   judicial   power   be   not
           separated   from   the   legislative   and
           executive."

</p><p id="p_634">(i)     According   to   sub­clause   (2)   of   <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_397">Article   105</a>   of

        Constitution   of   India   no   Member   of   Parliament

        can be held liable for anything said by him in

        Parliament   or   in   any   committee.   The   reports

        submitted by Members of Parliament is also fully

        covered by protection extended under sub­clause

        (2) of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_398">Article 105</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_635">(ii)    The   publication   of   the   reports   not   being   only

        permitted, but also are being encouraged by the

        Parliament.   The   general   public   are   keenly

        interested   in   knowing   about   the   parliamentary

        proceedings   including   parliamentary   reports
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_370">                                                                134</span>

        which   are   steps   towards   the   governance   of   the

        country.   The   right   to   know   about   the   reports

        only   arises   when   they   have   been   published   for

        use of the public in general.
</p>
<p id="p_636">(iii)   Section 57(4) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872

        makes it clear that the course of proceedings of

        Parliament   and   the   Legislature,   established

        under any law are facts of which judicial notice

        shall be taken by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_637">(iv)    Parliament   has   already   adopted   a   report   of

        “privilege committee”, that for those documents

        which are public documents within the meaning of

        Indian Evidence Act, there is no requirement of

        any   permission   of   Speaker   of   Lok   Sabha   for

        producing such documents as evidence in Court.

</p><p id="p_638">(v)     That   mere   fact   that   document   is   admissible   in

        evidence   whether   a   public   or   private   document

        does  not lead to draw any presumption that the

        contents   of   the   documents   are   also   true   and

        correct.

        Parliamentary Committee Report as the matter of

        noticing an event or history no exception can be

        taken on such reliance of the report. However,

        no   party   can   be   allowed   to   'question'   or

        'impeach' report of Parliamentary Committee. The

        Parliamentary   privilege,   that   it   shall   not   be

        impeached   or   questioned   outside   the   Parliament

        shall   equally   apply   both   to   a   party   who   files

        claim in the court and other who objects to it.

        Any   observation   in   the   report   or   inference   of

        the   Committee   cannot   be   held   to   be   binding

        between the parties. The parties are at liberty

        Parliamentary   Reports   can   be   used   for   the

        well as for considering the statement made by a

        minister.  When there is no breach of privilege

       Court does not proceed to permit the parties to

       question and impeach the reports.
</p>
<p id="p_641">(viii) The Constitution does not envisage supremacy of

       any   of   the   three   organs   of   the   State.   But,

       functioning   of   all   the   three   organs   is

       controlled   by   the   Constitution.     Wherever,

       interaction   and   deliberations   among   the   three

       organs   have  been  envisaged,  a  delicate  balance

       and   mutual   respect   are   contemplated.   All   the

       three   organs   have   to   strive   to   achieve   the

       constitutional goal set out for 'We the People'.

       Mutual harmony and respect have to be maintained

       by   all   the   three   organs   to   serve   the

       Constitution under which we all live.
