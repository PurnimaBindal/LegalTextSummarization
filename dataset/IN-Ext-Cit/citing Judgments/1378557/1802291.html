ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">1.	Heard
learned advocate Mr.P.K.Jani for petitioners and learned advocate
Mr.R.C.Jani for respondents.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	Present
Civil Revision Application is filed by tenant. The HRP suit filed by
landlord has been decreed against present tenant on the ground that
tenant is in arrears of rent under <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_1">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act and
thereafter, appeal preferred by tenant is also dismissed. The suit
has been decreed against tenant on additional ground of having
alternative accommodation as admitted by tenant which has been
discussed by appellate Court while deciding Issue No.3.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	The
HRP Suit No.352 of 1983 was filed by landlord - Mohd. Iqbal and
Mohd Usuf against present petitioners. The trial Court has decided
civil suit partly allowing it with a direction to handover vacant
possession of suit premises to plaintiffs by judgment and decree
dated 16.1.1990. Thereafter, tenant had preferred Regular Civil
Appeal No.77 of 1990 which has been decided by 2nd Joint
District Judge, Ahmedabad Rural at Mirzapur vide Exh.74 on 18.10.1995
whereby appeal has been dismissed while confirming the judgment and
decree passed by trial Court. The appellate Court has dismissed
cross-objection filed by landlord. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.	Learned
advocate Mr.P.K.Jani for petitioners submitted that subordinate
Courts committed an error in law in deciding the question that
defendants - tenants are in arrears of rent for more than 6
months and entitled vacant possession of suit premises. He also
submitted that both subordinate Courts have also committed error in
law while coming to conclusion that defendants - tenants
causing annoyance and nuisance to the neighbours.  Before trial
Court, defendants - tenants have filed written statement at
Exh.9 denying claim of landlord. The petitioners have denied that
they are in arrears of rent for a period of more than 6 months and
also denied that they have acquired suitable alternative
accommodation. The issue has been framed by trial Court vide Exh.10.
Thereafter, evidence of landlord was recorded at Exh.54. The evidence
of one Shri Suresh A. Patel was recorded at Exh.76 and evidence of
one Shri Khan Abdulkalim Abdulhakim was recorded at Exh.82. The
tenant was examined himself on oath vide Exh.99. After appreciating
oral and documentary evidence and after hearing submissions of both
learned advocates for both parties, trial Court come to conclusion
that tenants are in arrears of rent for a period of more than 6
months and defendants - tenants have acquired the suitable
alternative accommodation. However, trial Court has rejected the
prayer of plaintiffs - landlords on the ground of conduct of
defendants - tenants is such that it is a nuisance or annoyance
to neighbours. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">4.1	The
appeal preferred by tenants - present petitioners are also
dismissed. According to learned advocate Mr.P.K.Jani, Courts below
have erred in interpreting the provisions of  Bombay Rent Act, more
particularly <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_2">Section 12(3)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_3">12(3)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/214067/" id="a_4">Section 13(1)(l)</a> of
Rent Act. He also submitted that case of present petitioners -
tenants governed under <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_5">Section 12(3)(b)</a> and not under <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_6">Section
12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act. The present petitioners - tenants are not
in arrears of rent from 1.3.1982. He also submitted that facts have
not been properly appreciated by trial Court that landlord had not
accepted the rent paid by tenant  for that particular period. <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_7">Section
12(3)(b)</a> of the Act does not cast obligation on the tenants to pay
rent regularly. The trial Court has also not properly appreciated the
fact that on the day on which issue has been framed, the tenant was
not in arrears of rent. Therefore, tenant is having protection under
provisions of <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_8">Section 12(3)(b)</a> of the Act. The tenant has not
acquired suitable alternative accommodation within meaning of <a href="/doc/214067/" id="a_9">Section
13(1)(l)</a> of the Act. Learned advocate Mr.Jani submitted that Courts
below erred in not appreciating the fact that land which was allotted
to petitioners was of 13 ft. to 10 ft. area and taking into
consideration the strength of family members of tenant, rented
premises is inadequate. Even newly acquired premises were not
sufficient to accommodate all family members. Therefore, he submitted
that Courts below have committed an error in law which requires
interference by this Court while exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_10">Section
29(2)</a> of the Act. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_6">5.	Learned
advocate Mr.R.C.Jani appearing on behalf of respondents -
landlord submitted that Courts below have given concurrent finding of
fact which has been admitted by tenant and there is no error of law
committed by Courts below which requires interference by this Court
while exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_11">Section 29(2)</a> of  Rent Act.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">6.	The
rent was fixed at Rs.20/- and Panchayat tax is to be paid by
plaintiffs - landlord and rent was paid by tenant upto
28.2.1982. For that receipts have been given by plaintiffs. But
subsequent period from  1.3.1982, rent was not paid by tenants in
spite of repeated demand made by landlord. Therefore, on 21.1.1983
registered notice was served to tenant and it was received by tenant
on 22.1.1983 but, that notice has not been implemented or acted upon
by tenant and tenant was in arrears of rent beyond more than 6
months. Therefore, landlord is entitled to have the possession of
rented premises. There was no dispute raised by defendants -
tenants in respect to rent fixed by landlord at Rs.20/-. The issues
have been framed by trial Court vide Exh.51. Therefore, learned
advocate Mr.R.C.Jani submitted that finding given by trial Court in
respect to factual aspect, in affirmative in favour of landlord,
against which no rebuttal evidence has been produced by tenants.
Certain documents have been produced by tenants. Vide Exh.58, reply
of notice was given by defendants - tenants and defendants -
tenants were examined at Exh.99 and thereafter, pursis was filed by
both learned advocates before trial Court in respect to deposited
amount of rent with a date of deposit vide Exh.102. At the time when
the matter was heard by trial Court, no advocate remained present on
behalf of tenants and no arguments have been made by advocate on
behalf of tenants. The matter was heard by trial Court after
considering submissions made by learned advocate Mr.G.B.Shah, who is
appearing on behalf of landlord. He submitted that monthly tenancy
and rent was fixed at Rs.20/- and no dispute about standard rent has
been raised by tenants vide Exh.32 giving reply before trial Court.
The rent was remained due w.e.f. 1.3.1982. Therefore, trial Court has
examined the question of fact whether rent remained due for about 12
months from 1.3.1982 to 28.2.1983 or not. This aspect has been
considered by trial Court on the basis of evidence on record and no
dispute has been raised by tenant within period of one month after
receiving notice from landlord. Therefore, learned advocate
Mr.R.C.Jani submitted that in evidence of defendants - tenants
vide Exh.99, fact of paying rent to landlord has not been established
or proved because no money order has been sent to the landlords by
tenants and no such documents have been produced by defendant in his
evidence. On the contrary, tenants have admitted in his evidence that
they were not having knowledge as to on which date, money order was
sent to landlords. No witness was examined by tenants in support of
his case that money order was sent to landlord. The defendants -
tenants have not raised any contention about standard rent after
receiving notice from landlord and rent was not paid within a period
of one month from date of receiving notice from landlord. Therefore,
learned advocate Mr.R.C.Jani submitted that because of concurrent
finding given by Courts below as well as clear admission made by
defendants - tenants before appellate Court while deciding
Issue No.3 having alternative accommodation acquired, therefore, no
interference is required because no error of law committed by Courts
below under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_12">Section 29(2)</a> of Rent Act. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_8">7.	I
have considered submissions made by both learned advocates and also
perused judgment and decree passed by trial Court as well as
appellate Court. I have also perused record and proceedings received
from Courts below. The trial Court has decided issues which have been
framed vide Exh.51 that notice issued by landlord is valid and legal
and tenants were in arrears of rent covered by <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_13">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of
Rent Act. The appellate Court has considered relevant provisions of
<a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_14">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act which required that rent is payable by
month, there is no dispute regarding standard rent or permitted
increases and arrears of rent or increase is for a period of six
months or more, for that notice for determination of tenancy and
demanding arrears under <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_15">Section 12(2)</a> is served and tenants have
neglected to pay arrears of rent or increase though one month after
notice period has expired. Therefore, according to Courts below, case
of landlord is covered by <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_16">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act and on that
basis, decree was passed by trial Court. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_9">7.1	It
is necessary to note that according to case of plaintiffs -
landlord, who has to pay taxes in respect to suit property, that fact
has not been disputed by tenants. The reasoning given by appellate
Court while deciding Point Nos.1, 2 and 3 where appellate Court has
discussed the question as to whether case of tenants has been covered
by either <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_17">Section 12(3)(a)</a> or 12(3)(b) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_18">Rent Act</a> or not ? The
reasoning given by appellate Court in Para.14 and 15 are quoted as
under : 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_10">"14.	At
the first instance, it will have to be decided that whether
Sec.12(3)(a) or Sec.12(30(b) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_19">Rent Act</a> would be attracted in
the facts of our present case and after deciding that fact, it would
be easy to resolve the controversy posed for decision, and a faint
attempt has been made by Shri N.K.Jayswal, the learned advocate
appearing for the appellant to convince that Sec.12(3)(a) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_20">Rent Act</a>
would be attracted in the facts of present case and to reinforce his
argument he referred and relied on the reported decision of Hon'ble
Gujarat High Court in the case of Somabhai Kalidas Patel v. Bachubhai
Sankalchand Modi, 1986 GLH (UJ) 22, wherein it has been held that
when the defendant or a tenant has to pay the taxes over and above
the rent, the case will not fall under Sec.12(3)(a) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_21">Rent Act</a>
but, for a simple reason, I am of the opinion that the decision cited
at the bar is of no avail to the case of the defendant because
nowhere it is the case of the plaintiff that it is the defendant who
has to pay taxes in respect of the suit property and a specific case
has been pleaded in plaint Exh.1 that it is the plaintiff -
landlord who has to pay taxes in respect of the suit property and
therefore, in the present case, it is clear that only Section
Sec.12(3)(a) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_22">Rent Act</a> would be attracted.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">15.	It
is a settled law that the following conditions are required to be
satisfied in a suit governed by clause (a) and they are -
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(1)	</span>
<p id="p_12">rent is payable by month;
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(2)	</span>
<p id="p_13">there is no dispute regarding standard rent or permitted increases;
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">(3)	</span>
<p id="p_14">arrears of rent or increase is for a period of six months or more; 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_15">(4)	notice
for determination of tenancy and demanding arrears under Section (2)
is served and 

 


 


 


(5)	tenant
has neglected to pay arrears of rent or increase though one month
after notice has expired.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">and
so far the first condition is concerned as such, it is not the case
of the defendant that the rent is not payable by month and in his
deposition Exh.99 also as such there is no controversy or dispute so
far rent is payable by month is concerned and as such there is no
dispute regarding the standard rent or permitted increases because in
his written statement vide Exh.9, Para.4 he has admitted in so many
words that there is no dispute on the point that the rent of the
property is Rs.20/- per month. No so far as the question of rent for
a period of six months or more is concerned, according to the case of
the plaintiff, the defendant - tenant has paid rent upto
28.2.82 and thereafter, from 1.3.82 to 28.2.83 the rent is due from
the defendant - tenant and as such it is also not in dispute
that the defendant tenant has been served with registered post notice
vide Exh.57 wherein it has been stated that he is a tenant in arrears
of rent from 1.3.82 and it is not in dispute that the deft. has  been
served with the notice vide Exh.57 and it is also not in dispute that
he has not sent the amount claimed in notice within a month after the
notice period has expired and the only defence that has been put
forth by the defendant is that the plaintiff was not deliberately
accepting the rent or that to corner him he was not issuing the
receipt deliberately but, in that connection it is necessary to refer
the deposition of the defendant - Bahadursha Dadusha vide
Exh.99, and the defendant has admitted in his cross-examination that
</p><p id="p_17">-

<p id="p_18">"T[
JFT BZL K[ S[ T[ VUFpGL 5CM\RM C]\ HIFZ[ HIFZ[ EF0\] VF5TM tIFZ[ JFNL
5CM\R VF5TFP"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">and
therefore, it is clear that whenever the defendant has paid rent the
plaintiff landlord has issued a receipt and it does not appear any
ring of truth in the say of the defendant that the plff. was not
deliberately issuing the receipt in token of rent received by him and
not only that the deft. In his cross-examination has also admitted
that -

<p id="p_20">"D[\

T[ S. TFZLB[ SI¥]
T[ DG[ VtIFZ[ CF, IFN GYLP"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_21">and
he further admitted that he sent the rent only for the period of four
months and therefore, considering his abovestated admission that the
plff. Landlord was issuing receipt in token of receiving the rent
from him, it leaves no doubt that the rent is due from 1.3.1982 and
as such there was no necessity or occasion for the plaintiff to stop
the practice of issuing receipts in receiving the rent only from
1.3.1982 and therefore, on the strength of admission of the defendant
himself, it is clear that he was or is tenant of arrears of rent from
1.3.82 and that till service of notice or thereafter, also he did not
care to pay the rent due from him and from his admission, it is also
clear that he has not sent the amount of rent by money order and if
he has sent the amount then it was not for entire amount claimed in a
suit notice, and therefore, considering the case from either angle,
it leaves no doubt that the defendant is a tenant in arrears of rent
for a period of more than six months and that after notice for
termination of tenancy and demanding  arrears he has failed to pay
the rent, and therefore, on the strength of his own admission, it
cannot be said that he was ready and willing to pay the rent, and
therefore, for the abovestated simple reason, the point no.1 is
answered in the affirmative and the point no.2 is answered in the
negative."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_22">7.2	Similarly,
in respect to Point No.3, tenant has admitted in his evidence vide
Exh.99 that it is true that premises at Bajania where he himself and
his sons are utilizing said premises. Therefore, Para.16 is quoted as
under : 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_23">"Point
No.3:
</p> 


<p id="p_24">16.	The
plaintiff has also sought possession of the suit property on the
ground that the defendant has acquired vacant possession of or being
allotted a suitable residence and in that connection once again it is
necessary to refer the deposition of the deft. recorded vide Exh.99,
and in his deposition, he has made candid admission which reads as
under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_25">"T[
JFT BZL K[ S[ AHF6LIFJF/F DSFGGM C]\ TYF DFZF lNSZF p5IMU SZLV[
KLV[P"		
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">It
is the consistent case of the plaintiff that under some scheme of the
Government to provide residential accommodation to the person having
no residence, the defendant has been allotted a plot and the deft.
Himself has admitted that he and his sons are residing in that house,
and therefore, on the strength of admission made by himself, it can
be said that the deft. has acquired vacant possession or being
allotted a suitable residence, and therefore, on the strength of
admission of the deft. Himself the point no.3 is also answered in the
affirmative."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_27">8.	In
light of this reasoning given by appellate Court, after appreciating
evidence led before trial Court, the contentions raised by learned
advocate Mr.P.K.Jani cannot be accepted because ingredients of
<a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_23">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act is fully satisfied by plaintiffs. After
receiving notice from landlord, tenants have not raised dispute about
standard rent and panchayat tax has been paid by plaintiffs.
Therefore, it was a monthly tenancy and after receiving notice from
landlord, for more than 12 months rent has not been paid to landlord
by tenants and that rent become due and not paid within one month
from date of receiving notice from plaintiffs. Therefore, Courts
below have rightly considered <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_24">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act and for
that, landlord is entitled to recover  possession from tenant. The
alternative accommodation is also admitted by tenants in Exh.99.
Therefore, when Courts below arrived and having concurrent finding of
fact decided, this Court is having very limited jurisdiction to
interfere with finding of fact recorded by Courts below. This aspect
has been examined by this Court in case of Urvashiben Kanubhai Joshi
wd/o Kanubhai K. Joshi v. Bakshisinh Ishwarsinh, reported in 2009 (2)
GLR 1078. This Court has also decided question that under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_25">Section
29(2)</a> of Rent Act,  High Court would not re-appreciate the evidence
in exercise of its limited jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_26">Section 29(2)</a>  of Rent
Act in case of <a href="/doc/28087/" id="a_27">Bhavarlal Ganeshram v. Jasiben</a> wd/o Ishwarlal Ramchand
and Others, reported in 2006 (3) GLR 2230.  The relevant observations
are in Para.8 which is quoted as under :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_28">"Both
the courts below have concurrently found that no decree for
possession can be granted on the aforesaid ground of permanent
construction.  Mr. Juneja is not in a position to point out as to how
the finding of fact recorded by the Courts below is contrary to law. 
In its limited jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_28">section 29</a> (2) of the At, this
Court is not expected to re-appreciate the evidence on record. 
Considering the reasonings of the courts
below, I do not find any substance in the arguments of Mr. Juneja
that decree for possession was required to be passed for erection of
permanent structure as provided under
<a href="/doc/214067/" id="a_29">section 13</a> (1)(b) of the Act." 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_29">9.	The
Apex Court has also considered question of limited jurisdiction in
Revision Application preferred under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_30">Section 29(2)</a> of the Rent Act in
case of <a href="/doc/1647272/" id="a_31">Patel Valmik Himatlal and Others v. Patel Mohanlal Muljibhai</a>,
reported in (1998) 7 SCC 383. The relevant observations are in
Para.4, 5 and 6 which is quoted as under :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_30">"4.	Section
29(2)  of the Bombay Rents Act as applicable to Gujarat amendment
reads as follows :-
</p> 


<p id="p_31">"29(2).
</p><p id="p_32">No further appeal shall lie against  any   decision  in  appeal under
sub-section (1) but the High Court  may,   for the  purpose  of
satisfying	 itself that  any  such decision in appeal was according
to law, call	for the  case pass such order with	 respect thereto  as 
it thinks fit."
</p> 


<p id="p_33">5.	The
ambit	and scope  of the  said section came up for consideration
before  this Court  in <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_32">Helper  Girdharbhai vs. Saiyed Mohmad 
Mirasaheb Kadri and others</a>: (1987) 3 SCC 538 and after  referring to
a catena of authorities, Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.  drew a  distinction
between  the appellate and the revisional	jurisdictions of  the
courts and opined that the distinction was a	real one. It was held
that the right to appeal  carries with	 it the right of  rehearing
both on questions of law and fact, unless the statute conferring the
right to  appeal itself limits the  rehearing in  some way, while the
 power to  hear a revision is generally given to a particular case	
is decided  according	to  law.  The  Bench opined that  although the 
High Court  had wider powers than that which  could be exercised
under Section 115 of the Code of Civil  Procedure, yet  its
revisional  jurisdiction could only be exercised for a limited 
purpose with	 a  view  to satisfying itself  that the  decision under
challenge before it is according to law. The High Court cannot
substitute its own findings on a question of fact for the findings
recorded by the courts below on reappraisal of evidence. Did the High
Court exceed its jurisdiction ?
</p> 


<p id="p_34">6.	The
powers under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_33">section	29(2)</a> are  revisional powers with which  the
High  Court is clothed. It empowers the High Court to correct errors
which may make the decision contrary to law and which  errors go to
the root of the decision but it does	 not vest  the High  Court with
the power to re-hear the matter  and re-appreciate  the evidence. 
The mere fact that a different view	is possible  on re-appreciation 
of evidence cannot	 be a  ground for exercise of the revisional
jurisdiction."
</p> 


 
 


 


<p id="p_35">10.	In
view of above observations made by this Court as well as Apex Court,
contentions raised by learned advocate Mr.P.K.Jani cannot be accepted
because this Court cannot now re-appreciate the evidence which was
already appreciated by trial Court as well as appellate Court. In
this case, Courts below have not committed any error of law and
rightly examined matter which covered by <a href="/doc/1150627/" id="a_34">Section 12(3)(a)</a> of Rent Act
and tenant was in arrears about more than 6 months' period having
monthly tenancy and there is an admission of tenant vide Exh.99 in
his evidence that he acquired alternative accommodation where he is
residing with his sons. Therefore, contentions raised by learned
advocate Mr.P.K.Jani cannot be accepted and same are rejected.
According to my opinion, no error of law is committed by Courts below
and decision of Courts below are not contrary to law. Therefore,
there is no substance in present Civil Revision Application.
Accordingly, present  Civil Revision Application is dismissed. Rule
is discharged. Interim relief, if any, granted earlier stands
vacated. No costs.
