                                  Experience shows that family infighting brings downfall of the

                     family empire. No one can become a clear winner in litigations involving

                     family disputes. Ultimately, all the family members involved in the

                     litigation become losers though in varying degrees. Apart from loosing the

                     wealth and income, relationships between the family members also takes a

                     beating. The animosity and hatred continues to percolate for generation

                     after generation, though the succeeding generations were not directly

                     involved in the conflict. The present case is one such litigation between

                     members of a well known             business family who are having common

                     business and charitable interest. The dispute is not merely a property

                     dispute, but the dispute involves the fate of thousands of students, who are

                     studying in a reputed school by name “Chettinad Vidyashram”, which was

                     established as early as in the year 1986. Since the school is also the subject

                     matter of the litigation, it would have been better if both the parties to the

                     dispute could have amicably resolved their differences for the sake of the

                     Educational Institution and its students. But, unfortunately, that has not

                     happened. The noble objects of the author of the Public Trust has got

                     shattered due to the infighting between the family members.

                     issues being triable and hence, pleading an injunction is inappropriate as

                     the burden of proof lies on them as they assert that the Trust is not the

                     first appearance or on the face of it or so far as it can be judged from the

                     first disclosure. Prima facie case means that evidence brought on record

                     would reasonably allow the conclusion that the plaintiff seeks.



</p><p id="p_232">                                  65. The second condition for grant of an interim injunction is the

                     balance of convenience which must be in favour of the applicant. In other

                     words, the Court must be satisfied with the comparative mischief, hardship

                     or the inconvenience which is likely to be caused to the applicant by

                     refusing injunction will be greater than that which is likely to be caused to

                     the opposite party by granting it. Hence, it is the duty of the Court to

                     consider the convenience of the plaintiff as against the convenience of the

                     defendant. If the Court thinks that by refusing an injunction is greater or

                     more inconvenience will be caused to the plaintiff, it will grant interim

                     injunction. However, if the Court finds that greater inconvenience will be

                     caused to the defendant then it will refuse the relief.



</p><p id="p_233">                                  66. The Court while granting or refusing injunction shall exercise

                     sound, judicious discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or

                     injury which is likely to be caused to the parties if the injunction is refused

                     and compare it with that it is likely to be caused to the other side if the

                     injunction is granted.           If on weighing competing possibilities or

                     probabilities of the likelihood of injury and if the Court considers that

                     pending the suit, the subject-matter should be maintained in the statusquo,

                     an injunction would be issued. In other words, the plaintiff has to show

                     that the comparative mischief from the inconvenience which will arise

                     from withholding the injunction will be greater than the convenience which

                     is likely to arise from granting it. There must be a proper balance between

                     the parties and the balance cannot be a one-sided balance.

                     dedication was made to God or for a public chartiable purpose is

                     immaterial as both the dedications are not made to a living person and

                             “Income from property” under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_48">I.T. Act</a>, 1961, one has to go only
                             by the ownership and not by the fact as to who is in actual receipt of
                             the income from the property. We are not inclined to accept the third
                             contention advanced on behalf of the assessee that there has been
                             a diversion of income by overriding title in the present case and,
                             therefore, the income from the Chettinad Colony properties cannot
                             be assessed in the hands of the assessee. We do not see how the
                             principle of diversion of income by overriding title could be invoked
                             by the assessee, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case.
                             Since the assessee&#x27;s contention that the title had already passed
                             from the donor to the trust on February 9, 1969, itself has not been
                             accepted and it has been found that the title passed from the
                             donor to the trust only on March 8, 1971, the assessee in this
                             case continued to be the owner of the property till March 8, 1971,

                             and, therefore, it is only the assessee who has to be assessed on
                             the income from those properties. From the mere fact that the
                             assessee has chosen to permit the trust to enjoy the income
                             therefrom, it cannot be taken to be a diversion of income by
                             overriding title.

                     years and that too, when the said Deed of Declaration dated 28.03.1970

                     defendant Society as prayed for in these interlocutory applications will not

                     arise. The doctrine of estoppel may get attracted and a pleading to that

                     defendant Society and she having accepted the title of the plaintiff Trust in

                     contradictory stand which is diametrically opposite to the plea taken in the

                     suit CS.No.198 of 2016, where she has accepted the lease deed dated

                     29.10.2015 which confirms that she is only a lessee and not entitled for

                     any partition as sought for in CS.No.223 of 2021. Only in cases where

                     Will, dated 18.02.2015, there is a residual clause and therefore, as per the

                     property has been bequeathed. The said contention is true or not cannot

                     be decided in these interlocutory applications, but can be decided only

                     after trial that too, when on a prima facie consideration based on the

                     stand with regard to the development of suit C schedule property.

                     However, as regards, whether the building sanction was obtained in

                     accordance with the statutory building rules or not is a matter for

                     consideration in W.P.No.18058 of 2021, wherein, another learned Single

                     Judge of this Court as submitted by the respective Counsels has reserved

                     can be understood to signify the proverb that ‘you can’t eat your cake and

                     have it too!’. The conditions for the Doctrine of approbate and reprobate to

                     apply in a given situation are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_365">                                  (a) The first condition is that the party must have elected or made
                     his choice in clear and unequivocal terms;
</p><p id="p_366">                                  (b) The second condition is that it is not necessary for the electing
                     party to have taken a benefit from the choice he has made as such;
</p><p id="p_367">                                  (c) The third condition is that the electing party&#x27;s subsequent
                     conduct must be inconsistent with his earlier election or approbation.


                     In essence, the doctrine is about preventing an inconsistent conduct and
                     ensuring a just outcome.

                     dated 29.10.2015 under which the Society is a lessee of the suit A

                     schedule property. The plaintiff in CS.No.223 of 2021 and the sixth

                     defendant Society have also accepted in all their pleadings in CS.No.198

                     CS.No.198 of 2016. Therefore this Court is of the prima facie view that

                     Doctrine of approbate and reprobate applies to the plaintiff in C.S.No.223

                     of 2021 and the sixth defendant Society as the plaintiff cannot now take a

                     diametrically opposite stand now by claiming inheritance through partition.

                     stipulates that any resolution to be passed by the plaintiff Trust in

                     C.S.No.198 of 2016 shall be decided by majority of the Trustees present at

                     the meeting and the decision of the majority shall be final. However, the

                     lease deed, dated 29.10.2015 in favour of the sixth defendant Society in

                     C.S.No.223 of 2021 does not refer to any resolution passed by the

                     majority of the Trustees of the plaintiff Trust in C.S.No.198 of 2016.

                     <a href="/doc/1846928/" id="a_56">Section 48</a> of the Indian Trust Act, though not applicable to a public trust,

                     the instrument of Trust otherwise provides. Therefore, on a prima facie

                     consideration, this Court will have to necessarily accept the resolution,

                     defendant Society to prove that the resolution was passed by the board of

                     favour of the society which is running the school. When no such evidence

                     is produced, this Court is of the considered view that no prima facie case

                     has been made out by the plaintiff in CS.No.223 of 2021 and the sixth

                     defendant Society for the grant of any interim injunction in their favour in
