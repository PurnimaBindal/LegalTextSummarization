: Judgement 


                            ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">          (Passed on this 23rd day of April, 2012)

  (Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">/227</a> of the Constitution
                          of India)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits

     that the petitioner was duly appointed on the post of

     Shiksha Karmi Grade-II by the appointment order dated

     17.06.2005  (Annexure P-3). On the basis of  certain

     complaint, by order dated 06.12.2005 (Annexure P-2) the

     Director, Panchayat &amp; Social Welfare, Raipur,  while

     exercising  his power under Section 85  (1)  of  the

     Chhattisgarh Panchayat Raj Adhiniyam, 1993 (for short "the

     Adhiniyam, 1993"), suspended the execution of the order of

     appointment, issued by the Chief Executive Officer, Zila

     Panchayat, Janjgir-Champa. On the basis of said order dated

     06.12.2005, the Chief Executive Officer, passed the impugned

     order of termination on 13.12.2005 (Annexure P-1) without

     affording any opportunity of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits

     that the impugned order passed by the Chief Executive

     Officer, is without competence, as he has exceeded his

     jurisdiction in terminating the services of the petitioner

     without following due process of law, as prescribed under

     the Chhattisgarh Panchayat Shiksha Karmis (Recruitment and

     Conditions of Service)  Rules, 1997 (for short "the Rules,

     1997").
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.   The Director, exercising his power under Section 85 (2)

     of the Adhiniyam, 1993, suspended the order of appointment

     issued, may be with the purpose to hold enquiry. The Chief

     Executive Officer, has no authority or competence to

     terminate the services on the basis of suspension order

     passed by the Director.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the State respondents

     submits that there is no dispute that the Director exercised

     his power to suspend the execution order with the purpose to

     examine the order issued and thereafter, the order of

     termination from service can be passed.


</p><p id="p_9">5.   Having heard learned counsel appearing for the parties,

     perused the pleadings and documents appended thereto, it is

     evident that the Chief Executive Officer has passed the

     order of termination on the basis of suspension order passed

     under Section 85 (1) by the Director.

</p><p id="p_12">6.   The service condition of Shiksha Karmis are governed by

     the Rules, 1997. It is well settled principles of law that

     principle of natural justice must be read  into  the

     provisions of law, which provides for termination at any

     time by one month notice, as prescribed under Rule 10 of the

     Rules, 1997. In the case on hand, nothing has been done,

     even one month notice has also not been given.

</p><p id="p_13">7.   The removal of a regular employee without affording an

     opportunity of hearing is unconstitutional, as under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_3">Article

     311(2)</a> of the Constitution, it is provided that no such

     person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank

     except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the

     charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of

     being heard in respect of those charges. In such cases,

     where the employer has power to remove the employee from

     service, in that event also, the basic opportunity of

     hearing must be afforded to the employee. Thus, the impugned

     order  is illegal and cannot be sustained under  the

     provisions of law.

     Chhattisgarh and Others1</a> observed as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "13.  It is well settled principle  of
            law  that  if  any order  visits  with

<p id="p_15">9.   This  Court,  in  Ku. Punam &amp; Others  v.  State  of

     Chhattisgarh &amp; Others14, wherein an identical issue came up

     for consideration, observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          "20.       It  is well settled that  the
               purpose of rules of natural justice
               is  not to administer justice alone
               but   to  prevent  miscarriage   of
               justice   and  the  principles   of
               natural  justice are applicable  to
               the  administrative order, if  such
               order affects right of a citizen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">          21.  Applying well settled principle  of
               law  to  the  facts of  the  cases,
               there  is a common thread that  the
               principle of natural justice is not
               unruly  horse.  The  principles  of
               natural justice are required to  be
               complied with, having regard to the
               facts  situation obtained  therein.
               Thus,  the  principles  of  natural
               justice may not be required  to  be
               followed  in the cases,  where  the
               facts are admitted. Secondly,  that
               it  is  practically  impossible  or
               highly  improbable  to  afford   an
               opportunity  of  hearing,  in   the
               event, of quashing of selection  on
               account  of irregularity  committed
               on    mass   scale,   or   en-masse
               cancellation.  Thirdly,  no  useful
               purpose   would   be   served    by
               affording    an   opportunity    of
               hearing."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">10.  Accordingly,  the  impugned order  dated  13.12.2005

     (Annexure P-1) is quashed and the writ petition is allowed

     with all consequential benefits. No order asto costs.
