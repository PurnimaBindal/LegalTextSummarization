ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">	The
present revision application has been filed by the
petitioners-original defendants for the prayer that the decree passed
in H.R.P. Suit No. 2396/83 by the Small Causes Court, Ahmedabad dated
30.6.94 and also the judgment and order passed by the Appellate Bench
of the Small Causes, Ahmedabad, in Civil Appeal No. 83/94  dated
1.9.2000 confirming the said judgment and decree may be quashed and
set aside on the grounds set out in the memo of this revision
application, inter alia, that both the courts have committed an error
in appreciating the evidence.  It is also contended that both the
courts have failed to consider the fact that both the defendants were
residing along with the father as members of joint family in the suit
premises. Therefore, a specific contention referring to sec.
5(11)(c)(i)  that the tenancy right has been transmitted to the
defendants has not been appreciated properly which has led to
miscarriage of justice.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	Learned
advocate Mr. Gohil referred to both the judgments and also the
grounds in the memo of this application, particularly ground (C) and
submitted that a specific contention was raised  that the applicants
were residing in a joint family which has not been considered.
Similarly he referred to ground (D) and submitted that the provisions
of sec. 5(11)(c)(i) of the Bombay Rent Act providing for transmission
of the tenancy of a member of the tenant's family residing with the
tenant at the time of his death has not been appreciated.  For that
purpose learned advocate Mr. Gohil referred to exh. 73 which is an
identity card which has been discussed in Para 13 of the judgment of
the trial court. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	Learned
advocate Mr. Gohil referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/1723904/" id="a_1">Baldev Sahai Bangla v. R.C. Bhasin</a>, reported in
AIR 1982 SC 1091, and submitted that in this judgment, the Hon'ble
Apex Court has considered the definition of "family" and
he submitted that descendants from the common ancestors are included
in the term family.  He submitted referring to the observations in
this judgment that it has to be interpreted beneficially and has to
be liberally construed.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.	Learned
advocate Mr. Gohil has also referred to and relied upon the judgment
in the case of Jivram Ranchhoddas Thakkar and anr., reported
in AIR 1977 SC 1357.  He submitted that if the father has taken the
premises on rent, after the death of the father other family members
like the respondent original defendants who were residing in the
premises as members of the joint family would be entitled to
protection under sec. 5(11)(c)(i).  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">5.	Learned
advocate Mr. Gohil submitted that both the courts have failed to
consider this aspect. He has also referred to the record and
submitted that as both the courts have committed a grave error in
appreciating this aspect and the provisions of sec. 5(11)(c) of the
<a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_2">Rent Act</a>, the present revision application may be allowed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">6.	Learned
advocate Mr. Rajguru referred to the judgment of the trial court
(para 16) and submitted that defendant No. 2 only was residing after
1978 and there is no evidence regarding his residence before 1978. 
He pointedly referred to the observations made by the trial court in
the judgment and submitted that the courts below have considered the
aspect of sec. 5(11)(c) and on appreciation of facts the conclusion
has been arrived at. He submitted referring to the evidence, the
ration card at exh. 75, that it has been observed that family members
are only 4 as stated in the old ration card at exh. 76.  He
strenuously submitted that on the basis of such evidence the
observations have been made and conclusion has been arrived at that
the family of defendants No. 1 and 2 were not residing in the joint
family and therefore the submissions made based on sec. 5(11)(c) of
the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_3">Rent Act</a> are an after-thought which may not be accepted. He
submitted that even the driving licence which is produced at exh. 74
refers to the other address which has been discussed in the judgment
and therefore the findings arrived at by both the courts below may
not be disturbed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">7.	He
has referred to and relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1987 SC
1782 in the case of <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_4">Helper Girdharbhai v. Saiyed Mohmad Mirasaheb
Kadri and ors. Referring</a> to the observations made in Head Note A,
Para 5, he submitted that as observed, even if the tenant of the
premises in which the business of the firm was carried on was a
partner, it could not amount to subletting.  He emphasised the
observations,
 


 


 


"It
is well settled that if there was a partnership firm of which tenant
of the premises in which the business of the firm was carried on was
a partner, the fact of carrying on of business of the partnership in
the premises would not amount to subletting lead to the forfeiture of
the tenancy."
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_8">8.	Learned
advocate Mr. Rajguru has also referred to and relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1647272/" id="a_5">Patel Valmik
Himatlal and ors. v. Patel Mohanlal Muljibhai</a> (dead) through Lrs,
reported in AIR 1998 SC 3325, to support his submission with regard
to the scope of revisional jurisdiction and submitted that even
though the revision is under sec. 29(2) of the Bombay Rent Act
reappraisal of the evidence by the High Court would not be made.  He
submitted that as observed in this judgment, if no material
irregularity in appreciation of evidence is pointed out, the fact
that a different view is possible is no ground for exercise of
revisional jurisdiction.  He emhasised the observation,
 


 


 


"5.
</p><p id="p_9">The ambit and scope of the said section came up for consideration
before this Court in <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_6">Helper Girdharbhai v. Saiyed Mohmad Mirasaheb
Kadri</a>, (1987) 3 SCC 538 : (AIR 1987 SC 1782) and after referring to a
catena of authorities, Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. drew a distinction
between the appellate and the revisional jurisdictions of the Courts
and opined that the distinction was a real one. It was held that the
right to appeal carries with it the right of rehearing both on
questions of law and fact, unless the statute conferring the right to
appeal itself limits the rehearing in some way, while the power to
hear a revision is generally given to a particular case is decided
according to law. The Bench opined that although the High Court had
wider powers than that which could be exercised under Section 115 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, yet its revisional jurisdiction could
only be exercised for a limited purpose with a view to satisfying
itself that the decision under challenge before it is according to
law. The High Court cannot substitute its own findings on a question
of fact for the findings recorded by the Courts below on reappraisal
of evidence. Did the High Court exceed its jurisdiction ?
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_10">6. The
powers under <a href="/doc/1922056/" id="a_7">Section 29(2)</a> are revisional powers with which the High
Court is clothed. It empowers the High Court to correct errors which
may make the decision contrary to law and which errors go to the root
of the decision but it does not vest the High Court with the power to
rehear the matter and reappreciate the evidence. The mere fact that a
different view is possible on reappreciation of evidence cannot be a
ground for exercise of the revisional jurisdiction."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


 


 

<p id="p_11">He
therefore submitted that the present revision application may not be
entertained.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_12">9.	In
view of rival submissions, it is required to be considered whether
the present revision application can be entertained or not.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_13">10.	The
submissions which have been made by learned advocate Mr. Gohil are
required to be considered in light of the material and evidence on
record.  Much emphasis given on the aspect of sec. 5(11)(c)
contending that both the courts below have failed to appreciate that
the respondent-original defendants were members of the original
tenant's family and they were residing in a joint family which would
justify the transmission of the tenancy rights under the Bombay Rent
Act is required to be considered in background of the material and
evidence on record.  There is no doubt about sec. 5(11)(c)(i) that
the tenancy rights would be transmitted to the members of the
deceased tenant's family. However, sec. 5(11)(c)(i) provides,
 

 


 


"(i)
in relation to premises let for residence, any member of the tenant's
family residing with the tenant at the time of, or within three
months immediately preceding, the death of the tenant as may be
decided in default of agreement by the Court."
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_14">11.	Therefore,
it is required to be established that the members of the tenant's
family were residing with the tenant at the time of his death. 
However, as can be seen from the discussion which has been made on
appreciation of evidence in the judgment of both the courts below, it
is evident that father of the defendants died in 1953. However, the
driving licence, exh. 74, refers to the address as Near Pilot Dairy,
Kankaria and not the suit premises.  In the ration card which has
been produced at exh. 75 also the name of the family members of
defendant No. 2 are mentioned. This aspect has also been discussed in
the judgment of the lower appellate court in Para 27, 28, 29 &amp; 30
wherein it has been specifically stated that defendant No. 2 was
residing at Akaseth's Kuva's Pole and when defendant No. 1 shifted to
the suit premises, defendant No. 2 continued to stay in Akaseth's
Kkuva's Pole.  There is a reference to the additional evidence and
also the aspect of sec. 5(11)(c).  The submission made by learned
advocate Mr. Gohil that this aspect has not been considered cannot be
believed or accepted.  The member of the family has to be residing
with the deceased tenant as provided under the law.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_15">12.	In
the facts of the case, there is no quarrel with regard to the
proposition canvased by learned advocate Mr. Gohil referring to the
word 'family' that it has to be construed liberally and beneficially
referring to the judgment reported in the case of Baldev Sahai
Bangla (supra).  However, at the same time, as the same has been
considered  by both the courts below and have come to the concurrent
finding of facts on appreciation of evidence, this court would not be
justified in exercise of revisional jurisdiction to interfere with
the finding of facts. As rightly emphasised referring to the judgment
 reported in the case of Patel Valmik Himatlal and ors.
(supra) and the scope of sec. 29(2) of the Bombay Rent Act  that even
though sec. 29(2) provides that the High Court should arrive at the
satisfaction that the judgment in appeal by the lower appellate court
was according to law, the ambit and scope of exercise of jurisdiction
would still be limited as that of revisional jurisdiction and not the
appellate jurisdiction.  This aspect has been clarified by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Patel Valmik Himatlal and ors.
(supra) in Para 5 &amp; 6 which has been quoted hereinabove. The
Hon'ble Apex Court has specifically observed that revisional
jurisdiction could be exercised for limited purpose with a view to
satisfy itself that the decision under challenge is according to law
and there is no material irregularity in construing the provision of
law or applying the law.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_16">13.	Therefore,
as there is no error  in construing the provisions of law or applying
the law to the facts of the case while arriving at the conclusion, it
would not be justified to interfere with the concurrent findings of
facts arrived at by both the courts below and therefore the court is
not inclined to entertain the present revision application and it
deserves to be rejected and accordingly stands rejected. Rule is
discharged.

 FURTHER
ORDER
 

	After
the order was pronounced, learned advocate Mr. Gohil submitted that
his client is in possession and, therefore, status-quo may be
continued for some time, to which learned advocate Mr. Rajguru has
reservations. However, in the interest of justice, status-quo is
ordered to be continued till 30.6.2011.
