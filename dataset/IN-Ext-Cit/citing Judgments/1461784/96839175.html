No.807 of 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         Both the above captioned first appeals under Section 96
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are arising out of
common judgment dated 31.1.2017 passed by the 4 th Additional
Senior Civil Judge, Ahmedabad (Rural) in Regular Civil Suit
No.217 of 2014 (Old H. R. P. Suit No.352 of 2017) and the
Special Civil Suit No.807 of 2012 by which the learned Judge
dismissed the Regular Civil Suit No.217 of 2014 (Old H. R. P.
Suit No.352 of 2017) and partly allowed the Special Civil Suit
No.807 of 2012. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied by the
judgment dated 31.1.2017 the appellant has instituted the
present first appeals.
</p>

<p id="p_4">       Both the captioned first appeals are at the instance of the

(A) Facts of the First Appeal No.3579 of 2017 - Regular Civil
Suit No. 217/14 (Old HRP No. 352/07) First Appeal :-
</p>

<p id="p_7">2.1 The plaintiff initially filed a suit being HRP Suit No.
352/07 in the court of Small Causes Court, Ahmedabad. The
plaint was returned back to the plaintiff under the provisions
of Order 7 Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The
plaintiff then filed plaint in the Court of Principal Senior Civil
Judge, Ahmedabad [Rural] which was numbered as Regular
Civil Suit No. 217/14. The brief facts leading to the filing of
the Regular Civil Suit No. 217/14 are summarized thus :-
</p>

<p id="p_8">     The       property   bearing    bunglow    No.12        situated         in
&#x27;Pahelgaun Bunglows&#x27;, Premdeep Co-operative Housing Society
Ltd., Opp. Akash Tower, Judges Bunglow Road, Vastrapur,
Ahmedabad is the suit premises herein. The suit property is of
the ownership of defendant no.1. The defendant no.1 is
residing out of India since last many years. The defendant no.
2 is the manager, rent collector and representative of suit
premises. The suit premises was taken on rent by the plaintiff
from the defendant No.1 on date 01/07/2001 on deposit of Rs.
50,000/- (of which receipt is not given) and Rs. 5000/- as
monthly rent. The Panchayat tax and society maintenance of
the suit premises was to be paid by the plaintiff. Further the

plaintiff. The lease is month to month and ends on the last
date of each month.
</p>

<p id="p_9">2.2     The plaintiff has further averred in the plaint that the
plaintiff and his family members are occupying the suit
premises since the said premises was taken on rent. The
plaintiff&#x27;s two sisters are using the said premises in the name
of &#x27;Jadi-Butty Real Herbal&#x27; Beauty Parlour in the suit premises.
Though the defendant no.2 has collected rent from the plaintiff
on regular basis, the defendant no.2 has not given rent receipts
from the very beginning. The plaintiff used to ask the
defendant no. 2 to issue rent receipts, but the defendant no. 2
used to say that he did not wish to give the suit premises on
rent if receipts are required. Since the plaintiff was in need of
house, he used to make payments of rent without receipts. The
plaintiff has paid regular rent upto dated 31/12/2006. But
when the plaintiff went to pay the rent for the month of
January 2007, the defendant no. 2 did not accept the same
and asked to pay Rs. 10,000/- as rent or else evict the suit
premises. The defendant no.2 threatened the plaintiff that the
possession of the suit premises will be taken forcibly through
high-headed persons. Hence the plaintiff has filed this suit
praying for relief of declaring him as tenant of the suit
premises and also praying for permanent injunction restraining
the defendants from disturbing the possession of the plaintiff in
the suit premises and also restraining the defendants from

evicting the plaintiff from the suit premises without following
the due process of law.
</p>

<p id="p_10">2.3      The defendants in Regular Civil Suit No. 217/14 filed
their written-statement vide Exh- 9 in which they have denied
the averments made in the plaint and further stated that the
plaintiff is not a tenant of the suit premises. The defendant no.
1 is the owner of the suit premises and mostly residing and
residing at foreign (Kuwait) since many years. The plaintiff has
taken advantage of non-occupation of the property and behind
the back of the defendant no.1, trespassed the suit premises
and started residing in the same. The Court below decided the
application Exh-5 filed by the plaintiff on merits vide judgment
dated       07/08/07   wherein   the     Court   below     came        to     the
conclusion that the plaintiff failed to establish that he was a
lawful tenant of the suit premises and thus dismissed the
application below Exh- 5. The plaintiff challenged the said
order passed below Ex.5 before the Appellate Bench of the
Small Causes Court being AFO No. 82/07. The Appellate Bench
of the Small Causes Court was also pleased to dismiss the
appeal on date 28/02/12. Thereafter the plaintiff preferred
S.C.A No.3915/12 before the this Court wherein the Court was
pleased to uphold the order passed by the Courts below by
order dated 02/07/12.

that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he was a tenant of
the suit premises. The plaintiff&#x27;s use, occupation and possession
in the suit premises is unauthorized and illegal. It is not true
that the plaintiff has paid Rs. 50,000/- by way of deposit. It is
also not true that the rent of the suit premises is Rs. 5000/-
per month. The plaintiff is a trespasser in the suit premises,
hence the defendant no.1 filed a Special Civil Suit No. 807/12
for     the     recovery   of   possession       and     mesne        profit.       The
defendants have submitted that in view of above the suit filed
by the plaintiff being Regular Civil Suit No. 217/14 be
dismissed and the Civil Suit No.807 of 2012 be allowed.

Suit No. 807/12 :-
</p>

<p id="p_16">2.6      The landlady- Vibhaben Rajpal Tyagi is the plaintiff is
Special Civil Suit No. 807/12. The facts leading to the filing of
the suit are summarised thus :-
</p>

<p id="p_17">        The plaintiff Vibhaben Rajpal Tyagi is the owner of the
suit premises. The plaintiff is mostly residing and staying at
foreign since last many years. The defendant trespass in the
suit premises behind the back of the plaintiff. Thereafter some
months the defendant Jagjitsingh Bhagsingh Arora filed a
H.R.P. Suit No. 352/07 dated 13/02/07 in the Small Cause
Court, Ahmedabad. In the said suit the defendant Jagjitsingh
Bhagsingh Arora also filed an application for the grant of

S.C.A No. 3915/12 before the High Court of Gujarat wherein
the High Court was pleased to upheld the order passed by
both the Courts below on date 02/07/12. As per the reasoning,
finding and conclusion as recorded by the Courts below Ex.5,
present defendant is not a tenant of the suit premises and
relationship of landlady and tenant does not exist between the
plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant&#x27;s use, occupation
and      possession    in   the   suit   premises     is    completely            and
absolutely unauthorized, illegal and hence plaintiff is entitled
to recover the possession of the suit premises. Hence the
plaintiff filed Special Civil Suit No.807 of 2012 and prayed for
directing the defendant to hand over the possession of the suit
premises to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also prayed for
restraining the defendant from alienating the suit premises in
favour of third person in any manner till the plaintiff hands
over the possession to the defendant.

</p>

<p id="p_27">(4) Whether plaintiff in Regular Civil Suit No. 217/14 proves

Court in negative. The discussion with regard to the issues
Nos.1 to 3 is produced thus :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     &quot;18.       As discussed above the plaintiff has not produced any
     evidence either oral or documentary to prove that the suit
     premises was given on rent to the plaintiff by defendant no. 2

     rent of Rs. 5000/- and he has tendered Rs. 50,000/- to

defendant no. 2 as deposit. The plaintiff has not produced any
evidence to prove that he has regularly paid monthly rent of
Rs. 5000/- to defendant no. 2 till date 31/12/06. The plaintiff
has not produced any evidence to prove that he is a tenant of
suit premises. The plaintiff has not examined any independent
witness who would give evidence of factum of oral lease. It
cannot be believed that there would not be a single person who
would have knowledge about the existence relationship of
plaintiff and defendant as tenant and landlord within a span of
seven years. The plaintiff has relied upon the conduct of the
defendants to prove his case. But even the conduct of the
plaintiff is such that no prudent man would believe. It is the
say of the plaintiff that he was in need of residence and he
could not find any other premises, hence he agreed to take the
suit premises on rent without rent receipts. But whether it can
be believed that for seven years the plaintiff could not find any
other suitable premises whose owner would give rent receipts.
</blockquote><p id="p_34">A prudent man would certainly find another premises whose
owner would agree to give rent receipts. If the defendant no. 2
was not giving rent receipts, the plaintiff could have found
another premises. There was enough time for the plaintiff to
find another premises. The plaintiff has only relied upon the
circumstances proving the conduct of the defendants. But when
there is no direct evidence nor any corroborative piece of
evidence         produced   by   the     plaintiff,    the     conduct        of    the
defendants cannot be relied upon to decide factum of tenancy.
When the case is dependent upon circumstantial evidence, all
the circumstances must meet each other and it must form the

whole chain. Different sets of circumstances without forming the
whole chain, cannot be relied upon to prove a fact. In present
case, there is no direct evidence produced by the plaintiff. The
plaintiff has not even produced any corroborative piece of
evidence to prove his case. The plaintiff has relied upon various
circumstances forming conduct of the defendants. But as
discussed above, even assuming the conduct of the defendants
to be non believable, at no stretch of imagination it can be
inferred that the plaintiff is a tenant of the suit premises. From
the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff, it can at
the most be believed that the plaintiff is in possession of the
suit premises since year 2001. Furthermore, from the oral
evidence of the defendants, even assuming that defendant no. 2
was in the knowledge about the occupancy of the plaintiff in
the suit premises, at the most it can be inferred that the
plaintiff was a permissive user. Furthermore, there is no
evidence or even any circumstance which would lead the court
to believe that defendant no.1 who is the owner of the suit
premises was in the knowledge of occupancy of the plaintiff in
the suit premises. The plaintiff has failed to prove the fact of
implied agency between defendant no.1 and defendant no. 2.
Thus it cannot be inferred that the plaintiff is a tenant of the
suit premises.

The learned advocate for the plaintiff has argued that all these
judgments only lay a principle. In present case the plaintiff has
not relied on any weakness of the defendant but relied on oral
evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_36">(19.1) I have considered the rival arguments. I have read the
judgments (supra). In all the above judgments it has been
observed that the plaintiff must succeed by establishing his own
case and he cannot rely on the weakness of defendant&#x27;s case to
strengthen his case. The principle laid down by the Higher
Courts in the said judgments has to be considered. In present
case the plaintiff has relied on the conduct of the defendant&#x27;s to
prove his case. The plaintiff has not produced any direct or
corroborative     piece     of   evidence        to   prove     his     case.      The
circumstances on which the plaintiff relies are not such that
leads the Court to believe that the suit premises were let on
rent to the plaintiff by the defendant. Thus the argument on
behalf of the plaintiff is not acceptable and the judgments relied
on by the defendant are helpful to the defendant.

<p id="p_37">20.As discussed above the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is
a tenant of suit premises and he has taken the suit premise on
rent from date 01/07/01 on rent of Rs. 5000/- per month and

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     &quot;(21.1) The plaintiff has pleaded that when he went to give
     rent amount for the month of January 2007 to defendant no. 2,
     the defendant no. 2 demanded Rs.10,000/- as rent and
     threatened the plaintiff that he would cause to illegally evict
     the plaintiff from suit premises and also cause to throw all his
     belongings out of the suit premises by highheaded persons. The
     plaintiff has stated the same averments in his affidavit of

     crossexamination stated that after such incidence he has not
     filed any criminal complaint against defendant no. 2. The
     plaintiff has also stated that after Navalbhai demanded more
     amount of rent, he did not contact Vibhaben on telephone or
     by sending letter. Thus it transpires that the incident as stated
     by the plaintiff is not proved. The plaintiff has not filed any
     criminal complaint. The plaintiff has not even tried to contact
     the owner of the suit premises. Furthermore, the plaintiff has
     failed to prove any incident thereafter in which the defendant
     no. 2 would have acted on his threats. The plaintiff has not
     produced any evidence to prove that defendant no. 2 had sent
     highheaded persons to throw out the belongings of the plaintiff

     H.R.P.Suit No. 352/07 was received by defendant no. 2, the
     defendants came to know that the plaintiff has committed
     trespass. Simply because the defendants have not stated the
     exact date of trespass does not lead the court to believe that
     the factum of trespass is also not proved. Hence the arguments
     on behalf of the plaintiff is not acceptable. The plaintiff has
     pleaded that he has paid rent till date 31/12/06. Though the
     plaintiff has failed to prove such fact, but assuming it to be so,
     then the plaintiff has not paid any amount after 31/12/06 till
     date. The defendant no. 1 is the owner of the suit premises.
     The plaintiff has not established that he is a tenant and that he
     is entitled to be protected under the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Rent Act</a>. Hence the

     The learned advocate for the plaintiff has argued that the
     dispute between the parties is relating to relationship of
     landlord and tenant. Therefore only Rent Court would have
     jurisdiction. In reply the learned advocate for the defendant has
     argued that on looking to the pleadings as stated in the plaint

     has been prayed to recover the possession of the suit premises
     from a trespasser. Thus looking to the relief claimed and the

     helpful to the plaintiff because in present case the plaintiff has
     failed to prove that a relationship of tenant and landlord exists
     between the plaintiff and the defendant. Thus the plaintiff has
     not proved that this Court has no jurisdiction to try Special

 &quot;(24.3) The defendants i.e. the plaintiff in Special Civil Suit
 No. 807/12 has prayed for relief of directing the defendant i.e.
 the plaintiff in Regular Civil Suit No. 217/14 to hand over the
 possession of the suit premises. The defendant has also prayed
 for restraining the plaintiff from alienating the suit premises in
 favour of third person till he hands over the possession to the
 defendant. The defendant has also prayed for restraining the
 plaintiff from inducing anybody or third person in the suit
 premises till he hands over the possession to the defendant.
 The defendant has proved that the plaintiff is a trespasser in
 the suit premises. Hence the defendant is entitled to get the
 possession of the suit premises from the plaintiff. Hence the
 plaintiff i.e. the defendant of Special Civil Suit No. 807/12 can
 be directed to hand over the possession of the suit premises to
 the plaintiff of Special Civil Suit No. 807/12. The other reliefs
 are not pressed by the learned advocate for the defendant.
 Even the defendants have not pleaded nor proved that the
 plaintiff is trying to alienate the suit premises or trying to
 induce third person in the suit premises. Hence the said reliefs
 are not pressed.

the court below has committed serious error of law in deciding

the respondent (original plaintiff) submitted that the trial Court
has rightly dismissed the Special Civil Suit No.807 of 2012

failed to prove that the appellant is a tenant in the suit
premises. She submitted that while deciding issue no.1, 2 and
3 with regard to the Special Civil Suit No. 807 of 2012, the
Trial Court has rightly held in Para 18 which is produced
thus:-

         She submitted that in view of above, it is clear that there
was no lease deed and no rent receipt produced by the
appellant - original defendant.

<p id="p_57">11.1 She submitted that the plaintiff has not even stated in his
affidavit of examination-in-chief that when and where he used
to tender rent amount to defendant no.2. She submitted that
there is no iota of evidence produced by the respondent
(original plaintiff) to prove factum of payment of rent as stated
in the plaint of the suit filed by the respondent (original
plaintiff) If the plaintiff had paid regularly the amount of rent
since 2001 7 years, then he would have certainly preserved
some evidence to prove such payment. However, the plaintiffs
have failed to do so and, therefore, the appeal filed by the
plaintiff is required to be dismissed in limine.

examination that he is not having any writing or his own
handwriting regarding payment of monthly rent or payment of
deposit of Rs. 50,000/-. Thus, the plaintiff has not proved the
oral lease or payment of rent by cash and, therefore, the Trial
Court rightly held that the plaintiff failed to prove his tenant
right.

can prove that the plaintiff is a tenant. The Trial Court has

the defendant no.2 was agent and rent collector of defendant
no.1. She submitted that it is the case of the plaintiff that the
defendant no.1 is the owner of the suit premises and defendant
no.2 is the manager, rent collector and representative of rent
premises.        She   submitted    that     the   Trial   Court       has      after
considering oral and documentary evidence rightly concluded
that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant no.2
was the agent and rent collector of defendant no.1. Thus,
when the agency of the defendant no. 2 is not established and
when there is no averment against the defendant no.1, it was
rightly held that the plaintiff failed to prove that the plaintiff
was a tenant of the suit premises. She submitted that the Trial
Court has rightly held that the conduct of defendant no.1 and
2 do not prove that the plaintiff was a tenant. The trial court
has held that assuming that the defendant no. 2 was in the
knowledge of the occupancy of the plaintiff at the most it
could be inferred that the plaintiff was a permissive user.

<p id="p_72">11.6       The submission of the appellant that the suit filed by
the respondent for recovery of possession is required to be
dismissed because of insufficient pleading is without any legal

&quot;11) As rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the
respondents though the appellants claimed that they were in
possession of the suit lands nearly for a period of 12-15 years
prior to the filing of the suit as tenants admittedly there is no
evidence of execution of lease deed or payment of rent at any
point of time. In the absence of execution of a proper
pattanama (lease deed) and payment of rent their claim that
they are the tenants of the suit land cannot be accepted. It is
useful to refer to the recent decision of this Court reported
in <a href="/doc/1461784/" id="a_5">Jagadeesh &amp; Anr. vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Ors., JT</a> 2008 (2)
SC 308 while considering similar claim as to the tenancy, this
Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      &quot;11. We have already noted the findings made by the High
      Court in the impugned judgment on the question whether
      the appellants could be held to be the tenants on the
      evidence and materials on record. While doing so, in our
      view, the High Court was justified in coming to the
      conclusion that the evidence and material on record would
      clearly establish that the appellants were not able to prove
      that they were the tenants in respect of the scheduled land
      under the respondents. One of the main criteria for
      deciding whether a particular person is a tenant or not is
      to see whether there was payment of rent, either in cash
      or in kind. In this case, while rejecting the claim of the
      appellants,   the   High   Court      had     considered        that     the
      appellants had failed to satisfy the court that any payment
      of rent was made either by the father of the appellants or
      by the appellants themselves.&quot;</blockquote>

   While agreeing with the said view, we reiterate that payment of
   rent or lease amount either in cash or in kind is one of the
   relevant criteria for deciding whether a person is a tenant or
   not. (Emphasis supplied) Neither lease deed nor payment of rent
   was substantiated in these cases. In the absence of any such
   material and really if they were tenants for 12-15 years prior to
   filing of suit they would have taken steps much earlier and got

</p><p id="p_86"> 12. The tribunals below, while accepting the case of the
 appellants, had relied on the entries made in the RTC record
 in respect of certain period. While considering such entries, the
 High Court had rightly held that from the entries in the RTC
 record for the years 1968 to 1974, the name of the appellants
 was not shown as the person in cultivation of the land in
 dispute and also the nature of cultivation of the scheduled land
 was not shown as that of the tenants in the said RTC record.
 That being the position, the High Court had come to a proper
 conclusion that the entries in the RTC extracts produced by the
 appellants could not support the contention that they were
 cultivating the land in dispute as the tenants. In our view also,
 the High Court was fully justified in drawing an adverse
 inference against the appellants for not producing any Geni
 receipts or any lease agreement to show that the 5th
 respondent before the High Court (respondent No. 3 herein)
 had, in fact, leased out the scheduled land in favour of the
 appellants or their father, since deceased, on crop share basis
 and that the appellants had paid the Geni to the 5th
 respondent. Such being the findings arrived at by the High
 Court with which we are in concurrence, it is difficult to hold
 that the tenancy claimed by the appellants in respect of the
 scheduled land could be established.

 considering the scope of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_7">Section 121A</a> of the Act, we are,
 therefore, unable to agree with the learned counsel for the
 appellants that in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under
 <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_8">Section 121A</a> of the Act, the High Court was not entitled to

       appellate authority and the land tribunal. Such being the
       position, we do not find any reason to interfere with the

<p id="p_92">(a)     The appellant - tenant failed to produce any evidence
either oral or documentary to prove that the suit premises was
given on rent by the defendant No.2 on behalf of the
defendant No.1 from 1.7.2001 for a monthly rent of Rs.5,000/-
and      there         is   no   proof    that     the   plaintiff    has       tendered
Rs.50,000/- to the defendant No.2 as deposit.
</p>

<p id="p_93">(b)     No evidence is produced by the appellant to prove that

he has been paying monthly rent regularly at the tune of
Rs.5,000/- to the defendant No.2 till dated 31.12.2006.
</p>

<p id="p_94">(c)     The appellant has not examined any independent witness
who would give evidence that there was oral lease between
the plaintiff and the respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_95">(d)     There is no direct evidence or any corroborative piece of
evidence produced by the appellant to demonstrate that the
plaintiff was tenant in the suit premises.
</p>

<p id="p_96">(e)     It was well within the right of the respondent (original
owner) seeking direction against the appellant herein to hand
over the possession of the suit premises.
</p>

<p id="p_97">(f)     The premises in question is required by the landlady and
the trial Court after appreciation of the evidence held that the
premises in question was required by the landlady for her
occupation and residential purpose. In our view no error
committed by the Court below in allowing the Special Civil
Suit No.807 of 2012 filed by the landlady.
</p>

<p id="p_98">        In view of the above facts and the ratio as laid down by
the Apex Court, in our view the appellant herein cannot be
said to be a tenant of the suit premises and the relationship of
landlady and tenant do not exist between the appellant and
the respondent. The appellant has failed to prove that there is

relationship of landlord and tenant between the respondent
No.2 and the appellant has not produced rent agreement and
rent receipt to substantiate that appellant is the tenant of the
suit property and consequently the appellant is not entitled to
protection under the Rent Control Act. Undisputedly the
respondent is the owner of the suit premises and it is well
within the right of the owner of the property to seek
possession of the suit premises. In our view, the                              use,
occupation and possession of the suit premises can be said to
be unauthorised, illegal and hence the respondent herein is
entitled to recovery the possession of the suit premises. It
cannot be said that the Courts below have committed any
error in rejecting the Regular Civil Suit No. 217 of 14 filed by
the appellant         and allowing the Special Civil Suit No.807 of
2012 of the respondent (original owner).
