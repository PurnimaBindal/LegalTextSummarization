stay   operation   of   interim   injunction   order.   Then   on   legal   advise   the 

plaintiff filed revision petition in Hon'ble High court, Delhi, the earlier 

counsel did not communicate fate of development  in said revision and 

suit thereafter. On inquiries by the officials of the plaintiff company the 

earlier counsel always communicated that the proceedings were pending. 

</p><p id="p_16">14.      The plaintiff came across publication in Trade Mark Journal of the 

Defendant's application for registration of mark/label FRONTIER in the 

year 2007 and then filed notice of opposition dated 25.04.2007 against 

the   Defendant's   application   for   registration   of   impugned   mark 

FRONTIER.   The   said   opposition   is   pending.   In   the   first   week   of 

November 2007 plaintiff instructed the counsel, who has filed opposition, 

to find out status in the above said suit. The said counsel on inspecting 

the case file pertaining to the said suit communicated to the plaintiff that 

the   plaint   in   said   suit   has   been   returned   to   be   presented   before   the 

competent court vide order dated 22.04.2002. On the legal advise of the 

said   counsel,   the   present   suit   has   been   preferred   as   each   and   every 

violation/infringement of the plaintiff's said trade mark FRONTIER by 

the   defendant   on   using   identical/deceptively   similar   mark   FRONTIER

and still pirating the said trade mark/label and trade name FRONTIER of 

the plaintiff with fraudulent and malafide intention to trade upon and to

and   the   defendant   is   using   the   impugned   mark   in   respect   of 

identical/allied goods and as such common unwary buyers are bound to 

be waylaid in buying the defendant's goods under impression that they 

are buying the plaintiff's goods. Hence the defendant's goods are bound 

to be passed off as that of the plaintiff to the disadvantage of the plaintiff

 FRONTIER.   Adoption   and   user   of   the   impugned   mark/label   by   the

loss of distinctiveness, uniqueness and exclusively attached thereto.

The plaintiff's claim of proprietary right in the mark FRONTIER on the 

basis   of  adoption   and   use   thereof   since  the   year   1921  and/or   1947  is 

contrary to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999.   In fact, the

liable   to   be   dismissed.     The   present   suit   has   been   filed   beyond   the 

prescribed period of limitation under the provisions of the law.   As per 

plaintiff's own claim, the defendant has been using the mark FRONTIER 

since much prior to April, 2001 when the plaintiff had earlier filed the 

suit bearing no. 105 of 2001 for permanent injunction restraining use of 

the said mark before the Ld. Senior Civil Judge, Delhi.  The present suit 

has now been filed after a gap of more than six years of the order dated 

2nd April, 2002 of the Ld. Civil Judge directing return of plaint for want 

of jurisdiction. Admittedly, the defendant has been using the trade mark 

in question through out this period. For all those years from 2nd  April, 

2002 till the filing of the present suit, the plaintiff did not take any action 

against the defendant to restrain him from using the mark in question.

</p><p id="p_26">22.   The suit of the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed as the plaintiff has 

made false statements in the plaint. The plaintiff has admitted that the 

operation  of order of injunction  dated 15.10.2001  passed  in the above 

mentioned Civil Suit No. 105 of 2001 was stayed by the same very Court 

on 07.11.2001.  The plaintiff has made a false statement to the effect that

 order dated 22.04.2002 passed in the said suit whereby it was ordered 

that   the   plaint   be   returned   to   the   plaintiff   for   presentation   before   the 

Court   of   competent   jurisdiction.     The   plaintiff   has   admitted   that   the 

operation of the injunction order was stayed by the Hon'ble Court while 

dealing   with   the  defendant's  applications  including  the application  for 

return   of   plaint.     It   is   beyond   the   comprehension   of   mind   of   any 

reasonable person to believe the plaintiff's cooked up story to the effect 

that   its   earlier   counsel   always   told   that   the   alleged   revision   and   suit 

proceedings are pending.

through a franchisee, who is running his business from the shop adjoining 

to the shop of the defendant bearing no. G­4, 1333, Durga Chamber, D.B. 

Gupta Road, New Delhi-110 005 since the year 2001.  The plaintiff has

continuous, extensive and established use of the mark in question on the 

part of the defendant during all this period till the date of publication of 

the defendant's application for registration of the mark in question in the 

Trade  Marks  Journal.    The plaintiff  has not come before  this Hon'ble

</p><p id="p_29"> 24.       The   plaintiff   has   made   concealment   of   material   facts   from   this 

Hon'ble Court.  The plaintiff has deliberately concealed the fact that the 

plaintiff   has   been   selling   its   goods   from   the   adjoining   shop   of   the 

defendant  through its franchisee  since the year 2001 after the disputes 

between the plaintiff and the defendant had arisen.  The defendant is the 

proprietor   of   the   mark   in   question   GYANCY   FRONTIER.     The 

defendant   has   continuously   and   extensively   been   using   his   mark 

uninterruptedly   to   the  knowledge   of  the   plaintiff  since  the  year   2001. 

The defendant is therefore entitled to use his mark under the provisions 

of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_4">Section 12</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.  The opposition filed by the 

plaintiff to the application for the registration of the mark in question of 

the defendant is liable to be dismissed in due course and the defendant is 

entitled to get the registration of his mark.  
</p>
<p id="p_30">25.    The   defendant   has   established   its   trade.     The   sales   of   the 

defendant's goods bearing the mark in question is in no way affecting the 

alleged sales of the plaintiff and no damage of any sort has been caused 

to the plaintiff's alleged trade or its alleged reputation. 

</p><p id="p_31">26.       The   word   FRONTIER   cannot   become   the   property   and   /   or 

monopoly   of   any   trader   being   the   common   word   used   in   relation   to 

different merchandise goods and services by different persons.  The suit 

as such is liable to be dismissed.  The mark FRONTIER is being used by 

number of persons in respect of various merchandise and services.  The

persons and is common to trade.    
</p>
<p id="p_32">27.       The competing marks are neither identical nor deceptively similar. 

There is no similarity of any nature whatsoever between the competing 

marks.  The defendant has been using the prefix GYANCY with the word 

FRONTIER.  The prefix GYANCY used by the defendant is sufficient to 

distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.   The competing labels 

are also different.  There is no likelihood of creation of any confusion and 

deception by use of the mark in question on the part of the defendant. 

Therefore, there is no question of any infringement and/or passing off.  In 

addition, the name and address of the defendant appear on its packaging, 

which itself is sufficient to distinguish the goods of the defendant from 

that of the plaintiff.  There is no likelihood of creation of any confusion 

and deception by use of the mark in question on the part of the defendant. 

Therefore, there is no question of any infringement and/or passing off. 

No instance of confusion and deception has been pleaded in the plaint.  

</p><p id="p_33">28.       The plaintiff has all along been aware about the use of the mark 

and packing  material  in question  on the part of the defendant  and the 

plaintiff having knowingly stood by it acquiesced to the use thereof on 

the   part   of   the   defendant.     The   plaintiff   has   throughout   allowed   the 

defendant to use the mark in question and grown in business under the 

said mark.  The present suit has been filed only to crash the trade of the

failed to file Legal Proceeding Certificates, which are only admissible in

26.06.1997 but submitted that the said agreement was not concerning any 

goods   under   the   mark   /   label   FRONTIER.     It   also   admitted   that   the 

defendant issued a legal notice dated 12.02.2001 to the plaintiff.  The suit 

of   the   plaintiff   is   barred   by   the   principles   of   delay,   latches   and 

acquiescence.  The defendant has been using the mark in question openly 

and concurrently  much  prior to April, 2001  within the knowledge and 

under the nose of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_36">31.   Defendant denied that the competing marks / labels are identical or 

deceptively similar or that the unwary buyers are bound to be misled into 

buying   the   defendant's   goods   under   the   mark   in   question   under   the 

impression   that   they   are   buying   the   plaintiff's   goods   or   that   the 

defendant's goods are bound to be passed off as that of the plaintiff, as 

alleged or otherwise. It also denied that the use of the mark in question on

                           FRONTIER­An Ordinary Dictionary Word

</p><p id="p_39">34.   The first and foremost objection of the defendant is that the word 

FRONTIER is an ordinary dictionary word and the question of its being 

coined by plaintiff's predecessor does not arise at all. 

</p><p id="p_40">35.       It has been argued by the Ld. Counsel for the defendant that the 

plaintiff has made claim of user of label FRONTIER of different date in 

registration   proceeding   under  the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade  Marks  Act</a>  and the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_8">Copyright

<p id="p_41">36.       Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff answered the objection by arguing that

registered under No. 662072 under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_11">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 was firstly 

used in the year 1947 and as such claim of user since the year 1947 was 

truly mentioned  at the time of filing of application for the registration 

thereof   and   also   as   the   label   FRONTIER   registered   under   No.   A­ 

73560/2005 under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_12">Copyright Act</a> was firstly published by the plaintiff 

in year 1980 and as such claim of user thereof was rightly claimed at the 

time of filing of application for registration thereof under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_13">Copyright 

Act</a>. In any case plaintiff is the prior adopter/user vis­à­vis the defendant.

</p><p id="p_42">37.   Ld.   Counsel   for   defendant   has   relied   upon   the   case  <a href="/doc/14908792/" id="a_14">Rhizome 

Distilleries P. Ltd. vs. Pernod Richard S. A. France</a> 2010 (42) PTC 

806 (DEL.) (DB)  wherein the Court has held IMPERIAL is a laudatory 

word implying grandeur or royalty; it is also a word of common parlance 

and therefore no exclusive or proprietary rights can be claimed by either 

of the parties. In that case interim injunction was refused on the ground of 

delay   and   acquiescence;   plaintiff   idly   stood   by   and   watched   the 

defendant's sale grow manifold; both labels dissimilar and any likelihood 

of deception being ruled out, the injunction was refused. 

</p><p id="p_43">38.       No  doubt  the word  'FRONTIER'  is a dictionary  word  having a 

meaning, thus being in public domain. If we look at the hierarchy of

 marks   from   weak   to   strong   in   the   spectrum   of   distinctiveness   the 

following lineage appears:­

          GENERIC­&gt;DESCRIPTIVE­&gt;

          SURNAME­&gt;SUGGESTIVE­&gt;

          ARBITRARY­&gt;INVENTED

</p><p id="p_44">39.       Arbitrary   marks   comprise  those  words,  symbols  or pictures  etc. 

which are in common linguistic use but which, when used with the goods 

or service in issue, neither suggest nor describe any ingredients, quality 

or characteristic of those goods or services. Thus 'Apple' for computers; 

'Arrow'   for  shirts;   'Teacher'  for liquor  are  all  arbitrary  marks.  These 

words of dictionary have no connection with the ingredients, quality or 

characteristic of those goods. Thus they have in the course of trade have 

become   distinctive   of   the   goods   they   represent   from   a   particular 

proprietor or source. They have thus in the course of use have become 

source identifier. 
</p>
<p id="p_45">40.       On this yardstick, the word mark 'FRONTIER' being an arbitrary 

mark,   and   on   account   of   its   use   has   been   a   source   identifier   for   the 

plaintiff's goods and its distinctiveness. The plaintiff is not only claiming

 registration as such cuts both ways. The defendant is also using the word 

Frontier, of course coupled with another word 'Gyancy'.  It has also been 

using  ®  (word R in circle to indicate it being a registered trade mark), 

though   it   is   not   the   case   in   reality   as   the   defendant   has   shown   no 

registration  of the trade mark 'GYANCY FRONTIER'  on record. The 

defendant has argued that it was only due to bonafide mistake that some 

cartons with such description and using  ® were printed but not actually 

used. Be that as it may be.

<p id="p_49">43.       On this aspect Shri Goyal has argued that the  plaintiff is the first 

who adopted and used the word FRONTIER long back as a trade mark 

which does not refer directly or indirectly any description or quality of

plaintiff in respect of Biscuits, Namkeens, Cakes etc. is a coined word in

mark FRONTIER despite objections from the plaintiff, and the same in 

itself reflective of the dishonest user on the part of the defendant .It has 

no   right   to   use   the   impugned   mark   FRONTIER   OR   GYANCY 

FRONTIER, which is nothing but dishonest. The following facts speak

<p id="p_50">44.   Shri   Singh   has   argued   that   the   defendant   though  admits   the 

execution of the agreement dated 26.06.1997 but the said agreement is 

not   concerning   any   goods   under   the   mark   /   label   FRONTIER.     Ld. 

Counsel had read the agreement  verbatim  to emphasis there is not even 

mention of the word/label mark 'FRONTIER' in the same. 

</p><p id="p_51">45.       I have considered the rival submissions. The previous franchise is 

admitted. The same was for the sale of biscuits and allied products. The 

defendant's trade mark 'GYANCY FRONTIER' is also concerning the 

same/similar goods. The defendant has not offered any explanation as to 

why on earth it did not use any other word except 'Frontier' for the sale 

of its goods similar to that of the plaintiff. While the defendant was a 

franchisee of the plaintiff, it has at least the knowledge of the trade name 

of   the   plaintiff   containing   the   word   'Frontier'.   It   cannot   feign   any 

ignorance of the same.

</p><p id="p_53"> 46.   The defendant's plea that many other persons are using the word 

'FRONTIER' in different versions to sell the goods similar/same as to 

that of the plaintiff.  Be that as it may be. If so many people are violating 

the right of a person, it does not lie in the mouth of any of the violator to 

state that let others be caught first. One has to begin from somewhere. 

The defendant being the erstwhile franchisee of the plaintiff concern is 

bound to observe highest level of integrity vis­à­vis the trade name/mark 

of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_54">                   Previous suit abandoned--Delay ­­what effect?
</p>
<p id="p_55">47.   The defendant has argued that the plaintiff abandoned the previous 

suit and the instant suit filed after about 6 years with lame plea about the 

previous suit has left the plaintiff  with no cause of action and the suit is 

not only barred by limitation but on account of undue and unexplained 

delay.  The suit  of the plaintiff  is barred  by limitation  as the plaint  of 

plaintiff in earlier suit was returned vide order dated 22.04.2002 to file 

before the competent court but present suit filed on 26.11.2007 i.e. after 

more than 5 years from date of returning plaint. 
</p>
<p id="p_56">48.       Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff' argued that the plaint of the earlier 

suit returned with no date of presentation before competent court. There 

is bonafide explanation for non­representation of the plaint. The plaintiff 

got   information   about   order   dated   22.04.02   of   Ld.   Civil   Judge   for 

returning of the plaint of earlier suit when the present counsel on their

 instruction inspected the case file of earlier suit after filing of Notice of 

Opposition. Moreover, the plaintiff has not filed the present suit on the 

basis of cause of action arose at the time of filing earlier suit (arisen on 

23.01.2001   as   defendant   has   not   removed   its  board)  but  has   filed  the 

present suit on the basis of cause of action arose against the defendant 

when the plaintiff purchased the defendant's goods vide cash memo dated 

31.10.2007 which bears the trade mark consisting of word 'FRONTIER' 

and as such the present suit is based on fresh cause of action than the 

earlier   suit.   It   is   also   argued   that   prayers   made   in   both   the   suits   are 

different and not identical.
</p>
<p id="p_57">49.       Plaintiff has argued that in the case of continuing wrong the return 

of the previous plaint and its non re­filing fades into insignificance. As 

per Sec. 22 of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_15">Limitation Act</a> there is no limitation period prescribed 

for suing in respect of continuing breach of contract or continuing tort as 

each breach of contract or wrong gives separate cause of action to sue 

against such breach or wrong. Plaintiff's case covered under Sec. 22 of 

the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_16">Limitation Act</a> as the plaintiff has filed the present suit against the 

defendant   due   to   infringement   of   the   plaintiff's   said   trade   mark   and 

copyright in label FRONTIER and passing off goods by the defendant as 

that   of   the   plaintiff   the   time   of   filing   of   the   present   suit   and   said 

infringement and passing off have given independent and separate cause 

of action against the defendant and as such the present suit is not timed

 barred as alleged. It is well settled law that by limitation rights of a party 

does  not  lost but enforcement  of that rights  lost  before  the competent 

court   if   such   party   come   before   the   court   after   limitation   period 

prescribed for enforcement of that right. Every infringing act gives fresh 

cause of action. 
</p>
<p id="p_58">50.       Plaintiff   placed   reliance   upon  Bengal   Waterproof   Ltd.   Vs 

Bombay Waterproof Manufacture Co.1997 PTC 17 (SC) wherein the 

first suit for infringement and passing off of the registered mark 'DUCK 

BACK'   was   dismissed.   On  subsequent  point  of time  another  suit  was 

again filed praying same relief referring the recurring cause of action due 

to fresh sale of infringing mark. Defendant brought the defence of second 

suit. Setting  aside the concurrent findings of the court below Supreme 

Court held that; "As an act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort every 

time when such tortuous act or deceit is committed by the defendant, the 

plaintiff gets a fresh cause of action to come to the Court by appropriate 

proceedings."   Plaintiff   quoted   from  the   case   that   "Similarly  whenever 

and   wherever   a   person   commits   breach   of   a   registered   trademark   of 

another  he commits  a recurring  act of breach  or infringement  of such 

trademark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action on each time of 

such infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in 

such   as   case   when   in   historical   past   earlier   suit   was   disposed   of   as 

technically not maintainable in absence of proper reliefs, for all times to

 come in future defendant of such a suit should be armed with a licence to 

go   on   committing   fresh   acts   of   infringement   and   passing   off   with 

impunity  without  being  subject  to any legal  action against  such future 

acts." It is also held that:­

             "The   infringement   of   the   Plaintiff's   trademark   by 
             Defendants gave it a continuing and recurring cause of 
             action   and   merely   because   the   Calcutta   suit   was 
             dismissed in default and for non­ prosecution does not 
             prevent   the   plaintiff   from   filing   a   suit   in   this   court 
             (Delhi) on the basis of subsequent infringements of its 
             trademark."
</p><p id="p_59">51.   Plaintiff has also relied upon Midas Hygine Industries (P) Ltd. &amp; 

Anr. Vs. Sudhir Bhatia &amp; Ors. (2004) 3 SCC 90 in which Hon'ble the 

Supreme  Court  held that in cases  of infringement  of a trademark  or a 

copyright, it is well settled that normally an injunction must follow. It 

was observed that mere delay in bringing an action is not sufficient to 

defeat the grant of an injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction 

also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the adoption of the 

infringed trademark was dishonest.
</p>
<p id="p_60">52.   Reliance by the plaintiff has also been placed upon Swaran Singh 

Trading as Appliances Emporium Vs M/s. Usha Industries 1986 (6) 

PTC  287  (Del.)   (DB)  wherein  it  has been  held  that,  "The  effect  of a 

registered trademark is that even if there is some delay in enforcing the 

statutory right, the exclusive right of user cannot be lost. The principles 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 27 of 39</span>
 governing other types of injunctions are not to be readily applied to the 

infringement   of   a  trademark.   While   dealing   with   the   use   of   the   same 

trademark,   it  was   held   that  in such  a case  the public  is deceived  into 

purchasing the defendant's goods on the belief that they are the plaintiff's 

goods and it is the duty of the court to protect a registered trade mark. An 

injunction cannot be refused even if there is some delay in such a case 

because that would tantamount to permitting  a fraud  being practiced on 

unwary customers."
</p>
<p id="p_61">53.   The   plaintiff   has   also   relied  upon  M/s.  Hindustan  Pencils  Pvt. 

Ltd. Vs M/s. India Stationery Products AIR 1990 Delhi 19 wherein it 

was held that the defence of laches or inordinate delay is a defence in 

equity. If there is honest concurrent user by the defendant, then inordinate 

delay and laches may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of account 

but  the relief   of  injunction  should  not be refused.  This  is because  the 

interest of the general public has to be kept in mind. 

</p><p id="p_62">54.   Shri Goyal further argued that mere failure to sue without some 

positive act of encouragement is not in general enough to give a defence 

and that if defendant acted fraudulently or with knowledge of plaintiff's 

rights   then   relief   by   injunction   is   accorded   even   though   laches   and 

acquiescence   bar  the recovery  of damages  or profits.  The  courts  have 

been very reluctant to deny injunctive relief because of plaintiff's delay 

when it appears that defendant knowingly and deliberately adopted the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 28 of 39</span>
 mark which is an infringement. If the defendant acts fraudulently with the 

knowledge that he is violating the plaintiff's rights then in that case, even 

if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking action 

against the defendant, the relief of injunction is not denied. He referred to 

a plethora of case law on this aspect. He also argued that if the user in its 

inception   was   tainted   it   would   be   difficult   in   most   cases   to   purify   it 

subsequently.  The defendant has used the impugned mark consisting of 

the   word   FRONTIER   which   is   identical/deceptively   similar   to   the 

plaintiff's   registered   trade   mark  "FRONTIER".   Defendant's   goods  are 

biscuits,   cakes  etc.   which   are identical  to the plaintiff's  goods  sweets, 

namkeens,   biscuits,   cakes,   pastry   included   in   class   30   for   which   the 

plaintiff's   trade   mark   FRONTIER   is   registered:   Amounting   to 

infringement of the plaintiff's trade mark FRONTIER by the defendant. 

Under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_17">section 28</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 the registration of a trade 

mark gives to the registered proprietor exclusive right to use of the trade 

mark in relation to the goods for which such trade mark is registered.

</p><p id="p_63">55.   Shri Goyal also argued that it is settled law that the person who is 

user of a trade mark earlier in point of time is the owner of such trade 

mark.   In   passing   off   action   only   prior   user   of   the   trade   mark   is   to 

established, subsequent user even if registered is restrained. If chances for 

success is 20% injunction should be granted since use may destroy the 

value of the mark.

<p id="p_68">58.       Ld.   Counsel   for  the  plaintiff  argued  that  in  Anheuser­Busch  v. 

DuBo is Brewing Co., 175 F2d 370  the Court referred to the doctrine 

that   a   fraudulent   infringer   cannot   expect   tender   mercy   of   a   Court   of 

equity so that mere delay by the injured party in bringing suit would not 

bar injunctive relief. Even though there may be some doubt as to whether 

latches  or acquiescence  can deny the relief of a permanent  injunction, 

judicial opinion has been consistent in holding that if the defendant acts 

fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating the plaintiff s rights 

then in that case, even if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the 

plaintiff in taking action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is 

not denied.  The defense  of latches  or inordinate  delay  is a defense  in 

equity.   In equity   both  the  parties'  must  come  to the Court  with  clean 

hands. An equitable defense can be put up by a party who has acted fairly 

and honestly. A person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing or 

usurping somebody else's right cannot clarify the continued misuse of the 

usurped right. Before considering the defence of latches or acquiescence, 

an important factor which has to be seen is whether the user or adoption 

by the defendant was honest or fraudulent.

</p><p id="p_70"> 59.       Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff further argued that as per the settle 

position of law acquiescence means something more than mere silence on 

the part of the plaintiffs. Acquiescence means encouragement on the part 

of the plaintiff to the defendant. Non­action may disentitle the plaintiff 

for the award of damages or rendition of accounts, but such inaction does 

not show any consent or acquiescence  on the part of the plaintiff to the 

defendant's   using   the   said   mark.   No   overt   act   has   been   done   by   the 

plaintiffs   who   could,   in   any   manner,   amount   to   encouraging   the 

defendant to continue to use the infringing mark.
</p>
<p id="p_71">60.       Ld. Counsel for plaintiff further argued that the plaintiff need not 

run   after   each   and   every   violator.   It   is   only   when   the   violation   is 

substantial that the person may take action.  Hon'ble the Supreme Court 

in  National Bell Vs. Metal Goods, AIR 1971 SC 898  has held that a 

proprietor of a trademark need not take action against infringement which 

do   not   cause   prejudice   to   its   distinctiveness.   Similarly   in  Express 

Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Pepsi Inc. &amp; Ors.1989 (7) PTC 14 it has 

been held that "..if the proprietor of the mark is expected to pursue each 

and every insignificant infringer to save his mark, the business will come 

to a standstill...if a road side Dhaba puts up a board of "Taj Hotel" the 

owners   of  Taj   Group   are   not  expected  to  swing   into   action   and  raise 

objections forthwith. They can wait till the time the user of their name

<p id="p_72">61.       Ld.   Counsel   for   defendant   has   relied   upon   the   case  <a href="/doc/14908792/" id="a_18">Rhizome 

Distilleries P. Ltd. vs. Pernod Richard S. A. France</a> 2010 (42) PTC 

806 (DEL.) (DB) wherein interim injunction was refused on the ground 

of   delay   and   acquiescence   as   plaintiff   idly   stood   by   and   watched   the 

defendant's sale grow manifold. 
</p>
<p id="p_73">62.       Ld. Counsel for defendant has also relied upon  <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_19">Novartis AG vs. 

Wandbury Ltd</a> 2005 (31) PTC 75 (DEL.) wherein it has been held that 

acquiescence is nothing but on facet of delay. If the plaintiff stands by 

knowingly and lets a defendant build up an important trade until it has 

become   necessary   to   crush,   the   plaintiff   would   be   stopped   by 

acquiescence.   It   would   be   a   fraudulent   conduct   to   allow   knowingly 

somebody to spend money to build a reputation and then try and crush it. 

</p><p id="p_74">63.       There is a fine diving line between acquiescence, latches or waiver. 

Acquiescence may be express or implied consent. In law, care must be 

taken to distinguish between mere knowledge of a situation and positive 

consent to it. For example, in the defence of  volenti non fit injuria  an 

injured party will not be regarded as having consented to a risk simply 

because he knew that the risk existed. Thus acquiescence is a positive act 

and   must   show   consent.   On   the   other   hand   laches  is   the   neglect   and

 unreasonable delay in enforcing an equitable right. If a claimant with full 

knowledge of the facts takes an unnecessarily long time to bring an action 

(e.g. to set aside a contract obtained by fraud) the court will not assist 

him; hence the maxim "the law will not help those who sleep on their 

rights" and "equity aids the vigilant". Waiver is an act of abandoning or 

refraining from asserting a legal right.

<p id="p_77">66.       <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_21">In Ruston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. AIR 

1970 SUPREME COURT 1649 it has been held:­

                    "In   an   action   for   infringement   where   the 
                    defendant's   trade   mark   is   identical   with   the 
                    plaintiff's   mark,   the   Court   will   not   enquire 
                    whether the infringement is such as is likely to 
                    deceive   or   cause   confusion.   But   where   the 
                    alleged  infringement  consists  of using  not the 
                    exact   mark   on   the   Register,   but   something 
                    similar to it, the test of infringement is the same 
                    as in an action for passing off. In other words, 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 34 of 39</span>
                     the   test   as   to   likelihood   of   confusion   or 
                    deception arising from similarity of marks is the 
                    same   both   in   infringement   and   passing­off 
                    actions."
</p>
<p id="p_78">67.   While  evaluating  whether  there  is a possibility  of deception  the 

yardstick is based on the reality test--as a consumer in the market. If he 

is   likely   to   be   deceived   or   taken   for   a   ride,   then   there   is   element   of 

deception.  
</p>
<p id="p_79">68.       The Defendant has used the impugned mark consisting of the word 

FRONTIER on the packaging strikingly similar in colour combination, 

design,   placement   of   words,  lay  out  and  pattern  etc.  to the plaintiff's 

packagings   i.e.   trade   dress   in   order   to   mislead   the   ordinary,   unwary 

customers of common prudence and thus the defendant has considerable 

potential to pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. The defendant has 

used of the mark FRONTIER visible in large font and the packaging is 

similar to the plaintiff's packaging which by itself manifests that there is 

a clear and subtle attempt on the part of the defendant to impress upon 

the customers and members of trade that its mark is FRONTIER but not 

GYANCY FRONTIER. In defendants trade mark the word 'FROINTER' 

is quite prominent whereas the word 'GYANACY' is in small font and 

not prominently shown. The defendant's packaging and use of the mark 

FRONTIER  prominently and the design, color combination etc. of the 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 35 of 39</span>
 packaging is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's packaging. The trade 

dress as propounded by the defendant is quite similar to the plaintiff's 

trade dress and the deception and confusion to the consumer cannot be 

ruled out as the broad and prominent features are quite similar.  

</p><p id="p_80">69.       Even   otherwise   the   trade   mark   'GYANCY   FRONTIER'   is 

deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark 'FRONTIER'.  The 

defendant has no offered no explanation at all as to the use of trade mark 

'GYANCY FRONTIER'. 
</p>
<p id="p_81">70.       The goods such as biscuits or namkeens and other similar, allied or 

cognate   goods   are   purchased   by   the   ordinary   consumers   such   a 

housewives etc. Both the marks are not available to them side by side by 

comparison.   Thus   a   consumer   of   ordinary   prudence   and   imperfect 

recollection is likely to taken for a ride by believing that he is buying the 

goods of the plaintiff and not of defendant. The facts of the present case 

are in stark contrast to the facts of the case of  <a href="/doc/14908792/" id="a_22">Rhizome Distilleries P. 

Ltd. vs. Pernod Richard S. A. France</a> 2010 (42) PTC 806 (DEL.) (DB) 

in which the goods viz. the premium whisky is purchased by a customer 

who stands on a different footing as to the level of knowledge, prudence 

etc. than the purchaser of goods like biscuits and namkeen etc. 

</p><p id="p_82">71.   Therefore,   due   to   user   of   the   impugned   mark   consisting   of   the 

word   FRONTIER   by   the   defendant   in   respect   of   the   said   goods   will 

certainly   cause   confusion   among   the   public   who   will   purchase   under 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 36 of 39</span>
 impression that defendant's goods under the impugned mark consisting 

of word FRONTIER are the plaintiff's goods which are not so in reality 

and in such manner the public will be deceived and the defendant's goods 

will be further passed off as that of the plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_83">72.       The above fact coupled with the fact that once upon a time the 

defendant   was   the   franchisee   of   the   plaintiff   and   sold   its   goods   will 

compound the confusion, as the customers may still carry the impression 

of   the   association   between   the   plaintiff   and   defendant.     An   unwary 

consumer is very much likely to believe that the goods are coming from 

the same source/manufacturer.   Having so purchased the goods sold by 

the   defendant,   if   the   customer   is   not   satisfied   with   the   quality   of   the 

goods,   then   the   casualty   of   the   same   would   be   the   goodwill   and 

reputation of the plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_84">73.       Defense of delay, laches or acquiescence does not come to the aid 

to   the   defendant   for   the   reasons   that   the   delay   has   been  prima   facie 

reasonably   explained   and   even   otherwise   the   plaintiff   banks   upon 

continuing cause of action.   No positive   acts of acquiescence has also 

been established as the defendant has not stated as to what goodwill it has 

generated in its Trade Mark GYANCY FRONTIER due to the defendant 

keeping quite and watching its sale to grow etc.

</p><p id="p_85">74.       It is the settled law that he who seeks equity must also do equity. 

</p><p id="p_86">75.       In   the   instant   case   defendant's   adoption   of   trade   mark 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 37 of 39</span>
 'FRONTIER" as a part of its trade mark since inception is tainted and 

dishonest. The cartons of defendants are manifestly blatant copy of the 

plaintiff's   cartons   as   demonstrated   on   record.   The   settled   law   is   that 

statutory right can not be lost or defeated by delay. Delay may defeat 

rendition of account, damages, cost and not injunction.  

</p><p id="p_87">76.       It is the settled law that public interest must get precedence over 

the private interests. Why the law should permit a consumer to be taken 

for a ride? While considering an application for injunction it is not the 

actual deception but the likelihood of deception that is the sine­qua­non. 

In   the   present   case,   as   the   facts   of   the   case   suggest,   there   is   every 

likelihood   of   the   general   and   unwary   public   associating   the   goods   of 

defendant  with that of the plaintiff on account of the use of the same 

trade mark 'FRONTIER'. The public interest is paramount and cannot be 

permitted to whittled down or side­tracked. 
</p>
<p id="p_88">77.       There can be no absolute case. It is only on the plane of relativity 

that the rival cases of the parties have to be judged. The plaintiff has been 

able to show a  prima­facie  case in its favour vis­a­vis  the plaintiff and 

defendant the case of the plaintiff is at a higher pedestal. The plaintiff is 

not only the holder of registered trade mark, its mark is much more prior 

in use. The defendant is stopped from taking a stand to the contrary on 

account of itself being the franchisee of the plaintiff. The plea of delay, 

acquiescence and waiver carries no water at this stage as ostensibly there 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">TM No. 112/11                                                                                              Page 38 of 39</span>
 is   a   continuing   and   recurring   cause   of   action   as   disclosed   by   the 

pleadings   and   material   on  record.  The  balance  of convenience  is also 

titled in favour of the plaintiff as it has made substantial investments in 

its  trade  mark  and  generated  a considerable  goodwill.  The  plaintiff  is 

liable to suffer irreparable loss and injury if the injunction is not granted 

as the dilution of its goodwill which will have far­reaching consequences, 

which   cannot   be   compensated   with   any   amount   of   money   as   the 

consequences will continue to haunt the plaintiff for unlimited time or 

perpetually. 
</p>
<p id="p_89">78.       In   view   of   the   above   discussion,   in   my   considered   opinion   the 

plaintiff   has   been   able   to   make   a   good   case   for   grant   of  ad­interim 

injunction   to   restrain   the   defendant   from   using   the   trade   mark 

'FRONTIER' of plaintiff in respect of its goods in any way till the final 

disposal of the suit. It is ordered accordingly.
