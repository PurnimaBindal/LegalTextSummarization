as President  of the Municipal  Council, you are duty bound  to

However,   instead   of   that,   the   resolution   was   passed   for 

reserving   the   same   for   hospital,   nursing   home   and   medical 

college. At that time, you were presiding over the meeting. By 

this illegal Act, you have violated Sections 44( 1 )(e) and 42(1), 

(2)   and   (3)   of   Maharashtra   Municipal   Councils,   Panchayat 

Samiti and Industrial Township Act, 1965.

General   Body   Meeting   was   held   on   9.1.2007.   Although   it   is 

required   under   Section   80(1)   of   the   Maharashtra   Municipal

meeting   was   held   for   a   period   of   three   months   between 

28.2.2007   and   28.5.2007.   By   the   said   act,   you   have   violated

Charge No.4 


In the meeting held on 9.1.2007, the suggestion to the Agenda 

No.4   made   by   Members   Shri   Chintaman   Gharat   and   Shri 

Shekhar Mhatre that a rented car be provided for the use of the

Chintaman   Gharat   and   Shri           Shekhar   Mhatrehad   made 

suggestion  to the Agenda  No.ll of the same  meeting  that new

Members Shri Chintaman Gharat and Shri Shekhar Mhatre had 

made suggestion to the Agenda No.20 in the same meeting that 

new Nalla be constructed in front of the house of Shri Kailash

Gharat   and   Shri   Shekhar   Mhatre   to   Agenda   No.23   that   the 

Standing Committee be authorized to open the tender/approvals 

and give sanctions for diverse works of the Municipal Council. 

The   said   suggestion   was   rejected.   Similarly,   suggestion   was 

made   by   Shri   Chintaman   Gharat   and   Shri   Shekhar   Mhatre   to 

Agenda   No.   27   of   the   same   meeting   regarding   allotment   of 

contract for spraying insecticides in Ward Nos. 1 to 17 of the 

Municipal Council. It appears from the minutes of the meeting 

dated   9.1.2007   that   even   said   suggestion   was   rejected.   You 

have,   therefore,   violated   rules   30,   32(1)   and   (2)   of   the 

Maharashtra Municipal Councils (Conduct of Business) Rules, 

1966 by frequently rejecting the suggestions of the Members of

laying down 300 mm. CI pipeline for water supply. The tender for  


lower estimated cost  was not accepted rather there was a difference 


of more than  10  per cent  in tender amount.    The explanation  was 


furnished by the appellant that there was a resolution by the council  


itself   accepting   the   said   tenders   and,   therefore,   the   appellant  


exclusively could not be held responsible for acceptance of tenders 


on the high rate of CI pipes.   Even the rate of C.I. pipe purchased 


by  Maharashtra  Jivan   Pradhikaran  were   also  considered   and   after 


considering   all   these   factors,   the   lowest   bid   was   accepted   by   the 


Uran  Municipal  Council.    The   Chief   Officer,  the  Junior  Engineer

recommendation   was   forwarded   under   the   signature   of   President, 


Chief   Officer   and   Jr.   Engineer   and   thereafter,   the   Municipal

been   understood   in   correct   perspective.   Even   if   the   three   charges 


stood   proved,   the   punishment   imposed   is   totally   disproportionate, 


more   so,   was   not   warranted   in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the

    "The   term   misconduct   implies   a  wrongful   intention,   and  

    not   a   mere   error   of   judgment.   Misconduct   is   not  

    necessarily   the   same   thing   as   conduct   involving   moral  

    turpitude. The word misconduct is a relative term, and has  

    to  be  construed   with   reference   to  the   subject   matter   and  

    the context wherein the term occurs,  having regard to the  

    scope   of   the   Act   or   statute   which   is   being   construed.  

    Misconduct   literally   means   wrong   conduct   or   improper  

    conduct.   In   usual   parlance,   misconduct   means   a  

    transgression   of   some   established   and   definite   rule   of  

    action,   where   no   discretion   is   left,   except   what   necessity  

    may demand and carelessness, negligence and unskilfulness  

    are transgressions of some established, but indefinite, rule  

    of   action,   where   some   discretion   is   necessarily   left   to   the  

    actor.   Misconduct   is   a   violation   of   definite   law;  

    carelessness or abuse of discretion under an indefinite law.  

    Misconduct   is   a   forbidden   act;   carelessness,   a   forbidden  

    quality of an act, and is necessarily indefinite. Misconduct  

    in  office  may be  defined  as unlawful  behaviour  or neglect  

    by a public officer, by which the rights of a party have been  

    affected."

      Thus  it  could  be  seen   that  the  word  `misconduct'   though

    connotation   from   the   context,   the   delinquency   in   its  

    performance and its effect on the discipline and the nature  

    of   the   duty.   It   may   involve   moral   turpitude,   it   must   be  

    improper   or   wrong   behaviour;   unlawful   behaviour,   wilful  

    in character; forbidden  act, a transgression  of established  

    and definite rule of action or code of conduct but not mere

forbidden   act,   unlawful   behaviour,   wilful   in   character.   It   may   be 


synonymous  as  mis-demeanour    in   propriety  and  mismanagement. 


In   a   particular   case,   negligence   or   carelessness   may   also   be   a 


misconduct for example, when a watchman leaves his duty and goes

institution   but   leaving   the   place   of   duty   itself   amounts   to

Further,   the   expression   `misconduct'   has   to   be   construed   and 


understood  in  reference   to  the  subject  matter  and  context  wherein 


the term occurs taking into consideration the scope and object of the

respect,   or   reputation,   shame   or   bring   disfavour   or   discredit.  


Disgraceful   means   giving   offence   to   moral   sensibilities   and 


injurious to reputation or conduct or character deserving or bringing 


disgrace   or   shame.       Disgraceful   conduct   is   also   to   be   examined 


from  the   context   in   which   the   term  has   been   employed   under   the

the   official   of   the   office   bearer.   Therefore,   it   may   be   outside   the

indispensable   part   of   a   sound   judicial   system,   reasons   at   least  


sufficient to indicate an application of mind of the authority before  


the court. Another rationale is that the affected party can know why 


the decision has gone against him. One of the salutary requirements  


of natural justice is spelling out reasons for the order made.  In other  


words,   a   speaking   out,   the   inscrutable   face   of   the   sphinx   is 


ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or quasi-judicial performance.

obligation  to act fairly without ill will or malice- in fact or in law. 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                                      28</span>


Where   malice   is   attributed   to   the   State,   it   can   never   be   a   case   of  


personal ill-will or spite on the part of the State.  "Legal malice" or  


"malice in law" means something done without lawful excuse. It is a 


deliberate act in disregard to the rights of others. It is an act which is 


taken with an oblique or indirect object. It is an act done wrongfully 


and   wilfully   without   reasonable   or   probable   cause,   and   not 


necessarily   an   act   done   from   ill   feeling   and   spite.     Mala   fide 


exercise   of   power   does   not   imply   any   moral   turpitude.   It   means  


exercise of statutory power for "purposes foreign to those for which 


it is in law intended." It means conscious violation of the law to the  


prejudice   of   another,   a   depraved   inclination   on   the   part   of   the 


authority to disregard the rights of others, where intent is manifested 


by   its   injurious   acts.   Passing   an   order   for   unauthorized   purpose  



constitutes malice in law. (See:  Addl. Distt. <a href="/doc/165099707/" id="a_44">Magistrate, Jabalpur

There  may be  some  harm or loss  that  may not  be  wrongful  in  the 


eyes  of   law   because   it   may  not   result   in   injury  to   a  legal   right  or  


legally protected interest of the complainant but juridically harm of 


this description is called damnum sine  injuria. The complainant has 


to establish  that he has been deprived of or denied of a legal right 


and he has sustained injury to any legally protected interest. In case  


he has no legal peg for a justiciable claim to hang on, he cannot be  


heard as a party in a lis.  A fanciful   or sentimental grievance  may 


not be sufficient to confer a locus standi to sue upon the individual.  


There must be injuria or a legal grievance which can be appreciated  


and   not  a  stat   pro  ratione  valuntas   reasons  i.e. a  claim devoid   of 


reasons. Under the garb of being necessary party, a person cannot be 


permitted to make a case as that of general public interest. A person  


having  a remote interest  cannot  be permitted  to  become a party in  


the   lis,   as   the   person   wants   to   become   a   party   in   a   case,   has   to 


establish   that   he   has   a   proprietary   right   which   has   been   or   is 


threatened to be violated, for the reason that a legal injury creates a  


remedial right in the injured person. A person cannot be heard as a  


party unless he answers the description  of aggrieved party.   (Vide:

appreciate   that   it   was   a   case   of   political   rivalry.     The   case   of   the 


appellant has not been considered in correct perspective at all.

respondent   No.   5   could   at   the   most   be   pressed   into   service   as   a

appellant   have   been   dealt   with   exclusively   on   the   basis   of 


documentary   evidence,   there   is   nothing   on   record   by   which   the

unpleasant resolution/demand of the council. No finding of fact has 


been   recorded   either   by   the   competent   authority   or   by   the   High  


Court that some urgent/important work could not be carried out  for 


want   of   General   Body   meeting   of   the   council.     Merely   not   to 


conduct oneself according to the procedure prescribed or omission  


to   conduct   a   meeting   without   any   corresponding   loss   to   the 


corporate body, would not be an automatic misconduct by inference, 


unless   some   positive   intentional   misconduct   is   shown.   It   was   an 


admitted fact that the meeting had not been called.  However, in the 


absence of any imputation of motive, not calling the meeting by the  


appellant could not in itself, be enough to prove the charge. 


</p><p id="p_116">             <a href="/doc/1706664/" id="a_63">Section 81</a> of the Act 1965 requires that for the disposal of 


the   general   business,   the   President   should   call   the   meeting   of   the  


Council within a period of two months from the date on which the 


last preceding ordinary meeting was held. The statutory provisions  


further provided that in case the President fails to call the ordinary 


meeting   within   the   said   stipulated   period,   the   Chief   Officer   may 


report   such   failure   to   the   Collector   and   the   Collector   can   call   the 


ordinary meeting of the Council following the procedure prescribed  


therein.   The President  can also call the meeting on the request of  


the   members   not   less   than   one-fourth   of   the   total   number   of

it clear that in case the President fails to call the meeting, there are 


other modes of calling the meeting and in such an eventuality where  


reasonable   explanation   has   been   furnished   by   the   appellant   to   the 


show cause notice on this count, the competent authority could not 


have passed such a harsh order.

pipelines at a much higher rate are concerned,  it has been a positive  


case   of   the   appellant   that   as   earlier   contractor   had   abandoned   the 


work in between  and  there was a scarcity of water in  the  city, the 


Chief  Officer,  the  Junior  Engineer  considered  the  technical   aspect  


and then recommendations were forwarded under the signatures of 


the appellant, the Chief Officer and Junior Engineer to the  council,  


which ultimately passed the resolution accepting the said tenders. In 


such  a fact-situation,  it  was a collective  consensus  decision  of the  


house   after   due   deliberations.   Admittedly,   it   was   not   even   the 


ratification of contract awarded by the appellant himself. Thus, even 


by any stretch of imagination it cannot be held to be an individual  


decision   of   the   appellant   and   the   competent   authority   failed   to 


appreciate that the tenders were accepted by the Council itself and

</p><p id="p_120">          We   have   gone   through   the   counter   affidavit   filed   by 


respondent No.5, complainant before this court and he has not stated 


anywhere that the tenders were not accepted by the council, rather 


allegations have been made that the tenders had been accepted at a 


higher   rate   so   that   the   contractor   could   get   the   financial   gain.  


Similarly,   technical   issue   has   been   raised   for   not   calling   the 


meeting,   committing   serious   irregularities   sufficiently   warranting 


dis-qualification   of   the   appellant   on   his   omission   to   call   the 


meeting,   but   it   is   not   his   case   that   he   did   it  intentionally.     The 


counter   affidavit   filed   by   the   State   does   not   reveal   anything   in  


relation   to   the   issues   involved   herein   and   it   appears   that   the 


deponent/officer  has merely completed  the formalities without  any 


purpose.

after   appreciation   of   the   entire   evidence   on   record   that   the   first  


charge  proved  against  the  appellant   for  not  calling  the   meeting  of  


Council,  did  not  warrant the  order of removal  and  the explanation  


furnished   by   appellant   could   have   been   accepted.   Other   charges 


could not be proved against the appellant, in view of the fact, that

the tenders at a higher rate were accepted by the Council itself and  


the  appellant  could  not  be  held  exclusively  responsible  for  it.  The 


Respondent   no.   5,   being   a   political   rival,   could   not   have   been  


entertained   as   a   party   to   the   lis.   The   charge   of   not   calling   the 


meeting of the Council had been admitted by the appellant himself,  


thus,   no   further   evidence   was   required,   for   the   reason,   that   the 


admission is the best evidence.  The competent authority could have 


considered   his   explanation   alone   and   proceeded   to   take   a   final 


decision.   So   far   as   the   other   charges   are   concerned,   as   has   been  


observed   hereinabove,   it  had  been  a  consensus   collective   decision  


of the Council to accept the tender at higher rate and the appellant  


could   not   have   been     held   guilty   of   the   said   charges.   Thus,   the 


instant   case   has   been   a   crystal   clear   cut   case   of   legal   malice   and 


therefore, the impugned orders are liable to be quashed.   The duly 


elected   member/chairman   of   the   council   could   not   have   been 


removed in such a casual and cavalier manner without giving strict  


adherence to the safeguards provided under the statute which had to  


be scrupulously followed.

No.5   has   raised   new   grounds   and   the   appellant     raised 


serious   objections   as   he   had   no   opportunity   to   meet   the 


same. Thus, in order to give the appellant an opportunity to 


rebut   the   same   the   competent   authority   had   adjourned   the 


case   and   directed   the   Secretary   to   fix   a   date   so   that   the 


appellant   may   meet   those   new   objections/grounds. 


However, the order impugned removing the appellant from 


the post and declaring him further disqualified for a  period 


of   six   years   had   been   passed.     It   is   not   evident   from   the 


order impugned as what could be  those new grounds which 


had not been disclosed to the appellant. Thus, to ascertain as 


to whether in order to give an opportunity to the appellant to 


meet the alleged new grounds, the competent authority had 


adjourned the case, this Court while reserving the judgment

Counsel  for  the  State  Shri  Mike  Prakash  Desai  to  produce 


the original record before this Court within a period of two  


weeks.  For the reasons best known to the State Authorities 


neither   the   record   has   been   produced   before   us,   nor   any
