1994 SUPPL. (2) SCR

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MOHAN, J. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The first appellant in C.A. No. 4981 of 1994 arising out of SLP(C) No. 9854
of 1993 is an Association registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies Registration Act</a>.
The members of the association have been granted licences to carry on
business in the retail vending of India made foreign spirits (hereinafter
referred to as 'I.M.F.S.').
</p>
<p id="p_3">The second appellant is a licensee of l.M.F.S. Shop No. 336 at No. 7,
Thyagaraja Road, Madras - 17 for the year 1992-93.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The respondent, the Government of Tamil Nadu framed the Tamil Nadu Liquor
(Licence and Permit) Rules 1981. Under these rules, Indian made foreign
spirit and foreign liquor was lo be sold only by persons who are granted
licence for personal consumption. In the year 1989, the Government of Tamil
Nadu decided to grant the privilege of selling by retail of I.M.F.S. and
Beer through auction/tender system, Accordingly, the Government framed
Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules 1989 by G.O. Ms. N, 506 Home
(Prohibition) dated 15.4.1989. In the auction, the successful bidder was
granted the licence to carry on the business of vending I.M.F.S. in retail
in their respective shops. The licence was valid for a period of one year.
Under the said Rules, it was provided for a renewal of the licence for two
successive years on the licensee offering to pay 15% and 10% respectively
more than the privilege amount at which the sale was confirmed in his
favour during the previous years. Rule 13 contained all these clauses.
Under Rule 14(3), a provision was made that it was open to the Licensing
Authority to refuse the renewal by an order recording the reasons for
refusal. However, before such refusal, the Licensing Authority was
obligated to give a reasonable opportunity to the licensee of being heard.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The successful bidders obtained licences for the year 1989-90 and carried
on the business. Most of them obtained renewal for the subsequent excise
year 1991-92.
</p>
<p id="p_6">The Government issued orders in G.O. Ms. No. 90 Prohibition dated 21.4.1992
to the effect that fresh auction may be conducted for all the liquor retail
vending shops whose licence period expires on or before 31.5.1992 as well
as those licence period expires on or after 31.5,1992 by restricting the
period of licence to 31.5.1992 and refunding the proportionate portion of
the privilege amount. This course was adopted in order to facilitate the
Government to evolve fresh scheme of upset price for auctioning of the
liquor retail vending shops in the State.
</p>
<p id="p_7">The Notification also provided that the licence to be issued for the year
1992-93 shall be renewed for the second and third years after collecting
increased privilege fees. The prescription relating to increased fees was
provided under Rule 14(1) and (2) of the 1989 Rules made under the Tamil
Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, An ordinance was passed terminating the
validity of licences which enured beyond 31st May, 1992 with the expiry of
the said period. Subsequently, <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_2">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 42 of 1992 came into force
with from 12.5,92. By this Act Section 23(b) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition
Act, 1937 was substituted. In accordance with G.O.Ms. No. 90, Prohibition,
dated 21.4.92, auctions came to be conducted. The successful bidders were
issued the licences. At that stage. the Government received representations
form these dealers for the establishment of a bar within or adjoining
licence premises. The Government forwarded these representations to the
Commissioner of Prohibition and Excise and obtained necessary
recommendations. Thereafter the Government framed Rules by G.O.Ms. No. 99,
Prohibition. dated 26lh May, 1992 known as Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail
Vending in Bar) Rules, 1992. Those Rules permitted to open a Bar within or
adjoining licence premises. These Rules came into force on 1st June, 1992.
Rule 3 provides for grant of privilege by issue of license to a person
holding a liccnce granted under Rule 13 of the 1989 Rules for retail
vending of liquor in the Bar. The Rules stated retail vending of liquor in
open bottles, glasses or pegs for consumption in the Bar, Rule 4 required
every person holding a licence granted under Rule 13 of 1989 Rules and who
intends to obtain the privilege of retail vending of liquor in the Bar
shall make an application in the prescribed form to the Licensing Authority
for the grant of privilege and issue of licence for retail vending or
liquor in the Bar. Every liecensee of retail I.M.F.S. shop was entitled to
apply for and obtain a Bar licence on payment of a licence fee and the
privilege amount ranging from Rs. 18,750 to Rs. 75,000 depend-ing upon the
area in which the shop was located.
</p>
<p id="p_8">The case of the appellant is, in order to obtain the privilege of vending
I.M.F.S. in retail for the excise year 1992-93, the members of the first
appellant Association increased their offer. This huge offer was to enable
them to have a bar attached and thereby increased the volume of sale of
liquor. On obtaining licences under retail vending rules, the members of
the Appellant association spent considerable sums of money for acquiring
the adjoining premises to locate the Bar in accordance with the Bar Rules,
They were carrying on business in accordance with the rules with the fond
hope of making good the investment and also earn a profit during the period
to come.
</p>
<p id="p_9">It appears that the Government received various complaints. The drinking in
the Bars led to law and order problem. Therefore, by impugned G.O. Ms. No.
44, Prohibition and Excise dated 3.3,1993, the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail
Vending in Bar) Rules 1992 were rescinded with effect from 1.6.1993. The
said G.O. was challenged before the High Court of Madras in W.P.'No.
7776/93. The writ petition was dismissed on the ground that the Court could
not interfere with the policy decisions taken by the State, Aggrieved by
the same, Writ Appeal No. 658/93 was preferred. By the impugned judgment
dated 13.6.1993, the writ appeal was dismissed holding that the policy of
the Government is one step marching towards the total prohibition. The
appellants could not base their case on legitimate expectation, nor was
their any violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Thus. the present
civil appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_10">Ramanathapuram District Liquor Retail Sellers' Association has preferred
Writ Petition (Civil) No. 648 of 1993 under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article 32</a> of the Constitution
of India, challenging G.O. Ms. No. 44 dated 3.3.1993.
</p>
<p id="p_11">Mr. K. Parasaran, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants in
Civil Appeal No. 4981 of 1994 arising out of SLP(C) No. 9854 of 1993
submits that change of policy must pass muster of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution of India. When the State Government has permitted the sale of
liquor, the change of policy can be tested on the touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article 14</a>
of the Constitution of India. In 5.<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_7">C. Advocates-on-Record Association v.
Union of India</a>, [1993] 4 SCC 441 at page 703, this Court has taken the view
that due consideration of every legitimate expectation in the decision-
making process is a requirement of the rule of non-arbitrariness. Again, in
<a href="/doc/1261492/" id="a_8">Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P</a>, [1990] Supp. 1 SCR 625 at 650
this Court has taken the view, a change in policy should not be done
arbitrarily.
</p>
<p id="p_12">In support of this submission, reliance is placed on Halsbury's Law of
England Vol. 1(1) Fourth Edition, Para 81 at page 151.
</p>
<p id="p_13">In this background of law, the facts require to be anaylised.
</p>
<p id="p_14">By G.O. Ms. No 90, Prohibition and excise dated 21.4.92 retail selling of
liquor was permitted. Such licence holders were entitled to renewal as well
On their representations the bars came to be permitted. Thereafter G.O.Ms.
No, 99 dated 26.5.92 came to be passed enabling these licence holders to
open Bars, It is noteworthy that under both the sets of Rules a provision
is made for renewal. It was in the hope that Bar licence will be renewed
for the subsequent years as well, each licensee spent huge amounts in
opening the Bars. In such a case, the plea of legitimate expectation
certainly will came to the rescue of the appellants. No doubt, the State
can change its policy but it cannot be done arbitrarily as held in the
above cases. Raising a hope in the retail vendors that they would be
allowed to carry on vending in .Bars, renewal being a matter of course,
suddenly to deny that privilege is arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_15">A privilege once accrued cannot be taken away. This is a clear implication
of Section 8(3) of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act, More so, in a case
like this where the Rules are prospective in nature such a legitimate
expectation cannot be denied. Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu General clauses
Act does not, in any way, militate against the operation of <a href="/doc/1828480/" id="a_9">Section 8</a>. If
retail vending of liquor is permitted there cannot be anything wrong in
selling the same liquor in the Bar.
</p>
<p id="p_16">Lastly, the learned counsel cites <a href="/doc/734502/" id="a_10">R. Vijaykumar v. The Commissioner of
Excise, JT</a> (1993) 6 S.C.325 and submits that even in policy matters <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article
14</a> of the Constitution will apply.
</p>
<p id="p_17">Mr. R.K. Garg, learned counsel, appearing for the appellants in C.A. No.
4982 of 1994 arising out of SLP(C) No. 9957 of 1993 submits as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_18"><a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_12">The Prohibition Act</a> provides for complete prohibition. However, the
Government has reserved to itself the power to grant exemption in order to
augment financial resources. The Government of Tamil Nadu in the year
1992-93 decided as a policy to provide for Bar licence attached to the
retail shops in order to augment revenue on auctions of retail shops. This
change hi policy was notified before the auction for the year 1992-93
stating only retail vendors will be eligible for Bar licences. Out of the
successful retail shop vendors 300 and odd applied and secured Bar licence
in accordance with the definite condition of auction held in 1992-93 that
licence for Bar attached to the shop will be granted after application was
received and the prescribed fee was paid. The State of Tamil Nadu has, by
this integrated new policy, escalated the bid amounts, in addition earned
Bar Licence fees. Thus, it is submitted that the Rules relating to retail
vending of IMFL and the Rules for sale of liquor in Bars attached to the
shop formed a single integrated scheme. Such a trade was to go on for a
period of 3 years with automatic yearly renewal on terms specified without
fresh auction. The Government cannot destroy the integrated character of
trade. This arbitrary action has resulted in unjust enrichment on the part
of the Govern-ment and breach of faith bordering on fraud. No demonstrable
basis was disclosed for such an action.
</p>
<p id="p_19">The Government illegally and arbitrarily delinked the retail sale from sale
in the Bars. Such an integrated policy could not be so changed as to impose
unjust back-breaking burdens OB the retail vendors. This amounts to
destruction of fairplay. It is also is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_20">The impugned Notification dated 3rd of March, 1993 has to be tested On the
following grounds :
</p>
<p id="p_21">1.  Whether the Bar Rules could be rescinded arbitrarily?
</p>
<p id="p_22">2.  Whether both the sets of Rules form integrated policy?
</p>
<p id="p_23">3.  The State having made the retail vending licences part with huge amount
in the hope they could have Bars if not bound to honour its commitment.
</p>
<p id="p_24">A change in policy affects not merely legitimate expectations but also
credibility of State to act fairly and reasonably.
</p>
<p id="p_25">The impugned Notification is also arbitrary because no examination was
under taken warranting change of policy. No committee was appointed. No
report was received before the impugned Notification was issued the State
has proceeded on unfounded apprehensions relating to law and order.
</p>
<p id="p_26">It is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> of the Constitution because -
</p>
<p id="p_27">(i) It is destructive of the principles of natural justice ;
</p>
<p id="p_28">(ii) it is not based on relevant considerations and fair determination of
changed circumstances justifying prejudice and injury to the lawful
interest of the retail vendors;
</p>
<p id="p_29">(iii) No damage to public policy is established requiring all Bars had to
be closed.
</p>
<p id="p_30">In support of the above submissions Mr. R.K. Garg, learned counsel, cites
<a href="/doc/320843/" id="a_15">State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal</a>, [1986] 4 SCC 566. On the strength of this
ruling it is submitted that an integrated policy cannot be broken.
</p>
<p id="p_31">On the question of legitimate expectation reliance is placed on Council of
Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service, (1984) 3 All ER
935,

Mr, G.L ;Sanghi, learned counsel, appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu
traces the history relating to prohibition in Tamil Nadu. On 16th of July,
1991, the present Government, as a first step towards implementation of
total prohibition policy in the State, brought complete prohibition in
relation to manufacturing and trading of country liquor. This was done
because the State took note of the serious social evil uprooting the family
life of very many poor people in the State. Thereafter G.O.Ms. 90 dated
21.4,92 was passed enabling auction of liquor retail vending shops. At that
point of time retail vending shops were not allowed to have Bar attached to
the licence shops. They were to sell the liquor only in bottles. In the
earlier year the total number of retail vending shops was 3, 049 whereas in
the year 1992-93 the number of shops increased to 4, 216. There was also an
increase in the revenue from 32 crores to 98 crores. This increase was due
to the commercial expectation of the bidders and the heavy competition
among them.
</p>
<p id="p_32"> The Government also thought it fit that such shop owners who have licence
might be allowed to have Bars attached to the shops. It was in this view
the Bar licence was granted to those persons who held the licence for shops
under Tamil Nadu (Liquor Retail Vending) Rules, 1989. The Government
received various representations that such running of Bars attached to
retail vending shops had become nuisance to the public par-ticularly to the
woman folk. Therefore, the Governor of Tamil Nadu in his speech made in the
Legislative Assembly on 4.2.93 announced the policy decision of the
Government to abolish Bars. It was under these circumstances, G.O.Ms. No.
44 dated 3.3.93 came to be passed discontinuing both the grant and renewal
of Bar licences. This G.O. was unsuccessfully challenged before the High
Court. It is submitted that only under the authority of rules the vendor
was empowered to sell liquor. There are two different sets of Rules one of
the year 1988 dealing with the retail vending of IMFS; 1992 Rules dealing
with Bar licences. There is no question of these two different sets of
Rules becoming an integrated scheme. That being so, the principle of
Nandlal's case (supra) cannot apply. In the case of a statutory rule, no
question of arbitrariness would arise. It is always open to State to change
its policy. If the contention of the appellants is accepted it would amount
to fettering the State from repealing a law. This Court in Ghaziabad
Development Authority v, Delhi Auto &amp; General Financial Pvt. Ltd., JT
(1994) 3 S.C. 275 has clearly pointed out the inapplicability of the
doctrine of legitimate expectation. The same is the position here.
</p>
<p id="p_33">As regards the principle that the Government cannot claim any immunity from
the doctrine of promisory estoppel and there is no obligation to act fairly
and justly, reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/517737/" id="a_16">Vasantkumar Radhakishan Vohra v. Board of
Trustees</a> of the port of Bombay, [1991J 1 SCC 761.
</p>
<p id="p_34">The next submission of the learned counsel is, legislative action whether
plenary or subordinate is not subject to natural justice. It has been so
laid down in <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_17">Union of India v. Cyhnamide India Ltd</a>., AIR (1987) SC 1802. To
the same effect in <a href="/doc/223504/" id="a_18">Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of
India</a>, [1985] 2 SCR 287 at page 347. The principle that subordinate
legislation cannot be questioned on the ground of violation of the
principle of natural justice, has been reiterated. In the case of liquor
vending licences one can expect to have renewal on payment of 15 per cent
or 10 per cent, as the case may be. But in a Bar licence there is no
possibility of renewal of the privilege because Rule 6(l){c) States ; "A
privilege .amount as may be fixed by the Government in this behalf." If,
therefore, it is a privilege no question of right to renewal arises.
Lastly, it is submitted that no representation was made. Therefore, the
question of promisory estoppel cannot arise.
</p>
<p id="p_35">Mr. V.R. Reddy, learned Additional Solicitor General, submits that there is
no scope in this case for contending that the principle of legitimate
expectation would arise. <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_19">Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corpora</a>-
tion. [1993] 3 SCC 499 is an authority for the proposition that this
principle applies only to administrative decisions. When the State
completely prohibited the manufacture and sale of country liquor it brought
a windfall to those selling IMFS. This accounts for the increase in the
excise revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Supporting the argument of Mr. G.L. Sanghi that the principle of natural
justice is not applicable to legislative acts <a href="/doc/1417820/" id="a_20">H.S.S.K. Niyami v. Union of
India</a>, AIR (1990) SC 2128 is cited.
</p>
<p id="p_37">With regard to the applicability of Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu General
Clauses Act it is submitted that the repeal shall not affect the previous
operation of the repealed law, has no application to the present case. The
citation in this behalf is <a href="/doc/752151/" id="a_21">Indira Sohanlal v. Custodian of Evacuee
Property, Delhi</a>, [1955] 2 SCR 1117.
</p>
<p id="p_38">Before we go into the questions of law arising in this case, we will
briefly trace the legislative history leading to the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_39">Thanks to the courage and wisdom of Mr. C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji),
prohibition came to be introduced in his own native District of Salem in
the year 1937 by enacting Madras (later Tamil Nadu) Prohibition Act of
1937. By stages it was extended throughout the State in 1948. So much so
the Gandhian ideal of the abolition of evil of drinking was realised. To
recall the father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi:
</p>
<p id="p_40">"Nothing but ruin stares a nation in the face that is prey to the drink
habit."

The operation of the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_36">Prohibition Act</a> was temporarily suspended in .August
1971. However, prohibition was re-introduced in August 1972 by abolition of
toddy shops and in September 1974 by abolition of arrack shops. Even while
the prohibition was enforced the sale of IMFS continued in licenced shops
to permit holders.
</p>
<p id="p_75">In May 1981, once again sale of toddy and arrack was permitted. The
manufacture of IMFS was also permitted. Concerning the sale of IMFS the
Tamil Nadu Liquor (Licence and Permit) Rules, 1981 were framed. In the year
1989 the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules, 1989 (For short, Retail
Vending Rules) were framed by which the 1981 Rules were repealed in so far
as they related to the retail vending of IMFS and Beer. Rule 3 of these
Rules states the privilege or selling liquor in licence shops would be
available to persons by auction. The privilege amount was determined in
that auction. The State was enabled under Rule 4(1) to fix the maximum
number of shops to be established in the State.
</p>
<p id="p_76">Prior to the auction, notice of auction in Form No.l has to be published in
Tamil and English dailies. As per Rule any person intending to participate
in the auction has to deposit an earnest money of Rs. 10,00 in an area
falling within the limits of the Municipal Corporation or Municipality; a
sum of Rs. 7,500 in other areas. Rule 8 requires offer by tender in sealed
cover as prescribed in form IV. After the confirmation of sale of privilege
the auction purchaser has to make an application in form VI for the grant
of licence. The Licensing Authority after verifying various factors, as may
be necessary for satisfying itself, as to the suitability of the auction
purchaser, grants a licence within three days of the order of confirmation
of sale. The licence so granted shall remain valid for a period of one year
ending with 31st May of succeeding year.
</p>
<p id="p_77">From the above procedure the following is clear :
</p>
<p id="p_78">1.  Even if one happens to be the successful bidder in the auction, it does
not automatically entitle him to a licence.
</p>
<p id="p_79">2.  The licencee once granted is valid for only one year ending with 31st
of May of succeeding year. In this regard Rule 14 of the Retail Vending
Rules is relevant which is extracted below :
</p>
<p id="p_80">"Renewal of licence -
</p>
<p id="p_81">(1) If a licence intends to renew the licence for the second year he shall
apply at least 30 days before the date of expiry of the licence for renewal
in Form VIII after remitting -
</p>
<p id="p_82">(i)  an application fee of Rs. 100 (Rupees One hundred only):
</p>
<p id="p_83">(ii) the licence fee of Rs. 2,500 (Rupees two thousand and five hundred
only); and

</p><p id="p_84">(iii) the privilege amount determined at fifteen percent centum more than
the privilege amount at which the sale of the privilege was confirmed in
the previous year.
</p>
<p id="p_85">(2) If a licensee intends to renew the licence for the third year, he shall
apply at least 30 days before the date of expiry of the licence for renewal
in Form VII after remitting -
</p>
<p id="p_86">(i) an application fee of Rs. 100 (Rupees one hundred only);
</p>
<p id="p_87">(ii) the licence fee of Rs. 2,500 (Rupees two thousand and five hundred
only) and

</p><p id="p_88"> (iii) the privilege amount determined at ten percent centum more then the
 privilege amount at which the sale of the privilege was confirmed in the
 previous year.
</p>
<p id="p_89">Proviso omitted,

(3) If the licensing authority decides not to renew the licence, he may
refuse renewal by an order recording the reasons for refusal: (Emphasis
supplied)

Provided that the licensing authority shall give a reasonable opportunity
of being heard to the licensee before such refusal.
</p>
<p id="p_90">(4)  If a licence is not renewed, the licence fee remitted by the licensee
shall be refunded to him,"
</p>
<p id="p_91">What is important to be noted here is, under Rule 14(3) of the said Rules
the Licensing Authority is empowered either to renew or not to renew the
licence. Therefore, there is no automatic renewal. These Rules were
approved on 15.4.89 by G.O. Ms. 506, Home, Prohibition and Excise dated
15th April, 1989.
</p>
<p id="p_92">The present Government assumed office in June 1991. On 16th July, 1991
complete prohibition of manufacture and trade in country liquor was
imposed. Undoubtedly, this was a step in furtherance of <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_37">Article 47</a> of the
Constitution of India. On 21. 4.92, by G.O. Ms. 90 the Government ordered
the auction of retail vending shops throughout the State. The sale of
liquor was to be in bottles. At this stage, no Bar was allowed to be
attached to the licence shop of retail vending. For the excise year 1992-93
the number of shops increased and the excise revenue also correspondingly
increased. As rightly urged by learned Additional Solicitor General this
increase was due to the total prohibition of country liquor, namely, toddy
and arrack. The retailers made a representation that they could be allowed
to have Bar attached to the shops. It was in these circumstances, G.O. Ms.
No.99, Prohibition and Excise Department dated 26th May, 1992 came to be
passed. It must be made clear at this stage that these Rules called Tamil
Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending in Bar) Rules, 1992 deal only with the Bar
regulating the issue of licence and the privilege of retail vending of
liquor in the Bar, The Rules came into force on 1st June, 1992. Under rule
4(a) it is only a person holding a licence granted under Rules 13 of Retail
Vending Rules, 1989 who can make an application for the grant of privilege
and issue of licence for retail vending of liquor in the Bar.
</p>
<p id="p_93">The privilege amount varied from place to place from Rs. 18, 750 to Rs.
75,000.
</p>
<p id="p_94">The period of licence was co-terminus with the period of licence issued for
vending liquor. Rule 6 dealing with renewal of licence is important.
Clauses 1, 2 and 4 of Rule 6 are quoted hereunder :
</p>
<p id="p_95">"6. Renewal of licence :
</p>
<p id="p_96">1.  If the licensee intends to renew the licence for the second term he
shall apply not later than thirty days before the date of expiry of the
licence issued under rule 4 inform III together with the following amount :
</p>
<p id="p_97">a.  an application for Rs, 100 (Rupees One hundred only);
</p>
<p id="p_98">b.  a licence fee of Rs. 500 (Rupees Five hundred only)

c. A privilege amount as may be fixed by the State Government in the
behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_99">2. If the licensee intends to renew the licence for the third term, he
shall apply not later than thirty days before the date of expiry of the
licence renewed, in Form III......
</p>
<p id="p_100">3.  The licensing authority may refuse the renewal of a licence by an order
in writing for reasons to be recorded therein;
</p>
<p id="p_101">Provided that the licensing authority shall give a reasonable opportunity
of being heard to the licensee before such refusal."
</p>
<p id="p_102">It has to be carefully noticed that under Rule 6(1)(c) the privilege amount
may be fixed by the State Government in that behalf. Further there is power
to refuse renewal; of course, for valid reasons subject to right of appeal
and revision under Rules 16 and 17. On 4th February, 1993 the Governor of
Tamil Nadu made the following address:
</p>
<p id="p_103">"Prohibition as a key issue of State Policy is a Constitutional directive.
Honourable Members of the House are aware that the Government, under the
leadership of the Chief Minister Dr, J. Jayalalitha, implemented as its
first decision the abolition of cheap liquor shops throughout the State, in
keeping with its announced policy of prohibition, although this involved an
annual loss of revenue of Rs. 390 crorcs. The drive against bootlegging and
illicit liquor was intensified with the formation of the Prohibition Enfor-
cement Wing. The Chief Minister's drive against erring officials resulted
in a noticeable reduction in the incidence of illicit liquor. A massive
multi-media propaganda offensive against the evils of liquor has also been
launched. We have decided to give a decisive edge to the offensive against
illicit liquor by strengthening further the Prohibition Enforcement Wing at
a cost of Rs, 7 crores. With one enforcement unit in each Police sub
division, the Enforcement Wing will act effectively against the anti-social
elements engaged in the illicit liquor trade. This Government places the
highest emphasis on the welfare of the people, revenue considerations
yielding place to consideration of maximum social good. Members of the
House will wholeheartedly welcome the decision of the Government to
withdraw the licences for bars attached to foreign spirit shops with effect
from the excise year commencing from June, 1993."
</p>
<p id="p_104">Pursuant to this, the impugned G.O.Ms, 44, Prohibition and Excise
Department came to be passed on 3rd March, 1993. That reads as under:</p><pre id="pre_2">

<p id="p_106">2. The following Notification will be published in the Tamil Nadu

</p>
<p id="p_108">(By Order of the Governor)

K. Malaisamy, Secretary to Govt."
</p>
<p id="p_109">the effect of the above C.O. is, on and from 1st June, 1993 the Tamil Nadu
Liquor (Retail Vending in Bar) Rules, 1992 came to be rescinded. Both the
learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court under the
impugned judgment have upheld the validity of G,O. Ms. No. 44 dated 3rd
March, 1993. In the light of the above discussion the correctness of the
following contentions may be examined :
</p>
<p id="p_110">1.  Whether the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending) Rules, 1989 (For short
Retail Vending Rules) and Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending in Bar Rules,
1992 (for short Bar Rules ) form an integral scheme?
</p>
<p id="p_111">2,  Whether the appellants can claim the benefit of the doctrine of
legitimate expection?
</p>
<p id="p_112">3, Whether under the impugned G.O. by rescinding of the Bar Rules-
</p>
<p id="p_113">(a) The State has not acted fairly;
</p>
<p id="p_114">(b) violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a>, the action being arbitrary?
</p>
<p id="p_115">4. Whether the appellants could claim the benefit of Section 8 of the Tamil
Nadu General Clauses Act?
</p>
<p id="p_116">Point No. 1:
</p>
<p id="p_117">In view of what is stated above, it is clear that privilege of retail
vending could only be under licence. Such a licence is obtained after a
successful bid. The mere success in the bid does not ensure the privilege.
Still, as seen above, even after the confirmation of sale the auction pur-
chaser will have to apply in form No. VI to the Licensing Authority for the
grant of licence along with the requisite fee. It is only after the
Licensing Authority is satisfied as to the suitability of the auction
procedure for the grant of licence, such a licence is granted. The period
of licence is one year. No doubt, Rule 14 provides for renewal on payment
of 15 per cent Chan the privilege amount for the first renewal and 10 per
cent more for the second renewal. Here again, there is an automatic renewal
because of the power contained under Rule 14(3) enabling the Licensing
Authority to refuse. Thus, the Liquor Vending Rules completely take care of
vending providing for each detail.
</p>
<p id="p_118">The Bar Rules under Rule 4(a) lay down a qualification that only a person
holding a vending licence could seek a Bar licence. These Rules also talk
of renewal of licence under Rule 6. As seen above, such a renewal is not
automatic for two reasons :
</p>
<p id="p_119">(1)  The privilege amount is to be fixed by the State; and

(2)  under Rule 6(4) there is a power of refusal.
</p>
<p id="p_120">These are two sets separate Rules. One which deals with retail vending of
IMFS the other with the Bar. It is incorrect to contend that both these
Rules form an integrated scheme. Merely because for obtaining the Bar
licence, one must be a holder of retail vending licence, they cannot become
integrated scheme. Each set of Rules take care of different situations.
Therefore, we reject the argument of Mr. R.K. Garg that they form
integrated scheme. Nandlal's case (supra) has no application since that was
a case of an integrated scheme which is not so here.
</p>
<p id="p_121">Point No.2 :
</p>
<p id="p_122">We will briefly deal with the doctrine of legitimate expectation. It is not
necessary to refer to large number of cases excepting the following few:
</p>
<p id="p_123">On this doctrine Clive Lewis in 'Judicial Remedies in Public Law at page 97
states thus :
</p>
<p id="p_124">"Decisions affecting legitimate expectation -
</p>
<p id="p_125">In the public law field, individuals may not have strictly enforceable
rights but they may have legitimate expectations. Such expectations may
stem either from a promise or a representation made by a public body, or
from a proviso practice of a public body, The promise of a hearing before a
decision is taken may give rise to a legitimate expectation that a hearing
will be given. A past practice of consulting before a decision is taken may
give rise to an expectation of consultation before any future decision is
taken. A promise to confer, or past practice of conferring a substantive
benefit, may give rise to an expectation that the individual will be given
a hearing before a decision is taken not to confer the benefit. The actual
enjoyment of a benefit may create a legitimate expectation that the benefit
will not be removed without the individual being given a hearing. On
occasions, individuals seek to enforce the promise of expectation itself,
by claiming that the substantive benefit be conferred. Decisions affecting
such legitimate expectations are subject to judicial review."
</p>
<p id="p_126">In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service,
[1984] 3 All ER 935 at pages 943-44 it is stated thus :
</p>
<p id="p_127">"But even where a person claiming some benefit or privilege has no legal
right to it, as a matter of private law, he may have a legitimate
expectation of receiving the benefit or privilege, and, if so, the courts
will protect his expectation by judicial review as a matter of public law.
This subject has been fully explained by Lord Diplock in O'Reilly v.
Mackman, [1982] 3 All ER 1124 = (1983) 2 AC 237 and I need not repeat what
he has so recently said. Legitimate, or reasonable, expectation may arise
either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or
from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably
expect to continue. Examples of the former type of expectation are Re
Liverpool Taxi Owners' Association [1972] 2 All ER 589, (1972) 2 QB 299 and
A-G of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu, [1983] 2 All ER 346 = (1983) 2 AC 629. (I
agree with Lord Diplock's view, ex-pressed in the speech in this appeal,
that 'legitimate' is to be preferred to 'reasonable' in this context, I was
responsible for using the word 'reasonable' for the reason explained in Ng
Yuen Shiu, but it was intended only to be exegetical of 'legitimate.') An
example of the latter in R v. Hull Prison Board of Visitors, ex p. St.
Germain, [1979] 1 All ER 701, [1979] QB 425, approved by this House in
O'Reilly v. Mackman, [1982| 3 All ER 1124 at 1126 = [1983] 2 AC 237 at

</p>
<p id="p_129">In Halsbury's Laws of England Vol. 1(1) Fourth Edition Para 81 at pages

<p id="p_143">a State of H.P. v, Kailash Chand Mahajan, [1992] Supp. 2 SCC 351 at pages
386-87 in a judgment to which one of us was a party it was stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_144">"It might be urged by the tenure of appointment there is a right to
continue; the legitimate expectation has come to be interfered with. In a
matter of this kind, as to whether legitimate expectation could be pleaded
is a moot point. However, we will now refer to Wade's Administrative Law
(6th edn.) wherein it is stated at pages 520-21, as under:
</p>
<p id="p_145">"Legitimate expectation : positive effect. - The classic situation in which
the principles of natural justice apply is where some legal right, liberty
or interest is affected, for instance where a building is demolished or an
office-holder is dismissed or a trader's licence is revoked. But good
administration demands their observance in other situations also , where
the citizen may legitimately expect to be treated fairly. As Lord Bridge
has explained :
</p>
<p id="p_146">Re Westminister CC, (1986) AC 668 at 692, Lord Diplock made a formal
statement in the Council of Civil Service Unions case (below) at 408,
saying that the decision must affect some other person either -
</p>
<p id="p_147">(a) by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable
by or against him in private law; or (b) by depriving him of some benefit
or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the
decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be
permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated to him more
rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an
opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the
decision-maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an
opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be
withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_148">This analysis is 'classical but certainly not exhaustive' : <a href="/doc/514007/" id="a_53">R v. Secretary
of State</a> for the Environment ex. p. Nottinghamshire CC, [1986] AC 240 at

</p>
<p id="p_149">The Courts have developed a relatively novel doctrine in public law that a
duty of consultation may arise from a legitimate expectation of
consultation aroused either by a promise or by an established practice of
consultation".
</p>
<p id="p_150">In a recent case, in dealing with legitimate expectation in R v. Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex pane Jaderow Ltd., [1991] 1 All ER
41, it has been observed at page 68:
</p>
<p id="p_151">"Question II: Legitimate expectation: It should be pointed out in this
regard that, under the powers reserved to the member states by <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_54">Article 5(2)</a>
of Regulation 170 of 1983, fishing activities could be made subject to the
grant of licences which , by their nature, are subject to temporal limits
and to various conditions. Further-more, the introduction of the quota
system was only one event amongst others in the evolution of the fishing
industry, which is characterised by instability and continuous changes in
the situation due to a series of events such as the extensions, in 1976, of
fishing areas to 200 miles from certain coasts of the Community, the
necessity to adopt measures for the conservation of fishery resources,
which was dealt with at the international level by the intro-duction of
total allowable catches, the arguments about the distribution amongst the
member states of the total allowable catches available to the Community,
which were finally distributed on the basis of a reference period which ran
from 1973 to 1978 but which is reconsidered every year.
</p>
<p id="p_152">In those circumstances, operators in the fishing industry were not
justified in taking the view that the Community rules precluded the making
of any changes to the conditions laid down by national legislation or
practice for the grant of licences to fish against national quotas as the
adoption of new conditions compatible with Community law.
</p>
<p id="p_153">Consequently, the answer to this question must be that com-munity law as it
now does not preclude legislation or a practice of a member state whereby a
new condition not previously stipulated is laid down for the grant of
licences to fish against national quotas."
</p>
<p id="p_154">Thus, it will be clear even legitimate expectation cannot preclude
legislation,''

<a href="/doc/125080125/" id="a_55">In Food Corporation of India v. M/S.  Kamdhenu Cattle Feed In-dustries, JT</a>
(1992) 6, 259 at 264 this Court observed thus :
</p>
<p id="p_155">"The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a
situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure
to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary,
and this is how the requirement of due con-sideration of a legitimate
expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary
concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant
factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision making process.
Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the
context is a question of fact in each case. Whenever the question arises,
it is to be determined not according to the claimant's perception but in
larger public interest wherein other more important considerations may
outweight what would otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the
claimant. A bona fide decision of the public authority reached in this
matter would satisfy the re-quirement of non-arbitrariness and withstand
judicial scrutiny. The doctrine of legitimate expectation gets assimilated
in the rule of law and operates in our legal system in this manner and to
this extent"
</p>
<p id="p_156"><a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_56">In Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation, JT</a> (1993) 3 S.C. 15
at pages 50-51 this Court observed thus ;
</p>
<p id="p_157">"It has to be noticed that the concept of legitimate expectation in
administrative law has sow, undoubtedly, gained sufficient importance. It
is stated that "Legitimate expectation" is the latest recruit to a long
list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative
action and this creation takes its place beside such principles as the
rules of natural justice, unreasonableness, the fiduciary duty of local
authorities and "in future", perhaps, the principle of proportionality." A
passage in Administrative Law, Sixty Edition by H.W.R. Wade page 424 reads
thus :
</p>
<p id="p_158">"These are revealing decisions. They show that the courts now expect
government departments to honour their published state-ments or else to
treat the citizen with the fullest personal con-sideration. Unfairness in
the form of unreasonableness here comes close to unfairness in the form of
violation of natural justice, and the doctrine of legitimate expectation
can operate in both contexts. It is obvious, furthermore, that this
principle of substantive, as opposed to procedural, fairness may undermine
some of the established rules about estoppel and misleading advice, which
tend to operate unfairly. Lord Scarman has stated emphatically that
unfairness in the purported exercise of a power can amount to an abuse or
excess of power, and this seems likely to develop into an important general
doctrine."
</p>
<p id="p_159">Another passage at page 522 in the above book reads thus:
</p>
<p id="p_160">"It was in fact for the purpose of restricting the right to be heard that
'legitimate expectation' was introduced into the law. It made its first
appearance in a case where alien students of 'scientology' were refused
extension of their entry permits as an act of policy by the Home Secretary,
who had announced that no discretionary benefits would be granted to this
sect. The Court of Appeal held that they had no legitimate expectation of
extension beyond the permitted time, and so no right to a hearing, though
revocation of their permits within that time would have been contrary to
legitimate expectation. Official statements of policy, therefore, may
cancel legitimate expectation, just as they may create it, as seen above.
In a different context where car-hire drivers had habitually offended
against airport byelaws, with many convictions and unpaid fines, it was
held that they had no legitimate expectation of being heard before being
banned by the airport authority.
</p>
<p id="p_161">There is some ambiguity in the dicta about legitimate expectation, which
may mean either expectation of a fair hearing or expectation of the licence
or other benefit which is being sought. But the result is the same in
either case; absence of legitimate expectation will absolve the public
authority from affording a hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_162">(emphasis supplied)"
</p>
<p id="p_163">Again, at pages 56-57 it is observed thus :
</p>
<p id="p_164">"...........A case of legitimate expectation would arise when a body by
representation or by past practice aroused expectation which it would be
within its powers to fulfill. The protection is limited to that extent and
a judicial review can be within those limits. But as discussed above a
person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectations, in
the first instance, must satisfy that there is a foundation and thus has
locus standi to make such a claim. In considering the same several factors
which give rise to such legitimate expectation must be present The decision
taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary, unreasonable and not
taken in public interest. If it is a question of policy, even by way of
change of old policy, the courts cannot interfere with a decision. In a
given case whether there are such facts and cir-cumstances giving rise to a
legitimate expectation, it would primarily be a question of fact. If these
tests are satisfied and if the court is satisfied that a case of legitimate
expectation is made but then the next question would be whether failure to
give an opportunity of hearing before the decision affecting such
legitimate expectation is taken, has resulted in failure of justice and
whether on that ground the decision should be quashed. If that be so then
what should be the relief is again a matter which depends on several
factors. " (Emphasis supplied)

Again at pages 57-58 it is observed thus :
</p>
<p id="p_165">"Legitimate expectations may come in various forms and owe their existence
to different land of circumstances and it is not possible to give an
exhaustive list in the context of vast and fast expansion of the
governmental activities. They shift and change so fast that the start of
our list would be absolute before we reached the middle. By and large they
arise in cases of promotions which are in normal course expected, though no
guaranteed by way of a statutory right, in cases of contracts, distribution
of largess by the Government and in somewhat similar situations. For
instance in cases of discretionary grant of licences, permits of the like,
carries with it a reasonable expectation, though not a legal right to
renewal or non- revocation, but to summarily disappoint that expectation
may be seen as unfair without the expectant person being heard, But there
again the court has to see whether it was done as a policy or in the public
interest either by way of G.O., rule or by way of a legislation. If that be
so, a decision denying a legitimate expectation based on such grounds docs
not qualify for interference unless in a given case, the decision or action
taken amounts to an abuse of power. Therefore the limitation is extremely
confined and if the according of natural justice does not condition the
exercise of the power, the concept of legitimate expectation can have no
role to play and the court must not usurp the discretion of the public
authority which is empowered to take the decisions under law and the court
is expected to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding
authority the full range of choice watch the legislature is presumed to
have intended. Even in a case where the decision is left entirely to the
discretion of the deciding authority without any such legal bounds and if
the decision is taken fairly and objectively, the court will not interfere
on the ground of procedural fairness to a person whose interest based on
legitimate expectation might be affected. For instance if an authority who
has full discretion to grant a licence and if he prefers an existing
licence holder to a new applicant, the decision cannot be interfered with
on the ground of legitimate expectation entertained by the new applicant
applying the principles of natural justice, It can therefore be seen that
legitimate expectation can at the most be one of the grounds which may give
rise to judicial review but the granting of relief is very much limited. It
would thus appear that there are stronger reasons as to why the legitimate
expectation should not be substantively protected than the reasons as to
why it should be protected. In other words such a legal obligation exists
whenever the case supporting the same in terms of legal principles of dif-
ferent sorts, is stronger than the case against it. As observed in Attorney
General for New South Wales' case "To strike down the exercise of
administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment of
the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the courts
adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism. Moreover, the notion of a
legitimate expectation (falling short of a legal right) is too nebulous to
form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise
otherwise accords with law." If a denial of legitimate expectation in a
given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary,
discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power of violation of
principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well-known
grounds attracting <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_57">Article 14</a> but a claim based on mere legitimate
expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke
these principles." (Emphasis supplied)

For the above it is clear that legitimate expectation may arise -
</p>
<p id="p_166">(a)  if there is an express promise given by a public authority; or

</p><p id="p_167">(b) because of the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can
reasonably expect to continue ;
</p>
<p id="p_168">(c)  Such an expectation must be reasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_169">However, if there is a change in policy or in public interest the position
is altered by a rule or legislation, no question of legitimate expectation
would arise.
</p>
<p id="p_170">The licence under the Bar Rules of 1992 is for a period of one year. That
could be renewed, as seen above only on a privilege amount, as may be fixed
by the State Government, in this behalf. This is unlike the case of the
retail vending licence wherein the renewal is contemplated on payment of 15
per cent more than the privilege amount at which the sale of the privilege
was confirmed in the previous year". This is as regards the second year.
Likewise, 10 per cent more than the privilege amount for the third year.
Therefore, the position is entirely different giving no room for any
expectation. At best, it could be a hope. On this aspect we can usefully
refer to Director of Public Works v. HO PO Sang, [1961] 2 All E.R. 721. at
page 730 it was observed thus :
</p>
<p id="p_171">"It was submitted on behalf of the lessee that, after the director had
given notice (see s.3A(2) of his intention to give a re-building
certificate, some kind of a right (even though one that might be defeated)
to such a certificate was then acquired by the lessee. Their Lordships
cannot accept this view. After the director gave notice of his intention to
issue a certificate, there could have been no giving of it until certain
conditions were satisfied. The lessee was under obligation to give notices
as required by s.3B(l). Had there been no appeals by tenants and sub-
tenants and had the time for appeals expired, the director would then have
been in a position to give a certificate. Had those been the circumstances
than inas-much as the director had indicated what his intention was, doubt-
less he would in fact have given his certificate. But the ordinance did not
impose an obligation on the director to give a certificate in accordance
with his declared intention unless and until certain conditions were
satisfied. Though, in the events that happened, this point does not call
for decision, it would not seem that, in any circumstances, any right to a
certificate could arise at least until, after notices given, the time for
appeals by tenants and sub-tenants went by without there being any appeal.
In a case, however, where (as in the present case) the giving of notices
under s.3B(l) resulted in appeals by way of petition to the governor,
followed by a cross-petition to the governor presented by the applicant,
then any decision as to the giving of a re-building certificate no longer
rested with the director. In the present case, the position on Apr. 9,1957,
was that the lessee did not and could not know whether he would or would
not be given a re-building certificate. Had there been no repeal, the
petitions and cross-petition would in due course have been taken into
consideration by the Governor in Council. There-after there would have been
an exercise of discretion. The governor would not have directed either that
a certificate be given or be not given, and the decision to the Governor in
Council would have been final. In these circumstances, their Lordships
conclude that it could not properly be said that, on Apr. 9, the lessee had
an accrued right to be given a re-building certificate. It follows that he
had no accrued rights to vacant possession of the premises. It was said
that there were accrued rights to a certificate, and, consequently, to
possession, subject only to the risk that these rights were not defeated.
In their Lordships' view, such an approach is not warranted by the facts.
On Apr. 9 the lessee had no right. He had no more than a hope that the
Governor in Council would give a favourable decision. So the first
submission fails." (Emphasis supplied)

It has already been seen that under Rule 4(a) of the Bar Rules the
eligibility of such a licence is possession of a retail vending licence.
The period of licence was for one year ending by 31st May, 1992. The speech
of the Governor which we have extracted above was made on 4th February,
1993. The impugned G.O, had come to be passed on 3rd March, 1993. The
important point to be noted here is long before the Bar licensee could
apply for renewal (Rule 6 talks of 30 days before the expiry of the
licence) the policy decision has been taken not to renew.
</p>
<p id="p_172">Having regard to what is stated above, it is clear that there was
absolutely no promise of renewal at all.
</p>
<p id="p_173">It was by a Rule (subordinate legislation) in exercise of the powers
conferred by Sections 17-C, 17-D, 21 and 54 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition
Act, 1937 licences under Bar Rules came to be granted. Those Rules have
been repealed by exercise of the same powers under <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_58">Sections 17-C</a>, <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_59">17-D</a>, <a href="/doc/628266/" id="a_60">21</a>
and <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_61">54</a> of the Prohibition Act. Therefore, this is a case of legislation.
The doctrine of legitimate expectation arises only in the field of
administrative decisions. If the plea of legitimate expectation relates to
procedural fairness there is no possibility whatever of invoking the
doctrine as against the legislation. However, Mr. K. Parasaran, learned
senior counsel relies on Supreme Court <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_62">Advocates-on-Record Association v.
Union of India</a>, [1993] 4 SCC 441. At page 703 what is stated is this :
</p>
<p id="p_174">"Due consideration of every legitimate expectation in the decision making
process is a requirement of the rule of non-arbitrariness' and, therefore,
this also is a norm to be observed by the Chief Justice of India in
recommending appointments to the Supreme Court. Obviously, this factor
applies only to those con-sidered suitable and at least equally meritorious
by the Chief Justice of India, for appointment to the Supreme Court."
</p>
<p id="p_175">This principle of non-arbitrariness cannot apply to a change of policy by
legislation. Concerning the applicability of non- arbitrariness and change
of policy learned counsel has cited <a href="/doc/734502/" id="a_63">R. Vijaykumar v. The Commissioner of
Excise, JT</a> (1993) 6 S.C. 325. That case dealt with discrimination between
licensees. Hence, the same is not applicable. As a matter of fact in the
affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu dated 8th July, 1993
it is inter alia stated thus :
</p>
<p id="p_176">"On complaints received from the public, some time in February, 1993 itself
the Government had decided not to renew the licences for bar attached to
the retail vending shops. This was also announced in the Governor's speech
and made public on 4.2.1993.
</p>
<p id="p_177">That on 3.3.1993 the Government by G.O.Ms. No.44 announced that as a matter
of policy the Government would not renew licences to the bar attached with
the vending shop with effect from 1.6.1993."
</p>
<p id="p_178">For all these reasons, we have no hesitation in coming to the con-clusion
that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot arise at all in this
case.
</p>
<p id="p_179">The effect of accepting the argument of the appellants would be, as rightly
urged by Mr. G.L. Sanghi, learned counsel appearing for the State of Tamil
Nadu the power of the State will be fettered not to repeal a particular
law, however, much public interest may require the repeal.
</p>
<p id="p_180">Question No.3 : Whether rescinding of the Bar Rules is arbitrary ?:
</p>
<p id="p_181">It is a settled principle that legislative action, plenary or subordinate,
is not subject to natural justice. <a href="/doc/223504/" id="a_64">In Indian Express News Papers (Bombay)
Pvt. Ltd, v. Union of India</a>, [19S5J 2 SCR 287 at pages 347-48 it is stated
thus:
</p>
<p id="p_182">"This subordinate legislation cannot be questioned on the ground of
violation of principles of natural justice on which ad-ministrative action
may be questioned has been held by this Court in <a href="/doc/451059/" id="a_65">The Tulsipur Sugar Co,
Ltd. v. The Notified Area Committee, Tulsipur</a>, [1980] 2 SCR 1111,
<a href="/doc/64976/" id="a_66">Rameshchandra Kachardas Porwal &amp; Ors. v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors</a> etc.,
[1981] 2 SCR 866 and in Bates v. Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone &amp; Ors.,
[1972] 1 WLR 1373. A distinction must be made between delegation of a
legislative function in the case of which the question of reasonableness
cannot be enquired into and the investment by statute to exercise
particular discretionary powers. In the latter case the question may be
considered on all grounds on which administrative action may be questioned,
such as, non- application of mind, taking irrelevant matters into
consideration, failure to take relevant matters into consideration, etc.
etc. On the facts and circumstances of a case , a subordinate legislation
may be struck down as arbitrary or contrary to statute if it fails to take
into account very vital facts which either expressly or by necessary
implication are required to be taken into consideration by the statute or,
say, the Constitution. This can only be done on the ground that it does not
conform to the statutory or constitutional requirements or that it offends
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_67">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_68">Article 19(l)(a)</a> of the Constitution, It cannot, no doubt, be
done merely no the ground that it is not reasonable or that it has not
taken into account relevant circumstances which the Court considers
relevant."
</p>
<p id="p_183">The same principle is reiterated in <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_69">Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a>.,
AIR (1987) SC 1802 which is referred to with approval in <a href="/doc/1417820/" id="a_70">H.S.S.K. Niyami v.
Union of India</a>, AIR (1990) SC 2128.
</p>
<p id="p_184">When the State has received complaints that the consumption of liquor in
bars resulted in law and order problems, womanfolk being harassed,
certainly, in public interest it could take a decision to repeal the grant
of Bar licences. There is nothing unreasonable. It is not necessary as Mr.
Garg contends that a committee ought to have been appointed and a report
obtained before such a repeal. It is a matter of policy which the
Government alone is competent to formulate. The State Government knows how
best to augment its revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_185">As we have seen above, if there is no promise or right of renewal and if
the policy decision has been taken under the impugned G.O. long before the
licensee could apply for renewal what is the unfairness that could be
complained of? In our considered view, none. From this point of view, we
find the ruling in <a href="/doc/517737/" id="a_71">Vasantkumar Radhakishan Vira v. Board of Trustees of the
Port of Bombay</a>, [1991] 1 SCC 761 is not applicable to the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_186">Question No. 4 : Benefit under <a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_72">Section 8</a> of the General Clauses Act?
</p>
<p id="p_187">We have already noted that <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_73">Section 54</a> of the Prohibition Act is a rule-
making section. The Rules and the Notification require to be publish-ed in
the official gazette. Upon such publication, they shall have effect as if
enacted in the parent act. The High Court on the question of applicability
of Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act has stated thus :
</p>
<p id="p_188">Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act makes Chapter II applicable
to all <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_74">Tamil Nadu Act</a>s after the commen-cement of the said Act unless a
contrary intention appears in such Acts, Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu
General Clauses Act is subject to <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_75">Section 4</a> of that Act and the new
enactment can expressly or by necessary implication exclude the operation
of <a href="/doc/902105/" id="a_76">Section 8</a>. Read-ing <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_77">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/902105/" id="a_78">8</a> together . there can be no doubt
that an enactment which repeals an earlier enactment can exclude any of the
provisions of Chapter II of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act. The
impugned G.O. has rescined the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending in Bar)
Rules 1992 with effect on and from 1st June, 1993. Hence the repealed rules
ceased to be in existence after 31.5.1993. The privilege and the licence
granted to the petitioner were admittedly for one year ending with
31.5.1993. Under the repealed rules they were obliged to apply for renewal
and the renewal was not automatic. The application for renewal had to be
considered under the rules by the concerned authority and appropriate
orders should be passed. Once the rules are repealed. with the expiry of
</p><p id="p_189">31. 5.92, there could be no question of considering any application for
renewal for a period subsequent to that date. What all section 8 of the
Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act preserves or protects are the rights
acquired under the repealed Act. In other words, the petitioners licence
for the period upto 31-5-1993 remained undisturbed or unaffected by the
impugned G.O, It is not as if the same right or privilege can operate
beyond 31. 5. 1993 as though by an order of renewal. If the right or
privileges cannot on its own force is subsist when the impugned G.O. comes
into force the provisions of Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses
Act cannot give a fresh lease of life to such right or privilege or alter
the period of its validity. Hence, the contention based on the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_79">General Clauses Act</a> has to fail."
</p>
<p id="p_190">We are in entire agreement with this line of reasoning.
</p>
<p id="p_191">In this connection, the reliance placed by the learned Additional Solicitor
General on <a href="/doc/752151/" id="a_80">Indira Sohanlal v. Custodian of Evacuee Property, Delhi</a>, [1955]
2 SCR 1117 is fully  justified. At page 1118 it is stated thus :
</p>
<p id="p_192">"(iv) that the scheme underlying s,58(3) is that every matter to which the
new Act applies has to be treated as arising, and to and to be dealt with,
under the new law except in so far as certain consequences have already
ensued or acts have been completed prior to the new act, to which it is the
old law that will apply."
</p>
