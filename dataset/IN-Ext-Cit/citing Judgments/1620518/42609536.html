</blockquote><p id="p_8">6.     Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel arguing for DGC raised
manifold grounds contesting the maintainability of the writ petitions,
inter alia (a) DGC is a private club constituted by its members for their
personal recreation and is neither a „State‟ nor instrumentality of a State
or „other authority‟ under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_15">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India (b) DGC
is neither funded (directly or indirectly) nor owned or controlled by the
Government (c) it is a private body constituted under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_16">Companies Act</a>
governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association; (d) it
discharges no public duty and performs no public function; (e) DGC is a
Company under <a href="/doc/272099/" id="a_17">Section 8</a> of the Companies Act, 2013 limited by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                         Page 12 of 83</span>
 Guarantee; (f) it is an autonomous and private body run by its own
Governing Board, namely, the General Committee comprising of a
President, Captain, three nominees of the Government of India,
immediate past Captain and twelve members elected as per <a href="/doc/1256023/" id="a_18">Article 43</a> of
the Articles of Association of DGC; (g) presence of 3 nominees in the
Board, appointed by the Government, does not alter the status of DGC as
a private body and Government has no financial or even administrative
control over its functioning; (h) it is run solely for the use of its members
or permitted persons, membership being restricted and facilities are not
open to public at large and (j) funds are generated purely through
membership fee, membership subscriptions and revenues earned from
Golf.
</p><p id="p_9">7.      Succinctly put the argument was that DGC is a private body, not
performing public functions and is not financially or functionally or
administratively controlled by the Government of India and merely
having senior officials of the Government, as nominee Directors,
appointed by Ministry of Urban Development, as part of the General
Committee (Board), does not make DGC a State or its instrumentality or
„other authority‟ to bring it in the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
Accentuating on the role of the three nominee Directors, it was submitted
that they are at par with other Directors in the Board in all respects and do
not enjoy any extra or special powers. It was contended that reading of
the petitions shows that Petitioners have been unable to make out a case
that DGC is in any manner funded or controlled by Government of India
or that its functions fall in the realm of public functions.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 13 of 83</span>
<p id="p_10"> 8.     It was next submitted that no doubt DGC has been granted land
measuring 179 acres by Government of India, through a registered lease
deed, however, this is only a lessor-lessee relationship, governed by terms
of the lease deed. Merely because the lease deed is executed by the
Government as a lessor is not enough to bring DGC within the definition
of State or public authority. Under the lease, the possession and user of
the land subsists exclusively with DGC, to the exclusion of all others and
statutory dues and taxes are paid in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_11">9.     In support of his arguments, Mr. Sethi relied on the judgment in
<a href="/doc/1270943/" id="a_20">Air Vice Marshall J.S. Kumar vs. Governing Council of Air Force Sports
Complex and Anr</a>., 2006 (86) DRJ 711 (DB), wherein the Division
Bench of this Court held that a writ petition cannot lie against a private
body not performing any public function and since Air Force Sports
Complex was only providing recreation to serving and retired Air Force
personnel and not performing a public function, it was not a State under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_21">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. Reliance was also placed on the judgment
in the <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_22">Praga Tools Corporation vs. C.A. Imanual &amp; Ors</a>., 1969 (1) SCC
585, where the Supreme Court held that a Company being a non-statutory
body and incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_23">Companies Act</a>, was not performing a
statutory or public duty and hence no mandamus would lie against a
Company, for enforcement of any legal right by its workmen. For the
same proposition, reliance was also placed on K.K. Saksena vs.
International Commission on Irrigation &amp; Drainage &amp; Ors., 2015 (4)
SCC 670 and Shri Sohan Lal vs. Union of India &amp; Anr., AIR 1957 SC
</p><p id="p_12">529.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                         Page 14 of 83</span>
</p><p id="p_13"> 10.    Mr. Sethi additionally contested the maintainability of the petitions
on the ground that Petitioners have already approached the Conciliation
Officer under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_24">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as
„<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_25">I.D. Act</a>‟) and filed complaints alleging illegal removal of the Petitioners
and raising other grievances and proceedings are pending. DGC had
received notice and reply has been filed. Though, it was disputed that the
employees are „workman‟ under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_26">Section 2(s)</a> of the I.D. Act, however,
without prejudice to the said position, the argument was that once
Petitioners have resorted to the dispute resolution mechanism, they are
estopped from approaching this Court invoking its extraordinary
jurisdiction and seeking prerogative writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. For the proposition that once an alternate remedy is
available under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_28">I.D. Act</a> and other labour legislations, writ petition
will not lie, reliance is placed by Mr. Sethi on the judgments in Chairman,
Coal Authority of India &amp; Anr. vs. Madan Prasad Sinha and Ors., (2000)
10 SCC 597; <a href="/doc/482515/" id="a_29">Transport and Dock Workers Union &amp; Ors. vs. Mumbai
Port Trust and Anr</a>., (2011) 2 SCC 575 and a recent judgment of the
Coordinate Bench of this Court in PTI Employees Union vs. PTI,
W.P.(C) No.1596/2018 and W.P.(C) No.10605/2018.
</p><p id="p_14">11.    Without prejudice to the objection to the maintainability of the
petitions, Mr. Sethi contended that DGC, which is a private body, has
taken a decision not to undertake in-house food and beverages services.
The cost and expenses involved do not justify, at present, to undertake the
services in-house as they are impacting the finances and resources.
Accordingly, management decided to engage a specialized agency to
provide the entire gamut of food and beverage services, with no exposure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                          Page 15 of 83</span>
 or outgo to DGC. In fact, by handing over the operations and outsourcing
them, DGC shall benefit in as much as the agency shall pay to cover the
cost of infrastructure like space, air-conditioning and other incidental
provisions. This is purely an economic and commercial decision as a
matter of policy and is not open to judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_15">12.    It was pointed out that DGC is registered under the Shops and
<a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_31">Establishments Act</a>, 1954 and in accordance with <a href="/doc/1574478/" id="a_32">Section 30</a> of the said
Act, only one month‟s notice or salary in lieu thereof is payable while
terminating the services of an employee and the said provision has been
complied with. Albeit none of the provisions of the I.D.Act apply to
DGC,      however,        retrenchment   compensation   to   the   tune      of
Rs.10,05,20,034.00 was paid to all the 59 employees on 28.05.2020 and a
sum of Rs.73,36,865/- has been paid on 29.05.2020 to the 7 Executives.
</p><p id="p_16">13.    Per contra, Ms. Sunita Bhardwaj, learned counsel for the
Petitioners controverted the stand taken by DGC and urged that the writ
petitions are maintainable as DGC is „other authority‟ under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_33">Article 12</a>
and alternatively, as it discharges public functions it is an „authority‟
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226</a>, amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court. The term
„authority‟ used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a>, must receive a liberal meaning unlike the
term „authority‟ in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_36">Article 12.</a> The words &quot;any person or authority&quot; used

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">       &quot;15. The power of the High Court to issue writ begins with a
       non-obstante clause. The power and jurisdiction of the High
       Court is much wider. The jurisdiction extends to
       enforcement against infringement of Part III rights, against
       ‗State&#x27; and also against ‗any person or authority&#x27; and ‗for
       any other purpose&#x27;. The limitation of action against the
       ‗State&#x27; alone is not there under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226</a> of the
       Constitution. Thus, there is distinction between the powers
       to issue writs as between the Supreme Court and the High
       Court. The power to issue writ conferred upon the Supreme
       Court by <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_41">Article 32</a> is for enforcement of Part III rights, but
       the power to issue writs as conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">Article 226</a> upon
       the High Court is for enforcement of fundamental rights as
       against ‗State&#x27; and non fundamental rights as against any
       ‗other person or authority&#x27; or ‗for any other purpose&#x27;. Thus,
       is the distinction between writ jurisdiction of the Supreme
       Court and the High Court, that even where the Supreme
       Court declines a <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_43">Article 32</a> writ petition on the ground that
       the offending party/authority is not ‗State&#x27; yet the High

       is relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the body. The
       duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed

Authority, based on somewhat similar facts, where the plot of land is

Central Government as the Ministry of Urban Development has leased
land measuring 179 acres for promotion of Golf at a prime location on
nominal ground rent. This apart, Ministry exercises direct control over the
affairs and in the administration of DGC by nominating three serving IAS
officers as Directors, with full voting rights and control in the Managing
Committee. Ms. Bhardwaj submitted that DGC has taken an incorrect
stand that it is a private entity with no control of the Government and
places reliance on provisions of the lease deed, which was signed by the
President of India as Lessor and DGC as the Lessee, more particularly
Clause 21, which according to her, clearly evidences control of the
Government in management and administration of DGC. According to
her the said Clause casts a responsibility on DGC to inform the Ministry,
from time to time, of the expiry of the terms of the members of the

 Management Committee and other aspects relating thereto and also
provides for regulating memberships of Government servants in the club.
</p><p id="p_23">20.    Concisely and pithily put, the argument is that though DGC is not
State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_75">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, but it certainly falls
under the expression „other authority‟, as judicially interpreted, on
account of the deep and pervasive administrative control of the
Government of India, over its functioning. Alternatively, it performs
„public functions‟ and is an „authority‟ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article 226</a>, which has a
wider scope and ambit and thus this Court ought to exercise its
extraordinary jurisdiction to redress the grievances raised by the
Petitioners.
</p><p id="p_24">21.    On merits, Ms. Bhardwaj contended that DGC has illegally
terminated permanent services of the Petitioners, which is impermissible
in law and that too amidst Pandemic Covid-19, without any disciplinary
proceedings, without giving any opportunity of hearing and without prior
permission of the appropriate Government to terminate, which is a
mandate under <a href="/doc/607947/" id="a_77">Sections 25(N)(7)</a> and <a href="/doc/607947/" id="a_78">Section 25(O)(6)</a> of the I.D.Act.
Petitioners have been dedicatedly serving the Club for the past 3-4
decades, with an unblemished and exemplary record of service.
Impugned action of termination is in violation of the express directions
in the Notification dated 29.03.2020, issued by the Central Government
under <a href="/doc/513008/" id="a_79">Section 10(L)</a> of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the letter
and spirit behind it, which is to protect employees against wage reduction
and termination etc. in the wake of Pandemic COVID-19.

 particularly, when it is in violation of the principles of natural justice. It is
submitted that in <a href="/doc/979208/" id="a_80">Satwati Deswal vs. State of Haryana and Ors</a>., 2010 (1)
SCC 126, the Supreme Court held that if an employee is terminated and
there are violations of principles of natural justice in the procedure
followed to terminate, then, despite the existence of an alternate remedy,
Court can interfere under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_81">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_26">23.    In support of the argument that existence of an alternative
efficacious remedy does not as matter of rule, bar a writ remedy, support
is drawn from the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1603548/" id="a_82">Harbanslal Sahnia
vs. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd</a>., (2003) 2 SCC 107, para nos.7 and 8 of which

         concerned, suffice it to observe that the rule of exclusion of
         writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a
         rule of discretion and not one of compulsion. In an
         appropriate case, in spite of availability of the alternative
         remedy, the High Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction
         in at least three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition
         seeks enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (ii)
         where there is failure of principles of natural justice; or (iii)

of Contract Labour (Abolition &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_85">Regulation) Act</a>, 1970. Legislative
intent underlying the enactment is to enable an aggrieved person to make
an application to the concerned Authority to prohibit deployment of
contract labour by a Notification. Petitioners are certainly „aggrieved‟ as
their permanent employment in the F&amp;B Department has been abruptly
terminated under the false pretext of closure and contemporaneously
DGC has deployed contract labour, replacing them. Despite the
complaints of the Petitioners no action is being taken by the concerned
Authorities and a direction ought to be issued to them to enforce the

Nos.1 to 5 are under statutory obligations to take action for violation of

from 18.05.2020, which fact has been concealed by the Petitioners. The
Judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/7216703/" id="a_90">Ficus Pax Private Ltd. and Ors. vs.
Union of India and Ors</a>., 2020(4) SSC 810 is a complete answer to the
Petitioners‟ contentions where the Court observed as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">       ―37. It cannot be disputed that the lockdown measures
       enforced by the Government of India under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_91">Disaster

       employers as well as on employees. Various industries,
       establishments were not allowed to function during the said
       period and those allowed to function also could not function
       to their capacity. There can be no denial that lockdown
       measures which were enforced by the Government of India
       had serious consequences both on employers and
       employees. The period of Unlock having begun from 1-6-
       2020 and even prior to that some of the industries were
       permitted to function by the Government of India by
       different guidelines, most of the industries and

       wages during the lockdown period to its workers and
       employees. Some of them may not be able to bear the entire
       burden. A balance has to be struck between these two
       competitive claims. The workers and employees although
       were ready to work but due to closure of industries could not
       work and suffered. For smooth running of industries with

measure of punishment. Thus the procedure of holding a disciplinary
inquiry or opportunity of hearing before imposing punishment and

Petitioners to that extent is misconceived. Provisions of Shops and

complied with and Petitioners have been adequately compensated, in

a notice of closure of F&amp;B Section to the Department of Labour on
26.05.2020. The orders passed under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_101">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005

prosecution against management of DGC for violation of provisions of
I.D.Act and non-payment of wages for April and May, 2020, before the
Joint Labour Commissioner. Notice was issued to the management of
DGC and on 23.06.2020, both parties appeared and the management
sought copies of the complaints for filing detailed reply. DGC filed its
reply on 02.07.2020 and on an objection to jurisdiction of Labour Officer
(District South), matter was transferred to New Delhi District for further
proceedings. Thereafter, on 16.07.2020 hearing took place before the
Labour Officer who prepared a detailed report and forwarded the same to
the Joint Labour Commissioner. However, subsequently, matter was
again placed before the Labour Officer and he attempted some settlement
but no further proceedings could take place as it was informed that the
matter is sub-judice before this Court.

With respect to the application for grant of registration of establishment

will be considered only once the said certificate is surrendered.

</p><p id="p_37">34.    In view of the preliminary objection raised by DGC, the foremost
issue that arises for consideration is the maintainability of the present
petitions before this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_38">35.    <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_103">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India deals with powers of High
Courts to issue writs, orders or directions to any person or authority and
to enforce rights conferred by Part-III thereof and for any other purpose.
It has been observed by the Supreme Court in several judgements that the
expansive and extraordinary power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_104">Article 226</a>
of Constitution is as wide as the amplitude of the language used therein,
but at the same time Supreme Court and other Courts have been laying
down the clear restraints and constraints on exercise of that power. In Air
Vice Marshall J.S. Kumar (supra), the Division Bench held that the
language of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_105">Article 226</a> cannot be interpreted and understood literally. If
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                             Page 33 of 83</span>
 literally interpreted, it will follow that the words „for any other purpose‟
would mean that writ can be issued even for deciding private party
disputes such as disputes relating to property, divorce, succession
certificate etc. Similarly, if the words „to any person‟ are literally
interpreted, it would mean that writ can be issued to private persons. This,
however, would not be correct interpretation in view of various
pronouncements of the Supreme Court. A writ will ordinarily lie against
the State or instrumentality of the State but may lie against a person or
any other authority, if it performs public functions or discharges statutory
or public duties. Relevant paras of the judgment are as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">       ―30. The language of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_106">Article 226</a> is no doubt very wide. It
       states that a writ can be issued ―to any person or authority‖
       and ―for enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part
       III and for any other purpose;‖ However, the aforesaid
       language in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_107">Article 226</a> cannot be interpreted and
       understood literally. We cannot apply the literal rule of
       interpretation while interpreting <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_108">Article 226.</a> If we take the
       language of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_109">Article 226</a> literally it will follow that a writ can
       even be issued to any private person or to settle even private
       disputes. If we interpret the word ―for any other purpose&quot;
       literally it will mean that a writ can be issued for any
       purpose whatsoever, e. g., for deciding private property
       disputes, for grant of divorce, succession certificate etc.
       Similarly, if we interpret the words ―to any person‖ literally
       it will mean that a writ can even be issued to private persons.
       However, this would not be the correct meaning in view of
       various decisions of the Supreme Court in which it was held
       that a writ will ordinarily lie only against the State or

       our opinion the AFSC is not performing a public function nor
       discharging a public duty. Hence, no writ lies against it.

<blockquote id="blockquote_66">       31. The correct interpretation of the aforesaid words in

       to whom writs were traditionally issued by British Courts on

       to mean that a writ can ordinarily be issued for the purpose
       for which writs were traditionally issued by British Courts on

       opinion they are not so wide as to permit Judges to do

       principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_118">Article

whether DGC is a State or an instrumentality of the State or falls under
„other authorities‟ under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_119">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, so as to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 35 of 83</span>
 amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_120">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_121">Article 12</a> of the Constitution is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">       ―12. Definition--In this Part, unless the context otherwise
       requires, --the State includes the Government and
       Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature
       of each of the States and all local or other authorities within
       the territory of India or under the control of the Government
       of India.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_40">37.    Plain reading of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_122">Article 12</a> indicates that „State‟ includes
Government of India, Parliament of India, Government and Legislatures
of the States and all local or „other authorities‟. Petitioners did not dispute
the position that DGC is not a State and thus this is not a conundrum that
arises in the present case. The unequivocal contention of the Petitioners is
that DGC comes in the sweep of „other authorities‟ under the said Article.
Literally seen, the scope of „other authorities‟ is narrow under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_123">Article 12.</a>
However, the term has been given a broader interpretation and its scope
has been expanded over a period of time through judicial interpretations.
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_124">Article 12</a> in the Constitution was introduced in the Draft Constitution as
<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_125">Article 7.</a> The reason why the Article was placed in a Chapter concerning
Fundamental Rights is discernible from the Constituent Assembly Debate
by Dr. Ambedkar and I may allude to the same as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">       ―The object of the fundamental rights is twofold. First, that
       every citizen must be in a position to claim those rights.
       Secondly, they must be binding upon every authority -- I
       shall presently explain what the word ‗authority&#x27; means --
       upon every authority which has got either the power to make
       laws or the power to have discretion vested in it. Therefore, it
       is quite clear that if the fundamental rights are to be clear,
       then they must be binding not only upon the Central

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                             Page 36 of 83</span>
        Government, they must not only be binding upon the
       Provincial Government, they must not only be binding upon
       the Governments established in the Indian States, they must
       also be binding upon District Local Boards, Municipalities,
       even Village Panchayats and Taluk Boards, in fact, every
       authority which has been created by law and which has got
       certain power to make laws, to make rules, or make bye-laws.
       If that proposition is accepted and I do not see anyone who
       cares for fundamental rights can object to such a universal
       obligation being imposed upon every authority created by
       law -- then, what are we to do to make our intention clear?
       There are two ways of doing it. One way is to use a
       composite phrase such as ‗the State&#x27;, as we have done in
       <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_126">Article 7;</a> or, to keep on repeating every time, ‗the Central
       Government, the Provincial Government, the State
       Government, the Municipality, the Local Board, the Port
       Trust, or any other authority&#x27;. It seems to me not only most
       cumbersome but stupid to keep on repeating this phraseology
       every time we have to make a reference to some
       authority. The wisest course is to have this comprehensive
       phrase and to economise in words.‖

 SCR 377, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that the
expression is wide enough to include every statutory authority on which
powers are conferred to carry out Government or quasi-Government
functions and functioning within the territory of India or under the control
of Government of India. The ethos of this judgment was followed a
decade later when in <a href="/doc/974148/" id="a_131">Sukhdev Singh vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh
Raghuvanshi</a>, (1975) 1 SCC 421, another Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court ruled that bodies which are created by Statutes, would
come within the expression „other authorities‟ because of the nature of
their activities despite their constitution being for commercial purposes.
Accordingly, Corporations such as Life Insurance Corporation, Industrial
Finance Corporation were brought within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_132">Article 12</a> and
the reasoning to so hold is evident from the following observations in the
judgment:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">       ―The concept of State has undergone drastic changes in
       recent years. Today State cannot be conceived of simply as a
       coercive machinery wielding the thunderbolt of authority. It
       has to be viewed mainly as a service corporation. A State is
       an abstract entity. It can only act through the instrumentality
       or agency of natural or juridical persons. There is nothing
       strange in the notion of the State acting through a
       corporation and making it an agency or instrumentality of
       the State. With the advent of a welfare State the framework of
       civil service administration became increasingly insufficient
       for handling the new tasks which were often of a specialised
       and highly technical character. The distrust of Government
       by civil service was a powerful factor in the development of a
       policy of public administration through separate
       corporations which would operate largely according to
       business principles and be separately accountable. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                          Page 38 of 83</span>
        public corporation, therefore, became a third arm of the
       Government. The employees of public corporation are not
       civil servants. Insofar as public corporations fulfil public
       tasks on behalf of Government, they are public authorities
       and as such, subject to control by Government. The public
       corporation being a creation of the State is subject to the
       constitutional limitation as the State itself. The governing
       power wherever located must be subject to the fundamental
       constitutional limitations. The ultimate question which is
       relevant for our purpose is whether the Corporation is an
       agency or instrumentality of the Government for carrying on
       a business for the benefit of the public.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_43">40.    The Supreme Court in Zee Telefilms Ltd. (supra), after noticing the
observations of the Constitution Bench, as above, observed that because
of the change in socio-economic policies of the Government, by a judicial
interpretation, wider meaning was given to the expression „other
authorities‟ and this was primarily with a view to prevent the Government

       applicable to other similar bodies. This control is not
       specifically exercised under any special statute applicable to
       the Board. All functions of the Board are not public functions
       nor are they closely related to governmental functions.

       is under the control of the Government. Thus the little control

<blockquote id="blockquote_95">       26. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,
       however, contended that there are certain facets of the
       activities of the Board which really did not come up for
       consideration in any one of the earlier cases including
       in Pradeep Kumar Biswas case [(2002) 5 SCC 111 : 2002
       SCC (L&amp;S) 633] and those facts if considered would clearly
       go on to show that the Board is an instrumentality of the
       State. In support of this argument, he contended that in the
       present-day context cricket has become a profession and that
       cricketers have a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_145">Article 19(1)(g)</a> to
       pursue their professional career as cricketers. It was also
       submitted that the Board controls the said rights of a citizen
       by its Rules and Regulations and since such a regulation can
       be done only by the State, the Board of necessity must be
       regarded as an instrumentality of the State. It was also
       pointed out that under its Memorandum of Association and
       the rules and regulations and due to its monopolistic control
       over the game of cricket, the Board has all-pervasive powers
       to control a person&#x27;s cricketing career as it has the sole
       authority to decide on his membership and affiliation to any
       particular cricket association, which in turn would affect his
       right to play cricket at any level in India as well as abroad.

<blockquote id="blockquote_96">       27. Assuming that these facts are correct the question then is,
       would it be sufficient to hold the Board to be a State for the
       purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_146">Article 12?</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_97">       28. There is no doubt that <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_147">Article 19(1)(g)</a> guarantees to all
       citizens the fundamental right to practise any profession or to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                          Page 44 of 83</span>
        carry on any trade, occupation or business and that such a
       right can only be regulated by the State by virtue of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_148">Article
       19(6).</a> Hence, it follows as a logical corollary that any
       violation of this right will have to be claimed only against the
       State and unlike the rights under Articles 17 or 21, which can
       be claimed against non-State actors including individuals,
       the right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_149">Article 19(1)(g)</a> cannot be claimed against an
       individual or a non-State entity. Thus, to argue that every
       entity, which validly or invalidly arrogates to itself the right
       to regulate or for that matter even starts regulating the
       fundamental right of the citizen under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_150">Article 19(1)(g</a>), is a
       State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_151">Article 12</a> is to put the cart
       before the horse. If such logic were to be applied, every
       employer who regulates the manner in which his employee
       works would also have to be treated as State. The
       prerequisite for invoking the enforcement of a fundamental
       right under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_152">Article 32</a> is that the violator of that right should
       be a State first. Therefore, if the argument of the learned
       counsel for the petitioner is to be accepted then the petitioner
       will have to first establish that the Board is a State under
       <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_153">Article 12</a> and it is violating the fundamental rights of the
       petitioner. Unless this is done the petitioner cannot allege
       that the Board violates fundamental rights and is therefore
       State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_154">Article 12.</a> In this petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_155">Article 32</a> we
       have already held that the petitioner has failed to establish
       that the Board is State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_156">Article 12.</a>
       Therefore assuming there is violation of any fundamental
       right by the Board that will not make the Board a ―State‖ for
       the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_157">Article 12</a>.‖

       any statutory or public duty. A private body or a person may
       be amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may become
       necessary to compel such body or association to enforce any

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_104">       ―11. Judicial review is designed to prevent the cases of abuse
       of power and neglect of duty by public authorities. However,
       under our Constitution, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_164">Article 226</a> is couched in such a way
       that a writ of mandamus could be issued even against a
       private authority. However, such private authority must be
       discharging a public function and the decision sought to be
       corrected or enforced must be in discharge of a public
       function. The role of the State expanded enormously and
       attempts have been made to create various agencies to
       perform the governmental functions. Several corporations
       and companies have also been formed by the Government to
       run industries and to carry on trading activities. These have
       come to be known as public sector undertakings. However, in
       the interpretation given to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_165">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, this
       Court took the view that many of these companies and
       corporations could come within the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_166">Article 12</a> of the
       Constitution. At the same time, there are private bodies also
       which may be discharging public functions. It is difficult to
       draw a line between public functions and private functions
       when they are being discharged by a purely private
       authority. A body is performing a ―public function‖ when it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 47 of 83</span>
        seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the public or a
       section of the public and is accepted by the public or that
       section of the public as having authority to do so. Bodies
       therefore exercise public functions when they intervene or
       participate in social or economic affairs in the public
       interest. In a book on Judicial Review of Administrative
       Action (5th Edn.) by de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell in Chapter 3,
       para 0.24, it is stated thus:

             the public or that section of the public as having

             functions when they intervene or participate in
             social or economic affairs in the public interest.
             This may happen in a wide variety of ways. For
             instance, a body is performing a public function
             when it provides ‗public goods&#x27; or other collective
             services, such as health care, education and
             personal social services, from funds raised by
             taxation. A body may perform public functions in
             the form of adjudicatory services (such as those of
             the criminal and civil courts and tribunal system).
             They also do so if they regulate commercial and
             professional activities to ensure compliance with
             proper standards. For all these purposes, a range
             of legal and administrative techniques may be

       2001 SCC (L&amp;S) 227] the very same question came up for
       consideration. The appellant Company was engaged in the

             ―7. In de Smith, Woolf and Jowell&#x27;s Judicial
             Review of Administrative Action, 5th Edn., it is
             noticed that not all the activities of the private
             bodies are subject to private law e.g. the activities
             by private bodies may be governed by the
             standards of public law when its decisions are
             subject to duties conferred by statute or when, by
             virtue of the function it is performing or possibly its
             dominant position in the market, it is under an
             implied duty to act in the public interest. By way of
             illustration, it is noticed that a private company
             selected to run a prison although motivated by
             commercial profit should be regarded, at least in
             relation to some of its activities, as subject to
             public law because of the nature of the function it
             is performing. This is because the prisoners, for
             whose custody and care it is responsible, are in the
             prison in consequence of an order of the court, and

              the purpose and nature of their      detention is a
             matter of public concern and         interest. After
             detailed discussion, the learned      authors have
             summarised the position with         the following
             propositions:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">             (1) The test of whether a body is performing a
             public function, and is hence amenable to judicial
             review, may not depend upon the source of its
             power or whether the body is ostensibly a ‗public&#x27;
             or a ‗private&#x27; body.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_111">             (2) The principles of judicial review prima facie
             govern the activities of bodies performing public
             functions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_112">             (3) However, not all decisions taken by bodies in
             the course of their public functions are the subject-
             matter of judicial review. In the following two
             situations judicial review will not normally be
             appropriate even though the body may be
             performing a public function:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_113">             (a) Where some other branch of the law more
             appropriately governs the dispute between the
             parties. In such a case, that branch of the law and
             its remedies should and normally will be applied;
             and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_114">             (b) where there is a contract between the litigants.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_115">             In such a case the express or implied terms of the
             agreement should normally govern the matter. This
             reflects the normal approach of English law,
             namely, that the terms of a contract will normally
             govern the transaction, or other relationship
             between the parties, rather than the general law.
             Thus, where a special method of resolving disputes
             (such as arbitration or resolution by private or
             domestic tribunals) has been agreed upon by the
             parties (expressly or by necessary implication),

              that regime, and not judicial review, will normally
             govern the dispute.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_116">       23. The counsel for the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 1976
       of 1998 and for the appellant in the civil appeal arising out
       of SLP (Civil) No. 6016 of 2002 strongly contended that
       irrespective of the nature of the body, the writ petition under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_169">Article 226</a> is maintainable provided such body is
       discharging a public function or statutory function and that
       the decision itself has the flavour of public law element and
       they relied on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_170">Shri Anadi Mukta
       Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti
       Mahotsav Smarak Trust v. V.R. Rudani</a> [(1989) 2 SCC 691] .
       In this case, the appellant was a Trust running a science
       college affiliated to the Gujarat University under the Gujarat
       University Act, 1949. The teachers working in that college
       were paid in the pay scales recommended by the University
       Grants Commission and the college was an aided institution.
       There was some dispute between the University Teachers
       Association and the University regarding the fixation of their
       pay scales. Ultimately, the Chancellor passed an award and
       this award was accepted by the State Government as well as
       the University and the University directed to pay the teachers
       as per the award. The appellants refused to implement the
       award and the respondents filed a writ petition seeking a writ
       of mandamus and in the writ petition the appellants
       contended that the college managed by the Trust was not an
       ―authority‖ coming within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_171">Article 12</a> of the
       Constitution and therefore the writ petition was not
       maintainable. This plea was rejected and this Court held that
       the writ of mandamus would lie against a private individual
       and the words ―any person or authority‖ used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_172">Article 226</a>
       are not to be confined only to statutory authorities and
       instrumentalities of the State and they may cover any other
       person or body performing public duty. The form of the body
       concerned is not very much relevant. What is relevant is the
       nature of the duty imposed on the body. The duty must be
       judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                            Page 51 of 83</span>
        or authority to the affected party. No matter by what means
       the duty is imposed, if a positive obligation exists, mandamus
       cannot be denied.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">       29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of mandamus or the
       remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_173">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a public law
       remedy and is not generally available as a remedy against
       private wrongs. It is used for enforcement of various rights of
       the public or to compel public/statutory authorities to
       discharge their duties and to act within their bounds. It may
       be used to do justice when there is wrongful exercise of
       power or a refusal to perform duties. This writ is admirably
       equipped to serve as a judicial control over administrative
       actions. This writ could also be issued against any private
       body or person, specially in view of the words used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_174">Article
       226</a> of the Constitution. However, the scope of mandamus is
       limited to enforcement of public duty. The scope of
       mandamus is determined by the nature of the duty to be
       enforced, rather than the identity of the authority against
       whom it is sought. If the private body is discharging a public
       function and the denial of any right is in connection with the
       public duty imposed on such body, the public law remedy can
       be enforced. The duty cast on the public body may be either
       statutory or otherwise and the source of such power is
       immaterial, but, nevertheless, there must be the public law
       element in such action. Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish
       between public law and private law remedies. According
       to Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 30, p. 682,
            ―1317. A public authority is a body, not necessarily
            a county council, municipal corporation or other
            local authority, which has public or statutory
            duties to perform and which perform those duties
            and carries out its transactions for the benefit of
            the public and not for private profit.‖

       There cannot be any general definition of public authority or
       public action. The facts of each case decide the point.

<blockquote id="blockquote_118">        31. The decision of the employer in these two cases to
       terminate the services of their employees cannot be said to
       have any element of public policy. Their cases were purely
       governed by the contract of employment entered into between
       the employees and the employer. It is not appropriate to
       construe those contracts as opposed to the principles of
       public policy and thus void and illegal under <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_175">Section 23</a> of
       the Contract Act. In contractual matters even in respect of
       public bodies, the principles of judicial review have got
       limited application. This was expressly stated by this Court

       reiterated that the interpretation and implementation of a
       clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ
       petition. Whether the contract envisages actual payment or
       not is a question of construction of contract. If a term of a
       contract is violated, ordinarily, the remedy is not a writ

       by nor is it accountable to the Government. The Indian
       Government&#x27;s financial contribution to ICRISAT is minimal.
       Its participation in ICRISAT&#x27;s administration is limited to 3
       out of 15 members. It cannot therefore be said that ICRISAT

       easy to define what a public function or public duty is, it can
       reasonably be said that such functions are similar to or
       closely related to those performable by the State in its
       sovereign capacity. The primary activity of ICRISAT is to
       conduct research and training programmes in the sphere of
       agriculture purely on a voluntary basis. A service voluntarily
       undertaken cannot be said to be a public duty. Besides
       ICRISAT has a role which extends beyond the territorial

 of „other authority‟ under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_189">Article 12.</a> The Appellant was a cooperative
society registered under the U.P. Cooperative Societies Act. Respondents
had filed writ petitions before the High Court challenging the
discontinuation of their long services, spanning over 5 to 12 years,
without notice and retrenchment compensation. High Court overruled the
objection of the Mill that writ was not maintainable as the
Respondent/Mill was not an instrumentality of the State. Supreme Court
held that the Mill was not a State, despite the fact that 50% Shares of the

Relevant paras are as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_125">       ―8. From the decisions referred to above, it would be clear
       that the form in which the body is constituted, namely,
       whether it is a society or a cooperative society or a company,
       is not decisive. The real status of the body with respect to the
       control of Government would have to be looked into. The
       various tests, as indicated above, would have to be applied
       and considered cumulatively. There can be no hard-and-fast
       formula and in different facts/situations, different factors may
       be found to be overwhelming and indicating that the body is
       an authority under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_190">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. In this
       context, bye-laws of the Mill would have to be seen. In the
       instant case, in one of the writ applications filed before the
       High Court, it was asserted that the Government of Uttar
       Pradesh held 50% shares in the Mill which fact was denied
       in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the State and it was
       averred that majority of the shares were held by
       canegrowers. Of course, it was not said that the Government
       of Uttar Pradesh did not hold any share. Before this Court, it
       was stated on behalf of the contesting respondents in the
       counter-affidavit that the Government of Uttar Pradesh held
       50% shares in the Mill which was not denied on behalf of the

        Mill. Therefore, even if it is taken to be admitted due to non-
       traverse, the share of the State Government would be only
       50% and not entire. Thus, the first test laid down is not
       fulfilled by the Mill. It has been stated on behalf of the
       contesting respondents that the Mill used to receive some
       financial assistance from the Government. According to the
       Mill, the Government had advanced some loans to the Mill. It
       has nowhere been stated that the State used to meet any
       expenditure of the Mill much less almost the entire one, but,
       as a matter of fact, it operates on the basis of self-generated
       finances. There is nothing to show that the Mill enjoys
       monopoly status in the matter of production of sugar. A
       perusal of the bye-laws of the Mill would show that its
       membership is open to canegrowers, other societies, Gram
       Sabha, State Government etc. and under Bye-law 52, a
       Committee of Management consisting of fifteen members is
       constituted, out of whom, five members are required to be
       elected by the representatives of individual members, three
       out of the cooperative society and other institutions and two
       representatives of financial institutions besides five members
       who are required to be nominated by the State Government
       which shall be inclusive of the Chairman and Administrator.
       Thus, the ratio of the nominees of the State Government in
       the Committee is only 1/3rd and the management of the
       Committee is dominated by 2/3rd non-government members.
       Under the bye-laws, the State Government can neither issue
       any direction to the Mill nor determine its policy as it is an
       autonomous body. The State has no control at all in the
       functioning of the Mill much less a deep and pervasive one.

       Government of Uttar Pradesh, is only advisory and to guide
       its members. The letter sent by the Managing Director of the
       Federation on 22-11-1999 was merely by way of an advice
       and was in the nature of a suggestion to the Mill in view of its
       deteriorating financial condition. From the said letter, which
       is in the advisory capacity, it cannot be inferred that the State

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                            Page 57 of 83</span>
        had any deep and pervasive control over the Mill. Thus, we
       find none of the indicia exists in the case of the Mill, as such
       the same being neither an instrumentality nor an agency of
       the Government cannot be said to be an authority and,
       therefore, it is not State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_191">Article 12</a> of
       the Constitution.

<blockquote id="blockquote_126">       9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the contesting
       respondents submitted that even if the Mill is not an authority
       within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_192">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, writ
       application can be entertained as mandamus can be issued
       under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_193">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against any person or
       authority which would include any private person or body.
       The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, on
       the other hand, submitted that mandamus can be issued
       against a private person or body only if the infraction alleged
       is in performance of public duty. Reference in this connection
       may be made to the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_194">Shri Anadi
       Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna
       Jayanti Mahotsav Samarak Trust v. V.R. Rudani</a> [(1989) 2
       SCC 691] in which this Court examined the various aspects
       and distinction between an authority and a person and after
       analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the
       conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the
       authority or the person performs a public function or
       discharges a public duty that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_195">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
       can be invoked. In the cases of <a href="/doc/1624453/" id="a_196">K. Krishnamacharyulu v. Sri
       Venkateswara Hindu College of Engg</a>. [(1997) 3 SCC 571 :

       Union</a> [(2001) 1 SCC 298 : 2001 SCC (L&amp;S) 227] the same
       principle has been reiterated. Further, in the case of VST
       Industries Ltd. [(2001) 1 SCC 298 : 2001 SCC (L&amp;S) 227] it
       was observed that manufacture and sale of cigarettes by a
       private person will not involve any public function. This
       being the position in that case, this Court held that the High
       Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_198">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. In the present case, the Mill is
       engaged in the manufacture and sale of sugar which, on the

        same analogy, would not involve any public function. Thus,
       we have no difficulty in holding that the jurisdiction of the
       High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_199">Article 226</a> of the Constitution could not
       have been invoked.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_48">53.    At this stage, it would be useful to allude to the judgment of the
Supreme Court in K.K. Saksena (supra). The issue before the Supreme
Court was whether the High Court was right in holding that the writ
petition filed against International Commission on Irrigation and
Drainage (ICID) was not maintainable as it is not a State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_200">Article 12</a>
and nor were its actions amenable to judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_201">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution. Relying on several earlier judgments of the Supreme
Court on this aspect and examining elaborately the nature of functions of
ICID as well as its constitution, bye-laws, etc., the Supreme Court
observed as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_127">       ―43. What follows from a minute and careful reading of the
       aforesaid judgments of this Court is that if a person or
       authority is ―State‖ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_202">Article 12</a> of the
       Constitution, admittedly a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_203">Article 226</a>
       would lie against such a person or body. However, we may
       add that even in such cases writ would not lie to enforce
       private law rights. There are a catena of judgments on this
       aspect and it is not necessary to refer to those judgments as
       that is the basic principle of judicial review of an action
       under the administrative law. The reason is obvious. A
       private law is that part of a legal system which is a part of
       common law that involves relationships between individuals,
       such as law of contract or torts. Therefore, even if writ
       petition would be maintainable against an authority, which is
       ―State‖ under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_204">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, before issuing
       any writ, particularly writ of mandamus, the Court has to
       satisfy that action of such an authority, which is challenged,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                         Page 59 of 83</span>
        is in the domain of public law as distinguished from private
       law.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">       44. Within a couple of years of the framing of the
       Constitution, this Court remarked in <a href="/doc/107472/" id="a_205">Election Commission of
       India v. Saka Venkata Rao [Election Commission of
       India</a> v. Saka Venkata Rao, AIR 1953 SC 210] that
       administrative law in India has been shaped in the English
       mould. Power to issue writ or any order of direction for ―any
       other purpose‖ has been held to be included in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_206">Article 226</a> of
       the Constitution with a view apparently to place all the High
       Courts in this country in somewhat the same position as the
       Court of the King&#x27;s Bench in England. It is for this reason
       ordinary ―private law remedies‖ are not enforceable through
       extraordinary writ jurisdiction, even though brought against
       public authorities (see Administrative Law, 8th Edn., H.W.R.
       Wade and C.F. Forsyth, p. 656). In a number of decisions,
       this Court has held that contractual and commercial
       obligations are enforceable only by ordinary action and not
       by judicial review.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_129">       45. On the other hand, even if a person or authority does not
       come within the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_207">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, but is
       performing public duty, writ petition can lie and writ of
       mandamus or appropriate writ can be issued. However, as
       noted in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_208">Federal Bank Ltd. [Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar
       Thomas</a>, (2003) 10 SCC 733] , such a private body should
       either run substantially on State funding or discharge public
       duty/positive obligation of public nature or is under liability
       to discharge any function under any statute, to compel it to
       perform such a statutory function.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_131">       48. We are in agreement with the aforesaid analysis by the
       High Court and it answers all the arguments raised by the
       learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. The
       learned counsel argued that once the society is registered in
       India it cannot be treated as international body. This
       argument is hardly of any relevance in determining the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                          Page 60 of 83</span>
        character of ICID. The focus has to be on the function
       discharged by ICID, namely, whether it is discharging any
       public duties. Though much mileage was sought to be drawn
       from the function incorporated in the MoA of ICID, namely,
       to encourage progress in design, construction, maintenance
       and operation of large and small irrigation works and
       canals, etc. that by itself would not make it a public duty cast
       on ICID. We cannot lose sight of the fact that ICID is a
       private body which has no State funding. Further, no liability
       under any statute is cast upon ICID to discharge the
       aforesaid function. The High Court is right in its observation
       that even when object of ICID is to promote the development
       and application of certain aspects, the same are voluntarily
       undertaken and there is no obligation to discharge certain
       activities which are statutory or of public character.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_132">       49. There is yet another very significant aspect which needs
       to be highlighted at this juncture. Even if a body performing
       public duty is amenable to writ jurisdiction, all its decisions
       are not subject to judicial review, as already pointed out
       above. Only those decisions which have public element
       therein can be judicially reviewed under writ jurisdiction.
       <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_209">In Praga Tools Corpn. v. C.A. Imanual</a> [(1969) 1 SCC 585] ,
       as already discussed above, this Court held that the action
       challenged did not have public element and writ of
       mandamus could not be issued as the action was essentially
       of a private character. That was a case where the employee
       concerned was seeking reinstatement to an office.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_49">54.    On a finding that ICID was neither funded by the Government nor
discharging any function under any Statute, the question posed and
answered by the Supreme Court was :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_133">       ―46. In the present case, since ICID is not funded by the
       Government nor is it discharging any function under any
       statute, the only question is as to whether it is discharging
       public duty or positive obligation of public nature.

<blockquote id="blockquote_134">        47. It is clear from the reading of the impugned judgment
       that the High Court was fully conscious of the principles laid
       down in the aforesaid judgments, cognizance whereof is duly
       taken by the High Court. Applying the test in the case at
       hand, namely, that of ICID, the High Court opined that it was
       not discharging any public function or public duty, which
       would make it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High
       Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_210">Article 226.</a> The discussion of the High Court is

            is clear as crystal that the respondent has been
            established as a scientific, technical, professional and
            voluntary        non-governmental          international
            organisation, dedicated to enhance the worldwide
            supply of food and fibre for all people by improving
            water and land management and the productivity of
            irrigated and drained lands so that there is
            appropriate management of water, environment and
            the application of irrigation, drainage and flood
            control techniques. It is required to consider certain
            kind of objects which are basically a facilitation
            process. It cannot be said that the functions that are
            carried out by ICID are anyway similar to or closely
            related to those performable by the State in its
            sovereign capacity. It is fundamentally in the realm of
            collection of data, research, holding of seminars and
            organising studies, promotion of the development and
            systematic management of sustained irrigation and
            drainage systems, publication of newsletter,
            pamphlets and bulletins and its role extends beyond
            the territorial boundaries of India. The memberships

            countries on certain conditions.

            Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas</a>, (2003) 10 SCC 733]
            solely because a private company carries on banking
            business, it cannot be said that it would be amenable
            to the writ jurisdiction. The Apex Court has opined
            that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_213">Banking Regulation Act</a> and
            other statutes have the regulatory measure to play.
            The activities undertaken by the respondent Society, a

            partake the nature of public duty or State actions.

            stated to be remotely connected with the activities of

            has obligation to discharge certain activities which
            are statutory or of public character. The concept of
            public duty cannot be construed in a vacuum. A
            private society, in certain cases, may be amenable to
            the writ jurisdiction if the writ court is satisfied that it
            is necessary to compel such society or association to

            of public nature casting positive public obligation

</blockquote><p id="p_55">59.    From a reading of the aforesaid judgment, in my view, the reasons
that weighed with the Court to conclude that Air Force Sports Complex is
not amenable to writ jurisdiction can be culled out as under :-
</p><p id="p_56">(a)    It runs in accordance with its own Rules and byelaws laid down by
its Governing Council;
</p><p id="p_57">(b)    Funds are generated through monthly subscription and grants from
various welfare funds;
</p><p id="p_58">(c)    No funds sanctioned from the Ministry of Defence;
</p><p id="p_59">(d)    The Institute is not performing any public function or discharging
any public duty;
</p><p id="p_60">(e)    Only providing recreation to Air Force personnel;
</p><p id="p_61">(f)    Mere grant of some facilities by the Government, such as land,
subsidized liquor etc. towards recreation is only a benefit and no more;
and
</p><p id="p_62">(g)    No deep and pervasive control of the Government and it is only a
private body.
</p><p id="p_63">60.    When these reasons are placed on the canvas in the background
and facts of the present case, as carved out above, are compared, the
inescapable and inexorable conclusion is that DGC cannot be brought
under the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_233">Article 12</a>, as it is neither a State nor its
instrumentality nor „other authority‟. As stated categorically in the
counter-affidavit by DGC, it is governed by its own Memorandum and
Articles of Association and its management and other affairs are
regulated by the General Committee. There is no funding from the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 69 of 83</span>
 Government and nor does the Government have any administrative
dominance or control over the affairs of DGC. The funds are generated
through membership and subscription fee and revenue earned from golf
and thus there is no financial control of the Government. While it is not
disputed that the General Committee has three nominee members
appointed by the Ministry of Urban Development, but as stated by DGC
in the counter-affidavit, these Directors do not enjoy any extra or
dominant powers compared to the other Directors. There is nothing
brought on record by the Petitioners which shows any control of the
Government over the affairs of DGC, leave alone deep and pervasive
control. In so far as the contention of the Petitioners with respect to the
land leased to DGC by the Government i.e. the Ministry of Urban
Development at a nominal ground rent for promotion of Golf is
concerned, suffice would it be to note that mere execution of a lease deed
by the Government with respect to the land is not enough to confer the
status of a State or instrumentality of the State or a public authority. As
rightly argued by Mr. Sethi, the lease is governed by the terms of the
lease deed executed between two parties as lessor and lessee, with rights
and obligations flowing from and governed by the terms and conditions
therein. In fact, a similar contention was rejected by the Division Bench
in Air Vice Marshall J.S. Kumar (supra) and the relevant paras have
already been quoted in the earlier part of the judgment.
</p><p id="p_64">61.    At this stage, I may also take note of an affidavit filed on behalf of
the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs wherein it is categorically
stated that the lease of land in possession of DGC was executed in 1963
and was renewed from time to time, however, the Ministry does not have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 70 of 83</span>
 any control or any role in the day-to-day functioning of DGC and nor
does it exercise any administrative control. Thus, examining on the anvil
of the principles enunciated in the various judgements, referred to above,
this Court cannot agree with the contention of the Petitioners that DGC
falls under „other authority‟ as envisaged under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_234">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India and the question is answered against the Petitioners.
</p><p id="p_65">62.    No doubt Courts have held that writs may lie against a private body
but a caveat has been astutely lodged that only if it performs public
functions, it would be amenable to writ jurisdiction. This was the dicta
and ethos of the judgement of the Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1775396/" id="a_235">Unni Krishnan
J.P. &amp; Ors. vs. State of A.P. &amp; Ors</a>., (1993) 4 SCC 111. Taking the
benchmarks and yardsticks laid down by the Supreme Court, the next
question whether DGC is performing „public function‟ or „public duty‟,
in my opinion, can only be answered against the Petitioners. It is
uncontrovertibly obvious that DGC is providing recreational facility of
golf to its members or permitted members and this cannot be termed as a
function akin to sovereign functions of the State. Division Bench in Air
Vice Marshall J.S. Kumar (supra), relying on various judgements of the
Supreme Court including Praga Tools Corporation (supra), addressing a
similar issue held that the Air Force Sports Complex is a private body
which provides recreation to Air Force Officers, serving or retired and it
cannot be said that it is carrying out sovereign functions of the State.
</p><p id="p_66">63.    In General Manager, Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills (supra), as noted
above, the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the expression
„other authority‟. It was held that the form in which the body is
constituted i.e. Society or Company etc. is not decisive and the real status
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                            Page 71 of 83</span>
 with respect to the control of the Government is to be looked into and
there cannot be a hard and fast formula. In the said case the ratio of the
nominees of the State Government in the Management Committee was
one-third and the State Government held 50% shares in the Mill, which
was an untraversed position. However, the Supreme Court held that the
Mill was not an Authority or State or its instrumentality under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_236">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution, as none of the indicia existed to categorize it so and
the factors that led the Supreme Court to reach this conclusion,
discernable from reading of the judgment were; (a) Mill operated on self
generated finances; (b) bye-laws of the Mill reflected that its membership
was open to canegrowers, other societies, Gram Sabha, State Government
etc.; (c) State Government could not issue any direction to the Mill nor
determine its policy as the Mill is an autonomous body; (d) role of the
Federation, which is the apex body whose ex-officio CMD is the
Secretary, Department of Sugar Industry and Cane, Government of Uttar
Pradesh; is only advisory. Significantly, the second contention raised by
the Respondents was that even if the Mill is not an Authority under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_237">Article 12</a>, the writ can be entertained as mandamus can be issued under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_238">Article 226</a> against any person or authority which would include a private
person or body. Supreme Court, referred to the decision in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_239">Shri Anadi
Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti
Mahotsav Smarak Trust vs. V.R. Rudani</a>, (1989) 2 SCC 691, in which the
Court had examined the distinction between an authority and a person
and concluded that only when the authority or the person performs a
public function or discharges a public duty that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_240">Article 226</a> can be
invoked. Supreme Court also relied on its earlier decisions in K.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                         Page 72 of 83</span>
<p id="p_67"> Krishnamacharyulu vs. Sri Venkateswara Hindu College of Engg., (1997)
3 SCC 571 and <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_241">VST Industries Ltd. vs. Workers&#x27; Union</a>, (2001) 1 SCC
298, where the same principle was reaffirmed. Having examined the facts
of the case before it, the Supreme Court held that as the Mill was engaged
in manufacture and sale of sugar, it is not performing any public function
and analogy was drawn from the judgment in VST Industries
Ltd. (supra), where the Court had held that manufacture and sale of
cigarettes by private persons will not involve any public function. On this
analogy, I may safely hold that DGC only provides recreational facility in
the nature of a sport activity restricted to its members and permissive
users and it would be too far-fetched to term it as a public function akin
to a sovereign function of State, which is the touchstone from which the
expression has to take its colour. Thus, without any hesitation and
equivocation, this Court holds that DGC is neither „other authority‟ under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_242">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India nor it performs public function or
discharges public duty, to be amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_243">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_68">64.    Since this Court is not entertaining the writ petitions on ground of
maintainability, challenge to the alleged illegal termination of the services
of the Petitioners is not being adjudicated. Thus, at this stage no
directions can be issued to the official Respondents for taking action
against DGC for discontinuing the services, as sought by the Petitioners.
</p><p id="p_69">65.     Petitioners have relied on an order of the Information Commission
wherein Chandigarh Golf Club has been held to be a Public Authority. It
was pointed out by learned Senior Counsel for DGC that the said order
has been stayed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in WP(C)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 73 of 83</span>
 No.21967/2012 and similar orders qua DGC have been stayed by this
Court in W.P.(C) 6768/2013 and the petitions are pending. Thus, reliance
on the said orders cannot be placed by the Petitioners at this stage, quite
apart from the fact that a „public authority‟ under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_244">Information
Act</a>, 2005, has a different connotation in law, from an Authority under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_245">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. In this context, I may refer to and quote
from a judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in W.P. (C)
4596/2007 entitled „<a href="/doc/149070147/" id="a_246">IFCI Limited vs. Ravinder Balwani</a>‟, decided on 17th
August 2010, which is as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_163">       ―18. At this juncture, this Court would like to deal with the
       submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the
       test for determining whether a body is a ―public authority‖
       for the purposes of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_247">RTI Act</a> is no different from the test
       for determining whether a body is an ―authority‖ for the
       purposes of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_248">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. Given the fact
       that there is a specific definition of what constitutes a
       ―public authority‖ for the purposes of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_249">RTI Act</a>, there is
       no warrant for incorporating the tests evolved by the
       Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas for the purposes
       of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_250">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. While it is possible that an
       authority     within     the    meaning     of    <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_251">Article    12</a>
       of the Constitution is likely to be a ―public authority‟ under
       the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_252">RTI Act</a>, the converse need not be necessarily true.
       Given the purpose and object of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_253">RTI Act</a> the only
       consideration        is      whether     the      body       in

       under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_254">Section 2</a> (h) of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_255">RTI Act</a>. There is no need to turn
       to the Constitution for this purpose, particularly when there
       is a specific statutory provision for that purpose. Even for
       the purposes of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_256">Section 2(h)(d)</a> (i) or (ii) <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_257">RTI Act</a> for

</blockquote><p id="p_70">66.    The judgment in Satwati Deswal (supra), relied upon by the
Petitioners, is also of no avail as this was a service matter pertaining to
termination of the Petitioner by the Manager of the School and dealt with
an employment with the State of Haryana, which was amenable to writ
jurisdiction as a State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_259">Article 12.</a> In Roychan Abraham (supra), the
issue was with regard to a private educational Institution and the
Allahabad High Court held that private Institutions imparting education
to students perform a „public duty‟, which at the cost of repetition is quite
apart from the activities undertaken by DGC.
</p><p id="p_71">67.    Much emphasis was placed by learned counsel for the Petitioners
on the judgment in Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra), wherein
the Supreme Court has held that functions of the Board were public
functions, no matter discharged by a Society registered under the
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_260">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 and is amenable to the writ jurisdiction.
In order to analyze this argument, I may only refer to the judgment in the
said case and the circumstances in which the Supreme Court came to the
above conclusion. The Supreme Court first considered the judgment in
Zee Telefilms Ltd. (supra), where, by a majority, the Supreme Court had
held that BCCI was not State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_261">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution, based on its creation, share capital, financial control of the
Government and its autonomy. Having said that, the Supreme Court had
examined whether the Board was discharging public duties in the nature
of State functions. The contention that the Board was discharging public


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                           Page 75 of 83</span>
 duties in the nature of State functions was rejected by the Supreme Court
and it was held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_164">       ―29. It was then argued that the Board discharges public
       duties which are in the nature of State functions. Elaborating
       on this argument it was pointed out that the Board selects a
       team to represent India in international matches. The Board
       makes rules that govern the activities of the cricket players,
       umpires and other persons involved in the activities of
       cricket. These, according to the petitioner, are all in the
       nature of State functions and an entity which discharges such
       functions can only be an instrumentality of State, therefore,
       the Board falls within the definition of State for the purpose
       of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_262">Article 12.</a> Assuming that the abovementioned functions of
       the Board do amount to public duties or State functions, the
       question for our consideration is: would this be sufficient to
       hold the Board to be a State for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_263">Article 12?</a>
       While considering this aspect of the argument of the
       petitioner, it should be borne in mind that the State/Union
       has not chosen the Board to perform these duties nor has it
       legally authorised the Board to carry out these functions
       under any law or agreement. It has chosen to leave the
       activities of cricket to be controlled by private bodies out of
       such bodies&#x27; own volition (self-arrogated). In such
       circumstances when the actions of the Board are not actions
       as an authorised representative of the State, can it be said
       that the Board is discharging State functions? The answer
       should be no. In the absence of any authorisation, if a private
       body chooses to discharge any such function which is not
       prohibited by law then it would be incorrect to hold that such
       action of the body would make it an instrumentality of the
       State. The Union of India has tried to make out a case that
       the Board discharges these functions because of the de facto
       recognition granted by it to the Board under the guidelines
       framed by it, but the Board has denied the same. In this
       regard we must hold that the Union of India has failed to
       prove that there is any recognition by the Union of India

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                          Page 76 of 83</span>
        under the guidelines framed by it, and that the Board is
       discharging these functions on its own as an autonomous
       body.

<p id="p_72">68.    Having so observed, the Supreme Court found that as a matter of
fact the Board was discharging some duties like selection of the Indian
cricket team, controlling the activities of the players, which activities
were akin to public duties and in case of any breach of statutory
obligations or rights of citizens, the aggrieved party could seek redress by
a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_264">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and in that context
held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_165">       ―31. Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that the Board
       does discharge some duties like the selection of an Indian
       cricket team, controlling the activities of the players and
       others involved in the game of cricket. These activities can be
       said to be akin to public duties or State functions and if there
       is any violation of any constitutional or statutory obligation
       or rights of other citizens, the aggrieved party may not have
       a relief by way of a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_265">Article 32.</a> But that does
       not mean that the violator of such right would go scot-free
       merely because it or he is not a State. Under the Indian
       jurisprudence there is always a just remedy for the violation
       of a right of a citizen. Though the remedy under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_266">Article 32</a> is
       not available, an aggrieved party can always seek a remedy
       under the ordinary course of law or by way of a writ petition
       under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_267">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, which is much wider
       than <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_268">Article 32</a>.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_73">69.    The Supreme Court thereafter in Board of Control for Cricket in
India (supra) observed that the majority view in Zee Telefilms Ltd.
(supra) was that BCCI is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_269">Article 226</a> even though it is not a State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_270">Article 12.</a>

<p id="p_74"> Analyzing the rationale, the Supreme Court in Board of Control for
Cricket in India (supra) delved in detail into the functions of the Board,
which is reflected from para 33 of the judgment and on the basis of the
functions performed by the Board, came to a conclusion that BCCI was
performing public functions and, therefore, answerable in judicial review
of State action. Para 33 is as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_166">       ―33. The majority view thus favours the view that BCCI is
       amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_271">Article 226</a> even when it is not ―State‖ within the meaning of
       <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_272">Article 12.</a> The rationale underlying that view if we may say
       with utmost respect lies in the ―nature of duties and
       functions‖ which BCCI performs. It is common ground that
       the respondent Board has a complete sway over the game of
       cricket in this country. It regulates and controls the game to
       the exclusion of all others. It formulates rules, regulations,
       norms and standards covering all aspects of the game. It
       enjoys the power of choosing the members of the national
       team and the umpires. It exercises the power of disqualifying
       players which may at times put an end to the sporting career
       of a person. It spends crores of rupees on building and
       maintaining infrastructure like stadia, running of cricket
       academies and supporting State associations. It frames
       pension schemes and incurs expenditure on coaches,
       trainers, etc. It sells broadcast and telecast rights and
       collects admission fee to venues where the matches are
       played. All these activities are undertaken with the tacit
       concurrence of the State Government and the Government of
       India who are not only fully aware but supportive of the
       activities of the Board. The State has not chosen to bring any
       law or taken any other step that would either deprive or
       dilute the Board&#x27;s monopoly in the field of cricket. On the
       contrary, the Government of India has allowed the Board to
       select the national team which is then recognised by all
       concerned and applauded by the entire nation including at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">WP(C) 3403/2020 &amp; conn.                                         Page 78 of 83</span>
        times by the highest of the dignitaries when they win
       tournaments and bring laurels home. Those distinguishing
       themselves in the international arena are conferred highest
       civilian awards like the Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan,
       Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri apart from sporting awards
       instituted by the Government. Such is the passion for this
       game in this country that cricketers are seen as icons by
       youngsters, middle aged and the old alike. Any organisation
       or entity that has such pervasive control over the game and
       its affairs and such powers as can make dreams end up in
       smoke or come true cannot be said to be undertaking any
       private activity.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_75">70.    In stark contrast to the functions carried out by the BCCI, in my
view, the functions carried out by DGC cannot even remotely be termed
as public functions. Providing recreation as a Club to its restricted
members cannot be compared to the functions of the BCCI on any
pedestal. The said judgment, therefore, does not help the Petitioners.
</p><p id="p_76">71.    Since this Court has held that writ petitions are not maintainable as
no writ would lie against a private body not performing public functions,
it would be unnecessary to decide the other issues raised by the parties
including the existence or otherwise of an alternate remedy. It is left open
to the Petitioners to resort to appropriate remedies available to them in
accordance with law for ventilating the grievances raised in the present
petitions. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on
the merits of the issues raised.
</p><p id="p_77">72.    Before parting with these petitions, I may, however, take note of
the fact that in W.P.(C) 5440/2020, Respondents / Government of NCT of
Delhi has filed a short affidavit stating therein that the application made
by the Petitioners for prohibition of deployment of contract labour in the

 departments of DGC was forwarded to the Joint Labour Commissioner
(District South) who has recommended forwarding the application to
consider the matter to the State Advisory Board. The Chairman of the
Board is the final approving authority and as and when the meeting of the
Board is convened the agenda items shall be placed before it. This Court
is sanguine and confident that the needful shall be done as expeditiously
as possible by the concerned authorities, in accordance with law.

pending applications.

as it is the prerogative of the State Government to initiate prosecution,
depending on the facts and circumstances of each case before it. A writ of
mandamus cannot be issued for directing prosecution or institution of
legal proceedings to any party and there is a complete mechanism
available to the Petitioners under the relevant statutes for the said
purpose. <a href="/doc/415638/" id="a_288">In Nagpur Glass Works Ltd., Nagpur &amp; Anr. vs State of Madhya
