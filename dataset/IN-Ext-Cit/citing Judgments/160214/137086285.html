                               ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>


<p id="p_1">      The present petition is filed under Articles 14 &amp; 226 of the Constitution
of India as well as under the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development
Act, 1976 for the prayers, inter alia, that the action of the respondent authorities
continuing the reservation of the land owned by the petitioner bearing Survey
Nos. 582/1 &amp; 582/2 situated at Vadodara may be quashed and set aside as
unreasonable, arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Art. 14</a> <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2">&amp; 19</a> of the Constitution of
India and for a declaration that the reservation has lapsed. As a corollary, it has
also prayed for quashing and setting aside the Notifications dated 18.1.2012
and 24.9.2012 on the grounds stated in the memo of petition as well as the
amendment.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.    Heard learned advocate Shri Navin Pahwa appearing for M/s. Thakkar
Associates for the petitioner, learned AGP Shri Bharat Vyas for respondent
No.1 and learned advocate Shri Maulik Nanavati for respondent No. 3-
Vadodara Municipal Corporation.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    Learned counsel Shri Pahwa for the petitioner referred to the background
of facts and submitted that the land in question was reserved by the respondents
since 1996. Thereafter, a representation has been also made in 2006 and the
petitioner had given the notice as required under sec. 20 of the Gujarat Town
Planning &amp; Urban Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Act'). Learned counsel Shri Pahwa referred to sec. 20 of the Act which reads
as under :
</p>

<p id="p_4">"Sec. 20. Acquisition of land

(1) The area development authority or any other authority for whose purpose
land is designated in the final development plan for any purpose specified in
clause (b), clause (d), [clause (f)], clause (k), clause (n) [or clause(o)] of sub-
section (2) of section 12, may acquire the land either by agreement or under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     Page 2 of 14</span>
<p id="p_5">             C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




(2) If the land referred to in sub-section (1) is not acquired by agreement
within a period of ten years from the date of the coming into force of the final
development plan or if proceedings under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_4">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 I of
1894, are not commenced within such period, the owner or any person
interested in the land may serve a notice on the authority concerned requiring it
to acquire the land and if within six months from the date of service of such
notice the land is not required or no steps are commenced for its acquisition,
the designation of the land as aforesaid shall be deemed to have lapsed."
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.    Learned counsel Shri Pahwa, therefore, submitted that as provided in this
provision, if, after the land is reserved, it is not acquired for the public purpose
for which it is reserved, then the owner can issue a notice as required under sec.
20(2) of the Act. He submitted that in the facts of the case, the notices have
been given by the petitioner on 4.8.1980 and 21.9.2011. However, as the
respondents have failed to take steps for acquisition of the land in question
even after the notice under sec. 20(2) of the Act was issued, it is required to be
released. He submitted that as per the scheme of the Act, after the Town
Planning Scheme, within a period of 10 years the land has to be acquired which
has been reserved and if it is not acquired, then the owner can give notice. He
submitted that even after the notice if the acquisition proceedings are not
initiated within six months, then the reservation would lapse. He therefore
submitted that the decision of the respondent authorities to keep the land under
reservation without actual acquisition for such a long period is illegal. He
submitted that the petitioner has a right to the property which may not be a
fundamental right, but still when such right of the petitioner regarding
enjoyment is sought to be curtailed, the provision of the statute has to be
construed strictly.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.    For that purpose, he referred to Annexure-O which is the Resolution and
submitted that even their own resolution of the Board of Vadodara Urban
Development Authority (VUDA) acknowledges the fact about the notice.
Learned counsel Shri Pahwa pointedly referred to this to support his
submissions with regard to the reservation. He submitted that on failure of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     Page 3 of 14</span>
             C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




VUDA, respondent No. 2, to initiate the proceedings for acquisition, the
provisions of sec. 20(2) of the Act would be attracted.     He submitted that, in
fact, on earlier occasion the petitioner had raised an objection and had also
suggested that part of the land may be released suggesting change of zone. He
submitted that in fact the resolution refers to the fact that for institutional use
for Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) the parking zone could be
converted into residential zone. He therefore submitted that the present petition
may be allowed.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.    An affidavit-in-reply has been filed by respondent No.2 VUDA
contending that the land in question were reserved for Local Centre by VMC. It
is contended that the Second Revised Draft Development Plan of VUDA was
prepared and published on 23.11.2006 and as per the requirement of VMC it
was thought fit to keep the land for institutional use by VMC and Parking Zone
under sec. 12(2)(0) of the Act. The Second Revised Draft Development Plan
has been notified on 18.1.2012 which has come into effect and therefore the
land in question is kept for institutional use by VMC and also for the Parking
Zone. It is also contended that earlier the original owner of the property had
approached the High Court of Gujarat by way of Special Civil Application No.
16159 of 2011 challenging the reservation and the same was disposed of by
the High Court vide order dated 21.10.2011 permitting the petitioners to make
a representation. It is contended that the representation has been considered by
respondents Nos. 1 &amp; 2 and the resolution has been passed that the
representation is not accepted by respondent No. 1 considering the requirement
of the land in question for public purpose.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.    The affidavit-in-reply is also filed by respondent No. 1 referring to the
background of facts and the earlier petition being Special Civil Application No.
16159 of 2011 which was filed by the original petitioner which came to be
disposed of as withdrawn with a view to permit the original owner to make a
representation.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     Page 4 of 14</span>
<p id="p_10">            C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




</p><p id="p_11">8.    An affidavit-in-reply is also filed by respondent No. 3 contending, inter
alia, that the petitioner has purchased the land from the erstwhile owner by
registered sale deed dated 7.2.2012 and before such purchase the land in
question was already reserved for public institution for VMC and parking zone.
It is therefore contended that the challenge to the notification dated 18.1.2012
by which the Government of Gujarat revised the development plan suffers from
the vice of delay and laches. It is contended that the revised development plan
was published by the Area Development Authority in terms of sec. 13 of the
Act of 1976 on 24.11.2006. It is contended that the fact of reservation of the
land was known to the original owner in 2006 and in fact objections were also
made by the erstwhile owner. Thereafter the procedure has been followed
inviting objections with respect to the modification and thereafter Special Civil
Application No. 16159 of 2011 was filed by the original owner before the High
Court for the same prayer raising the same issues and ultimately it was
withdrawn with a view to make representation.
</p>

<p id="p_12">9.    It is therefore contended that the petitioner was fully aware of the fact
that the land was under reservation prior to the date of purchase and they have
not chosen to challenge such reservation immediately or within a reasonable
time and therefore the claim is bad for the delay, laches and acquiescence. It is
therefore contended that when the original owner of the land in earlier round of
litigation has forgone the right to challenge the reservation and has sold the
land without any reference to the reservation, the new purchaser who will be
stepping in his shoes cannot challenge or agitate the same issue. It is contended
that the petitioner who has acquired interest in the land after publication of the
notification reserving the land for public purpose could not contest such
reservation.   It is also contended that the Corporation has initiated steps
towards acquisition of the land reserved for public purpose by issuing notice to
the owners of the land. It is contended that the notice dated 4.2.2013 was
issued by the Corporation to the owners of the land bearing Survey No. 582/2


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    Page 5 of 14</span>
             C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




informing about the reservation calling upon them for discussion and therefore
it has been contended that the petition is misconceived.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10.   It is therefore contended that the petitioner is now estopped from
challenging the reservation of the land and the petition deserves to be
dismissed. It is also contended that the ground in the petition that despite
service of notice upon the authority for whom the land has been reserved, it has
not acquired the land or taken steps in that direction is factually incorrect. It is
contended that the land bearing Survey No. 582/2 came to be reserved for
parking zone and institutional area in January 2012 on publication of the
notification by the State Government. It is contended that final development
plan reserving the land in question for parking zone and institutional purpose
for VMC is notified in January 2012 and therefore the period has not expired.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11.   Learned counsel Shri Maulik Nanavati appearing for respondent No.3
has referred to the background of facts that the petitioner is the subsequent
purchaser of the land in question. He submitted that the original owner had
raised an objection and in fact the present petitioner who has purchased the
land cannot stand on a better footing than the original owner. Learned counsel
Shri Nanavati submitted that the petitioner has to step in the shoes of the
original owner who had not only raised an objection under the Act which has
been considered but had also challenged by way of Special Civil Application
No. 16159 of 2011 before the High Court. He emphasised that the said
petition was withdrawn with a view to make a representation. Learned counsel
Shri Nanavati submitted that the representation has been made which has been
considered and turned down. He submitted that having raised the same issue
before the court and withdrawn with a view to make a representation, it cannot
be permitted to agitate the same issue over again and again. He submitted that
the present petitioner having purchased the land from the original owner, will
step in their shoes and will also have to address with regard to the knowledge
or otherwise about such proceedings including reservation. He submitted that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     Page 6 of 14</span>
              C/SCA/3992/2013                                  JUDGMENT




the case of the petitioner also suffers from delay, laches and acquiescence for
which he referred to the papers including the synopsis of the dates of events
and submitted that for the first time he has challenged or raised this issue in
2012.     After the earlier petition filed by the original owner and the
representation made by him have been disposed of, a fresh round of litigation
is sought to be created by the petitioner, who is a subsequent purchaser.      He
therefore submitted that whether the petitioner who is a subsequent purchaser
had raised such issues or whether he would be bound on the ground of estoppel
from raising and agitating the same issue will have to be considered.
</p>

<p id="p_15">12.     Learned counsel Shri Nanavati referred to the provisions of sec. 20 of the
Act and emphasised the words 'authority concerned'..... He submitted that the
language of the section clearly provides that the notice has to be served to the
authority concerned, meaning thereby, the authority for which the reservation
has been made, that the reservation is made for VMC and no notice has been
served to VMC. He submitted that therefore the entire bogey raised referring
to the lapse of reservation after a particular period and the notice having been
served is misconceived in factual matrix. He submitted that the same public
purpose still remains valid and in fact the petitioner or its predecessor having
made an attempt for change of zone for part of the land and accepting the
reservation clearly suggests that it was accepted that the land in question is
reserved for public purpose. He submitted that in fact the notice as required
under the law has not been given to the 'authority concerned'. Learned counsel
Shri Nanavati submitted that in any case the period has to be counted from the
date of publication of the final scheme in the year 2012 and the notices have
been issued to the owners and the steps for acquisition have been taken. He
therefore submitted that all the contentions raised are required to be considered
in background of the facts particularly when the petitioner has for the first time
raised such an issue in the year 2012 and therefore he cannot raise the
contentions referring to sec. 20 of the Act.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     Page 7 of 14</span>
<p id="p_16">             C/SCA/3992/2013                                   JUDGMENT




</p><p id="p_17">13.    Learned counsel Shri Nanavati referred to Annexure-O (Resolution) and
submitted that there is a reference to the representation of the petitioner or his
predecessor-in-title but no notice as required under sec. 20(2) is issued. He
submitted that it is required to be examined whether Annexure-O can be said to
be a notice as contemplated under sec. 20(2) of the Act. He referred to the
papers and submitted that either the objection as per the Act has been made by
the original owner or subsequently the representation has been made by the
original owner and the notice as required under sec. 20 has not been given. He
submitted that in the objections of 1980 made by the original owner, there is a
reference with regard to the lapse of reservation. However, the petitioner who
is a subsequent purchaser has raised the issue in 2012 and therefore in light of
the withdrawal of the earlier petition, he is estopped from raising such
contention on the ground of estoppel as well as the principle analogous to O.2
R.2.
</p>

<p id="p_18">14.    Learned counsel Shri Nanavati referred to O.2 R.2 and submitted that the
basic idea is that the party who is filing the proceedings is deemed to have
asked for the same or all the reliefs and having failed the petition is withdrawn
to make a representation.     He submitted that now it is not open for the
petitioner to re-agitate the same issue. He submitted that though O.2 R.2 refers
to proceedings between the same party but in the proceedings by mere change
of name of the party it will not make any difference and what the court has to
look for is the substance. He emphasised and submitted that, can it be said that
the present petitioner was not aware about such steps taken by the original
owner, and therefore would it not fall in line having stepped in the shoes? He
therefore submitted that it would be deemed to have taken all the steps which
the original owner has taken for all purposes and the petitioner cannot
approbate and reprobate that for the purpose suitable to it the original owner is
deemed to have taken the necessary steps but for such other steps it may not be
binding it. He submitted that in fact the alternate suggestion for the change of
zone for part of the land itself suggests that the original owner had accepted the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    Page 8 of 14</span>

reservation.
</p>


<p id="p_19">15.   Learned counsel Shri Nanavati referred to the Notification dated
18.1.2012 at Annexure-G. He has also referred to the judgment of the High
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_5">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v. Surat Municipal
Corporation and ors</a>., reported in 2008 (3) GLH 137. Again, learned counsel
Shri Nanavati has referred to the papers and submitted that only after the
notification was issued in 2012, the present petitioner has made the
representation but it cannot be said that it was a notice and till then there is no
such notice under sec. 20(2) of the Act even by the earlier owner.              He
submitted that the synopsis of the facts would clearly point out that till then
there is no whisper about such notice.              Learned counsel Shri Nanavati
submitted that assuming without admitting that what has been addressed is
considered to be a notice as required under sec. 20(2) of the Act, still,
considering the public interest, the present petition may not be entertained in
exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. He submitted that there is no fundamental right and at the most it is a
legal right. Therefore, the discretion under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Art. 226</a> may not be exercised
considering the public interest as, otherwise, it would frustrate the object of the
Act and also the public interest.
</p>

<p id="p_20">16.   In view of these rival submissions, it is required to be considered
whether the present petition can be entertained and allowed.
</p>

<p id="p_21">17.   As it transpires from the background of facts referred to hereinabove, the
land in question was reserved for the Local Centre by VMC. When the revised
draft plan of VUDA was prepared and published on 23.11.2006 it was kept for
institutional use by the VMC and parking zone. The emphasis by learned
counsel Shri Pahwa referring to sec. 20(2) of the Act that as provided in sec.
20(2) if the land is not acquired, the owner or the person interested in the land


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     Page 9 of 14</span>
            C/SCA/3992/2013                                   JUDGMENT




may serve notice to the authority concerned requiring it to acquire the land. If
within six months from the date of service the land is not acquired or steps are
not taken for acquisition, the designation of the land shall be deemed to have
lapsed. Therefore, the underlying purpose of sec. 20(2) of the Act is that the
land should be acquired by the authority or the government for the purpose for
which it is reserved and if necessary steps are not taken for a period of 10
years, then, the owner or the person interested in the land may serve the notice
calling upon the government or the authority concerned to take steps for
acquisition, failing which the land would be designated or de-reserved.
</p>

<p id="p_22">18.   Thus, it provides for some amount of obligation that the land could be
acquired for public purpose, but there has to be a duration or limitation.
However, the fact remains that for various reasons the development plan is not
finalized and it is delayed during the process itself. In fact, the period of 10
years, therefore, has been provided. Again, it is required to be emphasized that
the period of 10 years has a reference to the final development plan and not the
draft development plan, meaning thereby, the revised or the draft development
plan is required to be finalized making the picture clear as regards the purpose
for which the land is reserved for public purpose. Therefore, the submission
made by learned counsel Shri Pahwa referring to sec. 20(2) of the Act is
misconceived on the ground that it has a reference to final development plan
and not the revised development plan and it has been approved in January
2012. (emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_23">19.   Again, the submissions which have been made referring to the papers
clearly suggest that the original owner had made a representation to the
authority. In fact, when the earlier petition being Special Civil Application No.
16159 of 2011 was preferred, the same was disposed of vide order dated
21.10.2011 permitting the petitioner to prefer the representation before the
competent authority. This itself would suggest that the original owner having
filed the petition earlier has withdrawn the same with a view to make a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   Page 10 of 14</span>
            C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




representation and had not raised any such issues relying upon sec. 20(2) of the
Act. However, the subsequent purchaser now claims to raise such an issue and
the present petition is filed in the name of the subsequent purchaser, though the
issue would remain the same. It is in this background the submissions are
required to be appreciated in context of the aspect, whether there was a
representation or a notice as required under sec. 20(2) of the Act. As stated
above, there where representions made and no notice as required under sec.
20(2) of the Act was given by the original owner. Again,         the     language
employed in sec. 20(2) of the Act clearly provides that the notice is required to
be served on the "authority concerned", meaning thereby, the notice ought to
have been served to the respondent VMC. As no such notice calling upon the
respondent VMC to de-reserve the land on failing to acquire the land has been
served, such contentions are misconceived. (emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_24">20.   It is a well-accepted rule of interpretation that the statutory provision has
to be read as it is and if the meaning is clear and unambiguous, no external aid
is necessary. In the facts of the case, the legislature has specifically used the
word "authority concerned" implying that the authority for which the land is
kept for reservation is the "authority concerned". In the facts of the case, VMC
is the authority concerned to whom such notice under sec. 20(2) of the Act
should have been served, which is not served.
</p>

<p id="p_25">21.   Again, considering the sequence of events and the background as well as
the fact that earlier petition being Special Civil Application No. 16159 of 2011
was withdrawn with a view to make representation clearly suggests that the
original owner having failed in getting any relief, has withdrawn the petition
only to make a representation. Further, merely because this petition is filed by
the subsequent purchaser, the provision of O.2 R.2 may not be strictly attracted,
but still the principles of issue estoppel will always be applicable. As rightly
contended, the present petitioner would step in the shoes of the original owner
and therefore it has to fall in line while making any such grievance. Therefore,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    Page 11 of 14</span>
            C/SCA/3992/2013                                   JUDGMENT




the present petitioner cannot be heard to say raising such issues which could
have been raised at the time of the earlier petition which was withdrawn.
Therefore, the issues which were raised or which could have been raised now
cannot be permitted to be raised merely by filing a subsequent petition in the
name of other person. It is required to be mentioned that sec. 20(2) clearly
provides that the owner or the person interested may give a notice and therefore
it was very much within the knowledge of the present petitioner to take
appropriate steps. Therefore, now it cannot be said that he was not aware,
though the earlier petition was withdrawn by the original owner.
</p>

<p id="p_26">22.   The reliance placed by learned counsel Shri Pahwa on the judgment in
the case of <a href="/doc/645118/" id="a_8">V.D. Barot v. State of Gujarat and ors</a>., reported in (2002) 10 SCC
668, is in a given set of facts suggesting that hypertechnical view should be
avoided and the second petition would be maintainable. However, assuming
that the petition is maintainable, it is required to be examined depending on the
facts and background with reference to the issue estoppel.
</p>

<p id="p_27">23.   A useful reference can be made to the observations made by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in a judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_9">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v. Surat
Municipal Corporation and ors</a>., (supra), on this very issue regarding notice
where the Hon'ble Apex Court has considered that the earlier conduct would
disentitle the person from claiming an equitable relief and the conduct would
preclude the person and operate as an estoppel against him. The underlying
object of the Act has to be seen that with the development as provided in the
final development plan every person is benefited and the owner or the person
interested is required to make appropriate claim before the appropriate
authority at an appropriate stage. The submissions made by learned counsel
Shri Pahwa referring to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Art. 14</a> or the Right to Property are therefore
misconceived.

            C/SCA/3992/2013                                    JUDGMENT




in (2003) 2 SCC 111 in the case of <a href="/doc/623061/" id="a_11">Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill
(P) Ltd. and ors</a>., has to be read in the background and context of the facts.
However, in this judgment, for the purpose of 10 years period for the operation
of sec. 20(2), specifically it has been made clear that the draft development
plan which has been sanctioned and notified shall be the final development
plan and the period of 10 years has to be calculated from the date of
notification when such final development plan came into force.

<p id="p_29">25.   A useful reference can also be made to the judgment of this High Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/1349369/" id="a_12">Deepakbhai J. Shah v. State of Gujarat</a>, reported in 2004 (3) GLH
789, wherein referring to this very issue regarding notice under sec. 20(2) of
the Act observations have been made. There also the reference is made to the
'authority concerned' and it has been observed that the notice under sec.20(2)
was required to be served upon the authority concerned, i.e., the Gujarat Slum
Clearance Board and the notice served upon VUDA would not be sufficient.

<p id="p_30">26.   In any view of the matter, having regard to the facts and circumstances
as discussed above and the rival claims, the Court, while exercising discretion
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is required to strike a balance
between the public interest and the right of the citizen. As stated above, the
petitioner as the subsequent purchaser or the person interested could have a
claim as provided in the statute. However, when the original owner having
failed, and when the subsequent purchaser is again raising the issues, he would
be estopped from raising such contentions. The court is required to consider
and strike a balance between public interest and private interest.

stands dismissed. Rule is discharged.</p><pre id="pre_2">
