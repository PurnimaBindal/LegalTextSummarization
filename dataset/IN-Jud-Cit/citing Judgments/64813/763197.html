    rival competing business by one of the Directors and/or the partner creates 

    more   complication   than   solving   and   doing   the   good   business   of   the

    way, the case as put up by the respondent to oppose the present petition is 





    self-destructive.  If the case of the respondent is accepted, then that itself 

    will affect his own company's business being 49% partner of the same.  In
