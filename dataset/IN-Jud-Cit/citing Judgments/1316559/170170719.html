        Petition filed under Order 47 Rules 1 and 2 r/w Section 114 of the
Civil Procedure Code, to review the order passed by this Hon'ble Court dated

!For Petitioners                : Mr.K.Chellapandian

:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by Mr.Justice C.T.SELVAM)  
        The petitioners seek review of the order passed by this Court in
W.A(MD)No.875 of 2015 dated 29.10.2015.   
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.Though the case of the 1st respondent has come to the attention of
this Court time and again by way of writ proceedings, appeals against orders
therein, we would restrict ourselves to the proceedings emanating from
W.P(MD)No.17034 of 2014.   
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The 1st respondent moved such writ petition seeking the following
relief:-
</p><p id="p_4">        ''To issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records
relating to the impugned orders in R.C.No.222253/Rect.I(2)/2013, dated
23.8.2014 issued by the 2nd respondent  and in Na.Ka.No.B1/3964/2014 dated  
7.3.2014 issued by the 3rd respondent along with the relevant portions in
annexure II referred to in Rule 14 of Tamil Nadu Special Police Subordinate
Service rules 1978 relating with the medical fitness and quash the same and
direct the respondents to issue appointment order within a stipulated time
and pass such further or other orders.''

</p><p id="p_5">        4.Accepting the contention of the review petitioners/respondents
therein that the 1st respondent/writ petitioner suffered a disqualification
from being recruited to the post of Grade-II Police Constable, since he
suffered defect in vision, W.P(MD)No.1703 of 2014 was dismissed and 
thereagainst, the 1st respondent moved W.A(MD)No.875 of 2015.  Therein, this
Court being of the considered view that though the learned single Judge has
considered the Certificate issued by Aravind Eye Hospital; the order passed
in the Contempt Petition(MD) No.85 of 2014, as well as the report of the
Medical Board, no reason had been assigned as to how corneal scars on both 
eyes would affect the 1st respondent/appellant's vision, allowed the writ
appeal under orders dated 29.10.2015.
</p>        
<p id="p_6">        5.The present review application seeks reconsideration of such order.
</p>        
<p id="p_7">        6.Heard learned counsel on either side and perused the materials
available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7.The main ground raised by learned Additional Advocate General is that
under G.O.Ms.No.443, Home (Police VI) Department dated 08.06.2006, an   
amendment to the special rules for the Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service
in Annexure II in column (3) was introduced, to the following effect:-
</p><p id="p_9">        ''Any class and Category Direct recruitment'' in column (1), after item
</p><p id="p_10">(iii) the following item shall be added, namely:-
</p><p id="p_11">        ''(iv) Lasik/Laser Surgery/Excimer Laser Surgery underwent by the
candidate is either of the eye shall be deemed to be a disqualification.''

</p><p id="p_12">        8.It is the contention of learned Additional Advocate General that such
amendment has been in force from 28.10.2005.  The position which emerges as a 
consequence of such amendment is the ineligibility of the 1st respondent to
be appointed in the post of Grade-II Police Constable.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        9.It is his contention that if the referred G.O., had been taken into
consideration, this Court in W.A(MD)No.875 of 2015, would not have ordered in
favour of the 1st respondent.  It is also contended that the same is an error
apparent on the face of the record and hence, this Court would consider the
same and allow the present review application.
</p>        
<p id="p_14">        10.We have heard the learned counsel for the 1st respondent/writ
petitioner on the above submissions.    
</p><p id="p_15">        11.The review applicants have not informed why G.O.Ms.No.443 presently 
sought to be relied upon was not brought to the Court's notice or what
precluded them, from doing so.
</p>        
<p id="p_16">        12.We are unable to accept the submission of learned Additional
Advocate General that there is an error apparent on the face of the record.
What has not been brought to the notice of this Court, cannot be informed to
be an error committed by the Court.  It is settled law that fresh factual
consideration cannot be entered upon in arriving at a decision in a review
application.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        13.We would like to reiterate that review is not an appeal in disguise.
Review can be made only if there is any mistake apparent on the face of the
record or there is any clerical error in the order sought to be reviewed .
Useful reference can be made to a few decisions on the point of review.
</p><p id="p_18">        (i)The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/80351/" id="a_1">Lily Thomas v. Union of India</a>, reported
in 2000 (6) SCC 224, while considering the scope of review and the
limitations imposed on its exercise under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_2">Article 137</a> of the Constitution of
India, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_19">        ?52.    The dictionary meaning of the word "review" is the act of
looking, offer, something again with a view to correction or improvement. It
cannot be denied that the review is the creation of a statute. This Court in
Patel Narshi Thakershi &amp; Ors. Vs. Pradyunmansinghji Arjunsinghji [AIR (1970)
SC 1273], held that the power of review is not an inherent power. It must be
conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication. The review
is also not an appeal in disguise. It cannot be denied that justice is a
virtue which transcends all barriers and the rules or procedures or
technicalities of law cannot stand in the way of administration of justice.
Law has to bend before justice. If the Court finds that the error pointed out
in the review petition was under a mistake and the earlier judgment would not
have been passed but for erroneous assumption which in fact did not exist and
its perpetration shall result in miscarriage of justice nothing would
preclude the Court from rectifying the error. This Court in S.Nagaraj &amp;
Ors.etc. Vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Anr.etc. [1993 Supp. (4) SCC 595] held:
</p><p id="p_20">                "19. Review literally and even judicially means re- examination
or re-consideration. Basic philosophy inherent in it is the universal
acceptance of human fallibility. Yet in the realm of law the courts and even
the statutes lean strongly in favour of finality of decision legally and
properly made. Exceptions both statutorily and judicially have been carved
out to correct accidental mistakes or miscarriage of justice. Even when there
was no statutory provision and no rules were framed by the highest court
indicating the circumstances in which it could rectify its order the courts
culled out such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice. In
Raja Prithwi Chand Law Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai [AIR 1941 FC 1] the Court 
observed that even though no rules had been framed permitting the highest
Court to review its order yet it was available on the limited and narrow
ground developed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords. The Court
approved the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Rajunder Narain Rae
v. Bijai Govind Singh (1836) 1 Moo PC 117 that an order made by the Court was
final and could not be altered:
</p><p id="p_21">                '...nevertheless, if by misprision in embodying the judgments, by
errors have been introduced, these Courts possess, by Common Law, the same   
power which the Courts of record and statute have of rectifying the mistakes
which have crept in.... The House of Lords exercises a similar power of
rectifying mistakes made in drawing up its own judgments, and this Court must
possess the same authority. The Lords have however gone a step further, and
have corrected mistakes introduced through inadvertence in the details of
judgments; or have supplied manifest defects in order to enable the decrees
to be enforced, or have added explanatory matter, or have reconciled
inconsistencies.?
</p><p id="p_22">Basis for exercise of the power was stated in the same decision as under:
</p><p id="p_23">                'It is impossible to doubt that the indulgence extended in such
cases is mainly owing to the natural desire prevailing to prevent
irremediable injustice being done by a Court of last resort, where by some
accident, without any blame, the party has not been heard and an order has
been inadvertently made as if the party had been heard.'
Rectification of an order thus stems from the fundamental principle that
justice is above all. It is exercised to remove the error and not for
disturbing finality. When the Constitution was framed the substantive power
to rectify or recall the order passed by this Court was specifically provided
by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_3">Article 137</a> of the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers who had the
practical wisdom to visualise the efficacy of such provision expressly
conferred the substantive power to review any judgment or order by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_4">Article
137</a> of the Constitution. And clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_5">Article 145</a> permitted this Court
to frame rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order
may be reviewed. In exercise of this power Order XL had been framed
empowering this Court to review an order in civil proceedings on grounds
analogous to Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. The expression,
for any other sufficient reason in the clause has been given an expanded
meaning and a decree or order passed under misapprehension of true state of
circumstances has been held to be sufficient ground to exercise the power.
Apart from Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules this Court has the
inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary in the interest of
justice or to prevent the abuse of process of Court. The Court is thus not
precluded from recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that
it is necessary to do so for sake of justice."
</p><p id="p_24">The mere fact that two views on the same subject are possible is no ground to
review the earlier judgment passed by a Bench of the same strength.
</p><p id="p_25">                53. This Court in M/s.Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. Vs.
Lt.Governor of Delhi [AIR 1980 SC 674] considered the powers of this Court
under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_6">Article 137</a> of the Constitution read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC and Order
40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules and held:
</p><p id="p_26">                "It is well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review
of a judgment delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing
and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a judgment
pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is
justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character
make it necessary to do so. <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_7">Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (1965) 1 SCR
933 at p.948. For instance, if the attention of the Court is not drawn to a
material statutory provision during the original hearing. <a href="/doc/64654035/" id="a_8">G.L. Gupta v. D.N.
Mehta</a>, (1971) 3 SCR 748 at p.760. The Court may also reopen its judgment if a
manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an order to do full
and effective justice. O.N.Mohindroo v. Dist. Judge, Delhi, (1971) 2 SCR 11
at p.27. Power to review its judgments has been conferred on the Supreme
Court by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_9">Art.137</a> of the Constitution, and that power is subject to the
provisions of any law made by Parliament or the rules made under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_10">Art.145.</a> In
a civil proceeding, an application for review is entertained only on a ground
mentioned in O. XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a
criminal proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the
record. (Order XL, R.1, Supreme Court Rules, 1966). But whatever the nature
of the proceeding, it is beyond dispute that a review proceeding cannot be
equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the
judgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except where a
glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier
by judicial fallibility. <a href="/doc/1626241/" id="a_11">Chandra Kanta v. Sheikh Habib</a> (1975) 3 SCR 935."
</p><p id="p_27">                54.     <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_12">Article 137</a> empowers this Court to review its judgments
subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made
under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_13">Article 145</a> of the Constitution. The Supreme Court Rules made in
exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_14">Article 145</a> of the Constitution prescribe that
in civil cases, review lies on any of the ground specified in Order 47 Rule 1
of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides:
</p><p id="p_28">                "Application for review of judgment -(1) Any person considering
himself aggrieved -
</p><p id="p_29">                (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but
from which, no appeal has been preferred.
</p><p id="p_30">                (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or
</p><p id="p_31">                (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes,
and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which,
after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could
not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, 
or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or
for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree
passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the
Court which passed the decree or made the order."
</p><p id="p_32">Under Order 40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules no review lies except on the
ground of error apparent on the face of the record in criminal cases.?
</p>
<p id="p_33">                (ii)<a href="/doc/622454/" id="a_15">In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aibam Pishak Sharma</a> , reported
in AIR 1979 SC 1047, the Supreme Court has held that, 
        "there is nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to preclude a High
Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of
plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave
and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive limits to the
exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be exercised on the
discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise
of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the
review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made;
it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the
record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous ground. But, it
may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.
That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power of review is not to
be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to
correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court."
</p>

<p id="p_34">                (iii)In yet another decision in RAJINDERSINGH Vs. Lt. GOVERNOR,   
reported in 2005 (13) SCC 289, at paragraph Nos.15 and 16, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that law is well settled that the power of judicial review
of its own order by the High Court inheres in every Court of plenary
jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice.  Power of judicial review
extends to correct all errors to prevent miscarriage of justice.   It was
further held that Courts should not hesitate to review their own earlier
order, when there exists an error on the face of record and the interest of
justice so demands in appropriate cases.        
</p>
<p id="p_35">                (iv)<a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_17">In Union of India v. Kamal Sengupta</a> reported in 2008 (8) SCC
612, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at Paragraphs 14 and 15, has held that, 
        "14. At this stage it is apposite to observe that where a review is
sought on the ground of discovery of new matter or evidence, such matter or
evidence must be relevant and must be of such a character that if the same
had been produced, it might have altered the judgment. In other words, mere
discovery of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for
review ex debito justiciae. Not only this, the party seeking review has also
to show that such additional matter or evidence was not within its knowledge
and even after the exercise of due diligence, the same could not be produced
before the Court earlier.
</p><p id="p_36">        15. The term `mistake or error apparent' by its very connotation
signifies an error which is evident per se from the record of the case and
does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and elucidation either of the
facts or the legal position. If an error is not self-evident and detection
thereof requires long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated
as an error apparent on the face of the record for the purpose of Order 47
Rule 1 CPC or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act. To put it differently an order or
decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely because it is erroneous in
law or on the ground that a different view could have been taken by the
Court/Tribunal on a point of fact or law. In any case, while exercising the
power of review, the concerned Court/Tribunal cannot sit in appeal over its
judgment/decision."
</p>
<p id="p_37">                (v)A Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court, in <a href="/doc/1398449/" id="a_18">Infant Jesus
Teacher Training  vs. M.Manikandan (Rev.Appn.No</a>.38 of 2010 in W.A.No.1145 of  
2009, dated 31.08.2010), referring to various decisions of the Hon'ble Apex
Court as well as this Court, has considered the scope of review and held as
follows in paragraphs 14, 31 and 32 of the order:
</p><p id="p_38">        ?14.Considering the scope of review jurisdiction and holding "mistake
or error apparent on the face of the record must be self evident and does not
require a process of reasoning, in <a href="/doc/1673497/" id="a_19">Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi</a>, ((1997) 8
SCC 715), the Supreme Court has held as under: 
</p><p id="p_39">"7. It is well settled that review proceedings have to be strictly confined
to the ambit and scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. <a href="/doc/1536859/" id="a_20">In Thungabhadra Industries
Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P</a>.(AIR 1964 SC 1372 = (1964) 5 SCR 174) (SCR at p. 186)
this Court opined:
</p><p id="p_40">?What, however, we are now concerned with is whether the statement in the
order of September 1959 that the case did not involve any substantial
question of law is an error apparent on the face of the record. The fact that
on the earlier occasion the Court held on an identical state of facts that a
substantial question of law arose would not per se be conclusive, for the
earlier order itself might be erroneous. Similarly, even if the statement was
wrong, it would not follow that it was an error apparent on the face of the
record, for there is a distinction which is real, though it might not always
be capable of exposition, between a mere erroneous decision and a decision
which could be characterised as vitiated by error apparent. A review is by no
means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and
corrected, but lies only for patent error.?
</p><p id="p_41">......
</p><p id="p_42">31. The review proceeding is not by way of an appeal. Holding that the review
must be confined to error apparent on the face of the record and re-appraisal
of the entire evidence on record for finding the error would amount to
exercise of Appellate Jurisdiction, which is not permissible, in <a href="/doc/139654/" id="a_21">Meera Bhanja
v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury</a>, (1995) 1 SCC 170, the Supreme Court held as  
under:
</p><p id="p_43">"8. It is well settled that the review proceedings are not by way of an
appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47,
Rule 1, CPC. In connection with the limitation of the powers of the court
under Order 47, Rule 1, while dealing with similar jurisdiction available to
the High Court while seeking to review the orders under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, this Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/622454/" id="a_23">Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v.
Aribam Pishak Sharma</a> ((1979 (4) SCC 389), speaking through Chinnappa Reddy,   
J., has made the following pertinent observations: (SCC p. 390, para 3) ?It
is true as observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1415584/" id="a_24">Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR
1963 SC 1909), there is nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to
preclude the High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in
every Court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to
correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive
limits to the exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be
exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which,
after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the
person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when
the order was made; it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent 
on the face of the record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous
ground. But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was
erroneous on merits. That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power
of review is not to be confused with appellate power which may enable an
appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate
court.
</p>
<p id="p_44">9. Now it is also to be kept in view that in the impugned judgment, the
Division Bench of the High Court has clearly observed that they were
entertaining the review petition only on the ground of error apparent on the
face of the record and not on any other ground. So far as that aspect is
concerned, it has to be kept in view that an error apparent on the face of
record must be such an error which must strike one on mere looking at the
record and would not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on points
where there may conceivably be two opinions. We may usefully refer to the
observations of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1346544/" id="a_26">Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v.
Mallikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale</a> (AIR 1960 SC 137), wherein, K.C. Das Gupta, 
J., speaking for the Court has made the following observations in connection
with an error apparent on the face of the record:
</p><p id="p_45">        ?An error which has to be established by a long-drawn process of
reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be
said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Where an alleged
error is far from self-evident and if it can be established, it has to be
established, by lengthy and complicated arguments, such an error cannot be
cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule governing the powers of
the superior court to issue such a writ."
</p>
<p id="p_46">        32. As held by the Supreme Court in AIR 1960 SC 137, (SATYANARAYAN      
LAXMINARAYAN HEGDEVS. MALLIKARJUN BHAVANAPPA TIRUMALE), the error must be                 
apparent on the face of the record i.e., error must be self-evident and not
which has to be established by a long drawn process of reasoning or which has
to be searched. In other words, it must be an error and it must be one which
must be manifest on the face of the record. Under the guise of review,
parties are not entitled to rehearing of the same issue. An error can be said
to be apparent on the face of the record only if such error is patent and can
be located without any elaborate argument and without any scope for
