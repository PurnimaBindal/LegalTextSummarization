</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The case against the petitioner is that the petitioner and others
approached the Revenue Department Officials and obtained a false patta in the
name of A3, even though the District Revenue Officer has passed a negative
order. When the complainant approached A4 for rectifying the patta, A4 and
her husband A1 demanded illegal gratification from the complainant. As the
complainant refused to give the demanded amount, A1 to A4 conspired with the
other accused and created forged sale deed and a case under Section 163, 164,
166, 167, 468, 471 r/w. 120(b) and 420 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> is registered against the

</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The petitioner filed a discharge petition under <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_2">Section 239</a> of
Cr.P.C., and the same was dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II,
Madurai. Against the order of dismissal, the petitioner has preferred this
revision case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.On the side of the petitioner, it is stated that the land of 1.30
acres belonged to one Salika Beevi. The complainant purchased the property in
the year 1973. The patta was issued in the name of Balkis Beevi for 0.82
cents. When the complainant approached the Village Administrative Officer to
change the patta, A4 and her husband demanded bribe. Using the false patta
given in the name of Balkis Beevi, the said Balkis Beevi sold the property
with the help of other accused. FIR was registered against seven persons and
the name of the petitioner is not in the FIR. A1 is the husband of A4. A3 is
Balkis Beevi. She sold the land to A2. A5 to A7 witnessed the document. This
petitioner is A8.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.On the side of the petitioner, it is stated that the civil suit is
pending and ownership cannot be decided at this stage and the enquiry of the
District Revenue Officer is in favour of A3. The disciplinary proceedings
against A4 is also dropped. There is no question of forgery. A3 is the owner
of the property. The revenue records stand in her name. The only allegation
against the petitioner is that he conspired with other accused. P.W.4 was
punished by the department for issuing patta in the name of the complainant.
But the petitioner was denied promotion. All the juniors of the petitioner
are getting promoted.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.On the side of the petitioner, it is stated that the part played by
the petitioner is not stated in the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3. The District
Revenue Officer has decided that the property was in the name of Balkis Beevi
in the revenue records even before the UDR. There is no promise to do any
act. No act was done by the petitioner. No benefit was received by the
petitioner. There is no forgery or imperfection or any criminal intention for
the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8.On the side of the prosecution, it is stated that the petitioner is
A8 in the case and discharge from the disciplinary proceedings cannot be
taken into account the criminal proceedings. The petitioner and others
conspired together to grab the land of the complainant and FIR is not a
encyclopedia, it cannot be a ground to discharge a person merely because his
name is not mentioned in the FIR. Departmental proceedings was done by 
officials whereas the criminal proceedings needs applying of judicial mind
and prayed the revision to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        9.On the side of the complainant, it is stated that the petitioner
conspired with A5 pasted the photo of A3 and created forged patta pass book
and A3 using the same, tranferred the patta in the name of A2, and that there
is specific overt act against the petitioner. On the side of the second
respondent, it is further stated that in the evidence of L.W.1. In the 161
statement of A1 to A4, there are specific allegation against the petitioner.
Discharge stage will occur only after issuance of copies under <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_3">Section 207</a> of
Cr.P.C., whereas in this case, A3, A5 and A7 were absconding and copies of
documents are not yet given to the accused.

<p id="p_10">        10.The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the Judgment passed

v. State of Chhatisgarh</a> in Criminal Appeal No.822 of 2012, which reads as
follows:
</p><p id="p_11">        ?There is no reference to a third person in the FIR; no evidence that
he came with the other accused or left with them. No weapon was seized from
him, nor was any property connected with the crime, seized. Having regard to
the role attributed to him and the absence of incriminating factors we find
that it is not safe to convict Mahesh of the offence of murder with the
<a href="/doc/387648/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> and <a href="/doc/123141/" id="a_6">120(B)</a>.?

discharge in respect of the offence alleged to have committed in pursuance of
the alleged conspiracy.?

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of B.Krishnan and Others v.
The Deputy Supreintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption Wing in
2015 0 Supreme (Mad) 1087, which reads as follows: 
</p><p id="p_15">        ?On considering the above, disciplinary proceedings were initiated
against the petitioners simultaneously, but charges have not been proved.
Hence, they were exonerated from the charges levelled against them, against
which, the Board preferred special leave petitions, which were dismissed. As
per the decision of the Apex Court, in the departmental proceedings, the
charges against the petitioners could be proved only by preponderance of
probabilities not by beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal case.?
</p>        
<p id="p_16">        13.The learned counsel for the prosecution relied on the Judgment

cannot be rejected on basis of evidence in departmental proceeding or report
of enquiry officer-However, if prosecution is solely based on a finding in a
disciplinary proceeding and same is set aside by superior authority, as the
very foundation goes, prosecution may be quashed.?

<p id="p_18">        14.In support, the Judgments passed by the Supreme Court of India in
the case of <a href="/doc/1706613/" id="a_9">Sathish Mehra v. Delhi Administration and Another</a> reported in
