                                   VERSUS

<p id="p_1">      R.F.Nariman, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      1.    The facts of this case raises questions relating to one  of  the
      two great social evils practiced against the women of this country for
      centuries.  In the facts presented before us, a young  woman  consumes
      pesticide having been driven to do so by repeated demands  being  made
      on her for money by the family into which she is supposed to merge her
      identity.  Sati  and  dowry  deaths  have  plagued  this  nation   for
      centuries.  Sati - the practice of sending a widow  to  her  husband's
      funeral pyre to burn in it  - was first outlawed under British Rule in
      1829 and 1830 under the Governor Generalship of Lord William  Bentinck
      in the Bengal, Madras and Bombay Presidencies.   General  Sir  Charles
      Napier, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in India  between
      1859 and 1861, is supposed to have  said  to  the  Hindu  Priests  who
      complained to him about the prohibition of Sati that "the  burning  of
      widows is your custom but in my country, when  a  man  burns  a  woman
      alive, we hang them and confiscate all their property.  Let  us  both,
      therefore, act in accordance with our national customs."
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.    It took free India many years  before  the  <a href="/doc/62792864/" id="a_1">Commission  of  Sati
      (Prevention) Act</a>, 1987 was passed by Parliament setting  down  various
      offences relating to the commission of Sati  and  the  trial  of  such
      offences by special courts. In this appeal, however, we are confronted
      with the  other  major  problem,  namely,  dowry  deaths.   Parliament
      responded much earlier so far as the prohibition of dowry is concerned
      by enacting the  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_2">Dowry  Prohibition  Act</a>,  1961  under  which  minimum
      sentences were prescribed as penalty  for  the  giving  or  taking  of
      dowry.  The specific menace  of dowry deaths, however, was tackled  by
      the introduction of a new provision in 1986  -  <a href="/doc/62792864/" id="a_3">Section  304B</a>  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">  the
      Penal Code</a> together with another new provision  <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_5">Section  113B</a>  of  the
      Evidence Act.  These two Sections read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "304-B. Dowry death.-(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by
           any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal
           circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown
           that soon before her death  she  was  subjected  to  cruelty  or
           harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or
           in connection with, any demand for dowry, such  death  shall  be
           called "dowry death", and such  husband  or  relative  shall  be
           deemed to have caused her death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           Explanation.-For the purpose of this sub-section, "dowry"  shall
           have the same meaning as in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_6">Section 2</a> of the  Dowry  Prohibition
           Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (2)  Whoever  commits  dowry  death  shall  be   punished   with
           imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years
           but which may extend to imprisonment for life."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "113-B. Presumption as to  dowry  death.-When  the  question  is
           whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it
           is shown  that  soon  before  her  death  such  woman  had  been
           subjected by such person to cruelty or  harassment  for,  or  in
           connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court  shall  presume
           that such person had caused the dowry death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           Explanation.-For the purposes of  this  section,  "dowry  death"
           shall have the same meaning as in <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_7">Section 304-B</a> of Indian  Penal
           Code (45 of 1860)."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_4">      3.    Coming back to the facts of the present appeal, a  young  woman,
      namely, Salwinder Kaur was married to  the  appellant  Rajinder  Singh
      sometime in the year 1990.  On 31st August, 1993, within four years of
      the marriage, Salwinder Kaur consumed Aluminium Phosphide, which is  a
      pesticide, as a result of which her young life was  snuffed  out.   On
      the same day, an FIR was lodged against the husband, his older brother
      and the older brother's wife. The  trial  court  after  examining  the
      evidence of the prosecution and the defence, acquitted the appellant's
      older brother and his wife but convicted the appellant  under  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_8">Section
      304B</a> and sentenced him to  undergo  rigorous  imprisonment  for  seven
      years, which is the minimum sentence  that  can  be  pronounced  on  a
      finding of  guilt  under  the  said  Section.   This  was  done  after
      examining in particular the evidence of  PW.2  -  Karnail  Singh,  the
      father of the deceased woman, PW-3 - Gulzar Singh, his  elder  brother
      and PW-4 - Balwinder Singh, Sarpanch of the village.  The  High  Court
      of Punjab and Haryana confirmed the conviction and the  sentence  vide
      the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.    For the purpose of this appeal it is sufficient to set  out  the
      dead woman's father's evidence which has  been  accepted  by  the  two
      courts below.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "I have three daughters and two sons, Paramjit Kaur, Manjit Kaur
           and Salwinder Kaur are my daughters.  Salwinder Kaur my daughter
           was married to Rajinder Singh r/o Bathwala.  She was married  to
           Rajinder Singh four years prior to her death.  After one year of
           the marriage, my daughter came to me and told that  her  husband
           Rajinder Singh, the brother-in-law  Davinder  Singh  and  Gurmit
           Kaur, present in court, are demanding money for  constructing  a
           house.  She also informed me that they were quarrelling with her
           for the said demand of money.  At the time  of  marriage  of  my
           daughter, I had given sufficient dowry according to  my  status.
           I told my daughter that at that moment I am not in possession of
           money.  However, I gave she-buffalo to my  daughter  for  taking
           the same to her in-laws' house and asked her to pull on with the
           parents-in-law.  After 7/8 months, when my  daughter  was  again
           ill-treated by the accused, she came to me  and  again  demanded
           money.  The  accused,  present  in  court,  were  demanding  and
           compelling my daughter to back with a promise that I would visit
           her shortly and on the following day,  I  alongwith  my  brother
           Gulzar Singh, the then Sarpanch Balwinder Singh and  Ex-Sarpanch
           Hazura Singh went  to  the  house  of  the  accused  in  village
           Bathawals.  On arrival at the house of the accused, the accused,
           present in court, along with father-in-law of my  daughter  were
           present at their house.  Harjinder Singh,  my  son-in-law  along
           with Gurmit Kaur  and  Davinder  Singh  were  also  present.   I
           requested all of them not to quarrel with my daughter on account
           of demand of money.  I also assured the accused that I would pay
           them the said amount at the time of harvesting  the  crop.   The
           accused  insisted  about  the  demand  of  money.   My  daughter
           Salwinder Kaur visited my house 15 days prior to her  death.   I
           again pacified my daughter  that  I  would  definitely  pay  the
           amount after harvesting the crop.  Salwinder Kaur was not  happy
           for not getting the money from me.  She was  maltreated  by  the
           accused. After the death of  Salwinder  Kaur,  member  panchayat
           <a href="/doc/105475081/" id="a_9">Harbhajan Singh of V. Bathwala and Davinder Singh</a>  accused  came
           to my house  and  informed  that  my  daughter  has  died  after
           consuming some poisonous substance and I was asked to  accompany
           them for cremating the dead body."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">      5.    We have heard learned counsel for the parties.  Counsel for  the
      appellant relied upon the cross-examination of Karnail Singh which  is
      set out hereinbelow:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           "I do not know if  Devinder  Singh  had  separate  portion.   My
           daughter had come to me for the first time 5/6 months after  her
           marriage, but she did not make any complaint to me regarding the
           conduct of the accused persons.  She complained to me only after
           about a year and she had told me that they  wanted  to  build  a
           joint house and asked her to bring money for  that  purpose.   I
           however did not give any money to  her  for  this  purpose.   No
           written complaint was ever  made  to  the  panchayat.   I  never
           talked about it to Balwinder Singh.  It is incorrect to  suggest
           that no demand of money was ever made from my daughter or that I
           have deposed falsely."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_7">      6.    Based on this, learned counsel argued  that  the  link  required
      between the demand made being connected with the marriage was  snapped
      as also the fact that since initially, the  complaints  were  made  at
      long intervals, no offence under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_10">Section 304B</a> could be said to be made
      out.  Counsel for the State of Punjab reiterated the findings of  both
      courts and argued in support of the judgment of the High Court.
</p>

<p id="p_8">      7.    The primary ingredient to attract the offence under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_11">Section 304B</a>
      is that the death of a woman must be  a  "dowry  death".   "Dowry"  is
      defined by <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_12">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961,  which  reads
      as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "2. Definition  of  "dowry".-In  this  Act,  "dowry"  means  any
           property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either
           directly or indirectly-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           (a) by one party to  a  marriage  to  the  other  party  to  the
           marriage; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           (b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other
           person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person,

           at or before  [or any time after the marriage]   [in  connection
           with the marriage of the said parties,  but  does  not  include]
           dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal
           Law (Shariat) applies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           Explanation I.- [***]

           Explanation II.-The expression "valuable security" has the  same
           meaning as in <a href="/doc/1320984/" id="a_13">Section 30</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_9">      8.    A perusal of this Section shows  that  this  definition  can  be
      broken into six distinct parts.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           1) Dowry must first consist of any property or valuable security
</p><p id="p_11">              - the word "any" is a word of  width  and  would,  therefore,
              include within it property and valuable security of any  kind
              whatsoever.
</p>
<p id="p_12">           2) Such property or security can be given or even agreed  to  be
              given.  The actual giving of such property  or  security  is,
              therefore, not necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_13">           3) Such property or security can be given or agreed to be  given
              either directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p id="p_14">           4) Such giving or agreeing to give  can again be not only by one
              party to a marriage to the other but also by the  parents  of
              either party or by any other person to either  party  to  the
              marriage or to any other person.  It  will  be  noticed  that
              this clause again widens the reach  of  the  Act  insofar  as
              those guilty of committing the offence of giving or receiving
              dowry is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           5) Such giving or agreeing to give can be at any time.   It  can
              be at, before, or at any time after the  marriage.  Thus,  it
              can be many years after a marriage is solemnised.
</p>
<p id="p_16">           6) Such giving or receiving  must  be  in  connection  with  the
              marriage of  the  parties.   Obviously,  the  expression  "in
              connection with" would in the  context  of  the  social  evil
              sought to be tackled by the <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_14">Dowry Prohibition  Act</a>  mean  "in
              relation with" or "relating to".
</p>


<p id="p_17">      9.    The ingredients of the offence under  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_15">Section  304B</a>   have  been
      stated  and  restated  in  many  judgments.   There  are   four   such
      ingredients and they are said to be:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           (a) death of a woman must have  been  caused  by  any  burns  or
           bodily injury or her death must  have  occurred  otherwise  than
           under normal circumstances;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           (b) such death must have occurred  within  seven  years  of  her
           marriage;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">           (c) soon before her death,  she  must  have  been  subjected  to
           cruelty or harassment by her husband  or  any  relative  of  her
           husband; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">           (d) such cruelty or harassment must be in  connection  with  the
           demand for dowry.
</blockquote>



<p id="p_18">      10.   This has been the law stated in the following judgments:
</p>
<p id="p_19">      <a href="/doc/634160/" id="a_16">Ashok Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>, (2010) 12 SCC 350 at  pages  360-361;
      <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_17">Bachni Devi &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a>,  (2011)  4  SCC  427  at  431,
      <a href="/doc/79816183/" id="a_18">Pathan Hussain Basha v. State of  A.P</a>.,  (2012)  8  SCC  594  at  599,
      <a href="/doc/640713/" id="a_19">Kulwant Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, (2013) 4 SCC 177 at  184-<a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_20">185,

      Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (2014) 12 SCC 582 at 583,  <a href="/doc/752705/" id="a_22">Suresh  Singh  v.
      State of Haryana</a>, (2013) 16 SCC 353 at 361,  <a href="/doc/36736141/" id="a_23">Sher Singh  v.  State  of
      Haryana</a>, 2015 1 SCALE 250 at 262.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      11.   This Court has spoken sometimes with divergent  voices  both  on
      what would fall within "dowry" as defined and what  is  meant  by  the
      expression  "soon  before  her  death".   <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_24">In  Appasaheb  v.  State  of
      Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 721, this Court construed the definition  of
      dowry strictly, as it forms part of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_25">Section 304B</a> which is  part  of  a
      penal statute.  The court held that a demand for money  for  defraying
      the expenses of manure made to a young wife who in turn made the  same
      demand to her father would be outside the definition of  dowry.   This
      Court said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "A demand for money on account of some financial  stringency  or
           for meeting some urgent  domestic  expenses  or  for  purchasing
           manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the  said  word
           is normally understood. The evidence adduced by the  prosecution
           does not, therefore, show that any demand for "dowry" as defined
           in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_26">Section 2</a> of the  Dowry  Prohibition  Act  was  made  by  the
           appellants as what was allegedly asked for was  some  money  for
           meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure."  (at  page
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">           727)




</blockquote><p id="p_21">      12.   This judgment was distinguished in at least four other judgments
      (see: <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_27">Bachni Devi v. State of Haryana</a> (2011) 4 SCC 427 at pages 432 to
      434; <a href="/doc/640713/" id="a_28">Kulwant Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, (2013) 4 SCC 177 at page
      185; <a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_29">Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana</a> (2014) 4 SCC 129 at pages  139
      to 141 and <a href="/doc/1907229/" id="a_30">Raminder Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (2014) 12 SCC 582 at page
</p><p id="p_22">      586.  The judgment was, however, followed in <a href="/doc/167568223/" id="a_31">Vipin Jaiswal v. State of
      Andhra Pradesh</a>, (2013) 3 SCC 684 at pages 687-688.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      13.   In order to arrive at the true construction of the definition of
      dowry and consequently the ingredients of the  offence  under  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_32">Section
      304B</a>, we first need to determine how a statute of this kind  needs  to
      be interpreted.  It is  obvious  that  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_33">Section  304B</a>  is  a  stringent
      provision, meant to combat a social evil of alarming proportions.  Can
      it be argued that it is a penal statute  and,  should,  therefore,  in
      case of ambiguity in its language, be construed strictly?
</p>
<p id="p_24">      14.   The answer is to be found in two path-breaking judgments of this
      Court.  <a href="/doc/35536/" id="a_34">In M. Narayanan Nambiar v. State of Kerala</a>, 1963 Supp. (2) SCR
      724, a Constitution Bench of this Court was asked to construe  <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_35">Section
      5(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.  In construing  the
      said Act, a penal statute, Subba Rao,J. stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">           "The preamble indicates that  the  Act  was  passed  as  it  was
           expedient to make more effective provisions for  the  prevention
           of bribery and  Corruption.  The  long  title  as  well  as  the
           preamble indicate that the Act was passed to put down  the  said
           social evil i.e.  bribery  and  corruption  by  public  servant.
           Bribery is form of corruption. The fact that in addition to  the
           word "Bribery" the word "corruption"  is  used  shows  that  the
           legislation was intended to combat also other evil  in  addition
           to  bribery.  The  existing  law  i.e.<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_36">  Penal  Code</a>  was   found
           insufficient to eradicate or even to control the growing evil of
           bribery and corruption  corroding  the  public  service  of  our
           country. The provisions broadly include  the  existing  offences
           under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_37">Sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_38">165</a> of the Indian Penal Code committed by
           public servants and enact a new  rule  of  presumptive  evidence
           against the accused. <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_39">The Act</a>  also  creates  a  new  offence  of
           criminal misconduct by public servants though to some extent  it
           overlaps on the pre-existing offences and  enacts  a  rebuttable
           presumption contrary to the well known  principles  of  Criminal
           Jurisprudence. It also aims to protect  honest  public  servants
           from harassment by prescribing that  the  investigation  against
           them could be made only by police officials of particular status
           and  by  making  the  sanction  of  the  Government   or   other
           appropriate officer a pre-condition for their prosecution. As it
           is a socially useful measure conceived in  public  interest,  it
           should be liberally construed so as to bring about  the  desired
           object, i.e. to prevent corruption among public servants and  to
           prevent harassment of the honest among them.

           is true that all penal statutes are to be strictly construed  in

           prosecute corporate bodies for the offence committed by them  is
           clear and explicit and the statute never intended  to  exonerate
           them from being prosecuted. It is sheer violence to common sense
           that the legislature intended to punish the corporate bodies for
           minor and silly offences and extended immunity of prosecution to
           major and grave economic crimes.

           cohabitate with such woman, in the  purported  exercise  of  his

<p id="p_26">      21.   This Court in <a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_65">Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana</a>  (2014)  4  SCC
      129, had this to say:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">           "17. Thus, the words "soon before" appear in  <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_66">Section  113-B</a>  of
           the Evidence Act, 1872 and also in <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_67">Section 304-B</a>  IPC.  For  the
           presumptions contemplated under these sections  to  spring  into
           action, it is necessary to show that the cruelty  or  harassment
           was caused soon before the  death.  The  interpretation  of  the
           words "soon before" is, therefore, important.  The  question  is
           how "soon before"? This would obviously depend on the facts  and
           circumstances of each case. The cruelty  or  harassment  differs
           from case to case. It relates to the  mindset  of  people  which
           varies from person to person. Cruelty can be mental or it can be
           physical. Mental cruelty is also of different shades. It can  be
           verbal or emotional like insulting or ridiculing or  humiliating
           a woman. It can be giving threats of injury to her or  her  near
           and dear ones. It can be depriving her of economic resources  or
           essential amenities of life. It can be putting restraints on her
           movements. It can be not allowing her to  talk  to  the  outside
           world. The list is illustrative  and  not  exhaustive.  Physical
           cruelty could be actual beating or causing pain and harm to  the
           person of a woman. Every such instance of  cruelty  and  related
           harassment has a different impact on the mind of a  woman.  Some
           instances may be so grave as to  have  a  lasting  impact  on  a
           woman. Some instances  which  degrade  her  dignity  may  remain
           etched in her memory for a long time. Therefore,  "soon  before"
           is a relative term. In matters of emotions we cannot have  fixed
           formulae. The time-lag may differ from case to case.  This  must
           be kept in mind while examining each case of dowry death.

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">           18. In this connection we may refer  to  the  judgment  of  this
           Court in <a href="/doc/1263837/" id="a_68">Kans Raj v. State of Punjab</a> [(2000) 5 SCC  207  :  2000
           SCC (Cri) 935]  where  this  Court  considered  the  term  "soon
           before". The relevant observations are as under: (SCC  pp.  222-
           23, para 15)

               "15. ... 'Soon before' is a relative term which is  required
               to be considered under specific circumstances of  each  case
               and no straitjacket formula can be laid down by  fixing  any
               time-limit. This expression is pregnant  with  the  idea  of
               proximity test. The term 'soon  before'  is  not  synonymous
               with the term 'immediately before' and is  opposite  of  the
               expression 'soon after' as used and  understood  in  <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_69">Section
               114</a>, Illustration (a) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_70">Evidence Act</a>. These words would
               imply that the interval should not be too long  between  the
               time of making the statement and the death. It  contemplates
               the reasonable time which, as earlier  noticed,  has  to  be
               understood and determined under the  peculiar  circumstances
               of each case. In relation to dowry deaths, the circumstances
               showing the  existence  of  cruelty  or  harassment  to  the
               deceased are not restricted to  a  particular  instance  but
               normally refer to a course of conduct. Such conduct  may  be
               spread over a period of time. If the cruelty  or  harassment
               or demand for dowry is shown to have persisted, it shall  be
               deemed to be 'soon before death' if  any  other  intervening
               circumstance showing the non-existence of such treatment  is
               not brought on record, before such alleged treatment and the
               date of death. It does not, however, mean that such time can
               be stretched to any period. Proximate and live link  between
               the  effect  of  cruelty  based  on  dowry  demand  and  the
               consequential  death  is  required  to  be  proved  by   the
               prosecution. The demand  of  dowry,  cruelty  or  harassment
               based upon such demand and the date of death should  not  be
               too remote  in  time  which,  under  the  circumstances,  be
               treated as having become stale enough."

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">           Thus, there must be a nexus between the demand of dowry, cruelty
           or harassment, based upon such demand and the date of death. The
           test of proximity will have to be applied.  But,  it  is  not  a
           rigid test. It depends on the facts and  circumstances  of  each
           case and calls for a pragmatic and  sensitive  approach  of  the
           court within the confines of law."

<p id="p_27">      22.   In another recent judgment in <a href="/doc/36736141/" id="a_71">Sher Singh v.  State  of  Haryana</a>,
      2015 (1) SCALE 250, this Court said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">           "We are aware that the word 'soon' finds place in <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_72">Section  304B</a>;
           but we would prefer to interpret its use not in terms of days or
           months or years, but as necessarily indicating that  the  demand
           for dowry should not be stale or an aberration of the past,  but
           should be the continuing cause for the death under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_73">Section  304B</a>
           or the suicide under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_74">Section 306</a> of the IPC. Once  the  presence
           of these concomitants are established or shown or proved by  the
           prosecution, even by preponderance of possibility,  the  initial
           presumption of innocence is replaced by an assumption  of  guilt
           of the accused, thereupon transferring the heavy burden of proof
           upon him and requiring him to produce  evidence  dislodging  his
           guilt, beyond reasonable doubt." (at page 262)




</blockquote><p id="p_28">      23.   We endorse what has been said by these two  decisions.  Days  or
      months are not what is to be seen.  What must be borne in mind is that
      the word "soon" does not  mean  "immediate".   A  fair  and  pragmatic
      construction keeping in mind the great social evil that has led to the
      enactment of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_75">Section 304B</a> would make it clear that the expression is a
      relative expression.  Time lags may differ from case to case. All that
      is necessary is that the demand for dowry  should  not  be  stale  but
      should be the continuing cause for the  death  of  the  married  woman
      under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_76">Section 304B</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      24.   At this stage, it is important to notice a  recent  judgment  of
      this Court in <a href="/doc/37016566/" id="a_77">Dinesh v. State of Haryana</a>, 2014 (5) SCALE 641 in  which
      the law was stated thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">           "The expression "soon before" is a relative term as held by this
           Court, which is required to be  considered  under  the  specific
           circumstances of each case and no straight jacket formula can be
           laid down by fixing any time of allotment. It can be  said  that
           the term "soon before" is synonyms with  the  term  "immediately
           before". The determination of the period which can  come  within
           term "soon before" is left to be determined by courts  depending
           upon the facts and circumstances of each case." (at page 646)




</blockquote><p id="p_30">      25.   We hasten to add that this is not a correct  reflection  of  the
      law.  "Soon before" is not synonymous with "immediately before".
</p>
<p id="p_31">      26.   The facts of this appeal are glaring.  Demands  for  money  were
      made shortly after one year of the marriage.  A she-buffalo was  given
      by the father to the daughter as a peace offering.  The peace offering
      had no effect.  The daughter was ill-treated. She  went  back  to  her
      father and demanded money again. The father, then, went along with his
      brother and the Sarpanch of the village to the matrimonial home with a
      request that the daughter be not ill-treated on account of the  demand
      for money.  The father also assured the said persons that their  money
      demand would be fulfilled and that they would have to  wait  till  the
      crops of his field are harvested.   Fifteen  days  before  her  death,
      Salwinder Kaur again visited her parents' house on being maltreated by
      her new family. Then came death by poisoning.   The  cross-examination
      of the father  of  Salwinder  Kaur  has,  in  no  manner,  shaken  his
      evidence.  On the facts, therefore, the concurrent  findings  recorded
      by both the courts below are upheld. The appeal is dismissed.
