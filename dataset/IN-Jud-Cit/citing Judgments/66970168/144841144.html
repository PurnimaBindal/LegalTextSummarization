constituted (Gita Mittal, P.S. Teji, JJ.).
</p><p id="p_32">17.     As such these appeals were listed before us on the 19 th
September, 2016. This was at a stage when the paper books were
ready and the appeals were ripe for hearing. On this date, Mr. Anil
Kumar Sharma, learned counsel (appearing for Sajjan Kumar in
Crl.A.No.1099/2013) prayed for an adjournment of the case for the
reason that he wished to file an application seeking recusal from
hearing of these matters by one of us (my learned Brother, P.S.
Teji, J.). In as much as the appearance on 10th September, 2011 in
the case is pertinent, we extract hereunder the complete order dated

      remain a member of the reconstituted Bench was mine, and
      mine alone. The choice that I made, was not of the heart,
      but that of the head. The choice was made by posing two
      questions to myself. Firstly, whether a Judge hearing a
      matter should recuse, even though the prayer for recusal is
      found to be unjustified and unwarranted? Secondly,
      whether I would stand true to the oath of my office, if I

of the judgment in the following terms :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      "57. ... In my considered view, the prayer for my recusal is
      not well founded. If I were to accede to the prayer for my
      recusal, I would be initiating a wrong practice, and laying
      down a wrong precedent. A Judge may recuse at his own,
      from a case entrusted to him by the Chief Justice. That
      would be a matter of his own choosing. But recusal at the
      asking of a litigating party, unless justified, must never to
      be acceded to. For that would give the impression, of the
      Judge had been scared out of the case, just by the force of
      the objection. A Judge before he assumes his office, takes
      an oath to discharge his duties without fear or favour. He
      would breach his oath of office, if he accepts a prayer for
      recusal, unless justified. It is my duty to discharge my
      responsibility with absolute earnestness and sincerity. It is
      my duty to abide by my oath of office to uphold the
      Constitution and the laws. My decision to continue to be a
      part of the Bench, flows from the oath which I took, at the

    ZACC 9] , on an application for recusal of four of the
    Judges in the Constitutional Court. After elaborately
    considering the factual matrix as well as the legal position,
    the Court held as follows: (ZACC para 104)
        "104. ... While litigants have the right to apply for the
        recusal of judicial officers where there is a reasonable
        apprehension that they will not decide a case
        impartially, this does not give them the right to object to
        their cases being heard by particular judicial officers
        simply because they believe that such persons will be
        less likely to decide the case in their favour, than would
        other judicial officers drawn from a different segment
        of society. The nature of the judicial function involves
        the performance of difficult and at times unpleasant
        tasks. Judicial officers are nonetheless required to
        'administer justice to all persons alike without fear,
        favour or prejudice, in accordance with the Constitution
        and the law'. To this end they must resist all manner of
        pressure, regardless of where it comes from. This is the
        constitutional duty common to all judicial officers. If
        they deviate, the independence of the judiciary would be
        undermined, and in turn, the Constitution itself."

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">        "11. In the instant case, we are disposed to think that
        apprehension that has been stated is absolutely mercurial
        and cannot remotely be stated to be reasonable. The learned
        Single Judge has taken an exception to the remarks given by
        the learned trial Judge and also opined about non-
        examination of any witness by him. As far as the first aspect
        is concerned, no exception can be taken to it. The learned
        Sessions Judge, while hearing the application for transfer of
        the case, called for remarks of the learned trial Judge, and
        in such a situation, he is required to give a reply and that he
        has done. He is not expected to accept the allegations made
        as regards his conduct and more so while nothing has been
        brought on record to substantiate the same. The High Court
        could not have deduced that he should have declined to
        conduct the trial. This kind of observation is absolutely
        impermissible in law, for there is no acceptable reason on
        the part of the learned trial Judge to show his
        disinclination. Solely because an accused has filed an
        application for transfer, he is not required to express his
        disinclination. He is required under law to do his duty. He
        has to perform his duty and not succumb to the pressure
        put by the accused by making callous allegations. He is not
        expected to show unnecessary sensitivity to such
        allegations and recuse himself from the case. If this can be
        the foundation to transfer a case, it will bring anarchy in
        the adjudicatory process. The unscrupulous litigants will
        indulge themselves in court hunting. If they are allowed
        such room, they do not have to face the trial before a court

observations on conduct of lawyers and litigants in the court which

<blockquote id="blockquote_60">         "15. Dealing with the conduct of lawyers and litigants in

      Singh</a> [1995 Supp (1) SCC 384] observed: (SCC pp. 403-
      04, para 33)
             "It is most unbefitting for an advocate to make
         imputations against the Judge only because he does not
         get the expected result, which according to him is the
         fair and reasonable result available to him. Judges
         cannot be intimidated to seek favourable orders. Only
         because a lawyer appears as a party in person, he does
         not get a licence thereby to commit contempt of the court
         by intimidating the Judges or scandalising the courts.
         He cannot use language, either in the pleadings or
         during arguments, which is either intemperate or
         unparliamentary. These safeguards are not for the
         protection of any Judge individually but are essential for
         maintaining the dignity and decorum of the courts and
         for upholding the majesty of law. Judges and courts are
         not unduly sensitive or touchy to fair and reasonable
         criticism of their judgments. Fair comments, even if,
         outspoken, but made without any malice or attempting to
         impair the administration of justice and made in good
         faith, in proper language, do not attract any punishment

         for contempt of court. However, when from the criticism
        a deliberate, motivated and calculated attempt is
        discernible to bring down the image of judiciary in the
        estimation of the public or to impair the administration
        of justice or tend to bring the administration of justice
        into disrepute the courts must bestir themselves to
        uphold their dignity and the majesty of law. The
        appellant, has, undoubtedly committed contempt of court
        by the use of objectionable and intemperate language.
        No system of justice can tolerate such unbridled licence
        on the part of a person, be he a lawyer, to permit himself
        the liberty of scandalising a court by casting
        unwarranted, uncalled for and unjustified aspersions on
        the integrity, ability, impartiality or fairness of a Judge
        in the discharge of his judicial functions as it amounts to
        an interference with the due course of administration of
        justice."

    permitted and in the result administration of justice would
    become a casualty and rule of law would receive a setback.
    The Judges are obliged to decide cases impartially and
    without any fear or favour. Lawyers and litigants cannot be
    allowed to "terrorize" or "intimidate" Judges with a view
    to "secure" orders which they want. This is basic and
    fundamental and no civilised system of administration of
    justice can permit it. We certainly, cannot approve of any
    attempt on the part of any litigant to go "forum-shopping".
    A litigant cannot be permitted "choice" of the "forum" and
    every attempt at "forum-shopping" must be crushed with a
    heavy hand.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">        17. At the same time, it is of utmost importance to
    remember that Judges must act as impartial referees and
    decide cases objectively, uninfluenced by any personal
    bias or prejudice. A Judge should not allow his judicial
    position to be compromised at any cost. This is essential

       for maintaining the integrity of the institution and public
      confidence in it. The credibility of this institution rests on
      the fairness and impartiality of the Judges at all levels. It
      is the principle of highest importance for the proper
      administration of justice that judicial powers must be
      exercised impartially and within the bounds of law. Public
      confidence in the judiciary rests on legitimacy of judicial
      process. Sources of legitimacy are in the impersonal
      application by the Judge of recognised objective principles
      which owe their existence to a system as distinguished
      from subjective moods, predilections, emotions and
      prejudices. Judges must always ensure that they do not
      allow the credibility of the institution to be eroded. We
      must always remember that justice must not only be done
      but it must also be seen to be done."

</p><p id="p_68">40.     Before considering the factual submissions, we undertake an
examination of the law placed before us. Let us first and foremost
examine the correctness of the submission of Mr. Vikas Singh,
learned senior counsel that it is sufficient to only allege an
apprehension of bias and therefore, justice would not be done and
the judge must recuse from hearing the case?
</p><p id="p_69">41.     Our attention stands drawn to the pronouncement in AIR
1966 SC 1418, <a href="/doc/351344/" id="a_81">Gurcharan Dass Chadha v. State of Rajasthan</a>. In
this case, the Supreme Court was seized of a petition under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_82">Section
527</a> of the Cr.P.C. for transfer of Criminal Case No.2/1964 pending
against the petitioner in the court of Special Judge, Bharatpur,
Rajasthan to another criminal court of equal or superior jurisdiction
subordinate to High Court other than the High Court of Rajasthan.
The petitioner stated in the petition that he apprehends that he was
"not likely to get a fair, just and impartial trial in the State of
Rajasthan owing to the hostility and influence of the then Law
Minister who was also Minister incharge of Home Department of
the State; the Additional Inspector General of Police, Anti-
Corruption, and the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Ajmer
Range, Jaipur" who would interfere in the trial of the case in the
State of Rajasthan. In para 12 of the judgment the Supreme Court
has noted the allegations underlying the hostility, the relevant
portion whereof reads as follows :

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 34 of 140</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">         "12. This brings us to the question of the merits of the
        petition. The petitioner is being prosecuted for offences
        under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_83">Section 120-B</a>/<a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_84">161</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

        Corruption Act. His apprehension is that the case
        against him is the result of the machination of two
        Police Officers and one Mr Mathura Dass Mathur who
        was the Home Minister in 1962. He also alleges hostility
        on the part of the State Government. He has given
        instances which in his opinion prove that the above two
        officers, the Home Minister and the State Government
        are hostile to him. In relation to the State Government
        he has alleged that when he was appointed Commandant
        of the 8th Batallion of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary
        the State Government down-graded his Post otherwise
        he would have received a higher starting pay. He also
        alleges that his suspension and prosecution were made
        to coincide with his assumption of new duties so that he
        might not be able to join his new post."</blockquote>


<p id="p_70">        In para 13, the appellant gave five instances in which he
apparently crossed the Minister's path giving him room for
annoyance. In regard to the two police officers, he had averred that
the DIG of Police, Ajmer Range and he had differences on three
occasions. He had also given similar instances of hostility towards
him entertained by Sultan Singh, DIG of Police.
</p><p id="p_71">42.     We find that the Supreme Court has laid down that the mere
apprehension that justice would not be done is not sufficient and
that the court has to be satisfied whether the expressed
apprehension is reasonable or not.         We extract hereunder the
observations of the Supreme Court on this important aspect :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">         "13. With regard to the Home Minister Petition he has
        given five instances in which he apparently crossed the
        minister's path and gave him room for annoyance. In
        regard to the two Police Officers he has averred that the
        Deputy Inspector General of Police, Ajmer Range
        (Hanuman Prasad Sharma) and he had some differences
        on three occasions. He has also given similar instances
        of hostility towards him entertained by Sultan Singh,
        Deputy Inspector General of Police. On the basis of
        these he says that he entertains an apprehension that he
        will not receive justice in the State of Rajasthan. The law
        with regard to transfer of cases is well-settled. A case is
        transferred if there is a reasonable apprehension on the
        part of a party to a case that justice will not be done. A
        petitioner is not required to demonstrate that justice
        will inevitably fail. He is entitled to a transfer if he
        shows circumstances from which it can be inferred that
        he entertains an apprehension and that it is reasonable
        in the circumstances alleged. It is one of the principles
        of the administration of justice that justice should not
        only be done but it should be seen to be done. However,
        a mere allegation that there is apprehension that
        justice will not be done in a given case does not suffice.
        The Court has further to see whether the apprehension
        is reasonable or not. To judge of the reasonableness of
        the apprehension the state of the mind of the person who
        entertains the apprehension is no doubt relevant but that
        is not all. The apprehension must not only be
        entertained but must appear to the Court to be a
        reasonable apprehension."

<blockquote id="blockquote_70">         "14. Applying these principles it may be said that there
        is a possibility that the petitioner entertains an
        apprehension that certain persons are hostile to him but
        his apprehension that he will not receive justice in the
        State of Rajasthan is not in our opinion reasonable. All
        the facts which he has narrated bear upon past events in
        his official life. Nothing has been said which will show
        that there is in any manner an interference direct or
        indirect with the investigation of the offences alleged
        against him or the trial of the case before the Special
        Judge, Bharatpur. A general feeling that some persons
        are hostile to the petitioner is not sufficient. There
        must be material from which it can be inferred that the
        persons who are so hostile are interfering or are likely
        to interfere either directly or indirectly with the course
        of justice. Of this there is no trace either in his petition
        or in the arguments which were advanced before us. Nor
        does the petitioner allege anything against the Special
        Judge who is trying the case. In this view of the matter
        we decline to order transfer of the case from the Special
        Judge, Bharatpur. The petition accordingly fails and will

        been called automatic disqualification. That is where the
        judge is shown to have an interest in the outcome of the

        Canal (1852) 3 HL Cas 759 at 793, when orders and
        decrees made by and on behalf of the Lord Chancellor

               it is of the last importance that the maxim that no
               man is to be a judge in his own cause should be
               held sacred. And that is not to be confined to a
               cause in which he is a party, but applies to a
               cause in which he has an interest. Since I have
               had the honour to be Chief Justice of the Court of

    in R. v. Camborne, JJ. ex. p Pearce [(1955) 1 QB 41 at 51]
    the Court, after a review of the relevant cases held that real
    likelihood of bias was the proper test and that a real
    likelihood of bias had to be made to appear not only from
    the materials in fact ascertained by the party complaining,
    but from such further facts as he might readily have
    ascertained and easily verified in the course of his
    inquiries.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_94">        15. The question then is: whether a real likelihood of bias
    existed is to be determined on the probabilities to be
    inferred from the circumstances by court objectively, or,
    upon the basis of the impressions that might reasonably be
    left on the minds of the party aggrieved or the public at
    large.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_95">        16. The tests of "real likelihood" and "reasonable
    suspicion" are really inconsistent with each other. We think
    that the reviewing authority must make a determination on
    the basis of the whole evidence before it, whether a
    reasonable man would in the circumstances infer that
    there is real likelihood of bias. The Court must look at the
    impression which other people have. This follows from the
    principle that justice must not only be done but seen to be
    done. If right minded persons would think that there is real
    likelihood of bias on the part of an inquiring officer, he must
    not conduct the enquiry; nevertheless, there must be a real
    likelihood of bias. Surmise or conjecture would not be
    enough. There must exist circumstances from which
    reasonable men would think it probable or likely that the
    inquiring officer will be prejudiced against the delinquent.
    The Court will not inquire whether he was really prejudiced.
    If a reasonable man would think on the basis of the existing
    circumstances that he is likely to be prejudiced, that is
    sufficient to quash the decision [see per Lord Denning, H.R.

following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">         "71. The principles which emerge from the aforesaid
         decisions are that no man can be a judge in his own
         cause and justice should not only be done, but
         manifestly be seen to be done. Scales should not only be
         held even but they must not be seen to be inclined. A
         person having interest in the subject-matter of cause is
         precluded from acting as a Judge. To disqualify a
         person from adjudicating on the ground of interest in
         the subject-matter of lis, the test of real likelihood of
         the bias is to be applied. In other words, one has to
         enquire as to whether there is real danger of bias on
         the part of the person against whom such
         apprehension is expressed in the sense that he might
         favour or disfavour a party. In each case, the court has
         to consider whether a fair-minded and informed
         person, having considered all the facts would
         reasonably apprehend that the Judge would not act
         impartially. To put it differently, the test would be
         whether a reasonably intelligent man fully apprised of
         all the facts would have a serious apprehension of
         bias. In cases of non-pecuniary bias, the "real
         likelihood" test has been preferred over the

         "reasonable suspicion" test and the courts have
        consistently held that in deciding the question of bias
        one has to take into consideration human probabilities
        and ordinary course of human conduct. We may add
        that real likelihood of bias should appear not only
        from the materials ascertained by the complaining
        party, but also from such other facts which it could
        have readily ascertained and easily verified by making

        considered the issue of disqualification of a Judge on
        the ground of bias and held that in applying the real
        danger or possibility of bias test, it is often appropriate
        to inquire whether the Judge knew of the matter in

        written statement from the Judge. A Judge must recuse
        himself from a case before any objection is made or if
        the circumstances          give rise to automatic
        disqualification or he feels personally embarrassed in
        hearing the case. If, in any other case, the Judge
        becomes aware of any matter which can arguably be
        said to give rise to a real danger of bias, it is generally
        desirable that disclosure should be made to the parties
        in advance of the hearing. Where objection is then
        made, it will be as wrong for the Judge to yield to a

        recusal. Where, following appropriate disclosure by the
        Judge, a party raises no objection to the Judge hearing
        or continuing to hear a case, that party cannot

         viewpoint of this Court or for that matter the Committee.
         It has to be seen from the angle of a reasonable,

which objection must be made at the earliest. It has been held that
silence and delay in making an objection of apprehension of
impartiality and bias on the part of the decision maker would
militate against the bonafides of the objection. Such delay may
lead to an irresistible inference that the petitioner had waived his
right to object to the appointment of respondent no.3 as member of
the Committee; and that such right was personal to him and it was
always open to him to waive the same. We may usefully extract

        whether the circumstances are such as to create a

        and whether the adjudicator was likely to be disposed
        to decide the matter only in a particular way. Public
        policy requires that there should be no doubt about the
        purity of the adjudication process/administration of
        justice. The Court has to proceed observing the minimal
        requirements of natural justice i.e. the Judge has to act
        fairly and without bias and in good faith. A judgment
        which is the result of bias or want of impartiality, is a

        vitiate the judgment/order. Actual proof of prejudice in

        disclosure is appropriate depends in large measure

        hearing has begun, the judge is alerted to some
        matter which might, depending on the full facts, throw
        doubt on his fitness to sit, the judge should in our
        view inquire into the full facts, so far as they are
        ascertainable, in order to make disclosure in the light
        of them. But, if a judge has embarked on a hearing in
        ignorance of a matter which emerges during the
        hearing, it is in our view enough if the judge discloses
        what he then knows. He has no obligation to disclose
        what he does not know. Nor is he bound to fill any
        gaps in his knowledge which, if filled, might provide
        stronger grounds for objection to his hearing or

        make further inquiry and learn additional facts not
        known to him before, then he must make disclosure of

Anr</a>., an objection was raised that one of the appellants in the High
Court was a municipal corporator and the learned judge of the High
Court who passed the impugned order was, whilst practicing at the
Bar, a Standing Counsel for the Municipal Corporation and
therefore, should have recused himself from hearing the appeal. It
was pointed out that in another RFA between different parties, the
learned judge has recused himself on his own from hearing that
RFA. For this reason, it was prayed that the impugned order be set
aside and the matter be remanded back to the High Court for
hearing afresh.       This plea was rejected by the Supreme Court
holding as follows :

      inclined to entertain this plea of the learned counsel for

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_156">             7.1. Firstly, the attention of the learned Judge of
         the High Court should have been invited to the
         relevant facts and there is no reason to hold why the
         learned Judge would not have recused himself, if at
         all a ground for doing so would have been made out
         and if only he would have been alive or made alive to
         such facts. A Judge may not necessarily remember the
         cases in which he had appeared for a party whilst at
         the Bar and in all fairness to the Judge, the parties
         and the learned counsel owe a duty to him to bring to

         his notice such facts as would disable him from
        hearing a case placed before him.

        wherein the learned Judge has recused himself, is
        concerned, we are not satisfied that that has any
        relevance to the present case.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_158">           7.3. On the material placed on record we cannot
        hold that simply because the learned Judge whilst at
        the Bar was a Standing Counsel for the Municipal
        Corporation he is precluded either in law or on
        propriety from hearing any case in which a
        Corporator is a party in his personal capacity; more
        so, when the relevant facts were not brought to his
        notice."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_160">67.     It is well settled that a distinction has to be drawn between a
case where a judge would stand automatically disqualified from
hearing a case.             This has been established by judicial
pronouncement, in a case where the judge is shown to have an
interest in the outcome of the case (para 4 of Locabail)
manifesting the principle that no man can be a judge in his own
cause. Such disqualification is not confined only to a cause in
which the judge is a party but applies to a cause in which he has an
interest.

of case by a judge or authority on the ground that the party
apprehends impartiality or bias upon the judge in fairly deciding
the case.

assertion of apprehension of bias but only apprehension of bias

 which is of substance and could be entertained by a reasonable,
objective, informed and fair minded person having considered all
facts that ought to persuade a judge to recuse from hearing a case.

apprehension of bias must by decided on the facts and
circumstances of the individual case.
</p><p id="p_86">        These are the principles which must guide the consideration
of these applications.

the earliest and carefully scrutinized taking into consideration the
factual matrix of the case from the perspective of a reasonable,
well informed person. The court would test the reasonableness of
the apprehension in delving into the minds of the applicant and
examine the material placed before it, even by calling for a written
report by the judge concerned.
</p><p id="p_88">72.     We may note that in the present case there is no assertion of
bias on the ground that there was any personal or financial interest
in the matter. So what could be an apprehension of bias which
could persuade the sought recusal?

basis of delegation of power by the District &amp; Sessions Judge-I.

District Judge-VII/Additional Sessions Judge on the criminal side.

Apart from this regular functioning, the District &amp; Sessions Judge-

        is pertinent to mention that under the bifurcation
        scheme, District Judge/Additional Sessions Judge of
        particular police district is made the Incharge of
        session cases also. The power has been given to the
        Additional Sessions Judge to deal with the session
        trials, criminal appeals and criminal revisions at the
        end of Additional Sessions Judge, Incharge of that

learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and order dated
25.03.2010 of the learned District Judge-VII/Additional Sessions

the case were made :

<blockquote id="blockquote_183">        "In the light of above mentioned factual position, the
        ground taken in the application that the present court

        as every Additional Sessions Judge is competent to
        try every session trial pertaining to entire area in the
        territorial jurisdiction of Delhi. The arguments
        advanced that this court is not having jurisdiction, is
        without any basis and not acceptable.

taken with regard to competency and jurisdiction of an Additional
Sessions Judge who was also the District Judge and was Incharge

Judge on 01.04.2010. On that date, the convicts Sajjan Kumar,
Brahmand Gupta, Ved Prakash, Peerya, Khushal Singh, Krishan
Khokhar and Bhagmal were present through counsel.
</p><p id="p_119">106. On 01.04.2010, the learned Sessions Judge heard the counsel
for the parties and also went through the records and thereafter
agreed with my reasoning on Delhi being one sessions division and
that any Additional Sessions Judge could try any case which may
be assigned to him by the Sessions Judge but for the reason that the
charge sheet was assigned to the Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate of North East District and the matter was not one under
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_120">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, allocated the matter to the

<p id="p_122">109. The above narration would show that I have not conducted a
single step in the case, not even the formal requirement of getting
the case papers checked. I did not direct the registration of the
case. I did not even take the cognizance in the case, let alone
"apply judicial mind" to the merits of the case or even considered
the matter on merits of the case at any point of time or stage in any
order passed by me.
</p><p id="p_123">110. The trial of the case was never before me. As such I had no
opportunity to do so and have never examined the "prosecution

Gita Mittal, J.
</p>
<p id="p_132">118. I have had the benefit of going through the narration of facts
and reasoning given by my ld. Brother.              While respectfully
agreeing with the same, I wish to add my own reasons which are as
follows.
</p>

<p id="p_133">(i)     Grounds on which the applications are premised

</p><p id="p_134">119. Before considering these applications on merits, it is
necessary first to set out the grounds on which the prayers for
recusal and transfer respectively are premised.
</p><p id="p_135">120. We        first   take     up    Crl.M.A.No.15236/2016     filed   in
Crl.A.No.1099/2016 by Sajjan Kumar. So far as the facts on which
the application is premised, in para 4(e), the applicant refers to the
"order dated 15th of February 2010" containing "observations on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013              Page 76 of 140</span>
 the strength of the chargesheet filed by the CBI and the defence
raised by the applicant" in paras 15 and 16 of the order.
</p><p id="p_136">121. In para 5(f), the applicant states that the learned judge had
"applied his mind to the merits of the case, including the defence
taken by the applicant".
</p><p id="p_137">122. In para 4(g), it is stated that the order on bail has been
"passed after dealing with the merits of the case against the
accused persons including the applicant/respondent and after
examining the material extensively on merits".
</p><p id="p_138">123. In para 5 of the application, it is contended that the facts
relating to the order dated 15th February, 2010 "demonstrate that
the Hon'ble Judge has applied judicial mind to the merits of the
case and has considered several of the main planks of the defence
of the applicant/respondent". On this assertion, it is submitted that
it would not be in consonance with the requirements of a fair
hearing and justice if the same judge hears the matter at the stage
of the appeal. On this, such applicant stated that there is a "real
danger of bias" if the appeal is heard by the same judge.
</p><p id="p_139">124. Interestingly, in para 6, the applicant referred to the stated
facts "demonstrate a real danger of bias and suspicion of bias".
Finally the applicant prays that the learned judge may kindly
recuse himself and the appeals be placed before the Chief Justice
for appropriate orders to secure the ends of justice.
</p><p id="p_140">125. This application is thus premised on the consideration of the
anticipatory bail application and the order dated 15th February,
2010 which were passed by my ld. Brother.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013            Page 77 of 140</span>
<p id="p_141"> 126. So        far     as     the     other   two   applications         being
Crl.M.A.No.15239/2016                 in      Crl.A.No.715/2013           and
Crl.M.A.No.15233/2016 in Crl.A.No.753/2013 filed by Mahender
Yadav and Krishan Khokhar respectively are concerned, we may
note that these applications are identical. Both are captioned as
"Applications u/s <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_122">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for transfer of matter to
another Bench of which Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S. Teji is not a
member". These applications make for an extremely distressing
reading as bald, wild and even false averments have been made
which have no bearing in truth. The same is evident from the
following identical assertions in both the applications :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_195">        "5. That after committal proceedings, the matter was
        committed to court of Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S. Teji, the
        then District Judge-VI, East District instead of to the
        court of District Judge-VII, North East District.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_196">        6.     That since the matter was being committed from
        the court of Sh. Lokesh Kumar Sharma, ACMM, North-
        East District, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi, as such it
        was pointed to the Hon'ble Judge that the matter has
        been wrongly committed to that court whereas it should
        have been committed to the court within whose
        jurisdiction PS Delhi Cantt falls where the alleged
        incident had taken place and it was requested that the
        matter may be transferred to such court."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_142">127. Most reprehensibly, the applicants make the following
further incorrect and baseless assertions :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_197">        "7. That however Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S. Teji with
        predetermined mind to try the matter which pertained
        to 1984 riots, passed a detailed order dated 27.03.2010




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013                Page 78 of 140</span>
         and held that this court is fully competent to try the
        present case. ...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_198">        8.    That the matter was then put up before the District
        &amp; Sessions Judge. Ld. District &amp; Sessions Judge vide
        order dated 01.04.2010 found force in the arguments
        and transferred the case to the court of Ms. Sunita
        Gupta, the .... Copy of the order dated 1.4.2010 is
        annexed herewith as ANNEXURE-D."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_143">128. In paras 9 and 10, the applicants refer to the submission on
his behalf in court on the 19th of September 2016 to the effect that
the applicant would have no objection to the hearing by the present
Bench. We propose to deal with this contention separately.
</p><p id="p_144">129. On the above incorrect and even false factual narration, in
para 10, the applicants Mahender Yadav and Krishan Khokhar also
aver that they have "serious apprehensions" that they would "not
get fair and impartial hearing and would not get justice in case the
matter is heard by the Bench of which Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S.
Teji is a member".
</p><p id="p_145">130. So far as the basis of the apprehension is concerned, that is
to be found in the following assertions in paras 11 and 12 of the
application wherein it is stated thus :
</p><p id="p_146">(i)     Apprehension is based "upon facts that had occurred
during the trial proceedings". (para 11)
</p><p id="p_147">(ii)    While dealing with the bail application of the appellant, the
learned judge "has already given his mind against the appellant".
(para 11)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 79 of 140</span>
</p><p id="p_148"> (iii)   Thereafter vide order dated 27th March, 2010, the learned
judge had "shown his anxiety to conduct the trial of the matter".
(para 11)
</p><p id="p_149">(iv)    The learned judge has made a request to the District and
Sessions Judge to instruct "him to proceed with trial of the matter".
(para 11)
</p><p id="p_150">(v)     "Because of all these orders", a "reasonable apprehension
has crept up" in the applicant's mind that they "will not have fair
or impartial hearing before this Hon'ble Bench". (para 11)
</p><p id="p_151">(vi)    The learned judge being the then Additional Sessions Judge
has "already formed and express an opinion on the facts of the
case which are subject matter of the present appeal in the form of
the bail order". (para 12)
</p><p id="p_152">(vii) The "appeal is an extension of trial". (para 13)
</p><p id="p_153">(viii) Bonafide belief that "serious injustice" would be done to
him. (para 14)
        Premised on the above averments, these two applicants -
Krishan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav have made a prayer to
transfer the matter to the court of Hon'ble the Chief Justice of this
court to transfer the matter to another Bench of which my learned
Brother is not a member.
</p>
<p id="p_154">(ii)    Order on anticipatory bail application dated 15th February,
        2010 - whether a binding adjudication on merits

expressed the apprehension of bias of my ld. Brother premised on

 his having passed the order dated 15th February, 2010 by the six
anticipatory bail applications filed. We therefore, propose to
consider this order first and foremost.            Let us sum up the
observations made by the learned judge in the order.
</p><p id="p_156">132. The order dated 15th February, 2010 deserves to be
considered in some detail.                 We summarize the parawise
observations in the common order dated 15th February, 2010 and
set our observations thereon against them :</p><pre id="pre_7">

Para 16 : Notes the arguments of
the defence and the applicants

 and the complainants who pointed
out that serious allegations had been
levelled.
Para 18 : Notes that the chargesheet
and the order of cognizance show
that that the ACMM considered the
material before him and proceeded
in the matter. The judge notes the
factual position with regard to the
material available on record which
and     what     it    "demonstrates"
regarding the cases.
Para 19 : An analysis has been             While Mr. Vikas Singh,

suggest so.                                had to be examined
                                           during trial. We note

<p id="p_158"> 134. Mr. Vikas Singh, ld. Senior Counsel has staunchly
contended that that the ld. Additional Sessions Judge had taken a
view on the merits of the matter in para 16 of order dated 15th
February, 2010 when he recorded that the Government of India
order may not assist the accused persons in establishing innocence.
</p><p id="p_159">135. The submission however, is erroneous inasmuch as every
court considering a criminal case, in law has to examine the
evidence laid before it in the light of statutory provisions and test
the same on sound and well settled legal principles. It is a well
settled principle of criminal law that the prosecution has to
establish its case beyond reasonable doubt by legal evidence.
</p><p id="p_160">136. A Government order based on material gathered during
investigation cannot in law bind a criminal court seized of the
prosecution of a case which has to decide the case on the basis of
evidence led by the parties.
</p><p id="p_161">137. It is not the case of the applicants before us that such opinion
of the Government would tie the hands of the criminal court and it
must arrive at the same opinion as may have been expressed in a
government order, irrespective of evidence led by the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_162">138. We put it to Mr. Salman Khurshid, ld. Senior Counsel for the
applicant that if such Government order had been to the contrary
i.e. against the accused persons, could the prosecution have
contended that the trial court was bound by it? Ld. Senior Counsel
rightly did not dispute the legal position that a criminal prosecution
has to be tested on the evidence laid before the court and not by
Government opinion.

application of mind or a final view on the trial of the accused.

v. State of Punjab</a> wherein the Supreme Court considered the
factors which a court would keep in mind when deciding an
application for anticipatory bail holding thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_201">        "31. In regard to anticipatory bail, if the proposed

        motive, the object being to injure and humiliate the
        applicant by having him arrested, a direction for the
        release of the applicant on bail in the event of his arrest
        would generally be made. On the other hand, if it
        appears likely, considering the antecedents of the

         applicant, that taking advantage of the order of
        anticipatory bail he will flee from justice, such an order
        would not be made. But the converse of these
        propositions is not necessarily true. That is to say, it
        cannot be laid down as an inexorable rule that
        anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless the proposed
        accusation appears to be actuated by mala fides; and,
        equally, that anticipatory bail must be granted if there is
        no fear that the applicant will abscond. There are
        several other considerations, too numerous to
        enumerate, the combined effect of which must weigh
        with the court while granting or rejecting anticipatory
        bail. The nature and seriousness of the proposed
        charges, the context of the events likely to lead to the
        making of the charges, a reasonable possibility of the
        applicant's presence not being secured at the trial, a
        reasonable apprehension that witnesses will be
        tampered with and "the larger interests of the public or
        the State" are some of the considerations which the
        court has to keep in mind while deciding an application
        for anticipatory bail. The relevance of these
        considerations was pointed out in <a href="/doc/1337799/" id="a_131">State v. Captain Jagjit
        Singh</a>[AIR 1962 SC 253 : (1962) 3 SCR 622 : (1962) 1
        Cri LJ 216] , which, though, was a case under the old

        439</a> of the Code. It is of paramount consideration to
        remember that the freedom of the individual is as
        necessary for the survival of the society as it is for the
        egoistic purposes of the individual. A person seeking
        anticipatory bail is still a free man entitled to the
        presumption of innocence. He is willing to submit to
        restraints on his freedom, by the acceptance of
        conditions which the court may think fit to impose, in
        consideration of the assurance that if arrested, he shall
        be enlarged on bail."

        that, at an earlier stage, their application for bail was
        rejected by this Court on September 7, 1977. But an

        facie concluding why bail was being granted,

        committed a serious offence. The court granting bail has
        to consider, among other circumstances, the factors such
        as (a) the nature of accusation and severity of
        punishment in case of conviction and the nature of
        supporting evidence; (b) reasonable apprehension of

        the court while considering a petition for grant of bail in

               devoid of such reasons would suffer from non-
               application of mind. It is also necessary for the
               court granting bail to consider among other
               circumstances, the following factors also before
               granting bail; they are:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_214">                  (a) The nature of accusation and the severity of
                  punishment in case of conviction and the nature
                  of supporting evidence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_215">                  (b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_219">147. It is therefore, well settled that the consideration at the stage
of bail, no detailed examination of evidence or close examination
of the documentation is effected. The court is not required to
elaborately deal with the merits of the case but the order is passed
on a prima facie consideration. This is to ensure that there is no
prejudging and no prejudice to the accused. It is in the nature of an
interim direction and is certainly not a stage in the trial. It is
equally well settled that any order or observation in a bail order
does not preclude the second application for the same relief.
</blockquote><p id="p_170">148. These principles laid down in these judgments apply equally
to decision making on an application for anticipatory bail as well as
an order passed on an application for anticipatory bail. Therefore,
any observation or order of bail or anticipatory bail is not a final
adjudication on any issue and does not impact consideration of the
matter on merits at any stage in the trial or bind any higher court in
appeal.
</p><p id="p_171">149. Not a single word or statement could be pointed out by
learned Senior Counsels as well as counsel for the applicants in the
order dated 15th February, 2010 passed by my ld. Brother which
could be considered even a binding comment, either on the nature
of the evidence in support of the charge or the circumstances, let
alone an observation which could be held to be a finding on the
merits of the case.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013            Page 93 of 140</span>
<p id="p_172"> 150. A reading of the order dated 15th February, 2010 would
show that the learned District Judge and Additional Sessions Judge
has proceeded extremely cautiously and with self-restraint
refraining from returning any finding on the merits of the case or
any of the allegations.           The learned judge has carefully and
objectively observed that the challans having been filed and
summons having been issued for the appearance of the applicants,
it would be improper to exercise discretion to grant anticipatory
bail and that the applicants were required to appear before the trial
court in response to the summons and the discretion to grant bail
had to be left to the trial court.
</p><p id="p_173">151. In this regard, we may note that <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_145">Section 438</a> of the CrPC
confers concurrent jurisdiction on the High Court as well as
Sessions Court to consider applications for grant of anticipatory
bail.   If an adjudication in a bail application is held to be a
consideration on merits of the matter, an anomalous situation
would arise. An accused person who had been granted anticipatory
bail by the High Court would then rely upon the observations made
in such order of bail to defeat his prosecution before the trial court.
This is certainly not permissible.
</p><p id="p_174">152. Or for that matter, a trial court deciding a bail application
would stand disqualified from proceeding with the trial.
</p><p id="p_175">153. We may also advert to the power of the Appellate Court in
seisen of an appeal against conviction, under <a href="/doc/985477/" id="a_146">Section 389</a> of the
Cr.P.C. providing for an order for suspension of execution of
sentence or the order appealed against, or, if the convict is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013             Page 94 of 140</span>
 confined, he be released on bail.          <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_147">Section 389(1)</a> postulates the
application for such suspension to be filed in the pending appeal.
If the proposition pressed by the applicants was accepted, it would
require judges who have passed orders on applications under
<a href="/doc/1116025/" id="a_148">Section 389(1)</a> of the Cr.P.C. to recuse from hearing the
substantive appeals against the judgments of conviction.
</p><p id="p_176">154. In law therefore, the order dated 15th of February 2010 is a
prima facie view, not "dealing with the merits of the case". It does
not contain any binding finding or observation which could even
remotely tie the hands of the trial court. It does not prohibit even a
subsequent application for anticipatory bail, let alone the appellate
court. It fairly leaves the discretion to grant bail completely to the
trial court.
</p><p id="p_177">155. The order dated 15th February, 2010 is therefore, neither an
application of "judicial mind to the merits of the case, including the
defence" of the applicants. The order does not show that it is
"examining the material extensively on merits". There is nothing
in the order dated 15th of February 2010 which could convey or
create apprehension of bias against the applicants on the part of the
ld. Judge who passed the same, let alone reasonable apprehension
of bias.
</p><p id="p_178">156. Therefore, the pleading that my learned brother has "given
his mind against the appellant" while rejecting the application for
anticipatory bail is premised on a completely misreading of the
order dated 15th February, 2010 and ignorance about the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013               Page 95 of 140</span>
 considerations which must weigh with the court while considering
for grant or rejection of bail.
</p>


<p id="p_179">(iv)    Consideration of a preliminary objection on territorial
        jurisdiction by the order dated 27th March, 2010 - Whether
        tantamount to a "definite view" on the merits of the case

</p><p id="p_180">157. Keeping in view the nature of objections and submissions
made before us, I must elaborate also on the order dated 27th
March, 2010 passed by the District Judge (VI)-cum-ASJ(I/C), East.
The case was for the first time placed before the District Judge-VI
on the 27th of March 2010 in accordance with the order dated 20th
March, 2010 of the ACMM pursuant to the specific directions
dated 25th March, 2010 made by the Ld. District Judge-VII/NE.
This order was thus passed on the very first date when the case was
placed before him.
</p><p id="p_181">158. Barely 42 days after the rejection of the application for
anticipatory bail, the applicants along with the co-accused were
present before the learned Judge on the 27th March, 2010 when
only Shri Bhagmal (the appellant in Crl.A.No.851/2013) filed the
application for transfer on technical grounds. He also did not do so
on any apprehension of bias on the part of the learned Judge. This
application merely stated that the learned Judge did not have
territorial jurisdiction to try the matter on his assessment of
jurisdictions of the criminal court.
</p><p id="p_182">159. On this application, my ld. Brother proceeded to hear
arguments in the presence of the accused persons and fixed the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013          Page 96 of 140</span>
 case at 3:00 pm for orders. The applicants remained present at
3:00 pm on the 27th of March 2010 when the order was passed
which has been extracted by my ld. Brother. There is not the
remotest reference to the merits of the case.
</p><p id="p_183">160. In the order dated 1st April, 2010, the learned Sessions Judge
has agreed with the legal position in the order dated 27th March,
2010 that Delhi was one Sessions division headed by District &amp;
Sessions Judge and any Additional Sessions Judge can try any case
which may be assigned to him by the Sessions Judge, Delhi. It was
noted that however, in the present case, the chargesheet had been
assigned by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to the
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for the North-East
District who had conducted the committal proceedings and that the
case therefore, had to be placed before the Additional Sessions
Judge Incharge of the North-East District, Karkardooma Courts,
Delhi. Consequently, by the order dated 1st April, 2010, the matter
was allocated to the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge
(Incharge) (North-East District) for this reason alone.
</p><p id="p_184">161. So far as the order dated 27th March, 2010 is concerned, we
find that Crl.M.A.No.15236/2016 filed by Sajjan Kumar does not
make any specific objection premised thereon.               However,
inasmuch as Mahender Yadav and Krishan Khokhar in para 11 of
their identical applications have unfairly and wrongly urged that
the order shows "anxiety to conduct the trial".
</p><p id="p_185">162. After the dismissal of the bail application on 15th February,
2010, the applicants before us, along with the co-accused Balwan



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 97 of 140</span>
 Khokhar, Capt. Bhagmal and Giridhari Lal appeared before the
learned ACMM on the 20th of March 2010 when the order of
committal to the same judge was passed in their presence.
</p><p id="p_186">163. No objection at all was raised by these applicants to the
committal of the case to my ld. Brother as District Judge-VI. This
was even though the order dismissing the anticipatory bail stood
passed (on 15th February, 2010), yet based on this very order,
present applications have been made. At no point of time did the
applicants object to my ld. Brother conducting the trial despite the
same.
</p><p id="p_187">164. The applicants also did not object to the order dated 25th
March, 2010 passed by the District Judge-VII/NE/ASJ/KKD
Courts sending the case to my ld. Brother. No application or
appeal was filed.
</p><p id="p_188">165. With regard to hearing of the preliminary objection on 27 th
March, 2010, in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
at AIR 1966 SC 1418, <a href="/doc/351344/" id="a_149">Gurcharan Dass Chadha v. State of
Rajasthan</a>, the following principle has been succinctly set down in
para 5 of the said judgment :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_220">      "5. We shall now take up the objection that this Court
      lacks jurisdiction to transfer the case pending before the
      Special Judge Bharatpur. This objection goes to the root
      of the matter. Questions of inherent jurisdiction must
      always be decided before the merits are considered
      because to dismiss the petition after consideration of
      merits itself involves an assumption of jurisdiction. We
      must accordingly consider the objection even though we
      are satisfied that the petition must fail on merits."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_221">                             (Emphasis by us)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 98 of 140</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_222"> 166. My ld. Brother therefore, had no option but to decide the
application of Capt. Bhagmal before considering the merits of the
case.
</blockquote><p id="p_189">167. It is important to note that only Capt. Bhagmal filed the
application that too premising the same purely on the
inconvenience on account of the physical distance between his
place of residence and the court as well as the fact that the alleged
offence was stated to have been committed in the South-East
District and not within the jurisdiction of any court in the
Karkardooma District Courts. Despite the correct legal position
that Delhi was one Session Division, the case was sent to the
District Judge. Even the District Judge did not agree with the
Bhagmal's application. It was only on account of the fact that the
ACMM had marked the case erroneously to the District Judge of
the East District, even though he (ACMM) himself was from the
North-East District, the learned District Judge had marked the case
to the District Judge (North-East).
</p><p id="p_190">168. The averments in the applications are a deliberate
misrepresentation inasmuch as the anticipatory bail was filed on
10th February, 2010 when the order of committal dated 20th March,
2010 had not been passed.
</p><p id="p_191">169. The above narration shows that the matter was never on the
board of my learned brother and was never dealt with by him. Post
committal, the accused persons had appeared for the first time
when the preliminary objection was taken up, not to his court, but
to the jurisdiction of all courts at Karkardooma and suggesting that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 99 of 140</span>
 the trial should be held in a court having jurisdiction over the
South-West District. The matter was sent to the ld. District &amp;
Sessions Judge without taking the case on board or dealing with it
on merits.
</p><p id="p_192">170. We may note that the applicants did not even support this
objection of Bhagmal in his application. None joined issues with
him.     This fact by itself amply establishes that the present
applications are a mere ploy to delay hearings and do not stem
from any real or reasonable apprehension in the minds of the
applicants.
</p><p id="p_193">171. No such submission ("pointed out") as is set out in para 6
was made. The applicant is clearly mis-stating the facts and has
made insinuations which are most unfortunate and improper. The
learned ACMM who passed the committal order applied his
independent mind. The above narration of facts would show that
my learned Brother has no connection at all with either the passing
of the order by the learned ACMM or the order of learned District
Judge-VII who passed the order on the 25th of March 2010 placing
the matter before him on 27th of March 2010.
</p><p id="p_194">172. As put by Mr. R.S. Cheema, ld Senior Counsel on behalf of
the CBI, on the 27th March, 2010, on a technical plea, an innocuous
order stood passed without dealing with the merits of the case.
</p><p id="p_195">173. The record does not disclose even a suggestion of an
objection by the applicants, let alone, "request" as averred in
para 11.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013          Page 100 of 140</span>
<p id="p_196"> (v)     "Definite opinion on material issues"; "proceedings
        during trial" or "dealt with the matter at the stage of trial"
</p><p id="p_197">        - whether made out?
</p>
<p id="p_198">174. During the course of hearing on these applications, we have
repeatedly asked learned Senior Counsels for the applicant and
learned counsel to point out a single finding on the facts of the case
or on the merits of the case. None could be pointed out. Learned
senior counsel and counsel also were not able to point out "definite
opinion on material issues".               However, merely an oblique
reference to "proceedings during trial" has been made.
</p><p id="p_199">175. Conscious of judicial discipline and fairness in adjudication,
we had made repeated queries to Mr. Vikas Singh, learned counsel
to point out the steps taken as a trial judge in the matter by my
learned Brother which have evoked no response at all. There was
no reference to any order or any provision of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_150">Cr.P.C</a>. Instead,
appearing for Mahender Yadav, Mr. Singh, ld. Senior Counsel, has
in rejoinder, referred to the pronouncement of the Supreme Court
reported at (1996) 4 SCC 127, <a href="/doc/213641/" id="a_151">Union of India &amp; Ors. v. Major
General Madan Lal Yadav (Retrd</a>.). In this case, the court was
concerned with an interpretation of the expression "trial
commenced" under <a href="/doc/1155293/" id="a_152">Section 123(2)</a> of the Army Act, 1950. Charges
for dereliction of duty were laid against the respondent and action
against the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_153">Army Act</a> was initiated against the respondent though
he had retired. It appears that the respondent took various steps to
delay his trial by General Court Martial (GCM) and thereafter
challenged the commencement of the GCM proceedings on the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013               Page 101 of 140</span>
 ground that it had not commenced within six months of his ceasing
to be subject to the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_154">Army Act</a>. The Bombay High Court had issued
a writ in his favour. The Supreme Court was concerned with the
interpretation as to what would be the meaning of the words "trial
commenced" as used in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/755884/" id="a_155">Section 123</a> of the Army
Act and the determination of as to when it commenced. In para 21,
the court observed that the trial before the court martial is deemed
to have commenced the moment the GCM assembles and
examination of the charge is effected.
</p><p id="p_200">176. In para 27, the court referred to Code of Criminal Procedure
and observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_223">        "27. Our conclusion further gets fortified by the scheme
        of the trial of a criminal case under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_156"> the Code</a> of

        considers the committal order under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_164">Section 209</a> by the
        Magistrate and proceeds further. It takes cognizance of
        the offence from that stage and proceeds with the trial.

which reads thus :

</p><p id="p_206">183. It is unfortunate in their applications expressions as "anxiety
to conduct the trial" have been so irresponsibly used by the
applicants. The above narration of facts clearly show that it was
the ld. ACMM who in the committal order directed that the file be
placed before the District Judge-VI. This was followed by the
order dated 25th March, 2010 passed by District Judge-VII/NE
District directing that the case be placed before the learned District
Judge-VI. It so came to be listed before the learned judge. The
applicants would point out the use of the expression "to issue

 instructions to proceed with the matter" in the order dated 27th of
March 2010 support their assertions of "anxiety to conduct trial".
</p><p id="p_207">184. This submission is made in ignorance of the position of the
court record. There is no request made in the order dated 27 th
March, 2010 that instructions were to be issued to my ld. Brother
to proceed with the matter. The use of the expressions reflect only
a polite term or phrase. In effect, the matter was sent to the ld.
District Judge for appropriate marking of the case as per the
practice. This is manifested from the fact that the case was sent
without any direction to register the case on the Board of ld.
District Judge-VI.
</p><p id="p_208">185. In this regard, we may borrow the words of my ld. Brother S.
Ravindra Bhatt, J. in (2015 (220) DLT 446, <a href="/doc/173085785/" id="a_179">All India Institute of
Medical Sciences v. Prof. Kaushal K. Verma</a> where he held thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_228">      "25. ...If one may add, the greater the experience of the
      judge, the more acutely she or he is aware of her or his
      fallibility and the pitfalls of acting on impulse or prejudice.
      The journey, which begins with certainty, later leads to a
      path of many grey areas. Given that language itself is an
      imperfect medium, words are but vessels giving shape to
      ideas and that no human being is perfect, no judge can
      claim to be perfect in communicating ideas. The emphasis
      on a phrase here or an expression there, bereft of anything
      more, would not ipso facto disclose a predilection, or pre-
      disposition to decide in a particular manner."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_229">                            (Emphasis by us)

        Therefore, the mere use of the expressions "instructions to
proceed" in the order dated 27th March, 2010 is immaterial. The
direction was for appropriate marking of the case. The same is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013             Page 105 of 140</span>
 amply manifested from the fact that my ld. Brother did not even
register the case on his board.
</blockquote><p id="p_209">186. The proceedings conducted by my Ld. Brother reflect utmost
fairness and objectivity and there is not the remotest expression of
"anxiety to conduct trial". The applicants were satisfied if the trial
was before my ld. Brother. In filing these applications and making
the submissions, the applicants overlook that if he was so
predetermined, after recording the correct legal position on 27th
March, 2010 that Delhi was one Sessions Division, District Judge-
VI could have ordered registration of the case and proceeded to
trial. This was not done.
</p><p id="p_210">187. Despite making innuendos suggestions and improper
suggestions before us in court that the learned judge must recuse
from hearing the appeals, no factual basis of the allegations made
in the application could be pointed out.
</p><p id="p_211">188. What         is   astounding          is   that   applications    asserting
apprehensions of bias and alleging deep interest in the case by a
judge have been drafted and filed without even inspecting the trial
court record. During the course of hearing, we repeatedly put the
query to learned counsel as to what was the stage at which the
matter was placed on 27th March, 2010 before the Sessions Court
concerned? This could not be answered by Mr. Vikas Arora, ld.
counsel on record in the application Crl.M.A.Nos.15233/2016 and
15239/2016 (of Mahender Yadav and Krishan Khokhar) who was
clueless about the same. We were informed that he needed to
inspect the record before he could answer our query. It is evident



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013                     Page 106 of 140</span>
 therefore, that these allegations have been so irresponsibly made
which have no basis in judicial record.
</p><p id="p_212">189. To our utter consternation, during the course of hearing, Mr.
Vikas Singh, learned Senior Counsel submitted that it was not his
client's objection to the hearing by my learned Brother for the
reason that he belongs to the Sikh community, but was expressing
apprehensions otherwise. This aspect had not even remotely
touched our minds. In so saying, in essence, Mr. Vikas Singh, ld.
Senior Counsel may have spoken about the proverbial "elephant in
the room" so far as his client is concerned.
</p><p id="p_213">190. Despite deep misgivings, we are compelled to note the same
because it was peremptorily made in a crowded court room and
would create a very wrong impression if left unnoticed.
</p><p id="p_214">191. The imputation has been made in para 7 of the applications
that the learned judge was working with a "pre-determined mind to
try the matter which pertains to 1984 riots" which we find is
completely baseless and stems from a figment of the applicant's
imagination.
</p><p id="p_215">        The suggestion to this effect completely overlooks the
independence of a judicial mind, trained to impartially and
fearlessly enforce the constitutional values inter alia enshrining
justice, liberty, equality, fraternity and the law uninfluenced by
any considerations, completely rising above personal predilections
or preferences. Judges know no caste, colour, community, creed or
gender and are ordained to discharge judicial duty impartially




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013          Page 107 of 140</span>
 ensuring equal justice to all. Inability to do so by us would be
violative of our oath of office.
</p><p id="p_216">192. To say the least, the foregoing averments are most
unfortunate, uncalled for and completely unfounded.                       The
assertions are a deliberate attempt to mislead and prejudice and
there is no reasonable apprehensions of bias at all, let alone real
apprehension. In the given facts, there can be no suspicion of bias
even. These applications are therefore, completely devoid of merit.
</p>
<p id="p_217">(vi)    When can an order in a case be treated as expressing a
        final opinion or definite opinion on issues arising therein
        justifying transfer of the case?
</p>
<p id="p_218">193. Two        of    the    applications    (Crl.M.No.15233/2016         and
Crl.M.No.15239/2016) placed before us seek an order by us for
transfer of their appeal to another Bench on the ground that a
definite view i.e. a final opinion stands taken by my learned
Brother in the orders aforesaid.            Despite repeated queries, the
applicants were unable to place any standards on which these
orders would require to be tested and it could be held that they
constituted a final opinion on the subject matter raised in it.
</p><p id="p_219">194. On this aspect, Mr. R.S. Cheema, ld. Senior Counsel has
placed the relevant extract from Vol.III, Part-A of Chapter XXVII
of the Delhi High Court Rules and Orders. This Chapter provides
the power of the High Court to transfer the cases under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_180">Section 526</a>
of the earlier<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_181"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> (<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_182">Section 407</a> of the new<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_183">

 another, on grounds specified therein. So far as grounds on which
the applications for transfer may be made, our attention is drawn to
Rule 7 onwards therein.
</p><p id="p_220">195. We extract hereafter Rules 7 and 10 which have been placed
before us by Mr. Cheema, learned Senior Counsel. Let us first
look at Rule 7 which places the grounds on which transfer of a case
may be sought :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_230">        "7. Common grounds on which applications for
        transfer are made--Applications for transfer of
        criminal cases are frequently made by accused persons
        on the allegation that such transfer is necessary in the
        interest of justice. The most common grounds on which
        such applications for transfer are made are (a) that the
        Judge or Magistrate is personally interested in the case,
        or (b) that he is connected with one or the other party to
        the case by relationship, friendship, etc., and is
        therefore, likely to be partial, or (c) that he has already
        formed or expressed an opinion on the subject matter of
        the enquiry or trial, or (d) that he has conducted himself
        in such a manner that no fair or impartial enquiry or
        trial can be expected from him.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_231">             xxx                        xxx                 xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_232">        10. Cases in which Magistrate has already expressed
        his opinion--The same course would be advisable in
        cases in which the Judge or Magistrate has already
        formed and expressed a definite opinion on the material
        issues requiring decisions, against the accused
        concerned."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_221">196. In the present case, a prayer for transfer of the case from this
Bench is sought.         Though no rules on this issue qua criminal




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013             Page 109 of 140</span>
 appeals are pointed out but the principles and standards laid down
in the above rules would provide guidance to our consideration.
</p><p id="p_222">197. The above narration of contents of the application and the
orders shows that the applicants do not assert the grounds of Rule
7(a) to (c) but suggest that they have apprehension that my ld.
Brother would not conduct a fair or impartial inquiry and that a
definite opinion on the material issues requiring decisions against
the accused stands formed and expressed.
</p><p id="p_223">198. We have noted above the well settled legal position that an
order of anticipatory bail is made at the investigation stage when a
person is apprehending arrest in a non-bailable offence. The law
discussed above amply manifests that an order of bail post arrest is
an interlocutory order, not based on evaluation of evidence that is a
scrutiny of whether the prosecution has proved a case against an
accused beyond reasonable doubt or not.
</p><p id="p_224">199. The second order dated 27th March, 2010 also does not take
any view at all regarding the merits of the case. The same is
inconsequential qua the applicants as it was not passed on
applications filed by them. It also does not press any "opinion on
the subject matter of enquiry or trial nor does it reflect formation
or expression of a definite opinion on the material issues requiring
decisions against the accused". The prayer for transfer of these
cases is completely unfounded and not tenable in law.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 110 of 140</span>
<p id="p_225"> (vii) Whether assertion that "dealt with case/trial" borne out by
      record?
</p>
<p id="p_226">200. In the present case, the applicants have made blanket
allegations that my Learned Brother has "dealt with the case/trial"
and therefore, must recuse from hearing the appeals. Even if it
could be so held, is it necessary to recuse?
</p><p id="p_227">201. In support of this submission, Mr. Vikas Singh, ld. Senior
Counsel has placed an order dated 7th April, 2011 passed in
Crl.A.No.753-<a href="/doc/138575974/" id="a_184">55/2009, State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh
Bhullar</a> when a learned judge recused from hearing the matter.
The order discloses no reasons for the recusal. Learned senior
counsel would inappropriately rely upon an internet report to
explain reasons.        It is certainly not open to parties to furnish
reasons for a judicial order.
</p><p id="p_228">        In the case in hand, there nothing to this effect has been
pointed out.
</p><p id="p_229">202. It is well settled that "the only thing in judge's decision
binding as an authority upon the subsequent judge is the principle
upon which the case was decided (Ref. : (1989) 1 SCC 101,
<a href="/doc/327169/" id="a_185">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur</a>)
</p><p id="p_230">203. Learned Senior Counsel has further placed (2007) 10 SCC
491, <a href="/doc/11545034/" id="a_186">Kuldeep Singh v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. wherein a reference
was made to one of the judges who was part of the Division Bench
which passed the impugned order having considered the matter as a
Single Judge. The court has noted the following submission of the

 respondent on this objection in para 7 of the judgment which is
reproduced hereunder :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_233">        "7. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that
        the appellant had not pointed out at any point of time
        before the Division Bench that Justice Kaul had earlier
        dealt with the matter and, therefore, it will not be open
        to the appellant to make a grievance. It was submitted
        that Justice Kaul had not passed the final order and,
        therefore, the order does not call for any interference,
        particularly when there is no merit in the appeal."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_231">204. The Supreme Court considered the precedent reported at
(1998) 9 SCC 677, <a href="/doc/578313/" id="a_187">S.K. Warikoo v. State of J&amp;K &amp; Ors</a>. and
finally held thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_234">        "11. It cannot be laid as a rule of universal application
        that whenever any learned Single Judge had dealt with
        a case even for routine purposes like issue of process
        or rectification of defect or even to pass an order of
        adjournment, that would preclude him from hearing
        the appeal. As contended by the respondents, the
        appellant has not made out a case to interfere. Though it
        is factually correct, as contended, the learned Single
        Judge had issued rule, that factual aspect does not
        appear to have been brought to notice of the Division
        Bench. But the final view expressed by the learned
        Single Judge on merit as affirmed by the Division
        Bench does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant
        interference."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_235">                          (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_236">205. The principles laid down by the Supreme Court in para 11
above supports the very fair stand of Mr. Salman Khurshid, learned
Senior Counsel before us who has repeatedly stated before us that

 merely because a case may have been touched by a judge, it would
not prohibit him from dealing with the appeal therefrom. We,
however, completely disagree with ld. Senior Counsel's objection
that there is anything in order dated 15 th February, 2010 which
could be treated as a final or definite view.
</blockquote><p id="p_232">206. No view on merits at all has been taken at all. The fact that
the matter was listed before my ld. Brother on 27th March, 2010 or
that he passed the order dated 15th February, 2010, on the
anticipatory bail application in my view does not prohibit or
preclude him from dealing with the present appeal.
</p><p id="p_233">207. For the above reasons we also find unacceptable, in fact
reprehensible, the submission on behalf of the applicants that the
hearing before this Bench would entail the hearing by a judge of an
appeal in a matter in which he had been a trial judge.
</p><p id="p_234">208. The view that we have taken is supported by the
observations of the Supreme Court in (2016) 5 SCC 808, Supreme
Court Advocate on <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_188">Record Association v. Union of India</a>. While
concerned with the right to waive the objection to disqualify
adjudicator, in para 30, the court has laid down that who can object
as well as when such objection would be tenable in the following
terms :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_237">    "30.      ...In our opinion, the implication of the above
    principle is that only a party who has suffered or is likely
    to suffer an adverse adjudication because of the possibility
    of bias on the part of the adjudicator can raise the
    objection."

          Therefore, it is amply clear that it is "adverse adjudication"</blockquote>
<p id="p_235">that is a binding decision on merits on an issue alone, which would
justify a prayer for recusal against a judge. Procedural orders or
interim order would not give rise to reasonable apprehensions of
bias.
</p><p id="p_236">209. We find that judicial precedents from England have pointed
out that simply because a judge has previously heard or decided a
case would not by itself preclude him from hearing the subsequent
cause.
</p><p id="p_237">210. On this issue, we may usefully extract the factors in the
opinion of the court of appeal in the judgment reported at (2001) 1
All ER 65, <a href="/doc/47824259/" id="a_189">Locabail (UK) Ltd v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.,
the court has made an attempt to lift some factors which may or
may not give rise to a real danger of bias. In para 25, we see the
following enunciation :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_239">         "25. It would be dangerous and futile to attempt to
         define or list the factors which may or may not give rise
         to a real danger of bias. Everything will depend on the
         facts, which may include the nature of the issue to be
         decided. We cannot, however, conceive of circumstances
         in which an objection could be soundly based on the
         religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, age, class,
         means or sexual orientation of the judge. Nor, at any
         rate ordinarily, could an objection be soundly based on
         the judge's social or educational or service or
         employment background or history, nor that of any
         member of the judge's family; or previous political
         associations; or membership of social or sporting or
         charitable bodies; or Masonic associations; or previous
         judicial decisions; or extra-curricular utterances



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013             Page 114 of 140</span>
         (whether in textbooks, lectures, speeches, articles,
        interviews, reports or responses to consultation papers);
        or previous receipt of instructions to act for or against
        any party, solicitor or advocate engaged in a case
        before him; or membership of the same Inn, circuit,
        local Law Society or chambers (see <a href="/doc/185390/" id="a_190">K.F.T.C.I.C. v. Icori
        Estero S</a>.p.A. (Court of Appeal of Paris, 28 June 1991,
        International Arbitration Report, vol. 6, 8/91)). By
        contrast, a real danger of bias might well be thought to
        arise if there were personal friendship or animosity
        between the judge and any member of the public
        involved in the case; or if the judge were closely
        acquainted with any member of the public involved in
        the case, particularly if the credibility of that individual
        could be significant in the decision of the case; or if, in a
        case where the credibility of any individual were an
        issue to be decided by the judge, he had in a previous
        case rejected the evidence of that person in such
        outspoken terms as to throw doubt on his ability to
        approach such person's evidence with an open mind
        on any later occasion; or if on any question at issue in
        the proceedings before him the judge had expressed
        views, particularly in the course of the hearing, in such
        extreme and unbalanced terms as to throw doubt on his
        ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind
        (see Vakauta v. Kelly (1989) 167 C.L.R. 568); or if, for
        any other reason, there were real ground for doubting
        the ability of the judge to ignore extraneous
        considerations, prejudices and predilections and bring
        an objective judgment to bear on the issues before him.
        The mere fact that a judge, earlier in the same case or
        in a previous case, had commented adversely on a
        party or witness, or found the evidence of a party or
        witness to be unreliable, would not without more found
        a sustainable objection. In most cases, we think, the
        answer, one way or the other, will be obvious. But if in
        any case there is real ground for doubt, that doubt
        should be resolved in favour of recusal. We repeat:

      in the application

</p><p id="p_256">222. We must hereunder set down the impact of filing of these
applications on the main and connected appeals. These applicants
are conscious that at present there is only one Division Bench in
the Delhi High Court which has been assigned hearing of criminal
appeals including life sentences and the death penalty. Therefore,
the recusal of hearing by either of us would entail either creation of
a special bench by Hon'ble the Chief Justice which would then
hear these maters only on Fridays as per practice. Or assignment
of these appeals to a Bench which is seized of other jurisdictions.
Either way, the applicants would have succeeded in their intention
of preventing expedition in hearing of these appeals.
</p><p id="p_257">223. We may point out that there was no prohibition to our
segregating the three appeals of the applicants on 19th September,
2016, and proceeding with the hearings in the other appeals
wherein counsels and parties were pressing for urgent hearing. But
the view we would have taken would have bound the consideration
of these three appeals as all the cases arise from one trial and assail
the same judgment. It was because of our sense of ensuring justice
that hearing the appeals where no applications were filed, stands
deferred.

<p id="p_258"> IX.     Effect of statement dated 19th September, 2016 by counsels
        for Mahender Yadav and Krishan Khokhar

</p><p id="p_259">224. We have extracted hereinabove the order recorded in the
hearing before us on 19th September, 2016, when adjournment was
sought by Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma, Advocate on behalf of Sajjan
Kumar to file the application for recusal. We had specifically asked
all the other private parties, which included Balwan Khokhar, Capt.
Bhagmal, Giridhari Lal as well as counsel for the CBI and the
complainant as to whether they had any objection on hearing the
matters by the Bench as presently constituted.        The counsels
appearing for all these parties including counsel for Mahender
Yadav and Krishan Khokhar had stated that they had no objection
if this Bench continues to hear the matter.
</p><p id="p_260">225. Despite the above statement made on behalf of Mahender
Yadav and Krishan Khokhar on the 19th of September 2016, these
applications (Crl.M.A.Nos.15239/2016 and 15233/2016)                have
been filed by Mahender Yadav and Krishan Khokhar which are
presently being considered.
</p><p id="p_261">226. We had questioned the counsels about the maintainability of
these applications given the statement made on 19th September,
2016 and were orally informed that the appellants have never
consented to the grant of such concessions and the counsels had no
authority to make the statements.
</p><p id="p_262">227. The authority to conduct any case is granted under a
document called the vakalatnama and it would remain the same, be
it a civil or a criminal case.
</p>

<p id="p_263"> 228. In this regard, we have perused the identical vakalatnamas
executed by these applicants (Mahender Yadav and Krishan
Khokhar). Mahender Yadav has executed a vakalatnama dated
24th May, 2013 signed by him authorizing his counsel Mr. Vikram
Singh Panwar, Advocate. A vakalatnama dated 29th May, 2013
has been signed and executed by Krishan Khokhar authorizing the
same counsel Mr. Vikram Singh Panwar, Advocate who was
present on behalf of both the applicants on the 19th of September
2016.
</p><p id="p_264">229. Both these vakalatnamas contain the following conditions :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_242">               "... To withdraw or compromise the said case or

<p id="p_265">230. Light is shed on the power of the counsel to make a binding
submission on behalf of the respondent by virtue of the
vakalatnama by the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the
judgment reported at (2015) 5 SCC 747, Y. Sleebachen &amp; Ors. v.
State of Tamil Nadu Through Superintending Engineer Water




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 121 of 140</span>

wherein the court was concerned with the power of counsel to enter
into a compromise/settlement on behalf of a client in a civil case.
</p><p id="p_266">231. In this judgment, the Supreme Court has ruled in the context
of a settlement in a civil case under Order XXIII Rule 3 of the
CPC. The principles laid down by the court on the aspect of
authority conferred by the vakalatnama would guide our
consideration in a criminal case as well. We therefore, extract
hereunder the consideration of the Supreme Court in paras 18
and 20 wherein judicial precedent with regard to the authority of a
counsel to do various acts :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_245">       "18. That apart, we find that as per the provisions of
    Order 3 Rule 4, once the counsel gets power of
    attorney/authorisation by his client to appear in a matter, he
    gets a right to represent his client in the court and conduct
    the case. ...

    Pleader was legally entitled to enter into a compromise
    with the appellant and his written endorsement on the
    memo filed by the appellant can be deemed as a valid
    consent of the respondent itself. Hence the counsel
    appearing for a party is fully competent to put his
    signature to the terms of any compromise upon which a
    decree can be passed in proper compliance with the
    provisions of Order 23 Rule 3 and such decree is perfectly

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_249"> 232. We may also usefully refer hereunder para 25 of the
pronouncement reported at (2011) 8 SCC 679, Bakshi Dev Raj (2)
v. Sudheer Kumar :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_250">           "25. Now, we have to consider the role of the counsel
        reporting to the court about the settlement arrived at. We
        have already noted that in terms of Order 23 Rule 3
        CPC, agreement or compromise is to be in writing and
        signed by the parties. The impact of the above provision
        and the role of the counsel has been elaborately dealt
        with by this Court in Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union
        Bank of India [Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank
        of India, (1992) 1 SCC 31] and observed that courts in
        India have consistently recognised the traditional role of
        lawyers and the extent and nature of implied authority to
        act on behalf of their clients. Mr Ranjit Kumar, has
        drawn our attention to the copy of the vakalatnama
        (Annexure R-3) and the contents therein. The terms
        appended in the vakalatnama enable the counsel to
        perform several acts on behalf of his client including
        withdraw or compromise suit or matter pending before
        the court. The various clauses in the vakalatnama
        undoubtedly gives power to the counsel to act with
        utmost interest which includes to enter into a
        compromise or settlement.

    case [(1992) 1 SCC 31] , SCC pp. 46-47)
           "37. We may, however, hasten to add that it will be
       prudent for counsel not to act on implied authority



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013            Page 123 of 140</span>
         except when warranted by the exigency of circumstances
        demanding immediate adjustment of suit by agreement
        or compromise and the signature of the party cannot be
        obtained without undue delay. In these days of easier
        and quicker communication, such contingency may
        seldom arise. A wise and careful counsel will no doubt
        arm himself in advance with the necessary authority
        expressed in writing to meet all such contingencies in
        order that neither his authority nor integrity is ever
        doubted. This essential precaution will safeguard the
        personal reputation of the counsel as well as uphold the
        prestige and dignity of the legal profession.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_254">            38. Considering the traditionally recognised role of
        counsel in the common law system, and the evil sought
        to be remedied by Parliament by the CPC (Amendment)
        Act, 1976, namely, attainment of certainty and
        expeditious disposal of cases by reducing the terms of
        compromise to writing signed by the parties, and
        allowing the compromise decree to comprehend even
        matters falling outside the subject-matter of the suit, but
        relating to the parties, the legislature cannot, in the
        absence of express words to such effect, be presumed to
        have disallowed the parties to enter into a compromise
        by the counsel in their cause or by their duly authorised
        agents. Any such presumption would be inconsistent
        with the legislative object of attaining quick reduction of
        arrears in court by elimination of uncertainties and
        enlargement of the scope of compromise.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_255">            39. To insist upon the party himself personally
        signing the agreement or compromise would often
        cause undue delay, loss and inconvenience, especially
        in the case of non-resident persons. It has always been
        universally understood that a party can always act by
        his duly authorised representative. If a power-of-
        attorney holder can enter into an agreement or
        compromise on behalf of his principal, so can counsel,
        possessed of the requisite authorisation by
        vakalatnama, act on behalf of his client. Not to

       inconvenience and loss to the parties personally, but
       also to delay the progress of proceedings in court. If the

       change, even at the risk of delay, inconvenience and
       needless expenditure, it would have expressly so

    power to make a statement on instructions from the party
    to withdraw the appeal. In that case, Respondent 1 therein,
    elder brother of the petitioner filed a suit for declaration
    against the petitioner and three brothers that the decree
    dated 4-5-1990 was null and void which was decreed by the
    Subordinate Judge, Hoshiarpur on 29-9-1993. The
    petitioner therein filed an appeal in the Court of the
    Additional District Judge, Hoshiarpur. The counsel made a
    statement on 15-9-1995 that the petitioner did not intend to
    proceed with the appeal. On the basis thereof, the appeal
    was dismissed as withdrawn. The petitioner challenged the
    order of the appellate court in the revision. The High Court
    confirmed the same which necessitated the filing of SLP
    before this Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_258">       29. The learned counsel for the petitioner in Jagtar

    admitting the appeal has no power to dismiss the same as
    withdrawn except to decide the matter on merits
    considering the legality of the reasoning of the trial court
    and the conclusions either agreeing or disagreeing with it.
    Rejecting the said contention, the Court held as under:

       as withdrawn except to decide the matter on merits
       considering the legality of the reasoning of the trial

       Order 3 Rule 4 CPC empowers the counsel to continue
       on record until the proceedings in the suit are duly
       terminated. The counsel, therefore, has power to make a
       statement on instructions from the party to withdraw the
       appeal. The question then is whether the court is
       required to pass a reasoned order on merits against the
       decree appealed from the decision of the Court of the
       Subordinate Judge? Order 23 Rules 1(1) and (4) give
       power to the party to abandon the claim filed in the suit
       wholly or in part. By operation of Section 107(2) CPC,
       it equally applies to the appeal and the appellate court
       has coextensive power to permit the appellant to give up
       his appeal against the respondent either as a whole or
       part of the relief. As a consequence, though the appeal
       was admitted under Order 41 Rule 9, necessarily the
       court has the power to dismiss the appeal as withdrawn
       without going into the merits of the matter and deciding
       it under Rule 11 thereof.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_259">           4. Accordingly, we hold that the action taken by the
       counsel is consistent with the power he had under Order
       3 Rule 4 CPC. If really the counsel has not acted in the
       interest of the party or against the instructions of the
       party, the necessary remedy is elsewhere and the
       procedure adopted by the court below is consistent with
       the provisions of CPC. We do not find any illegality in
       the order passed by the Additional District Judge as
       confirmed by the High Court in the revision."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_260">       30. The analysis of the above decisions make it clear
    that the counsel who was duly authorised by a party to
    appear by executing the vakalatnama and in terms of Order
    3 Rule 4, empowers the counsel to continue on record until
    the proceedings in the suit are duly terminated. The
    counsel, therefore, has the power to make a statement on

     instructions from the party to withdraw the appeal. In such
    a circumstance, the counsel making a statement on
    instructions either for withdrawal of appeal or for
    modification of the decree is well within his competence
    and if really the counsel has not acted in the interest of the
    party or against the instructions of the party, the necessary

practitioner to exercise the power and authority conferred under the

    and to express grave concern over the fact that lately such
    tendencies and practices are on the increase. We have come
    across instances where one would simply throw a stone on
    a Judge (who is quite defenceless in such matters!) and
    later on cite the gratuitous attack as a ground to ask the
    Judge to recuse himself from hearing a case in which he
    would be appearing. Such conduct is bound to cause deep
    hurt to the Judge concerned but what is of far greater
    importance is that it defies the very fundamentals of
    administration of justice. A motivated application for

    one matter which has caused us considerable concern and
    we wish to advert to it. After the recount had been ordered
    by the learned Single Judge in the High Court and the
    Deputy Registrar had carried out the inspection of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013          Page 129 of 140</span>
     ballot papers of the specified booths, the appellant filed an
    application in the High Court under Section 151 CPC
    seeking stay of the further arguments to enable the
    appellant to move the Supreme Court. In the said
    application the appellant referred to certain 'observations'
    made by the learned Judge during the course of arguments
    and also referred to the manner in which the two packets
    containing ballot papers which had been objected to by
    both the parties and had been kept for scrutiny of the
    learned Single Judge, were handled by the learned Judge.
    The appellant went on to say that 'by doing this the Hon'ble
    Court was pleased to make these ballot papers suspect and
    doubtful and these cannot be considered for any decision on
    them regarding their validity or otherwise as these
    remained in unsealed condition for unascertainable time
    without the petitioner or his counsel being present there'.
    The learned Judge by his order dated 13-5-1993 recorded
    the following proceedings:

           the petitioner himself has made a request that he

           transfer of the election petition from this Court. In
           view of this statement, the petition is being
           adjourned. The petitioner wants to place as
           application for transfer on record. He may file it in
           the Registry, if so advised.

           sealed envelopes relating to Polling Booths Nos. 28
           and 31 had been opened in the presence of the
           parties and their counsel at the time when the report
           of the Commissioner who carried out test checking
           was being considered. These open envelopes had
           remained in my custody in my almirah under lock

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_269">             33. Thereafter, the appellant as already noticed, filed
        a transfer petition in this Court which was dismissed on
        30-8-1993. The transfer petition like the application
        (supra) cast aspersions on the learned Judge in the
        discharge of his judicial functions and had the
        tendency to scandalise the Court. It was an attempt to
        browbeat the learned Judge of the High Court and
        cause interference in the conduct of a fair trial. Not
        only are the aspersions derogatory, scandalous and
        uncalled for but they also tend to bring the authority
        and administration of law into disrespect. The contents
        of the application seeking stay as also of the transfer
        petition, bring the court into disrepute and are an
        affront to the majesty of law and offend the dignity of
        the court. The appellant is an advocate and it is painful
        that by filing the application and the petition as a party
        in person, couched in an objectionable language, he
        permitted himself the liberty of indulging in an action,
        which ill behoves him and does little credit to the noble
        profession to which he belongs. An advocate has no
        wider protection than a layman when he commits an act
        which amounts to contempt of court. It is most
        unbefitting for an advocate to make imputations against
        the Judge only because he does not get the expected
        result, which according to him is the fair and reasonable
        result available to him. Judges cannot be intimidated to
        seek favourable orders. Only because a lawyer appears
        as a party in person, he does not get a license thereby to
        commit contempt of the court by intimidating the Judges
        or scandalising the courts. He cannot use language,
        either in the pleadings or during arguments, which is
        either intemperate or unparliamentary. These
        safeguards are not for the protection of any Judge
        individually but are essential for maintaining the dignity
        and decorum of the courts and for upholding the majesty
        of law. Judges and courts are not unduly sensitive or
        touchy to fair and reasonable criticism of their
        judgments. Fair comments, even if, outspoken, but made




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013             Page 131 of 140</span>
         without any malice or attempting to impair the
        administration of justice and made in good faith, in
        proper language, do not attract any punishment for
        contempt of court. However, when from the criticism a
        deliberate, motivated and calculated attempt is
        discernible to bring down the image of judiciary in the
        estimation of the public or to impair the administration
        of justice or tend to bring the administration of justice
        into disrepute the courts must bestir themselves to
        uphold their dignity and the majesty of law. The
        appellant, has, undoubtedly committed contempt of the
        court by the use of the objectionable and intemperate
        language. No system of justice can tolerate such
        unbridled licence on the part of a person, be he a
        lawyer, to permit himself the liberty of scandalising a
        court by casting unwarranted, uncalled for and
        unjustified aspersions on the integrity, ability,
        impartiality or fairness of a Judge in the discharge of his
        judicial functions as it amounts to an interference with
        the due course of administration of justice."

       and mind games adopted to seek recusal of Judges need to

Assertions of "facts that had occurred during the trial

<p id="p_279"> 249. In Jaswant Singh, it has been observed that petitions casting
unwarranted, uncalled for and unjustified aspersions on a ld. judge,
on his integrity, ability, impartiality or fairness in discharge of
judicial functions, had the tendency to scandalise the court. It was
held that the aspersions were an attempt to browbeat the learned
judge of the High Court and cause interference in the conduct of a
fair trial which brings authority and administration of law into
disrespect; brings the court into disrepute; are an affront to the
majesty of law and offend the dignity of the court. Such conduct
has been held to amount to interference with due course of the
administration of justice, thus clearly punishable under the
<a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_198">Contempt of Courts Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_280">250. The averments in the applications before us regarding court
proceedings are false and in fact would justify invocation of
criminal contempt of court proceedings against the applicants for
making such false averments with the clear intention of preventing
a judge from discharging judicial function.
</p><p id="p_281">251. We are commanded by the observations of the Supreme
Court in Subrata Roy Sahara extracted above that such baseless
and unfounded insinuations should be absolutely repulsed.
</p><p id="p_282">252. The attempt to single out a judge and address judges
constituting a Bench by name and making personal allegations not
supported by record against them are really a frontal attack
intended to humiliate the judge concerned in public spaces and
browbeat them giving in to illegally and improperly made demands
and deserves to be condemned in the highest tone.

<p id="p_283"> 253. Arguments before us were peppered with the plea that ld.
Senior     Counsels       were     "embarrassed"         in    supporting       the
applications. In our view, submissions which are supported by
facts and the authority of law cannot cause embarrassment in
discharge of professional duty.              If there is embarrassment in
making any submission, the same should not be made at all.
</p><p id="p_284">254. We have no manner of doubt that we would have been
justified in invoking such contempt proceedings against these
applicants for having wilfully made such applications containing
baseless      and       unfounded          allegations    and        deliberately
misrepresenting judicial record in a dishonest attempt to prevent
hearings in these cases.
</p><p id="p_285">255. In fact, in view of the specific mandate of the Supreme Court
in para 264 of R.K. Anand, penal consequences must enure to the
applicants for their aforedetailed conduct.
</p><p id="p_286">256. These cases underscore the real truth that "there can be
peace only if there is justice" as stated by Mahatma Gandhi and
endorsed by world leaders. Failure to punish for a mass crime as
riots in which several perished, creates the most difficult chasm in
the world to fill. Such failure not only creates wounds which fester
but those which actually and incurably infect society.
</p><p id="p_287">257. That riots happened in 1984 in New Delhi, the capital of
India in which hundreds perished, is not disputed. That despite
passage of 32 years thereafter, cases in the complaints emanating
from those riots have not attained finality in adjudication has
generated a sense of injustice in the victims as well as those who

 feel that they have been unjustly accused of commission of the
crimes.     Most importantly, it has lent arrogance to the actual
perpetrators and created scepticism with judicial process in the
society at large. It generates a view that serious crime such as
mass violence goes undetected and unpunished. We feel that this
may have emboldened several and encouraged other such incidents
which have occurred in the country thereafter leaving black marks
on our history.
</p><p id="p_288">258. It is the effort to bring a closure to these prosecutions
(pending as appeals in the Delhi High Court) , that too on fervent
and impassioned pleas initiated by an ailing eighty eight year of an
old co-convict (Capt. Bhagmal) undergoing rigorous life
imprisonment, supported by other life convicts, which has led to
our having to hear protracted arguments on the recusal of one of us
(P.S. Teji, J) thereby expending valuable judicial time thereon,
instead of proceeding with the merits of the case. It has further
required both of us to devote time and effort to penning separate
judgments on the prayer as mandated by judicial pronouncements.
</p><p id="p_289">259. We therefore, exercise restraint and desist from invoking our
jurisdiction under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_199">Contempt of Courts Act</a> and also in not
initiating penal action against the applicants as commended in the
above set out judicial precedents, only for the reason these cases
brook no further delay. No digression, distraction or diversion by
any other proceedings which could result in protraction of the
hearings in the main appeals would be in the interests of justice.
Though strongly inclined to impose costs for the dilatory tactics

in the larger interests of justice which would be met by expeditious
disposal of the cases.
</p>
<p id="p_290">XI.     Conclusion

</p><p id="p_291">260. In view of the above discussion, we sum up our conclusions
as follows :
</p><p id="p_292">(i)     The order dated 15th February, 2010 disposing the
anticipatory bail application was an interim order containing no
binding finding.
</p><p id="p_293">(ii)    The order dated 27th March, 2010 deciding the preliminary
objection to territorial jurisdiction of the court by one of the
accused persons (other than the applicants) is a view only on the
objection taken. There is no expression of opinion on the merits of
the case. The applicants did not support the objection.
</p><p id="p_294">(iii)   On the 27th March, 2010, the case was not even registered on
the board of the then District Judge-VI and Additional Sessions
Judge (East) who has never dealt with it as a trial judge or so
passed any order which could give rise even to a suspicion of bias,
let alone reasonable apprehension of bias.
</p><p id="p_295">(iv)    The applications under consideration manifest the insidious
attempt to create a facade of apprehension of bias by pleading a
non-existent factual foundation for the purposes of supporting the
prayer for recusal. Had there been any apprehension of bias or even
suspicion of bias, the applicants would have objected to the very
order of committal of the case on 20th of March, 2010 by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">Crl.A.Nos.715/2013, 753/2013 &amp; 1099/2013           Page 138 of 140</span>
 ACMM; the order dated 25th March, 2010 by the District Judge-VII
and would have filed applications of objection before the District
Judge-VI on 27th March, 2010 itself.
</p><p id="p_296">(v)     In the six years since 2010 (when the anticipatory bail
applications were dealt with and the order passed on 27 th March,
2010), a whole trial stands concluded and final judgment stands
passed in the case by the trial court. There is no basis at all for
nursing apprehension of bias, let alone reasonable or real ground
for the same.
</p><p id="p_297">(vi)    On the 19th of September 2016, other than learned counsel
for Sajjan Kumar, counsels appearing for all other private parties in
the bunch of connected appeals, including the applicants, had
submitted that they have no objection if this Bench continues to
hear these appeals. This statement binds the applicants.
</p><p id="p_298">(vii) The averments in the application are contrary to court
record, especially the references to trial and the imputations to the
mind of Bench. These tantamount to a direct interference in the
due course of administration of justice and obstruct discharge of
judicial function by a judge rendering the applicants liable to be
proceeded against under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_200">Contempt of Courts Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_299">(viii) The life convicts in the case do not have any apprehension of
bias and have not joined the applicants in filing these applications.
On the contrary, the life convicts have pressed for hearing the
appeals by the Bench as presently constituted illustrating the
malafide of the applicants and the intention to only delay decision
