<p id="p_1">                    The   plaintiffs   have   filed   present   suit   for   injuncting   the 
     defendants   from   telecasting   or   broadcasting   or   communicating   to   the 
     public or publishing in any manner the impugned advertisements or any 
     part thereof or any other advertisement of a similar nature.   The plaintiffs

     aforesaid terms during the pendency of the suit.   The plaintiffs have also 
     moved for ad-interim orders.

<p id="p_2">     2.              The plaintiff is a public limited company incorporated under 
     the   provisions   of   the   <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies   Act</a>   1966   and   carries   on   business   of 
     manufacturing   and   selling   of   consumer   products   including   mosquito 




                                                          
     repellents.     The plaintiffs claim to be a market leaders in the field of 
     mosquito repellent in India.   The defendant No.2 is also a public limited 
     company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a> and carries on business 




                                            
     of selling mosquito repellents and is competitor of the  plaintiffs in the 
                          
     field of mosquito repellents.     The plaintiffs are manufacturing mosquito 
     repellents in various types such as mats, refills, coils and liquid vaporizers 
                         
     under   the   trademark   "Good   Knight".       According   to   the   plaintiffs,   the 
     mosquito repellents with a trademark Goodnight are sold since 1984.   It 
     is the case of the plaintiffs that the mosquito repellents of the plaintiffs, in 
      


     particular,   Good   Knight   liquid   vaporizer   mosquito   repellent   bears 
   



     distinctive label   which is predominantly red in colour with a thin silver 
     lining,   being   an   essential   predominant   feature   of   its   packaging/   trade 
     dress.          It is the case of the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs came to know 





     recently   that   the   defendants   have   launched   three   commercials   on 
     television which are disparaging the mosquito repellent liquid vaporizer of 
     the   plaintiffs.       It   is   the   contention   of   the   plaintiffs   that   the   said 





     advertisement campaign conveys message to the public that the plaintiff's 
     product   is   inferior   and   of   substandard   quality   and   defendant   No.2's 
     product is of best quality.   In this background, the suit along with notice 
     of motion as aforesaid has been filed.

<p id="p_5">     4.              Shri Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel submits that perusal 
     of   the   advertisements   would   clearly   reveal   that   the   advertisements   in 




                                                            
     question, which shows that initially a machine with liquid vaporizer being 
     ineffective and useless, is totally aimed with disparaging the product of 
     the   plaintiffs.       It   is   submitted   that   the   bottle   containing   liquid   in   the 




                                              
     advertisement is the one shown having a label which is deceptively similar 
                           
     to the label used by the plaintiffs.   Learned counsel submits that though 
     the   defendants   are   entitled   to   make   any   claim   so   as  to   puff     up   their 
                          
     product; they cannot, in the advertisement, disparage the product of the 
     rival.     Learned counsel further submits that the plaintiffs   is a market 
     leader in the field of mosquito repellents and only in order to eat up the 
      


     plaintiffs' share in the market the impugned advertisements are telecast so 
   



     as   to   show   that   the   plaintiff's   product   is   bad   and   ineffective   and   the 
     defendants' product is a good product.   In reply to the contention of the 
     defendants   that   there   are   various   other   labels   having   red   colour   in 





     predominance   is   concerned,   learned   counsel   submits   that   out   of   three 
     labels on which the defendants are relying, one is their own label.   The 
     other   label   shows   the   product   to   be   manufactured   by   Balsara.       It   is 





     further submitted that Balsara has been taken over by Dabur and, as such, 
     the defendants are showing the product which was in the market in the 
     year 2007 and therefore misrepresenting the Court.   In so far as third one 
     is concerned, it is submitted that the label of Mortein is a combination of 
     red and yellow whereas the advertisement shows the combination of red

     and silver.   It is, therefore, submitted that it is clear that the intention of 
     the defendants is to disparage the product of the plaintiffs.   The learned

<p id="p_6">     5.             As against this, Shri Chagla, learned senior counsel appearing 
     for   the   defendants   submits   that   apprehension   of   the   plaintiffs   that   the 
     advertisements in question tries to disparage the product of the plaintiffs 
      


     is totally ill-founded.   It is submitted that the part of the advertisement, 
   



     which according to the plaintiffs disparage their product, is seen   hardly 
     for a second.   He submits that it is improbable that any ordinary person  
     would   identify   the   said   bottle   shown   in   the   beginning   of   the 





     advertisement   to   be   that   of   the   plaintiffs'   product.       Learned   counsel 
     submits that the advertisement is required to be seen as a whole.   Even 
     the  first part to which the plaintiffs objects, does not show the machine in 





     which the liquid vaporizer is put to be identical with that of the plaintiffs. 
     The learned counsel submits that reliance placed by the plaintiffs on the 
     judgments of the Delhi High Court, Madras High Court and of Calcutta 
     High Court are the judgment of the learned single Judge.     He submits 
     that the correct  legal  position is laid down by the Division Bench of the

     assistance from the said judgment, he submits that an   advertisement is 




                                                            
     commercial   speech   and   is   protected   by   <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_8">Article   19(1)(a)</a>   of   the 
     Constitution.   Learned counsel further submits that by seeking injunction 
     the plaintiffs are attempting to create monopoly in their favour which is 




                                                           
     not   permissible   in   law.     Mr.Chagla   further   submits   that   perusal   of   the 
     advertisements of the other competitors in the field including that of the 
     plaintiffs and another popular brand  'all out' would also reveal that in the 




                                             
     said   advertisements   also,   the   products   of   other   manufacturers   are 
                           
     compared   so   as   to   show   that   their   product   to   be   better   one.       He, 
     therefore, submits that it is not permissible for the plaintiffs to say that the 
                          
     defendants   are   not   entitled   to   telecast   the   advertisements   which   are 
     impugned in the present proceedings.   Learned counsel further relies on 
     the order of the division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of 
      


     Hindustan  Unilever  Ltd.  and  Ors.     v.   SC  Johnson  &amp;  Sons  and  Anr.

     further relies on the judgment in the case of  <a href="/doc/712415/" id="a_9">Godrej Sara Lee Ltd.   v.  
     Reckitt Benckiser   (I) Ltd</a>., 2006 (32) PTC 307 (Del.) in support of the 





     proposition that the plaintiffs are guilty of laches and are not entitled for 
     interim relief.   It is also contended by Shri Chagla that present motion so 
     also suit are liable to be thrown away on the short ground of suppression 





     of facts.   It is submitted that the plaintiffs have suppressed that they also 
     have label which is predominantly having white colour and, as such, on 
     the   ground   of   suppression   of   facts,   the   plaintiffs'   case   is   liable   to   be 
     rejected.       In   support   of   this   proposition   reliance   is   placed   on   the 
     judgment of the Apex Court in the case of  S.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu   v.

     Jagannath, (1994) 1 SCC 1 and  judgment of the Division Bench of this 
     Court in Appeal No.322/1991 (Maganlal Kuberdas Kapadia  v.  Themis  




                                                                                 
     Chemicals Ltd.)  decided on 22nd April 1991.
</p>



                                                         
<p id="p_9">     6.              I will first deal with the contention of the defendant that the 
     plaintiff is not entitled to equitable relief on the ground of suppression of 




                                                        
     material facts.   No doubt, the law on the point is very clear that if a party 
     seeking equitable relief approaches this Court by suppressing some vital 
     material which would have bearing on the issue as to whether relief could 




                                          
     be granted in its favour or not, then such party would not be entitled to 
                         
     any relief from this Court.   The principles that who seeks equity must do 
     equity and a party coming to the Court must come with clean hands are 
                        
     well settled.     In that view of the matter, though various judgments are 
     cited in support of the said proposition, I do not find it necessary to go 
     into that aspect of the matter.     The only question is as to whether the 
      


     alleged  suppression   is  first  of   all   suppression   or  not  and  even  if  it  be, 
   



     whether such suppression is of such a nature which would have bearing 
     upon the question of grant of relief in favour of the plaintiff or not.  The 
     defendants allege that though the advertisements of the defendants are 





     published   in   various   other   languages   including   Hindi,   Kannada   and 
     Telugu, it has been averred by the plaintiffs that they have noticed the 
     advertisements only in Malayalam channel.   The second contention is that 





     though   the   plaintiffs   have   stated   that   they   are   producing   the   product 
     which is having red label with silver lining, they have suppressed that they 
     also have a product which has white colour in predominance.

      the curvature in the middle is clearly displayed on the

      importance   given   to   the   shape   by   the   plaintiff   in   its 
      marketing of the product. The packaging (Ext. PW1/8) 
           
      also   establishes   the   fact   that   although   white   is   also

      the advertisement is that the said orange bar of soap

      must also be noted that the design of the plaintiff's soap 
      has been registered by the plaintiff as indicated by Ext.

      DVD that there is absolutely nothing to suggest that the 
      product   of   the   Appellant   is   targeted   either   overtly   or

      product either overtly or covertly. There is also no hint

<p id="p_27">      20. Learned   Counsel   for   the   Appellant   submitted 
      before   us   that   since   his   client   has   over   80%   of   the 
              
      market share in the country and a 100% market share in 
      some States, the obvious target of the commercial is the 
      product of the Appellant. In our opinion, this argument 
             
      cannot be accepted. The sub-text of this argument is an 
      intention   to   create   a   monopoly   in   the   market   or   to 
      entrench a monopoly that the Appellant claims it already 
      has. If this argument were to be accepted, then no other 
      mosquito repellent cream manufacturer would be able to 
      


      advertise   its   product,   because   in   doing   so,   it   would 
      necessarily  mean   that   the   Appellant's   product  is   being 
   



      targeted. All that we are required to ascertain is whether 
      the   commercial   denigrates   the   Appellant's   product   or 
      not.   There   is   nothing   in   the   commercial   to   suggest   a 
      negative content or that there is a disparagement of the 





      Appellant's   product.   The   commercial   merely   gives   the 
      virtues of the product of the Respondents, namely, that it 
      has certain ingredients which perhaps no other mosquito 
      repellent   cream   has,   such   as   tulsi,   lavender   and   milk 
      protein.   While   comparing   its   product   with   any   other 





      product,   any   advertiser   would   naturally   highlight   its 
      positive points but this cannot be negatively construed to 
      mean that there is a disparagement of a rival product. 
      That   being   so,   whether   the   Appellant's   product   is 
      targeted or not becomes irrelevant.

                 apprehension   of   getting   rashes   and   allergy   or   an 
                 allegation that other creams cause stickiness amounts to 




                                                                                   
                 disparagement   of   the   Appellant's   product.  We   cannot 
                 agree with the submission of learned Counsel. There is 
                 no suggestion that any other mosquito repellent cream 




                                                           
                 causes   rashes   or   allergy   or   is   sticky.   All   that   it   is 
                 suggested is that if a mosquito repellent cream is applied 
                 on   the   skin  (which   could   be   any   mosquito   repellent 
                 cream)  there   may   be   an   apprehension   of   rashes   and 




                                                          
                 allergy.  Generally   speaking,   this   may   be   possible 
                 depending   on   upon   the   quality   of   the   cream,   the 
                 sensitivity of the skin of the consumer and the frequency 
                 of use etc. - we cannot say one way or the other.  The 




                                            
                 commercial   does   not   suggest   that   any   particular 
                 mosquito   repellent   cream   or   all   mosquito   repellent 
                          
                 creams cause rashes and allergy. In fact, the Respondents 
                 are also trying to promote a mosquito repellent cream 
                 and   it   can   hardly   be   conceived   that   all   mosquito 
                         
                 repellent   creams   (which   would   naturally   include   the 
                 Respondents' product) cause rashes or  allergy.  All  that 
                 the   Respondent's   are   suggesting   is   that   since   their 
                 product contains tulsi, lavender and milk protein  such 
      

                 apprehensions are greatly reduced or that they should

     disparage   the   plaintiffs   product,   as   such   the   said   case   would   be  of   no 





     assistance to the case of the defendants.

     in the advertisement, an orange bottle of the respondents or the similar 
     orange bottle of some other manufacturer was not shown but, in fact, a 




                                                                                     
     completely   different   blue   bottle   was   shown.       In   this   background,   the 




                                                             
     Division   Bench   found   that   there   was   nothing   in   the   advertisement   to 
     suggest that the product of the respondents was in any manner disparaged 
     or   shown   to   be   inferior   to   the   product   of   the   appellants.         In   the 




                                                            
     circumstances, the order of injunction granted by the learned single Judge 
     was reversed.

<p id="p_31">     17.             It can, thus, clearly be seen that it is a settled position of law 
                             
     that a  a tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the world, 
     even though the declaration is untrue.     He can also say that his goods 
                            
     are better than his competitors, even though such statement is untrue.  He 
     can   also   say   that   his   product   is   best   in   the   world   or   better   than   his 
     competitors' and also can compare the advantages of his product over the 
      


     products   of   the   others.       However,   while   doing   so,   he   cannot   say   his 
   



     competitors are bad and, if he does so, he really slanders the goods of his 
     competitors and defames   his competitors and their goods which is not 
     permissible   and   only   in   such   a   case   the   Court   would   be   competent   to 





     grant order of injunction restraining repetition of such defamation.
</p>

<p id="p_32">     18.             It   is   equally   settled   that   to   decide   the   question   of 





     disparagement, the following factors are to be kept in mind:
</p><pre id="pre_4">                     (i)     Intent of commercial 
                     (ii)    Manner of the commercial 
</pre><p id="p_33">                     (iii)   Storyline of the commercial and the message 
                             sought to be conveyed by the commercial. 
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                             ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:50:13 :::</span>

     Out of the above, "manner of the commercial", is very important. If the 
     manner   is   ridiculing   or   condemning   product   of   the   competitor   then   it 




                                                                                  
     amounts to disparaging but if the manner is only to show one's product 




                                                          
     better   or   best   without   derogating   other's   product   then   that   is   not 
     actionable.

<p id="p_35">     19.            In this background, we have to consider the present matter. 
     The first advertisement shows a man holding racket standing in the room 
     and   is   seen   switching   on   the   liquid   vaporizer   machine.     It   shows   that 




                                            
     though the machine is put on the mosquitoes continue troubling him and 
                          
     so he  starts shooing them  with his racket.   Thereafter  standing on the 
     chair   he   is   shown   trying   to   kill   them   by   waving   his   racket   furiously. 
</p>                         
<p id="p_36">     Thereafter some oral utterances are made by the famous actor Madhavan 
     and at last defendant's product zooms into the screen and then zooms out 
     and fits itself into a machine and the actor says, "of MAXO.  A single drop 
      


     is   sufficient.     The   action   is   instant.     Besides,   it   fits   any   machine." 
</p>   



<p id="p_37">     Similarly, there are two other advertisements.   Since the entire story line 
     is reproduced hereinabove, I do not find it necessary to repeat again the 
     sum and substance of the advertisements.   At the request of the parties, I 





     have personally seen all the three advertisements on the screen of P.C.   In 
     all the three advertisements, immediately as soon as film starts, a man is 
     shown switching on the liquid vaporizer.     The bottle containing the red 





     liquid vaporizer is shown with a label which is of a dark red colour having 
     a   silver   linings.       I   have   personally   compared   the   labels  shown   in   the 
     advertisements with that of the plaintiff's.   I am aware of the fact that the 
     comparison   that   has   to   be   done   should   be   from   the   view   point   of   an 
     ordinary person of average intelligence.    Upon comparison of the labels 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:50:13 :::</span>
                                                   24/27                                1914.12-nmsl

     used on the bottles in the advertisements and the label of the plaintiff's 
     product,   I   find   that   the   label   used   in   the   advertisements   is   capable   of 




                                                                                    
     giving   impression   to  the   ordinary  man   of   average   intelligence  that   the 




                                                            
     bottle   which   is   initially   used   in   the   machine   is   that   of   the   plaintiff's 
     product.   The theme of the first advertisement is that after the machine is 
     put   on   with   the   vaporizer   having   label   alike     the   plaintiff's,   the   said 




                                                           
     product   is   ineffective   and   the   mosquitoes   continue   to   trouble   the   man 
     standing in the room and he tries to flee them away and kill them with a 
     racket.     Finally, the defendant's product is sought to be shown on the 




                                             
     screen by saying, "...of MAXO. A single drop is sufficient.   The action is 
                           
     instant.  Besides, it fits any machine."  In the second advertisement, after 
     the liquid vaporizer machine is switched on, the man in the room tries to 
                          
     flee away the mosquitoes with newspaper, climbs up on the chair doing 
     many acrobatics as he is not in a position to kill the mosquitoes and finally 
     the defendant's product is sought to be glorified with same words.   The 
      


     third advertisement opens in the same manner, the man tries to kill the 
   



     mosquitoes   with   his   hands   which   has   an   effect   of   clapping   the   hands 
     furiously, the claps go on increasing and, finally, the defendants product is 
     sought to be glorified.
</p>




<p id="p_38">     20.             As already discussed hereinabove, an intent of commercial; 
     the   manner   of   commercial;   storyline   of   commercial;   and   the   message 





     sought to be conveyed would be material.   If the intent of the commercial 
     is only for the purpose of promotion of the goods of the manufacturer, the 
     same would not be actionable but if the intention of the commercial is 
     disparaging the product of the plaintiff, then an action would lie.    From 
     the  storyline  and the  manner of  the  advertisements in  question,  it can 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                            ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:50:13 :::</span>
                                                  25/27                               1914.12-nmsl

     clearly   be   seen   that   the   message   that   is   sought   to   be   given   in   the 
     advertisements, is that even after the machine with product containing 




                                                                                  
     label alike plaintiff's product is put on, it has no effect and the mosquitoes 




                                                          
     go   on   troubling   which   require   the   person   in   the   room   to   indulge   in 
     acrobatics etc.   It is to be noted that the advertisement campaign or visual 
     media has an immediate impact on the viewers and possibly purchaser's 




                                                         
     mind,   particularly,   when   a   well   known   cinestar   is   endorsing   it.     It   is 
     further to be noted that the matter has to be looked from the view point of 
     the ordinary person of average intelligence.   Though the advertisements 




                                            
     in question may show the product having a label alike that of plaintiff's 
                          
     product for a few seconds, the possibility of the same being registered in 
     the mind of an average consumer and linking it with the ineffectiveness of 
                         
     the product cannot be ruled out.
</p>

<p id="p_39">     21.            In so far as contention of the defendants that there are other 
      


     similar labels which are having red colour in predominance is concerned, 
   



     I have examined the labels which are placed on record by the defendants. 
     One of the labels is that of the defendants themselves and, in any case, it 
     is a combination of red, white and black colours with a dark gray border. 
</p>




<p id="p_40">     In so far as Odomos label is concerned, I have personally seen the bottle 
     of which photograph is placed on record.   The said bottle is manufactured 
     in 2007.     Apart from that the said label is combination of orange, red, 





     while and blue colours.    The third one i.e. Mortein is combination of red, 
     black and yellow colours with yellow border.     It cannot be a matter of 
     coincidence that in the advertisement of the defendant, which shows the 
     product in the bottle containing liquid vaporizer to be useless, is having a 
     label of dark red colour with silver border.   From the material placed on  




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:50:13 :::</span>
                                                 26/27                               1914.12-nmsl

     record, I find that it is only plaintiff's product which is having label of dark 
     red colour with a silver border.     In that view of the matter, I am of the 




                                                                                 
     considered   view   that   by   the   impugned   advertisements   the   defendants 




                                                         
     have attempted to disparage the product of the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_41">     22.            In   so   far   as   the   contention   regarding   other   visual 




                                                        
     advertisements are concerned including the advertisement of the plaintiffs 
     amd  of the another mosquito repellent in the market i.e. "All Out", I have 
     personally   seen   the   advertisements   on   the   P.C.     In   none   of   the 




                                          
     advertisements   the   labels   are   shown   on   the   bottle   of   liquid   vaporizer, 
                         
     which   are   sought   to   be   compared   with   the   product   of   the   advertisers. 
     The distinction between the advertisments which are subject matter of the 
                        
     suit   and   the   other   advertisments   is   that,   the   advertisement   which   is 
     subject matter of the suit shows bottle which is having a label identical to 
     that of the plaintiff's product, whereas the other advertisements though 
      


     show a bottle of liquid vaporizer for comparison, it does not contain any 
   



     label.     In that view of the matter, the contention in that regard is also 
     without any substance.
</p>




<p id="p_42">     23.            However, I am of the view that if the objectionable label is 
     removed   from   the   bottle   shown   in   the   advertisements,   then   such 
     advertisements   would   be   permissible   in   view   of   settled   law   that     a 





     manufacturer,   without   disparaging   the   product   of   his   competitor,   can 
     make claim that his product is best in the world, even though such a claim 
     may not be true.   In that view of the matter, I find that the plaintiff has  
     made out prima facie case for grant of injunction.

               plaintiff would continue, whereas in view of the order that I am inclined

               be free to use the impugned advertisement provided it removes the red
