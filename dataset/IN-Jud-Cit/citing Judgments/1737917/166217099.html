RAJIV SHAKDHER, J

IA No. 13875/2009 (O. 39 R. 1&amp;2 of CPC by pltf.)

</p><p id="p_4"> 1.     By this order I propose to dispose of the captioned application preferred by the

 plaintiffs under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil

 Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the „CPC‟). The factual matrix, in the

 background of which, the application has been moved is as follows:-

</p><p id="p_5"> 2.     Plaintiff No.1 is a company which is incorporated under the laws of United States

 of America, having its registered office in that country. Plaintiff No.2 is a subsidiary

 company of plaintiff No.1. Plaintiff No.1 evidently holds 99% share in plaintiff No.2

 through its two subsidiaries i.e., Johnson‟s Wax International GMBN, Switzerland and

 S.C. Johnson &amp; Sons Investment Limited, Mauritius.
</p>
<p id="p_6">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                           Page 1 of 14</span>
</p><p id="p_7"> 3.       Incidentally, balance 1% share holding in plaintiff No.2 is held by defendant No.3

through its wholly owned subsidiary Unilever India Exports Limited, a company

incorporated under the laws of India.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.       The plaintiffs are aggrieved since one of its product i.e., "MR. MUSCLE

KITCHEN CLEANER" has been purportedly denigrated by virtue of an advertisement

(which is appended as Annexure 2 to the plaint) telecast on television and played out on

the internet by defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2.        It is the plaintiffs‟ case that the impugned

advertisement is telecast and uploaded on the internet at the behest of defendant No.3

which manufactures a competitive product under the brand name "CIF Cream".

</p><p id="p_9">5.       It is averred in the plaint that its product "MR.MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER"

has acquired for itself worldwide reputation in so far as household cleaning products, air

freshners and insecticides are concerned. Resultantly, plaintiffs have its operations in 70

countries. The plaintiffs claim that their products sell in over 110 countries across the

globe in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, South America etc.

</p><p id="p_10">6.       It transpires that plaintiff No.1 acquired proprietary rights in the brand name

"MR. MUSCLE", only in 1992 with the acquisition of Drackett Company from another

company by the name Bristol-Mysers. It is also averred that brand/trade mark "MR.

MUSCLE" has been registered in over 100 countries across the globe, which includes

India.    The brand/trade mark "MR. MUSCLE" was first registered in India on

19.01.1996. It is also claimed that "MR. MUSCLE" range of products were launched in

India in April, 2007. To begin with, the plaintiffs launched the product in issue i.e.,

"MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER" as also "MR. MUSCLE GLASS CLEANER".

The range of products was expanded in August, 2008 to include "MR. MUSCLE

KITCHEN CLEANER MULTIPURPOSE", and by December, 2008 other products such

as "MR. MUSCLE TOILET AND BATHROOM CLEANER", "MR. MUSCLE

ADVANCED TOILET CLEANER" and "MR. MUSCLE POWER TOILET CLEANER"

were added. The purpose of these averments evidently is to show that in the field of

household cleaners, the plaintiffs are the market leaders. In so far as the impugned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                            Page 2 of 14</span>
 advertisement is concerned, it is averred that "MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER"

amongst other products, launched under the brand name "MR. MUSCLE", is packed in a

unique container which is distinctively shaped with appropriate indentation, carrying an

orange colour, with a nozzle in the form of a trigger. The overall trade dress makes the

plaintiffs‟ product unique and immediately identifiable from those of its competitors.

</p><p id="p_11">7.      In order to build the brand image of "MR. MUSCLE" products, in respect of

"MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER" alone, in 2008-09, the plaintiffs have

purportedly incurred an advertisement expenditure of Rs 10.13 crores approximately, and

between April 2009 to September 2009 the expenditure was Rs 2.86 crores.                    The

plaintiffs have also averred that in 2007-2008 "MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER",

grossed sales equivalent to approximately Rs 2.60 crores; which has risen appreciably in

the subsequent year i.e., 2008-09.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.1     The plaintiffs‟ grievance is that defendant No.3 which is a competitor, has used

the services of defendant nos. 1 &amp; 2 to telecast the impugned advertisement to denigrate

the plaintiffs‟ product "MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER". This is brought out in

the impugned advertisement by first comparing its own product "CIF Cream" with

plaintiffs‟ product "MR. MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER" by using, amongst others, a

virtually similar container which is, orange in colour, and has a similar trigger; and

thereafter alludes to the fact that tough kitchen stains can be removed by using advanced

products, that is, "CIF cream" with least amount of effort.            In nutshell, by this

comparison the defendants lead the consumers and viewers to believe that other kitchen

cleaners including the plaintiffs‟ products are ineffective and worthless.

</p><p id="p_13">8.      In support of these averments, Dr. Singhvi appearing for the plaintiffs has: Firstly,

taken me through the averments made in the plaint in order to demonstrate the plaintiffs‟

market leadership, its investment in advertisement, and the turnover achieved which is

sought to be impacted by the impugned advertisement. Secondly, he has also stressed

upon the fact that there is in the instant case clear attempt at denigrating the plaintiffs‟



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                             Page 3 of 14</span>
 product as there is a side by side comparison of the plaintiffs‟ product with that of the

defendants. In order to buttress his submissions he relied upon the following judgments:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       <a href="/doc/22644009/" id="a_1">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. vs Hindustan Lever Ltd</a>. 2008 (38) PTC 139

       (16) PTC 393 (Del).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">9.      Apart from the above, Dr. Singhvi has also submitted that the balance of

convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs as defendant No.3 in its reply to the

captioned application has admitted that since October, 2009 the impugned advertisement

has not been telecast.       He has submitted that defendants currently are running an

Advertisement Story Board which is appended at page 28 of the rejoinder, to which

plaintiffs have no objection.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.     A reply in rebuttal has been filed by defendant no. 3. On a perusal of the reply, it

is quite evident that defendant nos 1 &amp; 2 are companies tasked with job of advertising

products of leading manufacturers. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are sponsored and paid for

their efforts evidently by these manufacturers. In turn defendant Nos.1 and 2 facilitate

the manufacturers‟ communication with their consumers through television commercials,

campaigns and flyers under the brand name "Brand Power".
</p>
<p id="p_16">10.1    Defendant No.3 in the reply, has refuted the allegations of disparagement made by

the plaintiffs.     Towards this end, they have in great detail analysed the impugned

advertisement to demonstrate that there is no intent to disparage the plaintiffs‟ products

by either "overt" or "covert" reference in the impugned advertisement. In respect of each

frame of advertisement defendant No.3 has averred as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        First Frame

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (i)        In this frame the impugned advertisement only conveys that everyone

                      prefers better cleaning with least amount of effort.</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                             Page 4 of 14</span>
         Second Frame

        (ii)       This brings out the fact that defendant No.3‟s product i.e., "CIF Cream" is

                      an effective cleaner.    The only product which is shown is "CIF

                      Cream".


        Third Frame


        (iii)      This frame (which is largely responsible for institution of the present

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                      action by the plaintiffs) shows that defendant No.3‟s product i.e., "CIF

                      Cream" alongside other surface cleaners including an orange coloured

                      container. It is important to note that defendant No.3, however, claims

                      that the shape, get up as well as the nozzle of the orange coloured

                      container is completely different from that of the plaintiffs‟ product.

                      Defendant No.3 has also stressed the fact that blue and orange

                      coloured containers are used predominantly by various manufacturers

                      across the country in respect of surface cleaners. Therefore, it is

                      averred that there are products of other manufacturers which are

                      orange in colour and have a nozzle in the form of a trigger.


        Fourth Frame


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        (iv)       In this frame liquid is poured on a greasy stove and in the side by side

                      frame another "CIF Cream" is also poured on to a greasy stove. The

                      protagonist adverts to the fact that side by side test reveals that "CIF

                      Cream" is better in comparison to other surface cleaners. The reason

                      given for the same by the protagonist is that "CIF Cream" formula

                      contains "micro particles".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">10.2    In the advertisement the protagonist has tried to allude to the fact that "CIF

Cream", which contains micro particles, is more efficient in removing various kinds of

stains found on myriad surfaces.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                               Page 5 of 14</span><p id="p_18">
 10.3    In this context, defendant No.3 in particular has averred as follows: First, the

comparison is with the blue coloured bottle in the fourth frame of the advertisement,

which makes it clear that defendant No.3‟s product is being compared with other surface

cleaners, and the reference is only with regard to the visual which is seen alongside.

Second, "CIF Cream" is compared with a blue coloured container, and not with an orange

coloured container, which is in the previous frame, with which, the plaintiffs are

aggrieved. Third, the statement that the cleaning efficacy of defendants‟ product is on

account of presence of micro particles in defendant No.3‟s products, is a statement of

fact, which is backed by technical research and laboratory tests. In this regard a reference

to test reports of one M.J. Labs has also been made, which is, appended as Annexure F to

the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
10.4.   Defendants have refuted the plaintiffs‟ claim that it is a market leader in

household cleaners. On the other hand, defendant No. 3 has taken a stand that "CIF

Cream" was launched in France in 1969; it is presently sold in over 50 countries across

the continents; the annual turnover of "CIF Cream Brand" globally in 2008 alone was

450 million Euros; "CIF Brand" is number one brand in 14 countries in the category of

liquid abrasive cleaner with more than 50% share in the European Continent alone, a fact

which is evidenced by AC Nielsen Report dated 19.06.2009, which shows the

defendants‟ product as market leader in 14 European countries; and lastly, the plaintiffs‟

product "MR.MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER" on the other hand does not even figure

in top three brands in the AC Nielson report.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
10.5.   As far as India is concerned, defendant no.3 has claimed that CIF Cream was

introduced in India in June, 2009 and since then, defendants have spent approximately

Rs 10 crores on advertising alone.       More specifically, in respect of the impugned

advertisement, which ran on television between August, 2009 and October, 2009 the

defendants have spent Rs 80 lakhs.

<p id="p_21"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                            Page 6 of 14</span>
 11      In the background of the aforesaid averments made in the reply of defendant no. 3

Mr. Ashok Desai, learned senior counsel has submitted that the plaintiffs‟ application

deserves to be rejected on the following grounds:-
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        (i)        Defendants had been running the impugned advertisement on television,

                      on the South Indian channels, since August, 2009. The plaintiffs‟

                      claim that they were unaware of the impugned advertisement till

                      October, 2009 is clearly false as TAM Certificates would demonstrate

                      that plaintiffs‟ own advertisements have been telecast on the same

                      channels. The delay of over three months in approaching the court

                      should be a good ground for refusing the prayer for interim relief.</blockquote><pre id="pre_3">

        (ii)       There is no subsisting cause of action and hence, not only the application

                      but also the suit deserves to be dismissed.          In support of his

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                      submissions, my attention was drawn to the fact that not only is the

                      container, in the side by side, comparison in the third frame of the

                      impugned advertisement, quite different from that of the plaintiffs, but

                      also that there are several such orange coloured containers in the

                      market of other manufacturers.       The comparison in the impugned

                      advertisement is, as a matter of fact, between liquid which is poured

                      from a blue bottle on to a greasy stove, and the contents of the

                      defendants‟ product, that is, "CIF Cream" which is also poured on to a

                      greasy stove in a side by side comparison. The comparison obviously

                      is not with the plaintiffs‟ product, and in any event, there is no

                      disparagement since what is shown is that the defendants‟ product as

                      compared to other products, which does not include plaintiffs'

                      product, is of a superior quality.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        (iii)      In any event, the statement made in the impugned advertisement being a

                      statement of fact, backed by technical research and laboratory tests, is

                      a complete defence to an action for disparagement,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                               Page 7 of 14</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         (iv)       The plaintiffs have neither appended affidavits of any consumer nor a

                      consumer survey report, to show how the impugned advertisement has

                      impacted the consumers in so far as their perception of plaintiffs‟

                      product is concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        (v)        It is the plaintiffs‟ own claim (a reference was made to the turnover

                      figures culled out in the plaint) that the turnover between 2007-08 has

                      jumped significantly and hence, the impugned advertisement has had

                      no impact on the sale of the plaintiff‟s product.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">
</blockquote><p id="p_23">11.1    As regards the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiffs, that the defendants

had not run the impugned advertisement after October, 2009, it was submitted that even

though this is factually correct, an inference could not be drawn that the defendants had

stopped telecast of the impugned advertisement because they realized that it resulted in

disparaging plaintiffs‟ product. It was submitted that each advertisement runs for a

particular time-span after which it may either be substituted by a new one, or be re-

introduced after giving it a short break. In order to buttress his submissions Mr. Desai

refers to the following judgments:-

</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">12.     In rejoinder, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs Mrs Pratibha Singh, apart from

reiterating the submissions made in the opening, in particular, addressed the issue of

delay. It was stressed that the averments made in the plaint that the plaintiffs came to

know of the impugned advertisement in October, 2009, was factually correct as the TAM

report was received by them only in October, 2009. She submitted that the defendants

have not filed any document to demonstrate that the impugned advertisement was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                              Page 8 of 14</span>
 running in South India since August, 2009. On the aspect of delay the learned counsel

for the plaintiffs relied upon a Judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_8">Pankaj

Goel vs Dabur India Ltd</a> 2008 IX AD Delhi 190. It was submitted that in the said case,

the court was pleased to condone the delay of nearly three years on the ground that it was

difficult for the plaintiff in that case, looking at the size of its budget, to keep track of

each and every advertisement which the defendants had taken out.


</p><p id="p_26">13.     In the sur-rejoinder, it was pointed out by Mr. Desai that TAM report could not be

filed, as there was not enough time available, for them to file it with their rejoinder. He,

however, handed over a TAM report issued by „Mind Share‟ to demonstrate the fact that

since August, 2009 the impugned advertisement of the defendants as also of the plaintiffs

have been running on the same South Indian Channels.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
14      I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. A perusal of the facts stated in

the plaint, the captioned application and the reply of the defendant No.3 would bring to

fore the following:-
</p>
<p id="p_28">
14.1    The impugned advertisement does allude to the fact that defendant No.3‟s product

is more efficacious as compared to other kitchen cleaners. The other kitchen cleaners are

shown in containers of various colours, including one, which is in orange colour with the

nozzle in the form of a trigger. It was evident during the course of arguments that there

are several similar kitchen cleaners found in the market which are also packed in orange

coloured containers or colours which are in close proximity to the orange shade with a

nozzle in form of a trigger. It cannot, therefore, be disputed by the plaintiffs that either

the colour orange or the nozzle in the form of trigger is unique to the plaintiffs‟ product.

In Court I have been shown several containers of varied colours including the colour

orange, which had a nozzle in the form of a trigger. The exact shape and size of trigger

may, of course vary depending on the shape and size of the receptacle. But these

differences by themselves, prima facie, cannot come to the rescue of the defendants as

there is by innuendo a reference to plaintiffs‟ product amongst others. The advertisement

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                             Page 9 of 14</span>
 on the defendants‟ own admission runs for a very brief period. Perhaps not more than 30

seconds. The time frame available to a consumer to appreciate the difference is so

minimal that the fine distinctions pointed out in court can have no meaning. The question

to be asked is why is there a need to show in the third frame of the impugned

advertisement an orange coloured container with a nozzle in the form of a trigger. The

defendants‟ insistence on having it included in the impugned advertisement, prima facie

lends credence to the plaintiffs‟ assertion that there is an attempt to compare.


14.2    But every comparison does not necessarily amount to disparagement.

Consequently, what is required to be answered is:- whether there is denigration of

plaintiffs‟ products.   The answer to this question in my mind lies in what is the

fundamental purpose for which the product is manufactured. Both the plaintiffs‟ and

defendants‟ products are kitchen cleaners. Therefore, efficacy in cleaning tough kitchen

stains with minimum effort would be the core object in manufacturing a product of such

kind. The impugned advertisement undoubtedly shows that "CIF Cream" which is the

defendants‟ product achieves this object quickly with least amount of effort in

comparison to the products of its competitor. In my view in the facts of the instant case,

the impugned advertisement prima facie does seem to denigrate the plaintiffs‟ product. It

comes within the test of the defendants alluding to a "specific defect" or "demerit" in the

plaintiffs‟ product. (See De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs International

General Electric Co. of New York Ltd. (1975) 2 ALL ER 599).

14.3    Therefore, the next issue which needs to be answered is as to whether the claim of

superiority of defendants‟ product is a statement of fact. Truth is a complete defence in

an action for malicious falsehood. In my opinion this issue would require a trial. At this

stage, I am not persuaded to hold that superiority of defendant No.3‟s product is

established not withstanding reliance by defendants on the test reports appended with the

reply. MJ‟s credentials have been challenged by the plaintiffs. Hence, in my view the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                              Page 10 of 14</span>
 validity of defendant no.3‟s statement that its product is superior to that of its

competitors, including the plaintiffs is still at large.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
14.4    Therefore, considering the totality of circumstances, I am of the view that the

plaintiffs have established a strong prima facie case for grant of injunction.


</p><p id="p_31">15.     The submissions made on behalf of the defendants that an injunction should not

be granted in the instant case as: the plaintiffs have approached this court after a delay of

nearly three months; there is no cause of action surviving as the impugned advertisement

is presently not being telecast; there is no evidence of impact on consumers as a result of

the impugned advertisement; the balance of convenience is in favour of the defendants

because they have spent huge amount of money on the impugned advertisement; and

lastly, there is no injury caused to the plaintiffs by virtue of the impugned advertisement

since it is the plaintiffs‟ own claim that turnover has increased since the telecast of the

impugned advertisement - are in my view without merit. The reasons are as follows:


</p><p id="p_32">16.     First, as far as the delay is concerned the plaintiffs‟ claim that they were unaware

of the impugned advertisement till October, 2009.          The defendants have, however,

handed over a document which seems to indicate that the plaintiffs‟ advertisements were

running on television channels in South India as far back as August, 2009. Therefore,

there may be perhaps, some merit in the assertion that the plaintiffs stand that they were

ignorant about the impugned advertisement is inaccurate. But the matter, however, does

not end there; for the reason that the defendants have not refuted the fact that the

impugned advertisement in its Hindi version continues to appear on the internet on the

defendants‟ website i.e., www.brandpower.com. What impact would an internet

advertisement have on the consumers can only be assessed at the stage of trial. The fact

remains that plaintiffs‟ grievance remains unaddressed to date. Apart from this, in the

instant case, what is important to bear in mind is that eventhough the defendants have

stopped running the impugned advertisement since 31.10. 2009 as per their own stand,

they have refused to give an assurance that they will not run the impugned advertisement

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                                 Page 11 of 14</span>
 again. The threat of commission of tort remains. The ground of delay, therefore, in my

view loses its force.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
16.1     As regards, the submission that no cause subsists which would justify

continuation of the present action; is also, without merit. This is so, for a short reason,

which is, that defendant no. 3‟s counsel in his submission in court flatly refused to give

any assurance to the court that they would not run the impugned advertisement till the

culmination of the suit proceedings. The provisions of Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 of the CPC

make it clear that it not only empowers the court to injunct what it perceives is a the

continuing wrong but also brings within its fold threatened breach of a legal right

invested in the plaintiffs. The Court both under Rule 1 as well as Rule 2 of Order 39 of

the CPC is empowered to restrain the defendant from committing an act which may

injure the plaintiff. Therefore, in my view the cause survives as long as the defendants

threaten to telecast the impugned advertisement. That apart, as observed above, the

defendants are telecasting a Hindi version of the impugned advertisement on the internet

on their website www.brandpower.com. Thus, there is subsisting cause of action in

favour of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
16.2     The objection with regard to the fact that the plaintiffs have not filed affidavits of

consumers or report of any consumer survey carried out, to demonstrate the impact on the

purchasers is, in my view, premature. The plaintiffs at the trial will undoubtedly be

required to prove, amongst other ingredients of the tort, injury by relying upon relevant

evidence. The affidavits of consumers as regards impact of the impugned advertisement

would be vital. At an interlocutory stage, the motion cannot be rejected on this ground

alone.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
16.3     The other objection with regard to increase in sales is also untenable. The effect

of an advertisement is neither known immediately nor is it directly proportional. Like

with every product there are some negative factors which drag the sales while there are

others which give it a filip. Depending on which factor has greater impact the sales may

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                               Page 12 of 14</span>
 increase or decrease. Therefore, increase in absolute terms does not give the entire

picture. It requires a deeper analysis. Furthermore, the yearly figures of turnover given

in the plaint do not clearly disclose whether the period in issue is a financial year or a

calendar year. If the turnover given in the plaint is for a financial year then the increase

in sales between 2007-08 and 2008-09 would ordinarily be a comparison of a 12 month

period of each year which commences in April and ends in March of next year. The

financial year 2008-2009 would end on 31.03.2009. As per the defendants own showing,

the impugned advertisement commenced in August, 2009. What is obvious is that the

impact of the impugned advertisement on the sales could only have been measured in the

period post August, 2009.        In any event, as observed above, the impact of an

advertisement is not necessarily felt in close proximity. Therefore, injury which the

impugned advertisement allegedly caused to the plaintiffs will require a closer study,

based on evidence that plaintiffs would place before the Court at the time of trial. At this

stage there is no reason to doubt the submission of the plaintiffs that the impugned

advertisement has the necessary portends of impacting its revenue.


16.4    The other objection that the balance of convenience is in favour of defendant no.3

since, a large sum of money had been spent by defendant no.3 on advertisement is, in my

view, to be determined not only on the basis of advertisement budgets of the warring

parties but also on other factors, which I will shortly touch upon.


16.5    The plaintiffs have, as indicated above, stated that they have spent close to

Rs 2.86 crores on advertisement in respect of their product between April-September,

2009.    Before that in 2008-09 they claim to have spent nearly Rs 10.13 crores

approximately. The plaintiffs have also averred that they have launched their product

"MR.MUSCLE KITCHEN CLEANER" in April, 2007. Therefore, by a comparative

yardstick plaintiffs were not only an early bird in making a foray in the Indian market but

undoubtedly spent a huge amount on advertising their product. As against this, the

defendants admittedly have launched its product in India in June, 2009, a fact evident

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) 2173/2009                                                            Page 13 of 14</span>
 upon perusal of paragraph 9 of reply filed by defendant no.3. The defendants have also

claimed that between June, 2009 and October, 2009 they have spent Rs 10 crores in

brand building by advertising through various mediums, and have spent about Rs 80

lakhs between August, 2009 and October, 2009 on the impugned advertisement alone.

As indicated above, the money spent on advertisements may not by itself help in

determining in whose favour the balance of convenience lies. What is, however, clear

that the plaintiffs‟ product has been introduced much prior in point of time; as a matter of

fact nearly 2 years ago. Furthermore, the defendants admittedly as of today are not

telecasting the impugned advertisement. There can be no irretrievable harm caused to the

defendants if they are restrained from telecasting the impugned advertisement.


16.6    The last contention that the impugned advertisement does not cause any loss,

much less irreparable loss, to the plaintiffs since they instituted the present action only

after the defendants had stopped the telecast of the impugned advertisement; in my view

is also an objection which cannot be sustained. The injury to the plaintiffs, as observed

above, is prima facie continuing in view of the fact that there is no denial by the

defendants that the Hindi version on the internet continues to show the impugned

advertisement. Therefore, prima facie the defendants continue to commit a tort. Whether

this has resulted in an injury or loss to the plaintiffs; is an issue amongst others which

shall be a subject matter of trial. For the reasons given above, I am inclined to restrain

the defendants from using the impugned advertisement, which is appended as Annexure

A to the plaint, in any medium of communication, during the pendency of the suit.
