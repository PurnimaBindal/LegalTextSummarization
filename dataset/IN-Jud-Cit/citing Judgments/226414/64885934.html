</p><p id="p_4">1.     This is a defendant‟s appeal directed against a decree for permanent
injunction issued by the learned Single Judge in a claim alleging that the
defendant/appellant‟s advertisement had disparaged the plaintiff‟s goods.
The impugned judgment also directed payment of punitive damages to the
extent of Rs. 5 lakhs to the plaintiff. The parties will be referred to by their
original description in the suit for the sake of convenience.

<p id="p_5">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 1
</p><p id="p_6"> 2.     The plaintiff (hereafter "Reckitt") sought to restrain the defendant
Hindustan Lever Ltd. (hereafter "HUL")         by permanent injunction from
telecasting the impugned advertisement or otherwise disparaging Reckitt‟s
goodwill and reputation and its product sold under the trade mark DETTOL,
in any other advertisements and in all media, from using the depiction of
Reckitt‟s soap or any other soap deceptively similar to that of Reckitt‟s in its
advertisement or in any other manner disparaging the goodwill and
reputation of Reckitt and its product sold under the trade mark DETTOL,
and finally, from using any other indicia whatsoever to associate with/depict
Reckitt or its products in its advertisements issued in any and all media
whatsoever including the electronic media. Reckitt also sought damages to
the tune of Rs.20,00,050/- towards disparagement, denigration and
tarnishment of its goodwill and reputation by the impugned advertisement. A
claim for exemplary damages too was made in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.     Reckitt is involved in the manufacture of the famous antiseptic
disinfectant under the trade mark DETTOL for over 70 years. It was averred
that the mark DETTOL is synonymous with good hygiene and, today, it is a
household name and is the most widely used antiseptic disinfectant in the
country. The plaint also mentioned the history of DETTOL dating back to
1929 when the DETTOL antiseptic liquid was developed. As an antiseptic
germ disinfectant, it was argued, DETTOL had an unparalleled reputation in
the medical profession and that it continuously evolved to meet modern day
demands, and now incorporates a range of innovative antiseptic, disinfectant
and cleaning products ranging from antiseptic liquid, hand wash and the




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 2
 DETTOL toilet soap which has been manufactured and sold by Reckitt
continuously since 1981. Reckitt relied on the new modern, distinctive and
unique shape of the DETTOL toilet soap, which was subjected to intentional
and deliberate disparagement by the defendant is identified by the members
of the trade and public by its colour. Reckitt stated that on the front of the
soap the trade mark "DETTOL" and the sword device is clearly visible.
Reckitt contended that consumer-recognition of its products is by the colour
and distinctive shape of the soap, and also through its distinctive green
coloured packaging. In 1981, the DETTOL soap was launched as a
rectangular shaped, orange coloured bar without any curves. Reckitt adopted
the present shape with the curves instead of edges in May, 2006. It was
argued that this new improved soap with curvature in the middle and curved
edges helps consumers to easily identify and distinguish the product from
others. Unlike other orange coloured soaps in the market, Reckitt‟s product
is the only one with such distinctive shape. Three variants of the new soap
are available in the market, i.e. DETTOL Original; DETTOL Skincare (a
white soap) and DETTOL Cool (a blue soap). Of the three variants, the
DETTOL Original bar is an orange coloured and is the most popular.
According to the plaint, the sale of DETTOL Original constitutes 80% of the
total DETTOL soap sales.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4. Reckitt argued that the soap packaging has always been of a distinctive
green and white colour combination and such packaging is synonymous with
Reckitt‟s famous DETTOL brand. In this line of argument, Reckitt argues
that the purchasing public perceives the orange coloured bar with its




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 3
 distinctive shape and the distinctive green and white packaging to be
synonymous with the DETTOL Original soap. Reckitt claims that it
continuously and uninterruptedly marketed its DETTOL products with such
distinctive green and white colour combination packaging, including the
sword device in India since the year 1933. It claims to have announced in a
press release that it was contemplating introducing new variants of its
flagship brand DETTOL and it launched a new ad campaign - "Surakshit
Parivar" - to create awareness of the practice of hygiene at the family level.
Reckitt allocated a budget of about Rs.5 crores for the programme.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5. Reckitt became aware that the HUL introduced an advertisement on
television, which intentionally and deliberately disparages Reckitt‟s soap
under the trade mark DETTOL and the unique and distinctive packaging.
The offending advertisement concerns the defendant‟s LIFEBUOY soap.
Reckitt alleges that a bare viewing of the said advertisement would convince
this Court of the defendant‟s malicious intent to increase the market share of
its LIFEBUOY soap by tarnishing the goodwill and reputation of Reckitt‟s
soap i.e. DETTOL Original Soap. The disparaged soap, alleged Reckitt, is its
product. The contours and the curvature in the middle on the toilet soap in
the defendant‟s advertisement are identical to the contours of Reckitt‟s
DETTOL Original soap. The only difference is that Reckitt‟s product and the
logo are not shown in the advertisement. The colour of the soap in the
defendant‟s advertisement is virtually identical to that of the DETTOL
Original soap of Reckitt. The packaging of the toilet soap used in the
defendant‟s advertisement is likewise similar to that of Reckitt‟s soap‟s




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                            Page 4
 packaging. The defendant‟s advertisement is designed to give an impression
to the buyers that the offending soap is Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original soap.
The learned Single Judge describes the disparagement alleged, in the
following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i) The advertisement begins with a couple returning home after
       getting wet in the rain. The wife then proceeds to take a new soap to
       go and have a bath. The green coloured packaging, the orange
       coloured soap and the distinctive DETTOL shape is clearly visible in
       the advertisement. The intention of this scene is to convey to the
       audience that the offending soap pertains to an established soap i.e.,
       DETTOL Original soap presently being used by the family.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii) The next frame shows the husband, a medical doctor, and the
       children telling the lady of the house not to use the soap and the
       vocals state: "Oh God bachaa lena naadaan ko aql dena....Hum sab
       ko bachaa lena".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       It is alleged that the use of a doctor protagonist is once again relevant
       as DETTOL is an established brand in the medical profession.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (iii) The next frame shows the doctor husband explaining to the wife
       the reason as to why she should not use the offending soap and,
       instead, should use the Defendant‟s LIFEBUOY soap by stating that
       normal antiseptic soaps make the skin dry leading to cracks in the skin
       thereby permitting the germs to enter the cracks in the skin while the
       defendant‟s soap fights germs and keeps the skin protected. According
       to the plaintiff this scene is clearly intended to give out the message
       that the Plaintiff‟s soap is not effective against fighting germs whereas
       the Defendant‟s soap is effective against fighting germs. The words
       used in the advertisement are:- "Dua ki zarurat padegi is dawa ke
       saath. Aam antiseptic sabun twacha ko rukha kar dete hai jis se
       dararon mein kitanu ghus jaate hain...isi liye naya Lifebuoy skin
       guard jo kare kitanuon per waar aur banaye suraksha ki bhi deevar."</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">       According to the plaintiff it is relevant to mention that as DETTOL is
       used in respect of an extremely well known brand of antiseptic liquid,



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 5
        the use of the term "dawa" (medicine) is clearly intended to draw the
       attention of the viewer to the Plaintiff‟s product.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       (iv) In the next frame the lady is then shown to go and have a bath
       with the Defendant‟s soap and come out very satisfied with the same.
       According to the plaintiff, this falsely indicates that the defendant‟s
       soap is effective against fighting germs while the plaintiff‟s DETTOL
       soap is not."
</p>
<p id="p_12">6. Reckitt alleged that the defendant‟s advertisement is a slanderous attempt
to increase the market share of its LIFEBUOY soap by defaming and
disparaging the worth and reputation of Reckitt‟s product. It was also alleged
that the said advertisement outreaches the limits of allowed competitive
advertising and blatantly denigrates the reputation and goodwill of Reckitt‟s
well established and leading brand. It not only showed that HUL‟s product
was good (i.e. puffery) but also very clearly depicts that Reckitt‟s product is
completely worthless. Further, the use of the soap bar including its unique
curved shape and the distinctive packaging which is virtually identical to that
of Reckitt‟s by HUL resulted in dilution and debasement of the hard earned
reputation and goodwill of Reckitt‟s world-known and widely used products.
HUL‟s conduct in filing a caveat dated 16.7.2007 was alleged to indicate its
mala fide intentions as against Reckitt‟s product as HUL was aware that the
soap depicted in its advertisement was Reckitt‟s soap and also knew that
Reckitt would initiate action against it.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.     The defendant, in its written statement, denied that Reckitt had any
cause of action or that the action could be adjudicated in the civil courts,
since the allegations pertained to unfair competition and were properly the
subject matter of proceedings under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 6
 Practices Act, 1969 (hereafter referred to as the „MRTP Act‟) and the
<a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_1">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. The advertisement, in question, stated the
defendant referred to ordinary antiseptic soaps; Reckitt‟s soap is neither an
antiseptic soap, nor an ordinary (unbranded) soap. It relied on the judgment
in <a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_2">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Limited v. Naga Limited &amp; Others</a>: 2003 (26)
PTC 535 (Del.), where it was allegedly held that Reckitt‟s soap is not an
antiseptic soap. The defendant alleged that Reckitt does not have a monopoly
over the colour or over the shape of the soap and cannot claim exclusivity
over the colour, shape or packaging of the soap. The defendant further stated
that the shape, contours and curvatures of Reckitt‟s orange coloured soap
DETTOL was not registered under the Design‟s Act to give it an exclusive
right to use it.
</p>
<p id="p_14">8. The defendant stated that it marketed several toilet soaps including one
under the brand name "LIFEBUOY" through an extensive marketing
network across the country and that it enjoys considerable goodwill and
reputation among the Indian consumers. It is stated that LIFEBUOY is a
global brand which was launched in the United Kingdom in 1894 as a
product for personal hygiene and that it is India‟s oldest toilet soap brand and
has been synonymous with health and hygiene in India since 1895. The
defendant alleged that the said product sold under the brand name
LIFEBUOY for over 110 years has acquired substantial goodwill in the
market and has become a household name. The defendant denied that its
advertisement disparaged Reckitt‟s product and said that it aims at educating
the consumers and public at large to understand the difference between toilet
soaps containing glycerine, which have a moisturizing effect on the skin and




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 7
 give a long term benefit on the one hand and ordinary antiseptic soaps in the
market on the other which may not contain glycerin and do not give to the
consumers the benefit of moisturizing the skin and removing the possibility
of formation of cracks which is a breeding ground for germs. It is further
stated that the defendant‟s claims about its soap being better than any other
ordinary antiseptic soap is based on the laboratory test conducted by it.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9. The defendant urged that its TV advertisement had to be seen in totality
and not in an isolated and unnatural manner, frame by frame. The defendant
contended that the intent, manner, story line and message of its
advertisement are that its soap is better than ordinary antiseptic soaps
because it is rich in glycerin and vitamin E. Further, the defendant stated that
Reckitt‟s soap, a Rs.200 crore brand, cannot be termed as an ordinary soap
and in any event, is not an antiseptic soap. In the entire advertisement, there
is no reference whatsoever to the trademark DETTOL or the sword device
and, therefore, there is no reference to Reckitt‟s product, argues the
defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">10. Denying that the impugned advertisement described Reckitt‟s soap, the
defendant outlined points of distinction. Again, the narration of the Single
Judge in this regard is set out below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "(a) The colour of the soap shown in defendant‟s advertisement is
       yellow in comparison to the plaintiff‟s orange soap; (b) The soap
       shown in defendant‟s advertisement is taken out of a pale green
       single-colour packaging, whereas the plaintiff‟s DETTOL TOTAL is
       sold in green and white and its other variants are sold in blue and
       white packaging; (c) There are many other soaps in the market with
       curvatures and contours similar to the plaintiff‟s soap. (d) The brand




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                            Page 8
        name DETTOL and/or the Sword device are embossed on all the
       plaintiff‟s products but the same are admittedly missing from the soap
       shown in the defendant‟s advertisement."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">11.    Without prejudice to its pleas that the impugned advertisement did not
describe or refer to Reckitt‟s product, the defendant stated, arguendo, if the
soap shown in the defendant‟s advertisement was that of Reckitt,
nevertheless a tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be the best in the
world, irrespective of the truth of that statement. It can be said that a
tradesman‟s goods are better than his competitors; though such statement
may be untrue. To say that one‟s goods are the best in the world or are better
than that of the competitors one can even spell out the advantages of his
goods over that of others. Reckitt itself has been showing that its soap is
better than that of the defendant‟s in its various advertisements, both in India
and abroad.
</p>
<p id="p_18">12.    The following issues were framed in the suit, for adjudication:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "1. Whether the depiction in the advertisement of the defendant of
       soap refers to the Dettol soap of the plaintiff? (OPP)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       2. Whether the advertisement of the defendant disparages or
       denigrates the soap of the plaintiff? (OPP)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       3. Whether the impugned advertisement seeks only to promote the
       superiority of the defendant LIFEBUOY soap over an ordinary
       antiseptic soap? (OPD)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       4. Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material facts? If so,
       its effect? (OPD)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       5. Whether the impugned advertisement constitutes an attack on the
       goodwill and reputation of the Dettol brand of the plaintiff? (OPP)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">        6. Whether the present suit is barred on account of the provisions of
       the MRTP Act, 1969 and/or the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_3">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986?
       (OPD)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       7. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any damages for disparagement,

</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">13. Reckitt relied on documents, Ext. PW1/1 to PW1/19 and PW1/DX1.
HUL relied on Ext. DW1/1 to DW1/18 and DW2/1 to DW2/9. The video
clip of the advertisement was filed in a compact disc (Ext. PW1/2). Reckitt
produced one witness (PW-1) - Mr. Mohit Marwah, its Brand Manager. The
defendant relied on testimonies of three witnesses - (1) Mr. Anuj Kumar
Rustagi, Global Marketing Manager, Lifebuoy Soaps (DW1); (2) Dr. Rajan
Raghavachari, Regional Senior Product Development Manager of the
defendant (DW2) and (3) Dr Hemangi Jerajani, Dermatologist (DW3).
Affidavits of the witnesses in the first instance formed their examination in
chief and they were subjected to cross-examination by the opposing counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_20">14. The Court had the benefit of considering the suit records, including the
video clip of the offending advertisement (Ext. PW1/2). The observations of
the Single Judge describing the story board are extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "1. A man and his wife returning home on a rainy day. The wife
       exclaims "Kya baarish hai" (what rain). The man places his white
       coat and stethoscope which indicates that he is a doctor. He goes and
       sits with his children (boy and girl) on the sofa. The children are
       watching a cricket match on television.

       "chalo main naha leti hoon" (come, let me take a bath). She is then
       shown taking out an orange bar of soap from a green wrapper.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       3. On seeing the orange soap in his wife‟s hand, the husband has a
       shocked look on his face and says "Oh God, bachaa lena" (Oh God,

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       4. The next frames show the husband and children pointing at the wife
       and singing a song in chorus "Naadaan ko aql dena, ham sab ko

       medicine).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">       7. This is followed by a cut to a bathing shot where a woman is shown
       using the said orange bar of soap. In this cut, there is a male voice-

       LIFEBUOY soap emerging out of the water. On the top left hand
       corner of the screen, the words "Glycerine" and "vitamin E" appear



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 11

       (that is why, new Lifebuoy Skin Guard).

       magnifying glass and the green germs are seen getting washed away.
       The male voice-over states that :

<p id="p_26">       12. The clip then proceeds to a new cut showing the wife, apparently
       after having had a bath, coming into the living room where the
       husband and children are watching the cricket match on television.
       On seeing her they, once again break into the same song "Bachaa
       lena" (Save us).

       (Aa hah, doctor saheb, save the prayers for them).

       (new Lifebuoy Skin Guard).

<p id="p_31">       16. This is followed by a cut to the Hindustan Lever Limited logo and
       the advertisement ends there."
</p>
<p id="p_32">15.    After making a detailed frame by frame description of the offending
advertisement, the learned Single Judge held that:
</p>



<p id="p_33">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                      Page 12
        "The new shape of the DETTOL Original toilet soap with the curved
       edges and the curvature in the middle is clearly displayed on the
       product packaging, which is further indicative of the importance given
       to the shape by the plaintiff in its marketing of the product. The
       packaging (Ext. PW1/8) also establishes the fact that although white is
       also used, green is the pre-dominant colour. Although, the brand
       name, logo or the sword device does not appear in the orange bar of
       soap shown in the advertisement (Ext. PW1/2), there can be no
       misgiving that the bar of soap which has been shown in the said
       advertisement is of a colour similar to that of the plaintiff‟s DETTOL
       soap. The contours, curvature as well as the overall shape of the
       orange bar of soap in the advertisement itself, are virtually the same
       as that of the contours, curvature and overall shape of the plaintiff‟s
       DETTOL Original soap. Moreover, the clear impression given in the
       advertisement is that the said orange bar of soap has been taken out
       from a green wrapper/ packaging. It must also be noted that the
       design of the plaintiff‟s soap has been registered by the plaintiff as
       indicated by Ext. PW1/DX-1. While it is true that there may be other
       orange coloured soaps and other soaps sold in the pre-dominantly
       green packaging and other soaps which have an oval shape, it is also
       true that it is only the plaintiff‟s soap which has a combination of all
       the three elements, i.e., orange colour, curved oval shape and pre-
       dominantly green packaging. Apart from this, it is only the plaintiff‟s
       soap which has contours in the manner indicated in the bar of soap in
       the said advertisement. No evidence has been produced by the
       defendant to show that there is any ordinary antiseptic soap with the
       same combination of the aforesaid elements of colour, shape, design
       and packaging. I have absolutely no doubt that the orange bar of soap
       shown in the advertisement refers to the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original
       soap."
</p>
<p id="p_34">16.    The learned Single Judge conceded that though Reckitt‟s soap was not
an antiseptic soap, and therefore, facially the defendant was not referring to
DETTOL, yet the long association of Reckitt with antiseptic products and
medications in the general public‟s mind led to the belief that the offending
soap was that of Reckitt, and an antiseptic one at that. The Single Judge then




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 13
 rejected the defendant‟s argument that there had to be proof of
disparagement through oral testimony of witnesses:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">       "It has been contended on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff has
       not produced any evidence of consumers to indicate that the orange
       bar of soap in the said advertisement appears to be the plaintiff‟s
       DETTOL Original soap. In response the learned counsel for the
       plaintiff submitted that producing such evidence would be counter-
       productive and is not necessary. He submitted that the plaintiff could
       produce witnesses stating that the orange bar of soap shown in the
       advertisement had reference to the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original soap.</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">       Similarly, the defendant could also produce witnesses to state the
       contrary. Ultimately, it would be for the court to make a judgment
       from the perspective of an average person with imperfect recollection,
       a test which has been well established, particularly in passing off
       cases. Though slander of goods and disparaging advertisements stand
       on a slightly different footing to passing off cases, I find myself to be
       in agreement with the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
       plaintiff. Ultimately it is a question of perception and the perception
       has to be determined from the stand point of an average person man
       with imperfect recollection but, with a corollary, which shall stated be
       shortly. One could normally expect that there would be a difference in
       perception between two distinct classes of persons -- (1) Persons who
       are using DETTOL Original soap and (2) persons who do not use that
       soap. A person belonging to the latter category may not be aware of
       the orange coloured bar of soap of the plaintiff with its distinctive
       shape, curvature and contours. He may also not be aware of the
       packaging employed by the plaintiff. Therefore, such a person may not
       link the bar of soap shown in the advertisement with the plaintiff‟s
       product when he sees the advertisement or when he comes upon the
       plaintiff‟s product in a shop. Such a person, in all likelihood, would
       perceive the orange bar of soap shown in the advertisement as being
       some unbranded bar of soap. On the other hand, a person belonging
       to the former category, being a user of the plaintiff‟s DETTOL
       Original soap, would immediately recognise the bar of soap shown in
       the advertisement as referring to the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original
       soap. This is because, such a person is familiar with the plaintiff‟s




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 14
        product. He is "intimately" aware of the look and feel of the soap
       because he uses it everyday."
</p><p id="p_36">After the above analysis, the impugned judgement proceeded to hold as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">       "The difference in approach in a passing off action and one for
       disparagement must also be highlighted. In a case of passing off, the
       question invariably is whether the trade mark or trade dress employed
       by A for his product is so deceptively similar to the established mark
       or trade dress of B‟s product that A‟s product could be confused by
       or passed off to consumers as B‟s product? Here the comparison is of
       rival products having a similar trade mark, get-up or trade dress.
       Familiarity with the established mark, trade dress or get-up is
       presumed. Because, it is this familiarity that the person intending to
       pass off his goods as those of the famous or more popular, exploits. In
       the case of disparagement, the one who disparages another‟s product,
       does not seek to make his product similar to the disparaged product,
       but to distinguish it from the disparaged product. The object of
       disparagement is to make the disparaged product appear to be as near
       or similar to the competitor‟s product. The comparisons, therefore, in
       cases of passing off and in cases of disparagement are different.
       Consequently, the comparison must be from the perspective of an
       average person with imperfect recollection but, that person must be
       picked from the category of users of the product allegedly sought to be
       disparaged or slandered.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">       27. Considered from the standpoint of an average man with imperfect
       recollection who is also a user of the DETTOL Original soap, the
       inescapable conclusion would be that the soap shown in the
       advertisement refers to the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original soap.
       Consequently Issue No 1 is decided in favour of the plaintiff and
       against the defendant."</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">       On the second issue, i.e. whether the impugned advertisement
promoted the defendant‟s product, the Court held that the advertisement
could be divided into two parts: one of those disparaged Reckitt‟s product
and the other sought to promote the defendant‟s product. It was held that



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 15
 though an attempt at promoting the defendant‟s product - which was
permissible - was discernible, yet the net result of the advertisement was to
disparage Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original. The Court held that the materials
relied on by Reckitt were insufficient to entitle it to compensatory or general
damages. However, Hindustan Lever‟s conduct was held to be such as to
entitle Reckitt to punitive damages, which the learned Single Judge
quantified at Rs. 5,00,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_38">Appellant‟s contentions

</p><p id="p_39">17.    The appellant/HUL contends that Reckitt could not have maintained
the suit since it was guilty of unfair conduct. It was submitted in this regard
that though Reckitt concedes that its product is not an antiseptic soap but at
the same time it unfairly maintains that the impugned advertisement
disparages and denigrates its products. It is submitted in this regard that the
advertisement merely cautions the viewers and the members of the public
that antiseptic soap tends to injure the skin. It is not Reckitt‟s contention that
its soap is an antiseptic soap. This important aspect escaped the notice of the
learned Single Judge. The suit, therefore, was not maintainable at all.
Learned counsel in this context relied upon the observations of the learned
Single Judge in paragraph 23 of the impugned judgment to the effect that
Reckitt‟s soap - Dettol Original - is not an antiseptic soap whereas the soap
in the advertisement is referred to as an "ordinary antiseptic soap".
However, it was argued that nevertheless the impugned judgment
erroneously held that the public at large carried an impression that all Dettol
products are antiseptic. Furthermore, submitted learned counsel, Reckitt even




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                           Page 16
 had claimed that its product was recommended by the Indian Medical
Association (IMA) - advertised prominently on the cover too.
</p>
<p id="p_40">18.    Elaborating on this aspect, learned counsel submitted that Reckitt did
not in fact have a cause of action at all because the Dettol Original is a toilet
soap, concededly bearing BIS specification IS:2888; 2004. However, the
comparison made in the advertisement is against an ordinary antiseptic soap,
an entirely different article or product falling within the BIS specification
IS:11479; 1985. Learned counsel relied upon the ruling of this Court in
<a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_4">Reckitt Benckiser India Limited v. Naga Ltd</a>., 104 (2003) DLT 490. It was
argued next that the learned Single Judge did not apply the proper test
applicable in disparagement of goods/products disparagement cases. Learned
counsel here submitted that the appropriate test applicable is whether a
reasonable man with average intelligence can identify Reckitt‟s products in
the advertisement. It was emphasized that the overall or the totality of
impression test in the same medium (of communication) has to be applied in
this context. Learned counsel faulted the learned Single Judge for applying
the test of confusion, properly applicable in passing-off actions. Reliance was
placed upon the meaning of the expression "disparagement" given in the
New International Webster‟s Comprehensive Dictionary, i.e. "to speak of
slightingly or undervalue or bring discredit or dishonor upon ..." It was
submitted that in considering whether a statement is denigrating or
otherwise, the Court should give the statement or material in question its
natural and ordinary meaning. In this context, learned counsel relied upon
the decision reported as Gillic v. British Broadcasting Corporation 1996
EMLR and the discussion in Clerk and Lindsells Treatise or Torts (20th




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 17
 Edition) Common Law Library, published by Sweet &amp; Maxwell, it was
emphasized that the question whether the statement is defamatory or
disparaging depends on the probability of the case and the natural tendency
of the publication, having regard to the surrounding circumstances and not
the intention of the defendant. Reliance was placed upon the judgment
reported as Keays v. Murdock Magazines, 1991 (1) WLR 1184. It was
submitted further that the learned Single Judge fell into error in holding that
the target group of persons to whom the impugned advertisement was made,
was the one who used the product as they would know how it looks. It was
stressed that this conclusion was illogical because then it would not be a case
of imperfect recollection. Besides, argued counsel, this flies on the face of
the well-accepted proposition that words are not defamatory if they may
damage the man in the eyes of a section of community unless they amount to
disparagement in the eyes of the right-thinking people of the entire general
public. Counsel also took exception to what he termed as a minute and
elaborate analysis of the impugned advertisement by the learned Single
Judge. He argued that the Court should have considered the overall effect,
rather than a bits and pieces approach in detailed scrutiny of the various
elements of the advertisement. Counsel relied on Skuse v. Grenada [1993]
EWCA Civ 34, in support of this argument. It was next argued that the
learned Single Judge could not have found, upon the fair assessment of the
materials on record, that there was disparagement of Reckitt‟s Dettol
Original soap.
</p>
<p id="p_41">19.    Learned Senior counsel, Shri Sandeep Sethi, underlined that to arrive
at such a conclusion it was essential for Reckitt to have led evidence by way




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 18
 of oral testimony of some consumers who saw the advertisement of Dettol
ordinary and found that its effect was to run-down the reputation and
goodwill or cause injury in their eyes. The absence of this material,
submitted counsel, undermined the findings of the learned Single Judge.
Reliance was placed upon the decision <a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_5">Colgate Palmolive v. Hindustan
Lever</a>, 1999 (7) SCC 1. Reliance was also placed upon <a href="/doc/1839492/" id="a_6">Reckitt and Coleman
of India Ltd. v. Jyothi Laboratories</a>, 1999 (2) Cal. LT 230. Learned counsel
argued that none of the witnesses produced by Reckitt could be characterized
as genuine members of the public since they were all either its officials or
associated with it.
</p>
<p id="p_42">20.    HUL further argued, through senior counsel, Sh. Sandeep Sethi, that
the impugned advertisement has not been considered in its totality by the
learned Single Judge, but considered it frame-by-frame and in bits and pieces
to hold that it disparaged Reckitt‟s Dettol Original soap. Learned counsel
relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Lakhanpal v. MRTP
Commission, AIR 1989 SC 1692. It was next urged that since the impugned
findings do not apply the proper test of overall effect but was based upon an
intense frame-by-frame analysis of the advertisement, highlighting the soap,
the packaging, the colours and the shape, the conclusions were distorted. It
was also emphasized that the learned Single Judge fell into error in holding
that the impugned advertisement contains a combination of three elements,
i.e. orange colour, curved shape and prominently green packaging. Learned
counsel relied upon the decision reported as <a href="/doc/664493/" id="a_7">Colgate Palmolive v. Mr. Patel</a>
2005 (31) PTC 583 (Del) to say that no one can claim monopoly over
colours and consequently Reckitt could neither claim monopoly over the




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                       Page 19
 orange colour nor the overall green packaging which were common colours.
However, the comparison made in the advertisement was with ordinary
antiseptic soap. Learned counsel further stressed that intense frame-by-frame
scrutiny has prejudiced the mind of the learned Single Judge since it
completely overshadowed the overall effect. The time given for depicting the
shape (with colour), packaging of HUL‟s soap and the so-called disparaging
comments having regard to the overall length of the advertisement, was
miniscule and disproportionately low - less than five per-cent. This could
not have resulted in disparagement at all - a very important aspect
overlooked by the learned Single Judge. Learned counsel also submitted that
in this intensive analysis, the impugned judgment overlooked a very
significant aspect which was that Reckitt‟s packaging of its Dettol soap,
claimed in the plaint was the white and green colour combination. The
impugned judgment, on the other hand, erroneously held that the green
packaging depicted in the advertisement was a pointed reference to that of
Reckitt‟s product. In other words, submitted the counsel, Reckitt‟s case was
that its white and green colour combined packaging had attained
distinctiveness whereas the impugned advertisement was green and no
evidence was led by Reckitt to establish that it packaged its products in that
manner.
</p>
<p id="p_43">21.    Sh. Sandeep Sethi next argued that the learned Single Judge failed to
consider the evidence of HUL and in particular, the affidavit evidence of
DW-1 along with the photographs, DW-1/1, DW-1/2 and DW-1/3. These
documents were photographs of various branded and unbranded orange
coloured soaps (DW-1/1); of various orange coloured antiseptic soaps (DW-
</p>



<p id="p_44">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 20
 1/2) and green and while packaging (DW-1/3). It was argued in this context
that orange is a common product colour in the market in both branded and
unbranded soaps and that there are several orange coloured antiseptic soaps
with green and white packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_45">22.    Learned counsel also submitted that Reckitt could have led
appropriate survey evidence that consumers involved in all orange coloured
soaps in a curvature and green packaging associated them with the Dettol
Original toilet soap. There was complete lack of such evidence. In these
circumstances, the appropriate course for the learned Single Judge was to
draw an adverse inference against Reckitt and not to decide the case on the
basis that such evidence or the lack of it was of no consequence. This led to
failure of justice because the evidence led by the defendant, i.e. HUL was
not taken into consideration. Likewise, submitted learned counsel, the
finding that the customer associated the term "ordinary antiseptic soap"
referred to in the impugned advertisement with Reckitt‟s product is based
upon an assumption and does not rest on any material or evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_46">23.    Learned senior counsel next submitted that to succeed in its suit for
disparagement, not only did Reckitt have to prove that the impugned
statement was concerning his goods but also that it was false and malicious,
i.e. with intent to cause injury. Reliance was placed upon the decisions
reported as White v. Mellin, 1895 AC 154; <a href="/doc/845286/" id="a_8">Imperial Tobacco Company v.
Albert Bonnan</a>, AIR 1928 Cal 1. It was submitted that the learned Single
Judge failed to consider the evidence led by HUL to establish that the
laboratory test reports produced as DW-2/1, DW-2/2, DW-2/3 and DW-2/7
substantiated the claim that ordinary antiseptic soaps were not of the same




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                       Page 21
 standard as HUL‟s "Skin Guard". Thus, the truth of the statement that
Reckitt‟s advertisement regarding its Skin Guard toilet soap which had
moisturizing content was more beneficial than antiseptic soaps which had the
tendency to cause injury to the skin. This error, in the submission of HUL‟s
counsel, clearly goes to the root of the matter since Reckitt could not have in
these circumstances stated that the claims made in the advertisement were
false. Thus, the second element, i.e. the truth of the statement having been
proved was established by HUL, the suit had to necessarily fail.
</p>
<p id="p_47">24.    Learned counsel faulted the impugned judgment in granting plaintiff‟s
claim for punitive damages even after holding that no special damage had
been proved. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court
referred to as <a href="/doc/1672252/" id="a_9">Organo Chemical Industries v. Union of India</a>, 1979 (4) SCC
</p><p id="p_48">1. It was stated that this approves the grant of such punitive damages.
Learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of the Court of Appeals in
Broome v. Cassel and Co., 1972 AC 1027 to submit that grant of punitive or
special damages even while the Court is unable to grant any general or
compensatory damages, is without authority of law. Learned counsel further
relied upon the decision in <a href="/doc/1994429/" id="a_10">Microsoft Corporation v. Deepak Rawal</a>, 2007
(35) PTC 478 (Delhi) to say that the rationale of awarding punitive damages
is to deter the wrong-doer from indulging in unlawful activities which have a
criminal propensity. He submitted that the reliance on Times Corporation v.
Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) by the learned Single Judge was
inappropriate. Learned counsel emphasized that the latter decision had
discredited the binding judgment of the Supreme Court in Organo Chemical
Industries (supra).
</p>



<p id="p_49">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 22
 Contentions of Reckitt Reckitt Benckiser

</p><p id="p_50">25.    It was argued on behalf of Reckitt Benckiser, the plaintiff, by Mr.
C.M. Lall, learned counsel that an overall reading of the rival pleadings,
particularly the allegations in paragraph 23 of the plaint and the
corresponding averments in the written statement clearly demonstrate that
the claim was in respect of reputation and goodwill of Reckitt soap under the
trademark Dettol with its new curved shape, orange colour, distinct green
and white packaging and the reputation it enjoyed. Learned counsel
emphasized that to establish this claim, adequate evidence in the form of
design registration of the soap, Ex. DW-1/DX-1 and the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_11">Design Act</a>,
conferred exclusivity. However, PW-1, in the deposition clearly stated that
the soap, Ex.PW-1/8 and the wrapper served as a trademark and was
displayed in the product packaging and that no other soap was available in
that unique shape in India or elsewhere. Learned counsel underlined that
there was no cross-examination on this issue. Likewise, there was no cross-
examination about the sales figures at the time of its launch in May 2006, in
the form of statement, Ex.PW-1/10. Likewise, PW-1 had asserted that the
orange colour of the soap and the green coloured packaging were identifying
features for Reckitt‟s Dettol toilet soap. On this too, there was no cross-
examination.
</p>
<p id="p_51">26.    Learned counsel next submitted that in another suit filed by HUL, a
copy of which was produced as Ex. PW-1/16, an admission was made that
Dettol had launched a toilet soap. That suit claimed relief against the
advertisement which were produced in the present case, i.e. DW-1/11, DW-
1/12, DW-1/13 and DW-1/14. It was submitted that the orange coloured




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                       Page 23
 Dettol soap with unique shape could be seen in the story board in that suit.
Learned counsel relied upon the examination-in-chief of DW-1 and the
evidence, DW-1/15, produced in the form of sales data collected by an
independent agency, IMRB to establish that sales figure of Dettol Original
undergo changes in summers and winters. Learned counsel emphasized that
the written statement admitted the extensive sales of Reckitt‟s product, in
paragraph 9 and DW-1 had admitted to purchasing Dettol Original soap and
thereafter developing the offending advertisement. In this regard, learned
counsel relied upon paragraph 11. It was contended that the impugned
judgment has adopted the correct approach with respect to proof of
disparagement. Learned counsel submitted that the conclusion arrived at by
the learned Single Judge, i.e. that evidence of consumers would tend to
cancel out the effect of each other, was a common sense and a practical
method at resolving what was obviously to be decided by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_52">27.    On the question whether HUL‟s advertisement disparages or
denigrates Reckitt‟s soap, Shri Lal relies on an admission in the former‟s
written statement. It reads as:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">       "23 ... It is further submitted that the defendant advertisement is
       dissuading the public from using the unbranded antiseptic soap"</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">       (emphasis supplied)
This averment, submits Reckitt, is relevant as it establishes that the attack is
on the rival product and not mere puffery of HLL‟s product. Counsel
underlined that this constitutes an admission of malice and passes the test of
malice set out in Imperial Tobacco Co. (i.e. it is "done with the direct object
of injuring the other person‟s business."). Likewise, the averment in
paragraph 20 of the plaint is relied to say that it lists the denigration made



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 24
 and includes the representation that use of DETTOL soap in fact invites
germs to the body which are then killed and washed away with the
LIFEBUOY soap of the defendant. Counsel highlights that in the story line
the husband (a doctor) and the children, the most influential people in the life
of a housewife, repeatedly mock at the mother for using DETTOL by use of
the term "bacha lena" (save) repeatedly. This clearly constitutes
denigration. This is a direct attack on Reckitt‟s "surakshit parivar" (secure
family) advertisement campaign, which is alluded to in paragraph 14 of the
plaint. Counsel also relies on the following averments to say that denigration
and malice are specifically pleaded in the plaint, in particular:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">       ".....a bare viewing of the said advertisement will be sufficient to
       convince this Hon‟ble Court of the malicious intention of the
       Defendant to increase the market share of its LIFEBUOY soap by
       tarnishing the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff‟s popular
       product." (paragraph 18)
       "....the impugned advertisement is nothing but a slanderous attempt of
       the defendant to increase market share of its LIFEBUOY soap by
       defaming and disparaging the worth and reputation of the plaintiff‟s
       product." (paragraph 21).
</blockquote><p id="p_54">It is argued that the impugned advertisement not only shows that the
defendant‟s product is good but also very clearly depicts that Reckitt‟s
product is completely worthless.
</p>
<p id="p_55">28.    Mr. Lal contends that Reckitt has led positive evidence, Ex.PW-1/13
in the form of a test report of an independent agency to establish that
DETTOL soap is 10 times more efficacious at reducing bacterial and fungal
cell counts than LIFEBUOY. It is submitted that PW-1 was cross-examined
on this issue and that HUL‟s representation that DETTOL causes germ




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 25
 formation is therefore completely false. It is urged that HUL too admits that
DETTOL is more than 10 times more efficacious than its LIFEBUOY soap
with actives, and a reference is made to Ex. PW-1/17, where in a previous
judgment, a learned Single Judge of this court recorded that admission (by
HUL, plaintiff in that suit) in the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">       "The statement in the advertisement that DETTOL is 10 times more
       efficacious is in comparison with those soaps which are without
       actives. Therefore, this statement would not have any reference to the
       plaintiff‟s LIFEBUOY soaps and even otherwise the said statement is
       claimed to be true by the defendant no.1 and the plaintiff could not
       dispute that if DETTOL soap is to be compared with soaps without
       actives, then this statement is factually correct."
</blockquote><p id="p_56">It is stated that HUL itself has led evidence to establish that Reckitt‟s soap
and its soap are comparable in reducing bacterial count; Ex.DW-2/1 and
Ex.DW-2/3 are referred to for this purpose. These, submits Reckitt, establish
that Dettol Original (0.961%) has higher levels of Trichloro Carbanilide
(TCC), which is the ingredient that helps reduce bacterial count, when
compared to Lifebuoy Skin Guard (0.227%). That TCC is an anti-microbial
active is admitted on in Para (vii) of the written statement. It is argued that
the plaintiff, Reckitt, has discharged the onus that the depiction of Dettol, as
the standard of proof indicated in <a href="/doc/1839492/" id="a_12">Reckitt &amp; Coleman of India Ltd. v. Jyothi
Laboratories Ltd., Cal LT</a> 1999 (2) HC 230, has thus been discharged.
Counsel additionally submits that Ex.DW-2/7 further establishes that out of a
sample of 31 people on whom tests were conducted with the rival products,
on four people Dettol Original caused less dryness and irritation to the skin
than Lifebuoy Skin Guard. On six people, the irritation levels were the same.
On 8 people, the irritation count was less than three. Therefore, they did not

 get skin irritation from either product. On 12 people HUL‟s product caused
skin irritation of the level of four or above. HUL‟s own report, therefore,
established the falsity of its claims made in the advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_57">29.    It is next urged that HUL‟s entire written statement is based upon
"laboratory test conducted" by it. (paragraph 6 of the written statement).
DW-1 has admitted that "prior to the launch of Lifebuoy Skin Guard soap",
he procured the Dettol Original soap of Reckitt and only "thereafter"
developed the offending advertisement (paragraph 11). All tests conducted
by HUL are after the launch of the impugned advertisement. Reckitt‟s test
report, that DETTOL is 10 times more efficacious was available with HUL.
This clearly established malice on its part, it is argued.
</p>
<p id="p_58">30.    On the fourth issue, i.e. if Reckitt was guilty of suppress of material
facts, it is urged that <a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_13">Reckitt Benckiser (India) v. Naga Ltd</a>. [104 (2003) DLT
490] related to a different advertising campaign of Reckitt and against a
different defendant and was based on completely different facts and had no
relevance to the present proceedings. It is argued that Reckitt has always
been careful in ensuring that the distinction between its DETTOL liquid and
DETTOL toilet soap is maintained in the plaint and in the market place. The
description of DETTOL soap as a toilet soap can be seen in paragraphs 7, 8,
9, 19(i) and 19(iii) of the suit, and discuss how the DETTOL brand has been
extended from an antiseptic liquid to a toilet soap. However nowhere is a
claim made that DETTOL has any antiseptic quality. On the fifth issue, i.e.
whether the impugned advertisement constitutes an attack on Reckitt‟s
goodwill and reputation, the arguments based on HUL‟s evidence is
reiterated.

<p id="p_59">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 27
</p><p id="p_60"> 31.    It is argued further that the proceedings in the present case being a
civil claim are not barred. Reckitt‟s counsel relies on <a href="/doc/785641/" id="a_14">Section 9</a>, CPC which
outlines jurisdiction of civil courts and states that such power can ousted
where cognizance is "expressly or impliedly barred." In this context, Section
4 of the MRTP Act is relied on to say that application of other laws is not
barred. Even the provisions of <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_15">Section 12B</a> of the said Act - points out Mr.
Lal - clarify that the powers of the MRTP Commission are "without
prejudice to the right of such Government, trader or class of traders or
consumer or institute a suit." Reliance is placed on the judgment of a
learned Single Judge in Citicorp. v. Todi Investors, 2006 (23) PTC 631
(Del). It is, therefore, argued that there is no express or implied bar in the
MRTP Act and on the contrary, a specific provision saves the rights under
other laws. Furthermore, counsel submits that the common law remedy of
false advertising existed prior to the enactment of the MRTP Act which
came into existence in 1969. It did not bar the common law remedies.
Learned counsel also argues that the MRTP Act is essentially a consumer
protection statute and not a statute designed to protect the rights of one
competitor against the other. Such a competitor therefore must only approach
the Civil Court and not the MRTP Commission. Consumers on the other
hand must approach the MRTP and not the Civil Courts.

<p id="p_61">Damages: Reckitt‟s counter claim

</p><p id="p_62">32.    As to the issue of damages, it is contended that Reckitt established in
Issue No.1 and 5 its reputation in its DETTOL soaps. HUL in its written
statement admitted to "plaintiff‟s soap being a Rs.200 crore brand."
Therefore, any denigration caused will be caused to at least a Rs. 200 crore




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 28
 brand. This will be the first important consideration for evaluating damages.
Reliance is placed on Ex.PW-1/19, a comparative table of the channels in
which advertisements of both products appear. This, Mr. Lal argues,
establishes how HUL targeted many of channels on which Reckitt advertises.
This fact is set out in Para 23 of the examination-in-chief of PW-1. Likewise,
counsel relied on Ex.DW-1/12 to DW-1/14, advertisements by Reckitt. In
each advertisement a mother is portrayed encouraging her child to bathe with
DETTOL soap. The defendant‟s advertisement has denigrated and
undermined this entire advertisement campaign which admittedly was run
„on various TV channels" and was "viewed by consumers and public at
large" "on almost daily basis during different hours." Admittedly, these
advertisements "are telecast during children‟s houses for TV viewing and
also shown prominently in between family serials for universal viewing"
(counsel points out that all these are averments from the written statement).
HUL‟s advertisement has seriously damaged Reckitt‟s campaign by showing
the children now mocking at their mother for using DETTOL soap. This fact
was spoken to by PW-1 in his examination-in-chief. It is submitted that the
extent of damages can be determined by how extensively HUL used the
offending advertisement. Ex.DW-1/16 to Ex.DW-1/18 establish the extent of
this usage. A channel-wise break-up of the advertisement and the times that
it was repeated is clearly set out in Ex.DW-1/18. It is contended that DW-
1/17 shows how sales of HUL‟s soap in the advertisement have increased. A
large part of this is attributable to the advertisement in issue. This is
specifically mentioned in the evidence of PW-1 at paragraph 26. Mr. Lal also
urged the Court to set aside the findings of the learned Single Judge with
respect to refusal to grant any general damages and pressed the counter claim



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                       Page 29
 of Reckitt, limited to this extent. He submitted that there were sufficient
materials on record, empirically, to realistically evaluate general damages in
the manner known to law. Counsel stressed that though the advertisement
was for 30 seconds, its impact was widespread, since the defendant HUL had
targeted every channel that had been used by Reckitt; it was pointed out that
the advertisement was telecast no less than 4441 times between end June and
August, 2007. Furthermore Reckitt‟s DETTOL brand admittedly was worth
Rs. 200 crores at that time. It was also urged that a total quantity of 9132
tons of the article, DETTOL Original, was manufactured during the period
January to June, 2007 and that the marketing expenses for that soap, in its
new shape was Rs. 23.6 crores for the latter half of that year. Counsel
pointed out that the admitted advertising expense in respect of LIFEBUOY
which was the subject of the impugned advertisement for one month alone
(July 2007) was Rs. 2.5 crores, according to the testimony of DW-1. Based
on these facts, the learned Single Judge should have awarded general (or
compensatory) damages, upon a fair assessment. It was submitted that in
disparagement (of products and goods) or slander to title, it is not easy to
assess the extent of harm or injury as it might not be always discernible in
the short term and may have long term effect, having regard to market
forces.
</p>
<p id="p_63">33.    HUL argues and its counsel, Mr Sethi, submits that the learned Single
Judge correctly evaluated the evidence and held that general damages should
not be awarded. Counsel submitted that production figures or amounts spend
towards publicity or even the number of times that the impugned
advertisement was published has little relevance to the issue of damages.
</p>



<p id="p_64">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 30
 What is important is that the plaintiff has to establish that it suffered injury
capable of assessment in monetary terms, which it could not, in the facts of
the present case. Therefore, counsel concluded that the findings of the
learned Single Judge did not call for interference.
</p>
<p id="p_65">Analysis and conclusions

</p><p id="p_66">34.    The law recognizes that tradesmen and manufacturers may commend
their goods and state that they are better than those of rival traders. Yet this
is with an important caution that the publisher or advertiser should not make
any false representation as to the quality or character of the rival or
competitor‟s goods or products. If no such false representation (as to the
character or quality of the rival‟s goods) is made, the advertisement of a
tradesman howsoever commendatory or exaggerated cannot result in an
actionable claim. Exaggerated claims sans such false representations are
known as „puffing‟. This license - to puff - was recognized in Bubbuck v.
Wilkinson, 1899 (1) OB 86 where the Lindlay MR observed that mere
statement that the defendant‟s goods are better than the plaintiff would not
be actionable. This reasoning was upheld in Allen v. Flood, 1898 AC 1.
Lindlay MR held that mere puffing would not be actionable because it would
"open a very wide door to litigation and might expose every man who said
its goods were better than another‟s to the risk of action". This was echoed
in White v. Mellin, 1895 AC 154 (widely cited by Indian Courts):
</p>

       advertising rival productions by obtaining judicial determination
       which of the two was the better".

 The determinative considerations were described in Cellacite &amp; British

1928 Calcutta 1 (DB), the Court held that to succeed in an action of slander

of injuring his business. In India, the decisions of various Courts, namely,
<a href="/doc/226414/" id="a_17">Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. Colgate Palmolive (I) Ltd. and Anr</a>., 1998 (1) SCC

(supra). <a href="/doc/1507971/" id="a_20">In Dabur India Ltd. v. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd</a>, 2004 (29) PTC

</p>
<p id="p_70">36.    HUL complains that the impugned judgment does not err in its
understanding of the law or the guiding principles but as to their application.
It is contended that the learned Single Judge even after noticing the law
incorrectly concluded that HUL‟s products disparage Reckitt‟s Dettol
Original. In its argument, HUL mainly contends that a frame by frame
analysis of the advertisement coupled with the „average man with imperfect
recollection‟ test applied by the learned Single Judge has resulted in
distorted conclusions. It is also emphasized in this context that the Court
overlooked that the plaintiff did not present any or evidence proof and that
instead the Single Judge sought to judge the advertisement from the stand
point of a common or reasonable man without any witnesses‟ deposition that
could have been tested through cross examination. This Court proposes to
address each of these submissions in turn.
</p>
<p id="p_71">37.    Slander of goods is a species or branch of the law of defamation. It is
widely accepted that to be defamatory, an imputation must tend to lower the
claimant in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally,
(i.e., the reference to the „common‟ or „reasonable‟ man). The standard that
the statement must amount to „disparagement of ... the reputation in the eyes
of right thinking men generally‟ was spelt out in Leetham v. Rank (1912) 57
SJ 111, and also applied and followed in Byrne v. Deane, [1937] 1 KB 818
and in Campbell v. Toronto Star, (1990) 73 DLR 190. Whilst the Canadian




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 33
 and Australian approach appears to be largely in tune with the English law
[ref Campbell (supra), a Canadian decision; and Reader‟s Digest Services
Pty Ltd v. Lamb (1982) 150 CLR 500, an Australian decision], the approach
of the US Supreme Court appears to be a bit different. In a case where the
plaintiff, a teetotaller, sued the publisher of a news item that he used to drink
whiskey, in the course of its judgment, the US Supreme Court held that there
could be no general consensus or opinion that to drink whiskey was wrong
and yet at the same time observed [ref. Peck v. Tribune Co 214, US 185
(1909)] as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "if the advertisement obviously would hurt the plaintiff in the
       estimation of an important and respectable part of the community,
       liability is not a question of a majority vote... No falsehood is through
       about or even known by all the world. No conduct is hated by all.
       That it will be known by a larger number and will lead an appreciable
       fraction of that number to regard the plaintiff with contempt is enough
       to do her practical harm... It seems to be impossible to say that the
       obvious tendency of what is imputed to the plaintiff by this
       advertisement is not seriously to hurt her standing with a considerable
       and respectable class in her community."
</blockquote><p id="p_72">38.    An interesting and fascinating discussion on the subject may be found
in Gatley on Libel and Slander (10th Edition) (2004) (the Common Law
Library, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, paragraphs 2.10 to 2.14). There, the expression
"right thinking person" was described as being

       "as much an abstraction as the "reasonable man": both serve as
       metaphors for what is in fact the judge‟s view of what is capable of
       being recognized as acceptable public opinion. Perhaps the American
       approach makes this issue more open to argument.
</p><p id="p_73">39.    In the present case, the learned Single Judge in our opinion, correctly
described the guiding principles after discussing the case law on the subject



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 34
 and even brought home the distinction between passing off actions - which
are concerned with deceptively similarity or confusion between the two
marks for which the test of impression gathered by an average woman or
man with imperfect recollection is applicable - and disparagement. The
impugned judgment notices this distinction and comments that

       "in the case of disparagement, the one who disparages another‟s
       product, does not seek to make his product similar to the disparaged
       product, but to distinguish it from the disparaged product. The object
       of disparagement is to make the disparaged product appear to be as
       near or similar to the competitor‟s product. The comparisons,
       therefore, in cases of passing off and in case of disparagement are
       different."
</p><p id="p_74">40.    Nevertheless, thereafter, in paragraph 27 of the impugned judgment,
the test applied in the present case is "stand point of an average man with
imperfect recollection who is also a user of Dettol original soap" to hold
that Dettol original was disparaged by the impugned advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_75">41.    This Court is of the opinion that the approach and understanding of the
learned Single Judge while discussing the law generally applicable as to
disparagement and permissible limits of puffing is correct and does not call
for any interference. At the same time, his allusion or reference to "average
man with imperfect recollection using Dettol soap" requires some
elaboration. Whilst there can be no quarrel with the fact that a reasonable
man and an average man refer to the same metaphor and imperfect
recollection refer to an natural attribute of a reasonable or average man, what
needs closer scrutiny is whether the standard applicable in judging
disparagement claims is if a particular class of user (in this case the Dettol
user) feels that the statement is disparaging. The learned Single Judge‟s



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 35
 discussions and conclusions on this are based upon his analysis of what
perceptions are discernible from the impugned advertisement.            This is
elaborately discussed in paragraph 24 of the impugned judgment where two
kinds of users, i.e., the Dettol users and those who do not use that soap are
noticed. The learned Single Judge held that the latter, i.e., non-users may be
unaware of the unique curvature shape, packaging etc. of the Dettol soap
sufficiently to link it with Reckitt‟s product as to possibly associate the
advertised product with Dettol, since the bar of soap in the impugned
advertisement is some unbranded soap.         However, as far as the former
category is concerned, the learned Single Judge held the Dettol users would
"immediately recognize the bar of soap shown in the advertisement as
referring to the plaintiff original Dettol soap". This was on account of
familiarity by reason of use of such soap and knowledge of its shape, colour,
size, contours and packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_76">42.    The question which this Court, therefore, has to address itself to is
whether the learned Single Judge faulted in his approach towards applying
the test of a reasonable man with imperfect recollection as being a particular
class of such citizens, i.e., Dettol users and then proceeding to hold that such
class can clearly identify the soap in the impugned advertisement as the
plaintiff "Dettol original".
</p>
<p id="p_77">43.    The previous discussion on the question as to whose perception is to
be considered in an action for defamation or disparagement has revealed that
the law of defamation recognizes that it is the standard of the right thinking
or reasonable men and women of the community from whose stand point the
imputation requires to be judged. In the case of disparagement of a rival‟s




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 36
 product, it may also be necessary to keep in view the possibility that
potential users of the product could be warned away by the advertisement,
thus widening the "target group". The American Court‟s refinement to this is
that the standpoint should be that of "respectable men and women" of the
community to which the claimant belongs and not to all kinds of people. Not
infrequently, Courts have been confronted with the argument that the target
audience is not a specific one, but of all reasonable men and women
generally. This has been described in Gatley (supra), at paragraph 2.15) as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       ".......First, it is plain that to say that the statement must lower the
       claimant in the estimation of right-thinking persons generally does not
       mean that the statement must be readily comprehensible to people in
       general: a defamatory statement may be made in a foreign language
       or in a highly technical scientific journal. In such cases there must be
       a publication to persons who do in fact understand the statement in
       the sense of which the claimant complains but the issue then seems to
       be "if this were explained to the ordinary citizen would it reflect on
       the plaintiff‟s reputation in his eyes? Secondly, in many cases it may
       be possible to show that a charge of conduct which in itself is
       obnoxious only to a limited group is defamatory because the statement
       carries the additional imputation that the claimant is thereby guilty of
       conduct, such as disloyalty or hypocrisy, which is regarded as
       discreditable by reasonable people generally even though they may be
       indifferent to the tenets of the group which is directly offended..."
</blockquote><p id="p_78">44.    There appears to be an overwhelming consensus of judicial opinion
that to determine whether a statement disparages or defames the viewpoint to
be considered is that of the general public (the refinements of whether such
"right thinking" or "reasonable" persons belong to a "respectable" section of
the public, apart). Thus, whenever an argument that a sectarian approach (i.e.
applying the standpoint of members of a section of the public) is to be




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 37
 adopted, Courts have tended to reject it time and again. In Tolly v. Fry, 1931
AC 333, the House of Lords had to decide if the depiction of the plaintiff, an
amateur golfer - without his consent - in an advertisement defamed or
caused injury to his amateur status (which was during the times regarded as
valuable for a golfer). The advertisement contained a limerick and also the
plaintiff‟s picture. It was argued unsuccessfully by the plaintiff that the
governing test was whether the knowing public (i.e. those aware about the
nature of the game, and the valuable status of an amateur, at that time) would
regard the depiction and the statement as defamatory. The House of Lords,
which had to decide whether the judgment which left the matter to the judge,
instead of the jury, was a correct one, held that the guiding principle was one
of perception of the general public and not the golf knowing citizens. This
was emphasized in the judgement:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">       "The question here does not depend upon a state of
       facts known only to some special class of the community, but to
       the inference which would be drawn by the ordinary man or woman
       from the facts of the publication."
</blockquote><p id="p_79">Similarly, in Gillick v. Brook Advisory Centres [2001] EWCA Civ 1263, the
following approach was adopted:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">       "the court should give the article the natural and ordinary meaning
       which it would have conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader
       reading the article once. Hypothetical reasonable readers should not
       be treated as either naive or unduly suspicious. They should be treated
       as being capable of reading between the lines and engaging in some
       loose thinking, but not as being avid for scandal. The court should
       avoid an over-elaborate analysis of the article, because an ordinary
       reader would not analyse the article as a lawyer or accountant would
       analyse documents or accounts. Judges should have regard to the
       impression the article has made upon them themselves in considering



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 38
          what impact it would have made on the hypothetical reasonable
         reader. The court should certainly not take a too literal approach to
         its task."

<p id="p_80">45.      In Petra Ecclestone v. Telegraph Media Group Ltd, 2009 EWHC
2779 (QB), the imputations against which the claimant sued Telegraph
Media Group were that Sir Paul McCartney‟s public call for "Meat free
Mondays" did not impress the plaintiff/claimant who is reported to have said
that she was not a "veggie" and did not have time for people like McCartney.
The Court rejected the submission of defamatory imputation and observed
that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">         "It might be that a sector of the public (i.e. those who disapproved of
         the use of leather or eating animal products) could think the less of the
         Claimant for taking the opposite stance, and might even do so because
         of what she is reported to have said about the McCartneys and Annie
         Lennox. But the test is not whether a sector of the public could think
         less of the Claimant for what she is alleged to have said (see Arab
         News Network v Al Khazen [2001] EWCA Civ 118 at [30]), but
         whether ordinary reasonable people in our society as a whole - or to
         use Mr Barca‟s phrase „the public‟ generally could do so. In our
         society people hold different (and sometimes strong) views on any
         number of issues including the use of animal products. In a
         democratic society where freedom of expression is a protected right,
         people are entitled to hold strong views, and to express them within
         the limits laid down by law."

<p id="p_82">46.    The discussion may be usefully summed up in the words of the
Australian High Court in Reader‟s Digest (supra):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">       "7. Where no true innuendo is pleaded and the published words
       clearly related to the plaintiff, the issue of libel or no libel can be
       determined by asking whether hypothetical referees - Lord Selborne‟s
       reasonable men (Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty (1882) LR 7 App
       Cas 741, at p 745 ) or Lord Atkin‟s right-thinking members of society
       generally (Sim v. Stretch (1936) 52 TLR 669, at p671 or Lord Reid‟s
       ordinary men not avid for scandal (Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd.
       (1964) AC, at p 260 ) - would understand the published words in a
       defamatory sense. That simple question embraces two elements of the
       cause of action: the meaning of the words used (the imputation) and
       the defamatory character of the imputation. Whether the alleged libel
       is established depends upon the understanding of the hypothetical
       referees who are taken to have a uniform view of the meaning of the
       language used, and upon the standards, moral or social, by which they
       evaluate the imputation they understand to have been made. They are
       taken to share a moral or social standard by which to judge the
       defamatory character of that imputation (Byrne v. Deane (1937) 1 KB

Judge‟s appreciation of the law, i.e. that the perspective of the Dettol users
guides the court in considering whether HUL disparaged Reckitt‟s soap is
erroneous, as it is based on a sectarian and "section of the public" point of
view and not of the "right thinking" or "reasonable" member of the public
generally. As to whether this approach has resulted in a wrong conclusion, is
another matter, which the Court would consider presently.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">48.    The next aspect to be considered is the nature of judicial scrutiny.
HUL complains that the learned Single Judge fell into error in making a
frame by frame, bit by bit analysis of the impugned advertisement and
thereby overlooked the guiding test that the advertisement or publication has
to be seen as a whole, rather than in a sectional manner, to decide if it
denigrates or disparages a rival product.
</p>
<p id="p_84">49.    The first question here is as to the manner in which such
advertisements are to be viewed, and secondly, the legal standard against
which the advertisement is to be judged. On this question, the advertisement
must be seen as a viewer would normally view it in the course of the
television programme, and not specifically with a view to catch an
„infringement‟. This distinction is thin, but important: in trying to determine
whether commercial disparagement has occurred, the relevant consideration
is how the viewer (i.e. the individual to whom the alleged disparagement is
addressed) would see the advertisement. This consideration is important also
because of the manner in which the advertisement is appreciated - whether
as a running reel or frame by frame. The answer to this necessarily is the
former, for two clear reasons. First, when deciding such matters, the judge is




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 41
 to consider (as will be discussed below) how an average, reasonable man
would view the advertisement as it appears on the television or electronic
medium, as in the present case. In order to do this, the endeavour of the court
is to substitute its judgment for that of the average/reasonable man.
Undoubtedly, when the advertisement is displayed on the television, it is not
scrutinized in every detail by the viewers, but rather, taken as a whole as it is
displayed. This simple proposition is of great relevance, since a judge, sits in
an adversarial setting with the clear purpose of determining whether
commercial disparagement has occurred, and thus, on the look-out for any
indication of the same, must equally remain cautious that the advertisement
is viewed as viewers normally view it.
</p>
<p id="p_85">50.      These concerns have been echoed by several courts - for example, in
Skuse v. Grenada, [1993] EWCA Civ 34, the Court noted that

      "[w]hile limiting its attention to what the defendant has actually said or
      written, the court should be cautious of an over-elaborate analysis of the
      material in issue."
</p><p id="p_86">Earlier, in Slim and Others v. Daily Telegraph and Others, [1968] 2 QB 157,
a case concerning libel, Lord Justice Diplock struck an important point:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">         "In the spring of 1964 two short letters appeared in the
         correspondence columns of the "Daily Telegraph." Written by Mr.
         Herbert, they formed part of a robust though desultory controversy
         about the prospective use by motor vehicles of a public footpath
         forming part of Upper Mall in Hammersmith. Neither letter can have
         taken a literate reader of that newspaper more than 60 seconds to
         read before passing on to some other, and perhaps more interesting,
         item. Any unfavourable inference about the plaintiffs‟ characters or
         conduct which he might have drawn from what he read would have
         been one of first impression. Yet in this court three lords justices and




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 42
        four counsel have spent the best part of three days upon a minute
       linguistic analysis of every phrase used in each of the letters. If this
       protracted exercise in logical positivism has resulted in our reaching
       a conclusion as to the meaning of either letter different from the first
       impression which we formed on reading it, the conclusion reached is
       unlikely to reflect the impression of the plaintiffs‟ character or
       conduct which was actually formed by those who read the letters in
       their morning newspaper in 1964."
</blockquote><p id="p_87">51.    The importance of returning to the meaning conveyed at first
impression, which for the viewer, at least in so far as advertisements such as
the present one are concerned, is also the final impression, is crucial. This
was also stated in McDonalds v. Burger King, (1986) FSR 45, in noting that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">        "advertisements are not to be read as if they are testamentary
       provisions in a will or a clause in some agreement with every word
       being carefully considered and the words as a whole being
       compared."
</blockquote><p id="p_88">52.            On this question, we must examine the approach of the learned
Single Judge closely - in that the Court applied the legal standard (which
will be discussed below) on a frame by frame appreciation of the impugned
advertisement. Such approach, with due respect, in this court‟s opinion, is
incorrect. The conclusions apart, the method employed in determining
whether disparagement has occurred (and crucially, the effect on the
consumer‟s mind) must be considered by Courts in such cases. The learned
Single Judge has, at paragraph 21 of the impugned judgment, considered
each frame of the advertisement in detail, and further, in paragraph 22,
considered some still pictures from the advertisement where the Dettol soap
is alleged to be shown. Relying on these photographs, the learned Single
Judge reached the conclusion that the soap displayed in the advertisement
does indeed refer to the Dettol soap. This, in the opinion of the Court, cannot



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 43
 be the correct approach; the appropriate method of viewing the
advertisement objected to would be to consider its overall effect.
</p>
<p id="p_89">Was the impugned judgment in error in its appreciation of the evidence
</p><p id="p_90">53.    HUL complains that the impugned judgment is in error because the
learned Single Judge held that in the final analysis the judge has to decide,
after considering the advertisement and its effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       "It has been contended on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff has
       not produced any evidence of consumers to indicate that the orange
       bar of soap in the said advertisement appears to be the plaintiff‟s
       DETTOL Original soap. In response the learned counsel for the
       plaintiff submitted that producing such evidence would be counter-
       productive and is not necessary. He submitted that the plaintiff could
       produce witnesses stating that the orange bar of soap shown in the
       advertisement had reference to the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original soap.
       Similarly, the defendant could also produce witnesses to state the
       contrary. Ultimately, it would be for the court to make a judgment
       from the perspective of an average person with imperfect recollection,
       a test which has been well established, particularly in passing off
       cases."
</blockquote><p id="p_91">HUL relies on Imperial Tobacco and Colgate Palmolive in support of the
submissions. As this court reads those authorities, the Courts did not prohibit
the judge presiding over the trial to consider the meaning of the term or
advertisement in issue, nor stated that as an invariable rule, the ritual of one
or a set of witnesses stating that it amounted to slander of goods and another
(for the defendants) stating otherwise, had to be ritualistically followed. The
learned Single Judge‟s approach, to a great extent, is based on common
sense and pragmatism. So long as the origin of the advertisement or
publication (i.e. who caused it to be telecast or broadcast, or published in the




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 44
 print media), its contents, duration etc. are not in dispute (as in the present
case) whether the content disparages is a decision that would ultimately
depend on the judge‟s reading and appreciation of the advertisement taken as
a whole, based on a proper application of the law on the subject. This view is
supported by the decision in Slim v. Daily Telegraph, [1968] 2 QB 157,
where Lord Justice Diplock expressed the rule in a clear statement:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">       "...Where, as in the present case, words are published to the millions
       of readers of a popular newspaper, the chances are that if the words
       are reasonably capable of being understood as bearing more than one
       meaning, some readers will have understood them as bearing one of
       those meanings and some will have understood them as bearing others
       of those meanings. But none of this matters. What does matter is what
       the adjudicator at the trial thinks is the one and only meaning that the
       readers as reasonable men should have collectively understood the
       words to bear. That is „the natural and ordinary meaning‟ of words in
       an action for libel."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">In Vodaphone Group Plc. v. Orange Personal Communications Services
Ltd., [1997] F.S.R. 34, the Court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">        "The meaning is for the court to determine when a judge sits without
       a jury. Evidence of the meaning to others is inadmissible. The
       question:</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">       „Is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does
       not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by the rules of
       construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of
       his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs ... what the
       ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally
       been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the word. But that
       expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there
       are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the
       words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a
       murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words
       themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 45
        is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning" per
       Lord Reid in Lewis v The Daily Telegraph.‟

The Court notices that even in recent English decisions (Cruddas v. Calvert,
2013 EWHC 1427 (QB) delivered on 5th June, 2013 and Interflora Inc v.
Marks &amp; Spencer Plc, 2013 (2) All ER 663) - though in analogous cases
relating to ad-word and trademark infringement claims- it was held that
evidence as to the meaning of common words and phrases in advertisements
or their effect, is by and large inadmissible. In Interflora, (supra) after an
elaborate review of past cases, the Court of Appeal held:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">       "In previous cases, it had been held that evidence of members of the
       public could not stand proxy for the legal construct of the average
       consumer. In the context of Ad-Words, the average consumer had been
       replaced by the reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant
       internet user, but the underlying concept, of a legal construct, was the
       same, BACH and BACH FLOWER REMEDIES Trade Marks [2000]
       R.P.C. 513 applied (see paras 40-44 of judgment). In cases involving
       ordinary consumer goods and services, the judge could reach a
       conclusion from his own experience without evidence from consumers
       ..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">In view of the above discussion, it is held that there is no merit in HUL‟s
argument that the judge fell into error in not considering oral testimony of
the parties as to whether the impugned advertisement amounted to slander of
goods, or denigration of Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original.
</p>
<p id="p_95">Did the impugned advertisement disparage or denigrate Reckitt‟s DETTOL
Original

</p><p id="p_96">54.    This court has previously observed that the correct test is whether the
impugned advertisement, or the publication complained of disparaged the



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 46
 plaintiff‟s goods in the eyes of the right thinking members of the public or
reasonable men and women. The Court had further held that while
considering the question of disparagement, the applicable test would not be
whether a "target audience" or "target group" i.e. a section of the general
public would perceive the advertisement to be disparaging, but if all
reasonable men and women would regard it to be so. Now, the all-important
question of whether the impugned advertisement in fact disparaged or
denigrated the plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original has to be decided in the light of
the evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_97">55.    As observed in an earlier part of this judgment, the advertisement was
of a total duration of 30 seconds and was telecast at the relevant time, in a
multitude of television channels. This Court had the opportunity of viewing
the advertisement, a recording of which was filed as part of the record and
was also played at the time of the hearing of the appeal. The court finds that
the storyline has been accurately described by the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_98">56.    It would be necessary to briefly summarize the whole advertisement.
A doctor and his wife return home on a rainy day. The wife plans to bathe
and the takes out an orange bar of soap from a green wrapper. This part of
the film is less than two seconds. The husband, at this stage exclaims that
that his wife can only be saved by God; later he and the children sing out that
naadan (the ignorant) should be given wisdom and all of them should be
saved from naiveté; the wife, surprised at this, questions them. Next, the
husband holds up the orange soap (this for about 2 seconds) and says that
with such cure, a blessing too would be necessary. In the next scene, a
bathing lady is shown raising the said orange bar of soap; it is accompanied



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 47
 by a male voice over which states that ordinary antiseptic soaps dry up the
skin; the camera then zooms to the upper arm, shown under a magnifying
glass revealing cracked skin with green germs lodged in them The male
voice then comments that germs get into the cracks (of the skin). As if to
emphasize the idea, the term "ordinary antiseptic soap" appears on the
screen. Next in a water shot, a bar of red LIFEBUOY soap emerges out of
the water. This scene highlights the words "Glycerine" and "Vitamin E" and
the male voice-over states this is why, new Lifebuoy Skin Guard). To
underline the idea, the arm under the magnifying glass is shown again, this
time with a voice over stating that it (LIFEBUOY) attacks germs; the scene
then shows glycerine flowing - and the voice over adding that (LIFEBUOY)
also builds a protective wall. The next scenes show that the wife allays the
fears of her family, and all of them saying that they have no fear (thus
suggesting that the wife accepted the suggestion to stop using the antiseptic
soap and had started to use LIFEBUOY). The final part of the advertisement
shows a LIFEBUOY Skinguard bar of soap and its package with the
LIFEBUOY logo zooming onto the package and the male voice-over
announcing "Lifebuoy Skin Guard"; the Hindustan Lever Limited logo is
then focused and the advertisement ends then.
</p>
<p id="p_99">57.    Facially, HLL‟s argument that the exposure to the orange coloured
soap is for about 5% of the entire advertisement - and the attendant
submission that this renders the possibility of any lasting impact improbable,
is attractive. That however, is not the main consideration which the court
should be alive to. As discussed earlier, it is the overall effect of the
advertisement rather than a frame by frame analysis which is relevant. To




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 48
 focus only on the manner that the orange soap bar is shown in the
advertisement would therefore, be falling into the same trap which HLL
cautioned the court from avoiding. It is not only the total time devoted in the
entire advertisement by which the orange bar is shown (in all about 4
seconds, on three occasions) which is to be considered, but its contextual
setting. The learned Single Judge accepted Reckitt‟s argument that though it
did not market an antiseptic soap, yet the repeated allusions to antiseptics
and how they result in cracks in the skin, provided the powerful contextual
background for the entire advertisement. HLL is no doubt right in saying that
there were several orange bars of soaps; some with curvature and a few had
green coloured packaging. Yet, the one shot (in which one protagonist) holds
up the orange soap bar shows the curvature of the orange bar, and the unique
indented shape within, which leaves no room for any doubt that it is
DETTOL Original. The absence of the Dettol symbol (cross) does not in any
manner - in the opinion of the court- detract from this impression (of the
ordinary reasonable viewer) as to the identity of the soap bar. This the Court
holds because the evidence on record, in the form of the story board in
Reckitt‟s advertisement campaign for DETTOL Original (to which umbrage
was taken by HLL, in a previous suit, filed in this Court - produced as Ex.
PW-1/16) shows that the soap was launched in May, 2006. HLL filed the suit
some-time in June, 2006; interim injunction was refused by a reasoned
judgment and order dated 17-11-2006. This story board (i.e concerning
Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original, in the previous suit by HLL) was produced as
DW-1/11 and DW-1/12, by HLL‟s witness, DW-1. This material clearly
depicts Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original advertisement, which contains the same
</p><p id="p_100">- or identical oval shaped orange soap - as in the impugned advertisement.
</p>


<p id="p_101">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 49
 That advertisement too was published in the same media, in television
channels. Reckitt led evidence (PW-1/19) disclosing that the advertisement
was widely and extensively telecast in numerous channels, on 2763
occasions, during the whole of July till 11 August, 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_102">58.    As this Court understands, the plaintiff‟s grievance is not that HUL
simplistically depicted its DETTOL Original in a bad light or denigrated it.
That argument would have been natural if Reckitt alleged that the soap
shown in the advertisement alone constituted denigration of its product.
However, the overall effect on the viewer - the shape of the soap, the green
packaging, the number of times the soap was shown, the suggestion made
that antiseptic soaps are bad for the skin, as they allow germ build up - is
complained to constitute what is termed as a defamatory innuendo. This
court had, earlier in Dabur India, recognized that clever advertising can
suggest something which is plainly not said, and create the desired impact in
the mind of the viewer. The innuendo, or the suggestion of something more
than what is spoken, is one such device. Tolley (supra) was a case which
used a pun and a limerick; there have been other instances where different
suggestions and innuendos have been held to be slanderous or disparaging.
In Kiam v. Neil, 1996 EMLR 493, the claimant, a prominent businessman
had appeared in advertisements and liked a razor so much that he bought the
company. The complained newspaper publication alleged that a Bank stated
that the plaintiff had defaulted on a GBP £ 13.5 million loan and that he had
filed for bankruptcy, neither of which was true. The newspaper apologized.
However, the claimant alleged a libel, based on an innuendo to members of
the public who had bought razors relying on a promise of a refund if they




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                       Page 50
 were not satisfied, that the plaintiff had induced them to purchase when he
was not in a position to fulfil the promise. The innuendo was founded on
packaging for the razor which bore a photograph of the plaintiff and a
statement about a refund. The defendants did not admit the innuendo. The
court upheld the decision that the innuendo was defamatory of the plaintiff.
This discussion is best summed up with in the words of Lord Reid in Lewis
v. Daily Telegraph [1963] 2 All E.R. 151, that the ordinary sense and context
of words is not their "legal sense" because:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">       "The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not
       inhibited by the rules of construction. So he can and does read
       between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience
       of worldly affairs ... What the ordinary man would infer without
       special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary
       meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that
       it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is
       not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the
       plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the
       sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary
       man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their
       natural and ordinary meaning." (emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_103">59.    In the present case, the Court has to be sensitive and alive to the fact
that viewership of television channels and electronic media is diverse and
widespread. The learned Single Judge found, and we see no infirmity in this
regard, that DETTOL‟s market leadership in the antiseptic liquid market
made it particularly vulnerable in the impugned advertisement. In this
context, the Court usefully recollects what was stated in a previous
disparagement action (Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited &amp;
ors v. Heinz India Private Limited &amp; Anr., I.A. No.15233/2008 in CS (OS)

       impact. First, it has a wider spread; it is perceived aurally through
       different senses, such as sound, visual, and printed. The suggestive
       power of this medium is greater. Second, such advertisements use
       several different tools, like music, dialogue, colors, and other aids, to
       bring home the message. Advertisements through this medium can,
       and do operate at conscious and subconscious levels; their power of
       suggestion extends not just to the discerning, or educated viewer, but
       to an entire range of viewership, with diverse income earning
       capacities, educational attainments, tastes, and so on. They influence
       even children. The impact of a catchy phrase, a well acted skit or story
       line, or even distinctive sounds or distinctive collocation of colors, can
       well define the brand or product‟s image, by imprinting it in the public
       memory forever."

<p id="p_104">Here, though at a superficial level, HUL targeted antiseptic soaps and
elaborated the ill-effects of antiseptics on the skin, the combined effect of
this message with the three visuals, two distinctly (though briefly) showing
Dettol soap, with its unique colour, curvature and shape suggested
powerfully to ordinary and reasonable viewer that the soap being spoken
against in the advertisement was none other than a Reckitt product. Though
not strictly accurate, the innuendo was in the nature of a commercial double
entendre where the hidden meaning was intended to impact the viewer more
than the obvious, superficial one. This plainly is disparagement, and a
slander of Reckitt‟s DETTOL Original; the Single Judge arrived at the
correct finding in that regard and the Court hereby affirms it.

</p><p id="p_106"> 60.    As far as HUL‟s argument with respect to its test reports go, this Court
is of opinion that they are of little relevance. HUL may be justified in saying
that antiseptic soaps cause skin damage; however that is not the point it seeks
to drive home in the impugned advertisement; the plaintiff Reckitt does not
claim that its product is an antiseptic soap, nor does it say that such result
can follow from use of such class of soaps. What is relevant is that the
message conveyed through the impugned advertisement is loud and clear:
that Reckitt‟s soap (the depiction of an "ordinary antiseptic soap") is bad for
the skin. Likewise, though HUL has produced Exhibits DW-1/1, DW1/2 and
DW-1/3 to show that other oval shaped, orange coloured and green wrapper
packaged soaps exist, it made no attempt to co-relate the shapes and colour
with specific products. Nor was its witness, DW-1 able to do so. In these
circumstances, the argument that the plaintiff could not complain about
being targeted by the impugned advertisement is insubstantial and
unpersuasive.

<p id="p_107">Correctness of the approach of the Single Judge as to damages

</p><p id="p_108">61.    In this section of the judgment, this court proposes to discuss the
correctness of award of damages by the learned Single Judge in the
impugned judgment. As noticed previously, the Single Judge felt that the
plaintiff, Reckitt had been unable to prove the damages suffered on account
of disparagement; yet award of punitive damages were called for. The
defendant, HUL questions the grant of punitive damages whereas the
plaintiff Reckitt complains that general or compensatory damages ought to
have been awarded.

<p id="p_109">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 53
</p><p id="p_110"> 62.    It is an accepted principle in English law that general damages are "at
large" in the case of defamation, including disparagement, slander, etc. This
was first stated in South Hetton Coal Company Limited v. North-Eastern
News Association Limited, [1894] 1 QB 133 that "if the case be one of libel -
whether on a person, a firm, or a company - the law is that damages are at
large. It is not necessary to prove any particular damage; the jury may give
such damages as they think fit, having regard to the conduct of the parties
respectively, and all the circumstances of the case." It is important that a
successful plaintiff is allowed to recover such damages as would compensate
for the loss of its reputation. These principles were re-stated in John v MGN
Ltd [1997] QB 586, where the Court of Appeal held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">       "The successful plaintiff in a defamation action is entitled to recover,
       as general compensatory damages, such sum as will compensate him
       for the wrong he has suffered. That sum must compensate him for the
       damage to his reputation; vindicate his good name; and take account
       of the distress, hurt and humiliation which the defamatory publication
       has caused. In assessing the appropriate damages for injury to
       reputation the most important factor is the gravity of the libel; the
       more closely it touches the plaintiff‟s personal integrity, professional
       reputation, honour, courage, loyalty and the core attributes of his
       personality, the more serious it is likely to be. The extent of
       publication is also very relevant: a libel published to millions has a
       greater potential to cause damage than a libel published to a handful
       of people. A successful plaintiff may properly look to an award of
       damages to vindicate his reputation: but the significance of this is
       much greater in a case where the defendant asserts the truth of the
       libel and refuses any retraction or apology than in a case where the
       defendant acknowledges the falsity of what was published and publicly
       expresses regret that the libellous publication took place. It is well
       established that compensatory damages may and should compensate
       for additional injury caused to the plaintiff‟s feelings by the
       defendant‟s conduct of the action, as when he persists in an unfounded




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 54
        assertion that the publication was true, or refuses to apologise, or
       cross-examines the plaintiff in a wounding or insulting way."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">       76. Of course, a company stands in a slightly different position, for it
       has no feelings to hurt, and it follows that considerations of
       aggravation which might be relevant if the claimant is an individual
       do not apply. However, the entitlement of a company to recover
       general damages has recently been affirmed by the House of Lords:
       see Jameel v Wall Street Journal [2007] 1 AC 359. A company‟s good
       name is a thing of value, but it can only be hit in its pocket, and there
       is no evidence here of actual financial loss. That is not to say that it
       may not merit vindication. The function of damages for vindication
       was well explained by Lord Hailsham in Broome v Cassell [1972] AC
       1027 at 1071c-e in terms of the need, „in case the libel, driven
       underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date‟, for
       the claimant (whether personal or corporate) to be able to point to a
       sum sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the
       charge. Of course, those words were spoken in the context of a jury
       award, and it could fairly be said that the need for vindication by an
       award of damages is less in a case where some vindication is provided
       by a reasoned judgment."

<p id="p_111">This was followed in Applause Store Productions Limited and Firscht v.
Raphael [2008] EWHC 1781, where the plaintiff complained of libel on
account of a fake Facebook identity which falsely described the claimant‟s
sexual orientation, his relationship status (that is to say, whether he was
single or in a relationship), his birthday, and his political and religious views.
Not all this information was truthful or accurate, and besides all of it was
private information. The Court of appeal followed John (supra) and awarded
substantial damages. Earlier, Iin Jameel v. Wall Streeet Journal 2007 (1)
AC 379, the rule was re-stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">       "...under the current law of England and Wales a trading company
       with a trading reputation in this country may recover general
       damages without pleading or proving special damage if the

       its business."
</blockquote><p id="p_112">In the same judgment, the Court also reiterated the existing law that once
defamation s proved, the law presumes damage- a proposition which applies
to a trading company also. Further, the Court held that:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_56">           119.       Defamation constitutes an injury to reputation.
              Reputation is valued by individuals for it affects their self-
              esteem and their standing in the community. Where reputation
              is traduced by a libel "the law presumes that some damage will
              flow in the ordinary course of things from the mere invasion of
              the plaintiff‟s rights" (Bowen LJ in Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2
              QB 524 at 528). It is accepted that the rule applies and should
              continue to apply to individuals. But it is argued that it should
              no longer be applied to corporations. Corporations, it is said,
              have no feelings to be hurt and cannot feel shame. If they are to
              sue for libel they should be required to show that the libel has
              caused them actual damage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">           120.       These arguments, in my opinion, miss the point. The
              reputation of a corporate body is capable of being, and will
              usually be, not simply something in which its directors and
              shareholders may take pride, but an asset of positive value to it.
              Why else do trading companies pay very substantial sums of
              money in advertising their names in TV commercials which
              usually say next to nothing of value about the services or
              products on offer from the company in question but endeavour
              to present an image of the company that is attractive and likely
              to cement the name of the corporation in the public memory?</blockquote>

              reputation matters to trading companies and because these
              sponsorship activities, associating the name of the company
              with popular sporting events, are believed to enhance the



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 56
                sponsor‟s reputation to its commercial advantage. The
               organisers of a variety of activities some sporting, some
               cultural, some charitable, are constantly on the look-out for
               sponsorship of the activity in question by some commercial
               company. The choice of sponsor and the reputation of the
               sponsor matter to these organisers. Who would these days
               choose a cigarette manufacturing company to sponsor an
               athletic event or a concert in aid of charity? If reputation
               suffers, sponsorship invitations may be reduced, advertising
               opportunities may become difficult, customers may take their
               custom elsewhere. If trade suffers, profits suffer.
</p>
<p id="p_114">           121.       It seems to me plain beyond argument that reputation is
              of importance to corporations. Proof of actual damage caused
              by the publication of defamatory material would, in most cases,
              need to await the next month‟s financial figures, but the figures
              would likely to be inconclusive. Causation problems would
              usually be insuperable. Who is to say why receipts are down or
              why advertising has become more difficult or less effective?
              Everyone knows that fluctuations happen. Who is to say, if the
              figures are not down, whether they would have been higher if
              the libel had not been published? How can a company about
              which some libel, damaging to its reputation, has been
              published ever obtain an interlocutory injunction if proof of
              actual damage is to become the gist of the action?
</p>
<p id="p_115">           122.        There is no doubt that, as the case law now stands, a
              libel is actionable per se at the suit of a corporation as it is at
              the suit of an individual, without the need to prove that any
              actual damage has been caused. In the South Hetton Coal Co
              Ltd case [1894] 1 QB 133 the plaintiff, a colliery company,
              complained of a libel that had attacked the company in respect
              of its management of company houses in which some of its
              colliery workers lived. The Court of Appeal held that the libel
              was actionable per se and, at p 140, that "... the plaintiffs
              would be entitled to damages at large, without giving any
              evidence of particular damage."

 In the United States of America, too, the difficulty which a defamed or
slandered claimant, particularly a commercial enterprise is put to in proving
empirically and accurately the damages or injury to its reputation and
enterprise has been recognized. It was thus, held in Story Parchment Co. v.
Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555 (1931) that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">       " Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the
       ascertainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it is enough if
       the evidence show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and
       reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate. The
       wrongdoer is not entitled to complain that they cannot be measured
       with the exactness and precision that would be possible if the case,
       which he alone is responsible for making, were otherwise..... If the
       damage is certain, the fact that its extent is uncertain does not prevent
       a recovery."
</blockquote><p id="p_117">63.    In the present case, the plaintiff (Reckitt) has been able to prove,
successfully, that HUL telecast the impugned 30 second advertisement on a
large number of occasions (2763 times, to be precise, according to Ex. PW-
1/19). The innuendo was cleverly designed to suggest that Reckitt‟s
DETTOL Original caused damage to the skin. The advertiser, i.e. HUL, was
conscious that it was crossing the boundary between permissible "puffing"
and what was prohibited in law. The evidence on record, in the form of
HUL‟s witnesses‟ testimony, is that Rs.2.5 crores was spent in July 2007
alone for advertising its product. HUL also admitted during the trial that the
DETTOL Original brand was worth Rs.200 crores. Such being the case, this
Court holds that the Single Judge‟s reluctance to award general damages was
not justified. It would be necessary to mention in this context that it may not
be possible for an otherwise successful plaintiff, in a disparagement or
slander of goods action to always quantify the extent of loss; there would




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 58
 necessarily be an element of dynamism in this, because of the nature of the
product, the season it is sold in, the possible future or long term impact that
may arise on account of the advertisement, etc. Therefore, courts the world
over have resorted to some rough and ready calculations.
</p>
<p id="p_118">64.      In view of the evidence presented before this Court (i.e. the number of
times the advertisement was telecast, the quantum of advertisement expenses
of HUL, the amount spent by Reckitt, to advertise its product, etc) this Court
is of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover general damages to the
tune of Rs. 20 lakhs. The impugned judgment and order is modified to that
extent, and the cross objection by Reckitt, is consequently allowed in these
terms.
</p>
<p id="p_119">65.      As far as punitive damages are concerned, the learned Single Judge
relied in Lokesh Srivastava and certain other rulings. Here, since the Court is
dealing with a final decree - and a contested one at that (unlike in the case of
trademark and intellectual property cases, where the courts, especially a
large number of Single Judge decisions proceeded to grant such punitive
damages in the absence of any award of general or quantified damages for
infringement or passing off), it would be necessary to examine and re-state
the governing principles.
</p>
<p id="p_120">66.      Rookes v. Barnard, [1964] 1 All ER 367, is the seminal authority of
the House of Lords, on the issue of when punitive or exemplary (or
sometimes alluded to as "aggravated") damages can be granted. The House
defined three categories of case in which such damages might be awarded.
These are:
</p>



<p id="p_121">RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                          Page 59
        a. Oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action any the servants
       of the government;
</p>
<p id="p_122">       b. Wrongful conduct by the defendant which has been calculated by
       him for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to
       the claimant; and

       c. Any case where exemplary damages are authorised by the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_123">The later decision in Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Broome, 1972 AC 1027, upheld
the categories for which exemplary damages could be awarded, but made
important clarificatory observations. Those relevant for the present purpose
are reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">       "A judge should first rule whether evidence exists which entitles a jury
       to find facts bringing a case within the relevant categories, and, if it
       does not, the question of exemplary damages should be withdrawn
       from the jury‟s consideration. Even if it is not withdrawn from the
       jury, the judge‟s task is not complete. He should remind the jury: (i)
       that the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff to establish the facts
       necessary to bring the case within the categories. (ii) That the mere
       fact that the case falls within the categories does not of itself entitle
       the jury to award damages purely exemplary in character. They can
       and should award nothing unless (iii) they are satisfied that the
       punitive or exemplary element is not sufficiently met within the figure
       which they have arrived at for the plaintiff‟s solatium in the sense I
       have explained and (iv) that, in assessing the total sum which the
       defendant should pay, the total figure awarded should be in
       substitution for and not in addition to the smaller figure which would
       have been treated as adequate solatium, that is to say, should be a
       round sum larger than the latter and satisfying the jury‟s idea of what
       the defendant ought to pay. (v) I would also deprecate, as did Lord
       Atkin in Ley v. Hamilton, 153 L.T. 384 the use of the word "fine" in
       connection with the punitive or exemplary element in damages, where
       it is appropriate. Damages remain a civil, not a criminal, remedy,



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 60
        even where an exemplary award is appropriate, and juries should not
       be encouraged to lose sight of the fact that in making such an award
       they are putting money into a plaintiff‟s pocket, and not contributing
       to the rates, or to the revenues of central government." (emphasis
       supplied).
</blockquote><p id="p_124">The House of Lords, in its discussion, remarked crucially that there is a
considerable subjective element in the award of damages in cases involving
defamation and similar actions. Courts, it remarked, used terminology to
reflect overlapping, and sometimes undesirable ideas underlining the
considerations weighing grant of damages:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">       "In my view it is desirable to drop the use of the phrase "vindictive"
       damages altogether, despite its use by the county court judge in
       Williams v. Settle [1960] 1 W.L.R. 1072. Even when a purely punitive
       element is involved, vindictiveness is not a good motive for awarding
       punishment. In awarding "aggravated" damages the natural
       indignation of the court at the injury inflicted on the plaintiff is a
       perfectly legitimate motive in making a generous rather than a more
       moderate award to provide an adequate solatium. But that is because
       the injury to the plaintiff is actually greater and, as the result of the
       conduct exciting the indignation, demands a more generous solatium.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">       Likewise the use of "retributory" is objectionable because it is
       ambiguous. It can be used to cover both aggravated damages to
       compensate the plaintiff and punitive or exemplary damages purely to
       punish the defendant or hold him up as an example.</blockquote>

<p id="p_125">       As between "punitive" or "exemplary," one should, I would suppose,
       choose one to the exclusion of the other, since it is never wise to use
       two quite interchangeable terms to denote the same thing. Speaking
       for myself, I prefer "exemplary," not because "punitive" is
       necessarily inaccurate, but "exemplary" better expresses the policy of
       the law as expressed in the cases. It is intended to teach the defendant
       and others that "tort does not pay" by demonstrating what
       consequences the law inflicts rather than simply to make the defendant




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 61
        suffer an extra penalty for what he has done, although that does, of
       course, precisely describe its effect.
</p>
<p id="p_126">       The expression "at large" should be used in general to cover all cases
       where awards of damages may include elements for loss of reputation,
       injured feelings, bad or good conduct by either party, or punishment,
       and where in consequence no precise limit can be set in extent. It
       would be convenient if, as the appellants‟ counsel did at the hearing. it
       could be extended to include damages for pain and suffering or loss of
       amenity. Lord Devlin uses the term in this sense in Rookes v. Barnard
       [1964] A.C. 1129, 1221, when he defines the phrase as meaning all
       cases where "the award is not limited to the pecuniary loss that can
       be specifically proved." But I suspect that he was there guilty of a
       neologism. If I am wrong, it is a convenient use and should be
       repeated.
</p>
<p id="p_127">       Finally, it is worth pointing out, though I doubt if a change of
       terminology is desirable or necessary, that there is danger in
       hypostatising     "compensatory," "punitive," "exemplary" or
       "aggravated" damages at all. The epithets are all elements or
       considerations which may, but with the exception of the first need not,
       be taken into account in assessing a single sum. They are not separate
       heads to be added mathematically to one another."

not indicated the standards which are to be applied while awarding punitive
or exemplary damages in libel, tortuous claims with economic overtones
such as slander of goods, or in respect of intellectual property matters. The
peculiarities of such cases would be the courts‟ need to evolve proper



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 62
 standards to ensure proportionality in the award of such exemplary or
punitive damages. The caution in Cassel that "[d]amages remain a civil, not
a criminal, remedy, even where an exemplary award is appropriate, and
juries should not be encouraged to lose sight of the fact that in making such
an award they are putting money into a plaintiff‟s pocket...." can never be
lost sight of. Furthermore - and perhaps most crucially -the punitive element
of the damages should follow the damages assessed otherwise (or general)
damages; exemplary damages can be awarded only if the Court is "satisfied
that the punitive or exemplary element is not sufficiently met within the
figure which they have arrived at for the plaintiff‟s solatium". In other
words, punitive damages should invariably follow the award of general
damages (by that the Court meant that it could be an element in the
determination of damages, or a separate head altogether, but never
completely without determination of general damages).

<p id="p_129">68.    This court is of the opinion that the impugned judgment fell into error
in relying on the decision in <a href="/doc/1152738/" id="a_23">Times Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava</a> 116
(2005) DLT 569. A Single Judge articulated, in his ex parte judgment in a
trademark infringement action, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">       "This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when
       the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trade-marks, copy
       rights, patents etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but
       award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and
       dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of
       lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they
       would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would
       be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial
       disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economy Lodging, Inc.
       reported in 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the




RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 63
        grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that
       one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an
       overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative
       to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that
       the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of
       limiting the defendant‟s ability to profit from its fraud by escaping
       detection and prosecution. If a to tortfeasor is caught only half the
       time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished
       twice as heavily in order to make up for the times he gets away This
       Court feels that this approach is necessitated further for the reason
       that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages
       suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never
       maintain proper accounts of their transactions since they know that
       the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the
       claim of punitive damages is of Rs.5 lacs only which can be safely
       awarded. Had it been higher even, this court would not have hesitated
       in awarding the same. This Court is of the view that the punitive
       damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum
       thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement."
</blockquote><p id="p_130">With due respect, this Court is unable to subscribe to that reasoning, which
flies on the face of the circumstances spelt out in Rookes and later affirmed
in Cassel. Both those judgments have received approval by the Supreme
Court and are the law of the land. The reasoning of the House of Lords in
those decisions is categorical about the circumstances under which punitive
damages can be awarded. An added difficulty in holding that every violation
of statute can result in punitive damages and proceeding to apply it in cases
involving economic or commercial causes, such as intellectual property and
not in other such matters, would be that even though statutes might provide
penalties, prison sentences and fines (like under the Trademarks Act, the
Copyrights Act, <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_24">Designs Act</a>, etc) and such provisions invariably cap the
amount of fine, sentence or statutory compensation, civil courts can
nevertheless proceed unhindered, on the assumption that such causes involve



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                         Page 64
 criminal propensity, and award "punitive" damages despite the plaintiff‟s
inability to prove any general damage. Further, the reasoning that "one
function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded
system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal
prosecution of minor crimes" is plainly wrong, because where the law
provides that a crime is committed, it indicates the punishment. No statute
authorizes the punishment of anyone for a libel- or infringement of
trademark with a huge monetary fine-which goes not to the public
exchequer, but to private coffers. Moreover, penalties and offences wherever
prescribed require the prosecution to prove them without reasonable doubt.
Therefore, to say that civil alternative to an overloaded criminal justice
system is in public interest would be in fact to sanction violation of the law.
This can also lead to undesirable results such as casual and unprincipled and
eventually disproportionate awards. Consequently, this court declares that
the reasoning and formulation of law enabling courts to determine punitive
damages, based on the ruling in <a href="/doc/545767/" id="a_25">Lokesh Srivastava and Microsoft
Corporation v. Yogesh Papat and Another</a>, 2005 (30) PTC 245 (Del) is
without authority. Those decisions are accordingly overruled. To award
punitive damages, the courts should follow the categorization indicated in
Rookes (supra) and further grant such damages only after being satisfied that
the damages awarded for the wrongdoing is inadequate in the circumstances,
having regard to the three categories in Rookes and also following the five
principles in Cassel. The danger of not following this step by step reasoning
would be ad hoc judge centric award of damages, without discussion of the
extent of harm or injury suffered by the plaintiff, on a mere whim that the
defendant‟s action is so wrong that it has a "criminal" propensity or the case



RFA (OS) 50/2008                                                        Page 65
 merely falls in one of the three categories mentioned in Rookes (to quote
Cassel again - such event "does not of itself entitle the jury to award
damages purely exemplary in character").
</p>
<p id="p_131">69.    Reverting to the facts of this case, the defendant clearly was aware
about its wrong doing and the harm which would ensue to HUL because of
the published disparagement. Yet it went ahead and aired it in almost all the
national and a large number of regional channels with repetitiveness. The
deliberation points at an aim to denigrate the plaintiff‟s product and harm its
reputation. At no stage did it - even in these proceedings - offer to make
amends. In the circumstances, the award of punitive damages was warranted.
The award of general damages through this judgment (although of a figure of
Rs.20 lakhs) is moderate, since the advertisement was aired over 2700 times
and seen - and intended to be seen - by millions of viewers. As observed in
John (supra)

       "The extent of publication is also very relevant: a libel published to
       millions has a greater potential to cause damage than a libel
       published to a handful of people.."
</p><p id="p_132">Having regard to all these circumstances, the court is of opinion that the
award of Rs.5 lakhs as exemplary damages in the facts of this case was
justified and not disproportionate; it is accordingly upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_133">70.    In view of the above discussion, it is held that this appeal has no merit.
It is accordingly dismissed, but with costs, quantified at Rs. 55,000/-. The
cross objections however succeed and the decree of the learned Single Judge
shall be modified. In addition to injunction and punitive damages assessed
by the impugned judgment, the plaintiff/Reckitt is also entitled to a decree

 for Rs.20 lakhs. The cross objections are allowed to that extent. The plaintiff
shall in addition to the costs of the appeal, be also entitled to costs of the
cross objection and counsel‟s fee, assessed at Rs.25,000/-.
