</p><p id="p_7">3.           The factual matrix in which the appellants came to be

prosecuted and convicted has been set out in detail by the Trial Court. I

need not, therefore, recapitulate the same all over again except to the

extent it is necessary. Shorn of details, the prosecution case as reflected in

the charge-sheet is as under :
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.           In a macabre incident which took place on 20.03.1975 at

about 04.15 P.M. the assailants threw two hand-grenades in the car in an

attempt to murder Sh.A.N.Ray, the then Chief Justice of India (in short :

CJI) when he was proceeding with his son Ajoy Nath Ray from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                    Page 3 of 201</span>
 Supreme Court to his residence in a staff car bearing registration No. DL

C 6431 driven by PW- Inder Singh. PW-Jai Nand, Security Officer /

Jamadar was present inside the car in the front seat. The hand-grenades

were thrown after the car had covered a distance of about 200 metres from

gate - „A‟, exclusively reserved for Supreme Court Judges at the

intersection of Tilak Marg and Bhagwan Das Road when it pulled up there

on account of STOP signal. The nefarious designs of the assailants did not

yield any result and providentially the hand-grenades thrown inside the

car did not explode. Apparently, the assailants failed to accomplish the

dangerous mission. PW- Jai Nand who had seen an „individual‟ throwing

„something‟ wrapped in a handkerchief inside the car through the window

where CJI was sitting, questioned him as to what he was doing there.

Instead of giving reply / response, the assailant suddenly started running

towards Bhagwan Dass Road. It prompted Jai Nand to get out of the car

and chase the assailant shouting „pakro - pakro‟. The culprit entered into a

taxi parked nearby at Bhagwan Dass Road; came out of it immediately;

fled towards Garhwal House; jumped over it; crossed its front gate and

disappeared. SI Om Prakash, PW- Const.Jai Lal, PW-Ramji Lal and many

others joined PW-Jai Nand to chase the assailant but in vain.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 4 of 201</span>
</p><p id="p_9">              The police machinery swung into action promptly on getting

information from Police Control Room. Insp.Sajjan Singh, SHO Tilak

Marg Police Station along with his team of police personnel reached the

spot after receiving the wireless message from SI Inder Singh. He made

an unsuccessful search for the culprit and returned to the crime scene at

about 05.10 P.M. He examined the spot of occurrence, prepared a rough

sketch (Ex.P-106) of the crime scene and seized various articles. He

lodged First Information Report after recording Jai Nand‟s statement

(Ex.P16). Two unexploded hand-grenades (Ex.A3 and Ex.A4) lying near

the rear portion of the car, handkerchiefs (Ex.A5 and Ex.A6) were taken

into possession. Services of Major S.K.Sharma, Garrison Engineer were

requisitioned to defuse the hand-grenades. Statements of the witnesses

conversant with the facts were recorded. On 21.03.1975, the investigation

was transferred to Crime Branch, Delhi Police. One Abrol arrested as a

suspect was subsequently got discharged for want of evidence.

</p><p id="p_10">5.           The assailants without indicating their identity claimed

responsibility for the attack and conveyed the information to various

newspapers. „The Indian Express‟ published a news-item developed out of

a communication Ex.P10 received from „unknown sources‟ on

24.03.1975. Similar communication (Ex.P11) was received in the office of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 5 of 201</span>
 „The Statesman‟. PW-16 (Prakasha Rao), Deputy News Editor sent it to

the police as it contained dangerous matter. Communications Ex.P12 &amp;

Ex.P13 were dispatched to „The Hindustan Samachar‟ and „The Hindustan

Times‟. Letter (Ex.P14) contained in an envelope (Ex.P14/A), addressed

to CJI was received by his Private Secretary in between March 23 and 30,

1975 when he was on tour to Punjab. Sh.S.K.Gupta, Registrar, Supreme

Court, received it on April 01 or 02, 1975 after return from Punjab and he

forwarded it to Superintendent of Police (Security).

</p><p id="p_11">6.           It is relevant to note that CBI had earlier registered RC1/75-

CIA-1/SPE under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_17">Section 120B</a> IPC; 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a> and <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_19">Sections 3</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_20">4</a> of the

Explosive Substances Act, 1908 pertaining to Sh.L.N.Misra murder in a

bomb-blast at Samastipur in Bihar. A-1 had already been arrested in the

said proceedings in Patna on June 17, 1975. Feeling nexus between

L.N.Misra murder case and the present one, Delhi Administration made a

request to Delhi Special Police Establishment for investigation in the

present case as well. CBI thereon formally registered the present case as

RC11/75(CIU)/SPE/CBI dated June 30, 1975 at 05.40 P.M. and the

investigation was assigned to Sardari Lal, DSP, CIU.

</p><p id="p_12">7.           A-1 was formally arrested in this case on June 30, 1975 at

08.30 P.M. Pursuant to disclosures made by him during police remand, A-

 2 was arrested on 06.07.1975 and various articles including three diaries

(Ex.P123, Ex.P124 and Ex.P125) were recovered from his residence.

Vikram and A-3 were arrested at Bhagalpur on July 24, 1975 in some

other case. They were formally arrested in the instant case on July 27, and

brought to Delhi by air on July 28, 1975. A-1 to A-3 declined to

participate in Test Identification Parade (in brief : TIP) fixed for July 30.

Vikram during police remand from July 31 to August 14, 1975, expressed

desire to record confessional statement (Ex.P9) voluntarily on August 14,

1975 before Sh.R.D.Aggarwal (PW-20), Addl. Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate. Vikram was granted conditional pardon by Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate and was made an approver on August 22, 1975.

</p><p id="p_13">8.           During further investigation, CBI arrested Ram Nagina

Prasad at Icchapur on July 18, 1975 in L.N.Misra murder case. On July

25, 1975, pursuant to disclosure statement (Ex.P142) at his instance hand-

grenade (Ex.A9) was recovered from near the bamboo wall of meat shop

of Jagdish at Icchapur.
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.           During extensive and marathon investigation, CBI recorded

statements of number of witnesses conversant with the facts. Anonymous

letters (Ex.P10 to Ex.P14) were collected. From the approver‟s

disclosures, CBI came to know about the activities of the conspirators in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 7 of 201</span>
 relation to the object and scheme of the conspiracy and the manner in

which the object of the conspiracy was sought to be achieved and

executed. On A-1‟s interrogation, CBI came to know about his association

with PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) doing Ph.D. in Indian Agricultural Research

Institute, Delhi. On July 05, 1975, DSP B.R.Puri (PW-71) recovered guest

register (Ex.P122) containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A) relating to reservation

of accommodation in the hostel for two days i.e. March 20 &amp; 21, 1975 by

him for a guest „Pawan Kumar of Azamgarh‟. It revealed that the said

reservation was made at A-1‟s instance and the accommodation was used

by him to stay with A-3. On A-2‟s interrogation, it came to light that he

had booked a berth in second class on March 15, 1975 in the name of

„Pankaj Kumar‟ to perform journey from Delhi to Howrah by a train

departing Delhi on March 25, 1975 at the instance of A-1. A-1 allegedly

asked A-2 on March 21, 1975 for another reservation in the said train in

the name of „Ramesh Kumar‟. After recording statements of the relevant

witnesses and scanning relevant railway documents, it revealed that A-1

and A-3 had performed the journey on the tickets reserved in fictitious

names by A-2. The investigating agency discovered on A-1‟s

interrogation that Tilak Raj Bhatia (PW-4) and Charan Singh (PW-5) had

knowledge about the movements of A-1 and his associates at the time of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 8 of 201</span>
 commission of the crime. In their statements recorded on July 10, 1975,

PW-4 and PW-5 confirmed the account of the occurrence later on given

by the approver.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.          During further investigation, the exhibits were sent to Central

Forensic Science Laboratory for examination and its reports were

collected. Specimen handwriting and signatures of the appellants were

obtained and sent for comparison with the questioned documents. The

Chief Investigating Officer obtained the required sanction (Ex.P-153)

from the Administrator of Union Territory of Delhi for the prosecution of

A-1, A-3 and Ram Nagina Prasad under <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_21">Sections 4</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1539301/" id="a_22">6</a>, <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_23">Explosive

Substances Act</a>, 1908. On completion of investigation, CBI submitted the

final report to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on August 28, 1975. The

learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate recorded the statement of Vikram,

the approver, on various dates between December 03, 1975 and January

14, 1976 and committed the case to the Court of Sessions by an order

dated January 23, 1976.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.          After hearing both the sides and considering the record of the

case, the Trial Court did not find sufficient ground to proceed against Ram

Nagina Prasad for the offence of criminal conspiracy to kill CJI. For the

reasons given in the order dated 14.05.1976, Ram Nagina Prasad was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 9 of 201</span>
 exonerated of the charge under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_24">Section 120B</a> IPC. He was charged-

sheeted for committing offences under <a href="/doc/747401/" id="a_25">Sections 4(b)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1539301/" id="a_26">6</a>, <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_27">Explosive

Substances Act</a>. Joint charges under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_28">Section 120B</a> IPC were framed

against the appellants. A-1 and A-3 in addition were charged for

committing offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_29">Section 307</a> IPC and 4(b) <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_30">Explosive Substances

Act</a>. The appellants abjured their guilt and claimed trial. The prosecution

examined 85 witnesses in all on various dates. Statements of the

appellants were recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_31">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. The Trial Court

undertook a very elaborated exercise by putting almost 171 questions to

the appellants with respect to the evidence brought on record and the

circumstance appearing against them to give an opportunity to explain.

The appellants denied their complicity in the crime and pleaded false

implication. Plea of alibi was set up by A-1 &amp; A-3. The defence examined

eight witnesses and relied upon documents (Ex.D1 to Ex.D67).

</p><p id="p_17">12.          The Trial Court examined the grievances raised by the

appellants elaborately. After appreciating the evidence and considering

the rival contentions of the parties, the Trial Court by the impugned

detailed judgment acquitted Ram Nagina Prasad of the charge and

convicted the appellants for the offences described previously. Being


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 10 of 201</span>
 aggrieved and dissatisfied, they have preferred the appeals. It is pertinent

to note that State did not challenge Ram Nagina Prasad‟s acquittal.

(B)          Submissions / Arguments on behalf of the Appellants

</p><p id="p_18">13.          I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great length

on various dates.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.          Learned counsel for A-3 strenuously urged that the Trial

Court did not appreciate the evidence in its true and proper perspective.

He stressed that Vikram‟s statement cannot be read into evidence. He

informed    that    during      the   pendency   of   instant   appeals,    in

Crl.A.No.174/2012, „<a href="/doc/135573998/" id="a_32">Sudevanand vs. State</a>‟, 2012 (3) SCC 387, Supreme

Court by an order 19.01.2012 ordered to recall PW-Vikram for further

cross-examination. CBI, however, could not trace Vikram and expressed

inability to examine him. He further urged that under Articles 141, 142

and 144 of the Constitution of India, this Court was bound to follow the

order dated 19.01.2012 in letter and sprit. Besides this, the Supreme Court

doubted the truthfulness, honesty and reliability of the statement of

Vikram as he (PW-Vikram) had made two diametrically opposite

statements one before CBI (in the instant case) and other before CID in

Danapur Jail on 30.09.1978. Adopting an alternative argument, counsel

urged that even if approver‟s statement is taken into consideration, he is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 11 of 201</span>
 not a reliable and trustworthy witness and under <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_33">Section 3</a> of the Evidence

Act, his statement cannot be read as part of evidence. Vikram knowingly

furnished false address, fake surety and dishonest undertaking not to leave

Delhi till trial in L.N.Misra case was over. The said trial is still continuing

and despite issuance of non-bailable warrants, he chose not to appear

before the Court. CBI was hand-in-glove with approver Vikram from the

beginning and was solely responsible for his abscondance. Learned

counsel further urged that statement of PW-1, approver Vikram, is beyond

the parameters of <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_34">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C. An accomplice who needs pardon

from the trial of the offence must be involved in the crime and that his

acts must constitute wilfully taking part in the said crime. In the instant

case, PW-1 was not a willing party to the crime. He obeyed A-1 without

application of mind. His statement has not been corroborated in material

particulars by any independent witness. PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-44

(Rajbir Singh), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and PW-57 (Raj Singh) were

defectors from the „Organisation‟ and were themselves suspects. Their

role was not different from that of PW-Vikram. Their statements recorded

under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_35">Sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_36">164</a> Cr.P.C. were not voluntary as during

Emergency they were kept in detention for number of days and forced to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                    Page 12 of 201</span>
 give evidence as per CBI‟s dictates. They could not corroborate the

statement of PW-Vikram.
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.             Counsel further urged that the prosecution could not establish

if the appellants hatched „criminal conspiracy‟ to base conviction for the

offence under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_37">Section 120B</a> IPC. Relying upon various judgments,

Counsel pointed out that acts subsequent to the achieving of the object of

conspiracy have to be ignored from the essential elements of conspiracy.

Any subsequent act which though unlawful, would not make the accused a

part of the conspiracy. If two views are possible, the one favourable to the

accused has to be adopted. He further emphasised that the prosecution is

required to stand on its own legs and cannot get any advantage from the

explanations given by the accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_38">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. Mere false

explanation in answer to a question under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_39">Section 313</a> would not come

within the purview of additional link or circumstance against the accused

towards his guilt. He emphasised that mere membership of an

„Organisation‟ cannot incriminate a person unless he is proved to have

resorted to the acts of violence. In the instant case, Anand Marga, an

„association‟     or   „Organisation‟   (hereinafter   to   be   referred   as

„Organisation‟) was banned by Central Government after internal

Emergency in June, 1975. The appellants and Vikram were falsely

 implicated as they were members of the banned „Organisation‟ and were

allegedly associated together. A-3 was never a party to criminal

conspiracy for committing the murder of the CJI. There is no evidence if

A-3 had attended any meeting where any such conspiracy was discussed.

Statement made by approver cannot be taken as independent evidence and

is inadmissible under <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_40">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act.

</p><p id="p_21">16.          Counsel further argued that since the prosecution case was

based upon circumstantial evidence, it was legally required to prove each

and every fact or circumstance beyond reasonable doubt. The

circumstances so proved must form a chain where the inference is only of

the crime committed and that the evidence should be such which goes

only to prove that the alleged conspirators had committed the crime and

that there is no other hypothesis or theory sustainable except indicating

directly towards the guilt of the accused. The Counsel pointed out various

omissions in the statement of PW-57 (Raj Singh) whereby he did not

name A-3 to be the „individual‟ who stayed with PW-Vikram on the night

of 19.03.1975 at his house. There was no independent corroboration to

PW-57 (Raj Singh)‟s statement who remained in police custody from July

01 to July 09 and never went to the office during this period. Criticising

PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)‟s testimony, he pointed out that he did not know
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 14 of 201</span>
 A-3 but identified him after the police had shown him. Similarly, PW-5

(Charan Singh) did not know A-3. The Trial Court rightly observed that

A-3‟s refusal to participate in the TIP was justified and could not be used

against him. PW-30 (Ramesh Kumar Bagdi)‟s statement in the

identification of A-3 was not reliable. He categorically admitted that

requisition slip (Ex.P57) was shown to him in June, 1975 when in fact

such a slip was allegedly recovered by the police on 13.07.1975 from PW-

25 (Prem Prakash Sharma). He did not utter a word about A-3‟s presence

in the train with A-1. Evidence of Foot Print Expert, PW-38 (P.S.Nayyar),

was violative of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_41">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India. While in police

custody, A-3 was subjected to custodial violence and was forced to wear

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2). That was an effort of CBI to make him a

witness against himself. Since the Trial Court did not believe A-3‟s

disclosure statement (Ex.P101), reliance on the statement of PW-53 (Shiv

Charan) regarding purchase of „hawai‟ chappals from his shop on

20.03.1975 was not permissible. CBI could not establish cogent evidence

regarding stay of A-3 in the hostel. PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) did not talk to

A-3 on any of the days including March 25.
</p>
<p id="p_22">17.          Counsel further urged that period of hatching of conspiracy

was described in the charge. Acts committed prior or after the said period
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 15 of 201</span>
 of conspiracy are not within its ambit. The FIR talks only of „one

assailant‟ but CBI in complete disregard of the said FIR changed the

prosecution story during investigation. On the same set of evidence, Ram

Nagina Prasad was acquitted. Thus conviction of A-3 under <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_42">Section 4</a> (b)

of the <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_43">Explosive Substances Act</a> was not acceptable. Counsel further

emphasised that investigation and trial were not fair, transparent and legal.

CBI started investigation on 30.06.1975 when internal Emergency had

already come into operation. It is unbelievable that CBI knew it on that

very day that A-1, A-3 and Vikram were involved in the aforesaid attack.

This fact was entertained by various CBI investigators especially PW-71

(B.R.Puri), DSP, CBI, who was already involved in the investigation of

various cases including Anand Murti‟s case and L.N.Misra murder case.

PW-71 was absolutely prejudiced against the workers of                   the

„Organisation‟ and influenced the Chief Investigating Officer to involve

the appellants in this case. The investigation was completely biased,

motivated and mala-fide.

<p id="p_23">18.          Counsel further urged that sentence order itself was illegal

under <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_44">Section 31</a> Cr.P.C. which provides that maximum consecutive

sentence cannot exceed more than fourteen years. Finally, the counsel

urged that A-3 has suffered agony of trial for more than 37 years. He

 deserves acquittal due to long delay in disposal of the appeal. Since, there

is no minimum sentence provided under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_45">Section 307</a> IPC, the appellant

reliable witness. After the Emergency came to an end in 1977, CID in

Bihar informed Bihar Government about the cases registered against

Anand Margies whereby CBI falsely implicated them to cover up the real

culprits. Bihar Government took the matter seriously and investigated it

through their officials. They found that approver Vikram was forced

through horrific torture to toe the line of CBI. He retracted his confession

via tape recording by the jail Superintendent and also verbally repeated

that statement to the Chief Secretary, Bihar. Chief Minister of Bihar,

requested Mr. Justice V.M.Tarakunde to give legal opinion. After

perusing the relevant documents of the case, Justice Tarakunde came to

the conclusion that case was false and was of the view that there should be

a fresh probe into the incident and innocent persons should be discharged.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 18 of 201</span>
 PW- Vikram was directed to be recalled to confront him with the

statement recorded in Danapur jail but CBI deliberately opted not to

produce him. He further argued that there were various discrepancies,

omissions and improvements in the statements of the approver Vikram.

Moreover, he never attributed any role to him. A-2 was never present in

any meeting to have the slightest knowledge of existence of any such

conspiracy. PW-Vikram admitted that he did not know if A-2 was a

conspirator or not. He further argued that he had never shown the CJI to

A-1 in the Supreme Court. Moreover, this circumstance was not enough to

show his involvement in the conspiracy. The other alleged overt act that

he (A-2) obtained railway tickets for A-1 and A-3 in the fictitious names

is not incriminating in nature as the alleged conspiracy was hatched,

implemented and finished on 20.03.1975 itself. Moreover, these tickets

did not in any manner further the alleged conspiracy. At the relevant time,

A-1 was an accused in the self-immolation case of Acharya

Dhineshwarand. He was one of the lawyers for the „Organisation‟ at that

time. He did not communicate directly with A-1 but acted through a

„parokar‟. It cannot be assumed that he and A-1 had direct contact or vice

versa. Even for the sake of argument if in order to avoid arrest in self-

immolation case, A-1 or his parokar wanted to obtain train tickets on his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 19 of 201</span>
 behalf in some fictitious names for usual travel and requested him (A-2) to

book them, it was wholly reasonable as the said reservation for train

tickets did nothing whatsoever to assist or advance the cause of

conspiracy of 20.03.1975. A-2 was arrested during Emergency being a

follower of the banned „Organisation‟. A-2 had no motive to make an

attempt to murder the CJI. The Trial Court was not correct to conclude

that motive was sufficiently shown merely by drawing an interference of

his being an Anand Margi. The prosecution witnesses examined by the

police against A-2 were defectors from the „Organisation‟. The

„Organisation‟ to which A-2 was attached never preached violence. His

denial to be a follower of the „Organisation‟ in 313 statement cannot be

taken as an additional link to complete the chain as the prosecution was

required to stand on its own legs. A-2 further urged that he was never a

party to the criminal conspiracy and never participated in it in any form.

<p id="p_28">(C)          Submissions / Arguments on behalf of CBI

</p><p id="p_29">22.          Controverting the arguments of the appellants, learned

counsel for CBI urged that Vikram‟s evidence was reliable and it passed

the test of „General Reliability‟. It remained unshaken and un-impeached

despite grueling cross-examination spanning over eight days by as many

as four counsel. Vikram was able to recall material names, places, dates

and other relevant details. Evidence made by Vikram has been duly

corroborated in material particulars. The confession made by Vikram was

further corroborated in terms of the sequence of events i.e. the events and

conspiracy prior to the date of incident, as well as the events after escape

made by the accused persons from the site of incident. He further stressed

that the observations of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in order dated 19.01.2012

have been taken out of context and are being wrongly relied upon by the

appellants. These observations were only with respect to the limited

question of the calling the witness for re-examination. At no stage, did the

Supreme Court materially deal with the evidence given by Vikram before

the Trial Court nor did it juxtapose with alleged statements made before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 21 of 201</span>
 the jail authorities in Danapur. The Supreme Court never tested the

evidence of Vikram proved on the anvil of „reliability‟. The observations

at best constitute obiter and are not law in terms of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_74">Article 141</a> of the

Constitution of India. Vikram could not be produced for cross-

examination as he was not traceable despite sincere efforts made by CBI.

He was not available either in Delhi or his native place in Bihar. His

brother Parmanand informed that he last met him in the year 1980-1981 in

Danapur jail and after that his family had made efforts to trace him but

could not find him. His whereabouts are not known and it is doubtful if he

is still „alive‟ or „dead‟. Under <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_75">Section 33</a> of the Evidence Act, Vikram‟s

statement is admissible. Evidence given by PW-Vikram in L.N.Misra case

is also admissible in the present proceedings where he (PW-Vikram)

clearly stated that his statements before jail authorities were obtained

against his wishes and were incorrect. He further urged that Vikram‟s

availability was not known to either of the parties when the matter was

pending before the Supreme Court. Vikram was discharged in this case in

1976 and was released on bail in L.N.Misra case in 1985. As the matter is

38 years old and he has not been heard or seen by any of his relatives who

would have naturally heard of him if he had been alive, it should be

presumed that he is „dead‟ under <a href="/doc/985205/" id="a_76">Section 108</a> of the Evidence Act and his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 22 of 201</span>
 evidence is admissible. CBI had no role when Vikram was released on

bail after 11 years. PW-Vikram was examined before the Courts eight

times at different stages and his stand remained consistent. Alleged

statements recorded before the Jail Authorities, Danapur, without any

authority of law and in complete violation of legal provisions were

inadmissible in evidence. Report of the Justice Tarakunde was only an

opinion and is not an admissible piece of evidence. There was a conflict of

interest as A-2 was junior of Justice Tarakunde and as a lawyer, had

appeared in the case on his behalf. The alleged retraction dated

30.09.1975 was in the knowledge of the appellants right through the

beginning and Vikram was confronted with such material in the year 1981

in L.N.Misra case. However, the appellants deliberately did not rake up

the said issue till 1998 for seeking summoning of Vikram for further

examination and waited for 17 years to ensure that Vikram would not be

available for further cross-examination. As per material available on

record, there is no doubt that Vikram was an accomplice with the

appellants in an attempt to murder the CJI.
</p>
<p id="p_30">23.          Counsel further urged that pardon under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_77">Section 306</a> granted

to him was legal as Vikram was very much part of the conspiracy and

played active role to achieve its object. The appellants never challenged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 23 of 201</span>
 the grant of pardon to him. From Vikram‟s evidence, it is clear that he has

made full and true disclosures of the whole of the circumstances within

his knowledge, involving himself directly in the crime and also specifying

the role played by the appellants. The investigation was honest, fair and

transparent. Gopalji, Mahender Pratap Singh and Abrol were not

proceeded with despite their arrest in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_31">24.          Apart from the evidence of Vikram, the independent

evidence of Raj Singh, Jai Nand, Inder Singh, Charan Singh, Tilak Raj

Bhatia and Parasnath clearly established that Vikram was an accomplice

and part of the conspiracy. The prosecution collected direct and

circumstantial evidence to corroborate approver Vikram in material

particulars. Documents Ex.P23 and Ex.P25 (requisition slips) and address

of A-1 at point Q20 in Ex.P127 (diary of A-2 which are in his hand)

coupled with oral evidence, proved complicity of A-2 in the conspiracy.

Once it is proved that the appellants had conspired to commit the murder

of CJI, acts, declarations and conduct (during the existence of the

conspiracy) of each of the conspirator in reference to their common

intention are admissible against them. He further urged that a false plea

taken in 313 statement can be considered as an additional circumstance if

other circumstances proved and established point out the guilt of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 24 of 201</span>
 accused. In the end, he urged that the sentence awarded to the appellants

is commensurate with the offence committed by them. Mere pendency of

appeal for the last about 37 years is no ground to modify or alter the

sentence. Reliance has been placed on : „SCBA vs. UOI‟, AIR 1998 SC

</p><p id="p_33">25.          Before embarking on an evaluation of the rival submissions,

it would be apposite to note that the „Organisation‟ undeniably had no

hand in the crime. CBI did not implicate / suspect the „Organisation‟ in

any manner for any active or passive role in the crime. The „Organisation‟

cannot be condemned for individual acts of its followers for any criminal

activity. To say that CBI was not favourably disposed or had any malice /

bias towards it has no credible foundation.

</p><p id="p_37">27.          PW-78 (Insp. Sajan Singh), SHO, PS Tughalak Road with his

police personnel rushed to the spot after getting information from the

Police Control Room at 04.40 P.M. and made futile attempt to locate the

culprit. After recording Jamadar - Jai Nand‟s statement (Ex.P16), he

lodged First Information Report and conducted required proceedings

about seizure of the car, „hawai‟ chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) and

preparation of their sketches (Ex.P18 and Ex.P19). PW- Major Sharma

from the Army arrived and defused the hand-grenades. He got the crime

scene photographed. Statements of SI Om Parkash, Ramji Lal, Inder

Singh, Jai Nand, Major Sharma and Const. Jai Lal were recorded by him

that day. In the cross-examination, he disclosed that SI Om Parkash had

given him two digits of the number of the taxi as DLT-14 or 41.

witness box and gave detailed account of the occurrence without

implicating any individual. He deposed that some „object‟ had dropped

near the foot of his son on the mat after hitting on his left arm near the

shoulder. Within a split second, another „object‟ dropped in the car from

the right side and fell on the foot board. He further deposed that noting

„someone‟ running, Jamadar Jai Nand (PW-2) chased him towards Mandi

House. CJI was able to observe that fleeing man was a bit tallish and thin.

He further told that Jamadar who lived in the quarters attached to his

residence informed him in the evening that he was not able to catch that

man despite chase. He fairly admitted that he was not aware if the two

„objects‟ had been thrown in the car through two different windows. He

had no suspicion on anyone. He denied the suggestion that the two

„objects‟ already planted in the upper rack of the car in its rear portion had

fallen after the car stopped at the red signal. There was no basis /

foundation for such a suggestion which was not consistent with the

the fleeing man i.e. tallish in height and thin from legs described by the

 and the part of the statement as quoted by the Trial Court in the impugned

judgment reads :
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "No sooner did the car pull up at the stop line then a young
       man nearly 5‟.8" in height, sallow complexion, medium
       built, wearing a light sky blue shirt and brown pants came
       to the car from the left side (i.e. east side) foot path of Tilak
       Marg and threw something at the Chief Justice in the car. I
       heard the thud of that object falling in the car, turned round
       and saw that that man had thrown another object in the rear
       seat of the car. That man then went behind the car and ran
       towards Bhagwan Dass Road. I immediately opened the
       door, got out and chased that man, shouting „pakro, pakro‟.
       He entered a taxi waiting at Bhagwan Dass Road. Seeing
       me still chasing him, he got out of the taxi and started
       running. A constable in uniform who had heard my shouts
       tried to intercept that man, but he succeeded in eluding him
       and crossing into the Garhwal House over its gate.
       Constable Jai Lal (I learnt his name subsequently) and I
       and some other persons including SI Om Prakash (I learnt
       his name later) continued the chase. That man scaled the
       rear gate of Garhwal House and disappeared behind the
       Haryana House. He had earlier discarded his chappals at
       the road near the car. On my return to the car after the
       chase, I found that the Chief Justice and his son had already
       gone back to the Supreme Court. Driver Inder Singh, who
       was present near the car, told me that, that man had thrown
       hand grenades in the car. I myself saw the hand grenades
       lying on the floor board of the car, rear-side. Two kerchiefs
       and a piece of newspaper were also lying nearly. I can
       identify that man."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">33.          The complainant gave a graphic detail of the incident at the

earliest available opportunity. He claimed to have witnessed the assailant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 29 of 201</span>
 who had thrown the hand-grenade in the car; described his identifying

features and asserted to identify him. While appearing as PW-2, Jai Nand

proved the version given to the police at the first instance without major

variations. He deposed that after hearing the „sound‟ of something falling

inside the car on the side on which son of the Chief Justice was sitting, he

looked that side, but could see nothing. When he turned behind, he saw

„another‟ person, standing on the side of the car where the Chief Justice

was sitting. The said „man‟ wrapped „something‟ in a handkerchief and

threw through the window at the place where CJI was sitting. He

explained that the said „man‟ had come close to the car. When he inquired

as to what he was doing, the „man‟ wearing a light blue shirt and pants of

brown colour, immediately ran away. He chased him shouting „pakro -

pakro‟. The said „individual‟ ran towards Bhagwan Dass Road and

entered into a waiting taxi at Bhagwan Dass Road but instantaneously

came out of it and ran. On hearing him „pakro - pakro‟, a constable from

DDA flats tried to catch hold of him but he succeeded eluding him (the

constable), and crossed the gate of Garhwal House. The witness further

stated that he saw one of the chappals being discarded by him on the right-

hand side of the car. The other chappal was discarded at some distance

from there. These were „hawai‟ chappals with a strap. He and other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 30 of 201</span>
 chasers crossed the Garhwal House in pursuit of the assailant. He could

see that „man‟ only up to the rear gate of the Garhwal House and

thereafter, he disappeared. After crossing the rear gate, he went up to

Haryana Bhawan but could not find the assailant. He returned to the scene

of occurrence at about 05.00 or 05.15 P.M. where the police had already

arrived. PW-2 (Jai Nand) identified A-3 to be the assailant who was

chased by him. He also identified A-1 to be the „individual‟ to whom he

had seen standing behind the car and „staring‟ around. He elaborated that

A-3 did not have any beard or long hair that time. He further deposed that

on July 30 or 31, 1975, he went to Tihar jail for identifying the culprits

but the identification parade did not take place.
</p>
<p id="p_47">34.          In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), the witness

revealed that the police recorded his statements in March, July and

August, 1975. He explained and clarified that he had only heard the

„sound‟ of the first article falling in the car and was unaware whether that

article was thrown inside the car from the left or right side. He was

emphatic that he only saw „one‟ man throwing an article into the rear seat

of the car only once and his description was given by him to the police.

He admitted the suggestion that the description of that „man‟ standing

behind the car was similar to that of A-1 minus his beard and long hair.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 31 of 201</span>
 He denied the suggestion that he had mentioned about the „second‟ man

standing behind the car for the first time in his statement before CBI. The

witness was emphatic to say that he could not say definitely whether the

„man‟ to whom he had chased had thrown both the hand-grenades or only

one. He claimed that he saw A-1 face to face from close quarter. His

statement was recorded at about 06.00 P.M. at the spot and it took 15

minutes. The witness further revealed that he did not note the number of

the taxi.
</p>
<p id="p_48">35.          In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-3), he asserted that

the „man‟ to whom he saw on the left side rear window of the car was

standing hardly a half feet away from the car. He had thrust his hand

inside the car while throwing the hand-grenade. The said „man‟ had

already left the spot before his getting out of the car and he had chased

him shouting „pakro - pakro‟ and not „chor - chor‟. The witness further

revealed that window panes of the car were already down while leaving

the Supreme Court. He saw the face of the fleeing culprit thrice; First,

when he was standing near the car; second time when he entered into the

taxi; and lastly, when he was scaling the front gate for one or two seconds

each time. The distance between the taxi and the car was about 200 or 225

yards.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 32 of 201</span><p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50"> 36.           He elaborated that he only saw „something‟ falling in the

handkerchief and had heard the „Thud‟ of falling of the second article. He

denied the suggestion that he had seen „someone‟ else fleeing from the

scene of occurrence and that A-3 was falsely implicated at the instance of

the police.
</p>
<p id="p_51">37.           On scrutinizing the entire statement, it is clear that despite

searching and lengthy cross-examination, no material discrepancies could

be elicited to disbelieve the cogent and reliable version narrated by this

independent and natural witness who had no ulterior motive to give

detailed account of the occurrence and to describe the feature of the

assailant to whom he had seen fleeing from the spot (after throwing an

article inside the car). Presence of the witness and his reaction soon after

the occurrence to chase the culprit was quite natural and reasonable. His

presence with CJI was not accidental, but consistent with his duties. He

had no prior animosity or acquaintance with any of the accused to create a

false evidence at the instance of the police or CBI. None of the assailants

was named or implicated by him in his statement (Ex.P-16). The

discrepancies, omissions and improvements highlighted by learned

counsel for the appellants are not material to suspect his testimony in its

entirety. The horrible occurrence was sudden and unexpected. It was not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 33 of 201</span>
 expected from the witness to describe it minutely in the FIR. The primary

object of the FIR from the point of view of the informant is to set the

criminal law in motion. The prompt and early reporting of the occurrence

with all its vivid details gives an assurance regarding truth of the

prosecution version. It is vital and valuable piece of evidence for

appreciating the evidence led at the trial. It is manifest that an FIR is not

intended to be a very detailed document and is meant to give only the

substance of the allegations made.
</p>
<p id="p_52">               FIR is not an encyclopedia. It need not contain an exhaustive

account of the incident. Non-mentioning of minute details thereon does

not mean that the facts do not exist and its author was not aware of the

details. At that point of time, recording of the statement (Ex.P-16) was to

set the police machinery into motion. There is every possibility of minor

mismatch between the version recorded in 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_84">Cr.P.C</a>. and the statement

given in Court. In „<a href="/doc/94136948/" id="a_85">Naresh Kumar vs. State</a>‟, 206 (2014) DLT (1) DB, this

Court held :

          purpose of contradicting prosecution. No sanctimony

          recorded by the police during the course of
          investigation as before the police witness is susceptible
          to all kinds of pulls and pressures to follow a
          particular line and therefore, ultimately it is deposition
          of a witness before the Court of Law which is held to
          be sanctimonious......"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_54">38.          PW-2 (Jai Nand), whenever confronted with the statement

(Ex.P-16) gave plausible explanation and clarified the mismatch. The

material facts deposed by him remained unchallenged and uncontroverted

in the cross-examination. Futile attempt was made to argue that the

witness had initially introduced the story of „one‟ assailant in the FIR.

Subsequently, in connivance with CBI, he made significant improvements

in his Court deposition and introduced the theory of „two‟ assailants who

had thrown the hand-grenades inside the car. Scanning the contents of the

FIR, it transpires that the witness was sure that a young „man‟ whose

description was given in the FIR had thrown an „object‟ in the rear seat of

the car. He did not in categorical terms rule out the presence of „some

one‟ else. In Court statement, he gave reasonable and acceptable

explanation. Apparently, the shocking incident had taken place

unexpectedly in a fraction of second. The occupants in the car were taken

by surprise and did not know as to what had really happened. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 35 of 201</span>
 unprecedented event bewildered all of them. When PW-2 (Jai Nand)

heard the thud / noise / sound of an „object‟ falling in the car at the first

instance, his natural reaction was to turn back and find out as to what

exactly had happened. At that moment, he saw an „individual‟ standing on

the side of the car throwing the „object‟ through the open window. The

witness had even asked the „man‟ as to what he was doing. When the said

„individual‟ ran away, PW-2 immediately chased him shouting „pakro -

pakro‟. He did not state in so many words that the first „object‟ of which

he had heard the noise / thud was handiwork of the assailant who had

thrown the „object‟ through the window. He had not stated or disclosed

that both the objects were thrown inside the car by „one‟ and the same

individual. After return from unsuccessful chase to A-3, he found that two

hand-grenades were thrown inside the car. In the cross-examination, the

witness elaborated and explained that he was not a witness when the first

hand-grenade was thrown inside the car and had not seen the said

„assailant‟. During investigation, it revealed that A-1 was the assailant to

whom the witness had seen standing behind the car „staring‟ while the

other assailant who had thrown the hand-grenade had fled the spot and

was chased by him. Even in his deposition before the Court, PW-2 (Jai

Nand) did not depose if A-1 had thrown the object / hand-grenade inside
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 36 of 201</span>
 the car. Neither this witness nor the investigating agency had any clue

about the perpetrators of the crime at that time. The appellants‟ contention

of introduction of „two‟ men theory subsequently is devoid of any merit.

</p><p id="p_55">39.          PW-2 (Jai Nand) made a positive identification of A-1 and

A-3 in the Court. Earlier, he had gone to Tihar Jail to participate in the

TIP. On July 30, 1975, A-1 and A-3 declined to join the TIP. In written

applications (Ex.P2 &amp; Ex.P3), they attempted to justify refusal for non-

participation in TIP alleging that their faces remained uncovered and they

were shown to witnesses at the airport and out side the Courtroom where

they were produced. They, however, did not name the officer who had

directed them to uncover their faces. They also did not name any specific

individual to whom they were shown. No complaint was lodged or made

by them to the Metropolitan Magistrate before whom they were produced

that day. It is worthy to note that in the cross-examination, not a single

question was put to PW-2 (Jai Nand) if he had gone to Delhi Airport on

July 28, 1975 or at Tis Hazari Courts, or that he was among the

individuals who had seen them that day. The application for holding TIP

proceedings was moved in promptitude without any delay soon after the

culprits were brought to Delhi. Remand application (Ex.P-30) and order of

the Court (Ex.P-30/A) reflect that A-1 and A-3 were produced in muffled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 37 of 201</span>
 faces and no grievance was raised by them that time. PW-2 (Jai Nand) had

no extraneous consideration to falsely identify A-1 and A-3 in the Court.

It is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the evidence of

identification in Court. The facts, which establish the identity of the

accused persons are relevant under <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_86">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act. PW-2

(Jai Nand) had reasonable, fair and sufficient opportunity to observe and

note the broad features of the assailant (A-3) to whom he had seen

throwing the hand-grenade inside the car. The occurrence had taken place

during day time on March 20, 1975 when there was sufficient light at the

spot. It enabled PW-Jai Nand to identify the assailant. Not only PW-2 (Jai

Nand) had witnessed A-3 throwing the hand-grenade inside the car, he

had given a long chase and had seen him attempting to take shelter in the

taxi standing nearby and then coming out of it soon thereafter and

escaping after going inside the Garhwal House. It is quite possible for him

to remember the features of the assailant as he had direct confrontation /

encounter with A-3. No suggestion was put in the cross-examination that

the description given by the witness in FIR did not tally with the features

of A-3. Regarding A-1, the witness had merely a fleeting glance and had

purportedly seen him while standing behind the car after he had come out

of the car to chase A-3. He did not describe his features at that time.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 38 of 201</span>
 Corroboration will be required to establish A-1‟s identity in these

circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_56">40.          On a consideration of the evidence, this Court holds its

disagreement with the Trial Court that the prosecution had failed to

establish by the evidence of PW-2 (Jai Nand) with regard to identification

of the culprits. In „Harijana Thiru Pala and Others vs. Public Prosecutor,

High Court of Andhra Pradesh‟, Supereme Court observed : "Doubtless

the High Court in appeal either against an order of acquittal or

conviction as a Court of first appeal has full power to review the evidence

to reach to its own conclusion "
</p>
<p id="p_57">             In „<a href="/doc/1772862/" id="a_87">Shyam Babu and Others vs. State of Haryana</a>‟, AIR 2009

SC 577, Supreme Court held that where the accused persons had refused

to join TIP, it would speak volumes, about their participation in the crime.

</p><p id="p_58">41.          A fair reading of the evidence tendered by this witness makes

it evident that he has stated the facts seen by him in a simple manner

without any noticeable embellishments. What is mentioned by the witness

is that he had seen A-3 running and „hurriedly‟ entering into the taxi and

fleeing thereafter. It was not explained by A-3 what made him to run away

from the spot, entering into taxi and then disappearing from the spot.

Nothing was suggested if A-1 or A-3 were available outside Delhi. PW-2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 39 of 201</span>
 is certain about the identity of A-3 and the role played by him in the

occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_59">42.           Another equally important witness is PW-7 (Om Prakash)

who was posted in Special Branch of CID in March, 1975 and was on ten

days‟ leave for preparation of LLM studies. He lived in quarter No. 4,

Type-III at Tilak Marg. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.15 P.M., he was

going on cycle to his flat from the side of Tilak Bridge. He deposed that

when he reached near the traffic lights, he heard people shouting „pakro -

pakro‟at Bhagwan Dass Road. He saw an „individual‟ in white uniform

with a white turban (identified PW-2) chasing the culprit wearing a blue

shirt, badami pants, slim in body, sanwla complexion, short moustaches

and hair. He joined the chasers. The fleeing man entered into a taxi

standing at Bhagwan Dass Road near DDA flats; soon came out of it; fled

towards Garhwal House and entered into it by scaling over its gate. He

identified A-3 to be the individual who was being chased. He further

deposed that A-3 was unable to be caught and he returned to the spot. He

also saw two „chappals‟ lying on the right side of the car. He identified A-

3 at R.K.Puram after he declined to join TIP in Tihar.
</p>
<p id="p_60">43.           In the cross-examination, he stated that Jai Nand (PW-2) was

with him on return to the scene of occurrence from Haryana Bhawan. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 40 of 201</span>
 admitted that in his statement (Ex.D8) to the CBI, he had given the

number of the taxi, DLT something like "14‟, „49‟ or „69". He admitted

that in his statements (Ex.D18 and Ex.D19), he had not mentioned about

the „chappals‟ lying at the spot. He denied the suggestion that statement

given by him in the Court was a hearsay account given to him by the

Jamadar on their way back.
</p>
<p id="p_61">44.          Replying to the question put on behalf of the A-3, he recalled

that it was Jamadar who was shouting „pakro - pakro‟. He denied the

suggestion that he had to wait at the traffic lights for 50 seconds from the

time he had heard „pakro - pakro‟ until the traffic light turned green. He

explained that face of the fleeing culprit was seen thrice; first when he

entered the taxi; second when he came out of it and third when he scaled

over the rear gate for 10-15 seconds each time. He denied that false

evidence was given by him expecting departmental promotion.

</p><p id="p_62">45.          On examination of the testimony of this independent witness,

it transpires that he has corroborated the version given by PW- Jai Nand

without major variations. Presence of this witness was natural and

probable as he had residential accommodation in flats at Tilak Marg near

the crime spot and had given chase to an „unknown‟ culprit. It cannot be

accepted that he was a planted witness. His statement under Section 161
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 41 of 201</span>
 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_88">Cr.P.C</a>. was recorded the same day when even the identity of the

assailants was not known. The witness being in responsible official job

was not expected to falsely implicate an innocent one. He gave minute

detail of the sequence of event which prompted him to chase the fleeing

culprit even though he was not aware as to what was the offence

committed by him. Being a police officer, his natural instant reaction on

hearing the shouts of „pakro - pakro‟ was to chase the fleeing culprit. In

the performance of his duty, among other chasers, he attempted to catch

hold of the fleeing man. Soon after return to the spot, he described the

salient features of the fleeing man and volunteered to participate in the

TIP. In Court, he had no hesitation to recognize and identify A-3 to whom

he had given an unsuccessful chase. In the absence of prior animosity or

ill-will, this witness had no extraneous consideration to falsely identify

him. It is true that for certain omissions in the statements (Ex.D18 and

Ex.D19) recorded by police and CBI, he has been confronted. However,

these omissions or improvements do not discredit the version given by

him on material facts. Presence of this witness at the spot was not

challenged in the cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_63">46.          Another important witness on similar facts examined by the

prosecution is PW-65 (Jai Lal, Ex. Constable). In March, 1975, he was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 42 of 201</span>
 posted in the demolition squad of the DDA at Vikas Bhawan and was on

duty at the residence of Sh. Jag Mohan, Vice Chairman, DDA, flat No. 1

at 7, Bhagwan Dass Road, New Delhi. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.15

P.M., after hearing shouts of „pakro - pakro‟, he went out on the patari

and witnessed 4 or 5 persons coming from Tilak Marg side chasing a

culprit who wanted to enter the DDA flats. Being at the gate, he stood

ready to catch hold of him but the assailant jumped over into Garhwal

House locked at that time after eluding him. He prompted PW-Ramji Lal

on duty in the inquiry office to block him near the rear gate of Garhwal

House. PW-Jai Lal identified A-3 to be the assailant to whom he had

chased unsuccessfully. In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), he

further highlighted that a taxi was standing at a distance of nearly 50 yards

from the gate.
</p>
<p id="p_64">47.          In the cross-examination (conducted by A-3), he explained

that he saw the face of the culprit only once when he came face to face

while he stood poised for catching hold of him in his arm. He reasoned for

not running towards the culprit to catch hold of him, because he himself

 police or CBI and was on duty at the relevant time near the spot. It makes

him a credible and reliable witness and his testimony inspires implicit

confidence. He was not acquainted with the fleeing man and was not

aware as to what crime he had committed. Being on duty at the residence

of Vice Chairman, DDA it was natural for him to chase the fleeing man

after hearing shouts of „pakro - pakro‟. He joined other chasers to

apprehend the fleeing man whose identity was not known to him. In his

statement recorded on the same day by Delhi police, he gave detailed

account of the occurrence and unsuccessful chase. The witness had direct

confrontation with the fleeing man who wanted to enter DDA flats to

escape. When this witness got ready to apprehend him, he eluded him and

went inside the Garhwal House by jumping into it. Again, this witness

chased him to that place. Presence of this witness at the spot has not been

denied or disputed. No ulterior motive was assigned to him to make false

statement. The name of this witness emerged on the day of occurrence

itself. The fact that the fleeing man was not named by him shows that he

had no animosity with anyone to fabricate a false story. The witness had

clear and reasonable opportunity to observe broad features of the fleeing

man as his face was seen by him from close quarters during day time. He

was transferred after 2 or 3 days of the occurrence and nothing has

 emerged if he remained in contact with the police thereafter to see the

culprit at the time of his production in the Court. In the absence of any

material inconsistency, I find his testimony in consonance with the

testimonies of PW - SI Om Prakash and PW-Jai Nand. All these

witnesses unequivocally identified A-3 to be the assailant chased by them

soon after the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_66">49.          PW-33 (Ramji Lal Sharma) working as Assistant Wireman at

DDA Flats situated at No.7, Bhagwan Dass Road, deposed on similar

lines. On hearing the shouts of „pakro - pakro‟, he was among the chasers

to apprehend the culprit who disappeared after scaling Garhwal House.

PW-33 (Ramji Lal Sharma) recognized A-3 to be the culprit who was

chased by him that time. Presence of the witness being on official duty is

not under challenge. He corroborated the version given by other chasers

and also saw A-3, entering into a taxi standing nearby. He claimed that he

had seen the face of the culprit for 2 / 3 seconds. He admitted the

suggestion that "it is correct that on turning into the Bhagwan Dass Road,

I had gone up to traffic lights and stopped there." Apparently, the version

given by the witness to have chased the assailant has not been denied.

This official witness having no animosity with A-3 had no reason to

falsely implicate him. Presence of this witness emerged on the day of

 incident itself when Delhi Police recorded his statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_89">Section 161</a>

Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_67">50.          From the statements of the witnesses referred above, it stands

established that after hand-grenades were thrown inside the car of the CJI,

PW - Jai Nand and others gave a chase to the fleeing assailant. The said

assailant after discarding the „hawai‟ chappals at the spot ran to escape in

a taxi standing nearby and entered into it hurriedly. He immediately came

out of it and jumped into Garhwal House to avoid apprehension by the

chasers including PW - Jai Nand. But for this exercise, there was every

possibility of his apprehension as the gap between the two was very short.

Since the occurrence had taken place during broad day light in March, the

chasers had clear and sufficient opportunity to observe and note the broad

features of the said man. The description and identifying features of the

fleeing man were described / mentioned by the chasers in their statements

recorded soon after the incident. The assailant was subsequently,

identified as A-3 in the Court by the witnesses at the time of their

examination. Adverse inference is to be drawn against A-3 for not

participating in TIP without justifiable reasons. A-3 had fled the spot soon

after the „object‟ was thrown by him from the left window of the car.

Jamadar even had some confrontation when he enquired from him as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 46 of 201</span>
 what he was doing. A-3 did not give plausible explanation as to what had

led him to be present there to throw the „object‟ inside the car. A-3 was

unable to explain as to why he was running away from that place. No

suggestion was put in the cross-examination to any witness that on the

relevant date and time, A-3 was available / present at a different specific

place. In 313 statement, A-3 did not claim his presence at any other

particular place. He claimed that he did not return to Delhi, after he left it

in the end of 1970. However, he was conspicuously silent as to where else

his place of residence or work was thereafter. It was imperative for A-3

facing serious allegations of a murderous assault on CJI to specifically

disclose his presence on that day at a particular place of residence / job.

However, he did not reveal anything. Adverse inference under <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_90">Section

106</a> Evidence Act is to be drawn against A-3 as these facts which were

within his special knowledge were not divulged. In 313 statement, he

admitted his arrest along with Vikram on July 24, 1975, at Bhagalpur.

Again, he did not explain as to how he had come into contact with Vikram

and how they happened to be together at Bhagalpur for any specific

purpose. A-3 holding an important position as „Avadhoot‟ in the

„Organization‟, disclosed that after he left Delhi, he went to different

places including Madras and Bombay. However, he did not examine any

 witness or produce any document to show that he continued to work

regularly at a particular place till 20 March, 1975. He also did not produce

any document to show his whereabouts from March 20, 1975 to July 24,

1975 when he was arrested. This small piece of evidence showing his

presence at his place of job or residence would have exonerated him of all

the charges.

</p><p id="p_69">51.            The prosecution examined PW-5 (Charan Singh), an illiterate

licenced taxi driver plying taxi (DLT-1469 make Ambassador) at Gole

Market, Taxi Stand for the last ten years. He is the most crucial natural

witness having no affiliation with any of the parties. No ulterior motive

was attributed to him for making false statement. He had no criminal

antecedents and never appeared as a witness in any criminal case.

</p><p id="p_70">52.            In his Court statement, he gave detailed account of the

occurrence that took place on 20.03.1975. He elaborated that on that day

at about 02.00 P.M. at Gole market, Taxi Stand, an old man (identified as

Tilak Raj Bhatia - PW-4) hired the taxi for sight-seeing and took him to

his companions standing at a distance of 20 / 25 yards (identified as A-1,

A-3 and PW-Vikram). They occupied the rear seat and Tilak Raj Bhatia

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 48 of 201</span>
 sat next to him in the front seat. The taxi was first taken to Budha Jayanti

Park where all of them went inside it to return after 15 / 20 minutes.

Thereafter, it was taken to India Gate via Shanker Road and Rail Bhawan.

There, they all consumed ice cream from an ice-cream vendor. All the

passengers except Tilak Raj Bhatia went to Amar Jawan Jyoti. After

returning to the taxi, A-1 ordered to take the taxi to Children‟s Park.

Again, they all except Tilak Raj Bhatia went inside Children‟s Park and

returned after 15 or 20 minutes. A-1 thereafter, asked him to hurry up to

Bhagwan Dass Road as they had to meet someone there or else would

miss him. He drove to Bhagwan Dass Road by the side of Patiala House

Court via Tilak Marg and stopped the taxi at the left hand side of

Bhagwan Dass Road near an electric pole. All the three passengers in the

rear seat got out of the taxi, asking Tilak Raj Bhatia to wait in the taxi.

After about ten minutes, he heard the voice of „pakro - pakro‟ from the

side of Tilak Marg. A man (identified A-3) came running from that side

wanted to enter into the taxi from left hand side rear door but he was not

allowed to do so as it was not available for hire. A-3, wore a blue shirt,

Badami colour pants and was barefoot. He went into Garhwal House after

scaling its closed gate. 5 or 7 persons chased him shouting „pakro - pakro‟

and two of them crossed the gate of the Garhwal House in his pursuit. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 49 of 201</span>
 further deposed that A-1 returned to the taxi after 2 or 3 minutes of A-3‟s

entry in the Garhwal House and asked him to drive him to Connaught

Circus. Since he had some doubts, he refused to go and got his fare `

18.50/- as per meter reading. Thereafter, A-1 and Tilak Raj Bhatia went

away in the direction of Supreme Court and he drove the taxi to

Connaught Place. PW-Charan Singh further elaborated that A-1 had

carried a black colour bag in his hand inside the taxi; he took it with him

while going inside Budha Jayanti park and Children‟s Park. At Bhagwan

Dass Road, when the passengers sitting in the left rear seat (A-1, A-3 and

Vikram) went out, they left behind the black bag in the taxi. PW-Charan

Singh identified A-1 in the Court adding that he had no beard, long hair

and moustaches that time. After recognising A-3 in the Court, he recalled

that he had occupied middle rear seat and had disappeared in Garhwal

House. He identified Vikram, the approver, to be their third companion.

</p><p id="p_71">53.          He further deposed that in the 7th month of the year 1975, the

police along with Tilak Raj Bhatia approached him at Gole Market, Taxi

Stand. He recognised him (PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia) and thereafter, he was

taken to R.K.Puram. He and Tilak Raj Bhatia went to Central Jail Tihar

for participation in identification parade which did not take place. After 10

/ 12 days, he was called at R.K.Puram where Vikram and A-3 were shown
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 50 of 201</span>
 to him. His taxi in question was seized which he got released on

„superdari‟.
</p>
<p id="p_72">               In the cross-examination, he explained that after purchase of

the taxi from Naldev Singh, he was plying it for the last four years and his

badge number was 15262. He was in prescribed khaki uniform that day.

He described the details of the route taken to finally reach Bhagwan Dass

Road. He informed that the three individuals were visible to him for a

distance of 5 / 7 yards at Bhagwan Dass Road till they separated from

each other. About Vikram, he informed that he did not see him crossing

into the Garhwal House. Vikram did not return to the taxi. He denied the

suggestion that he had demanded money from the accused persons to pay

off ` 8,000/- debt to Gurdial Singh and on their refusal, the false

statement was given. He claimed that he did not owe money to anyone.

He disclosed that A-1 was wearing canvas shoes, whereas Vikram and

Tilak Raj Bhatia were in black leather shoes and boots respectively. He

stated that Tilak Raj Bhatia did not ask the three passengers as to whom

they wanted to meet and why they were in a hurry. He admitted that he

did not catch hold of A-3 to prevent him from entering the taxi. He came

to know about the incident the following day. On return to the taxi stand,

he did not talk to any of his friends or colleagues as to what had happened.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 51 of 201</span>
 He denied the suggestion that he was taken into custody and was beaten

by the police at R.K.Puram.
</p>
<p id="p_73">54.          I have critically examined the evidence tendered by this

witness. His version appears to be natural and probable. The appellants

could not elicit any material discrepancies or contradictions in the cross-

examination to disbelieve the version narrated by him minutely; his

deposition on material facts remained unchallenged and unrebutted.

Barring minor omissions in his earlier statements (Ex.D-9 and Ex.D-10),

there were no noticeable improvements or deviations. No oblique motive

was assigned to this illiterate and rustic witness to implicate the

appellants. He had neither any grudge to grind against the appellants nor

anything has been suggested to him. He was not acquainted with them. He

had witnessed the sequence of events while performing his duty as taxi

driver and had taken the passengers from one destination to other on

payment of fare. He identified A-1 and A-3 besides approver Vikram and

PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) in the Court to be the passengers who had

travelled in the taxi on that day and had ultimately left them at Bhagwan

Dass Road near the place of incident. He had visited Tihar jail to

participate in TIP which the assailants declined to join. PW-5 gave vivid

and detailed account as to how the passengers had visited various places
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 52 of 201</span>
 before arriving at the spot. The accused persons did not deny their

presence in the taxi that day. They did not offer reasonable explanation of

their visit to various places prior to arriving at the crime scene; did not

give any justification for abandoning their idea to go for sight-seeing.

Apparently, the assailants before arriving at the destination had taken the

taxi here and there to squander the time. His omission to report the

incident to the police at the first instance does not dilute or dent his

testimony. Moreover, he was not sure as to what really had happened or if

the passengers in the taxi were the real assailants. Being unacquainted

with the appellants, there was least possibility of this witness to lodge

report with the police. His statement inspires complete confidence as he

had no attachment / connection with the „Organisation‟ to which the

assailants belonged. His entire version is in consonance with the

testimony of PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia and that of approver- Vikram. CBI was

not aware of him and reached to him when PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) took

them to Gole Market, Taxi Stand where he was expected to be present

with taxi. To lend credence to his testimony certain suggestions put to him

in the cross-examination are worth-noting. "It is correct that when they

hired my taxi, the meter showed the minimum charges at ` 1.60; I deny

the suggestion that I could not recognise Sudevanand (A-3) and that I
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 53 of 201</span>
 refused to let him enter the taxi thinking that the same had been hired by

other passengers; I deny the suggestion that a police man came to me and

arrested me and thereafter he asked me that I would not be released unless

I told the whole thing to him." There exist no ground to eschew his

evidence especially when the Trial Court found his evidence trustworthy

and relied upon it. He candidly stated all that he had seen. The tenor of his

evidence is such that it is not possible to say that he has falsely implicated

the accused. His evidence has a ring of truth. When he suspected

something amiss, he refused to carry the passengers further.

             day of incident - identity of A-1 &amp; A-3

</p><p id="p_75">55.          Star witness examined by the prosecution is PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia). Undisputedly, he was ardent follower of the „Organisation‟ since

1966 having complete faith in it. However, in 1973, he drifted from the

said „Organisation‟ due to self-immolation by some followers to secure

release of Anand Murti @ Baba. Notwithstanding that, he continued to

maintain previous contacts and connections with his fellows and stood

surety for Gunadhishanand and other after the self-immolation episode.

He and A-1 were known to each other since 1969 and gradually the

familiarity grew. A-1, an accused in the self-immolation case was wanted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 54 of 201</span>
 by police. It is not clear whether he was Proclaimed Offender. However,

PW-84 (R.L.Bhagat, Advocate) who represented State as Addl. Public

Prosecutor in case titled „<a href="/doc/1485845/" id="a_91">State vs. Acharya Puriyanand and Others</a>‟ was

certain that A-1 was a Proclaimed Offender. PW-4 deposed that A-1

established connection with him in June or July, 1974 when he (A-1)

came at his shop at Punchkuin Road and took him to Pusa Institute where

he was introduced to PW- Shiv Raj Singh in a park. A-1 visited him again

next day at his shop and took him to the hostel where Shiv Raj Singh

stayed. A-1 requested him to arrange / procure arms and ammunitions and

to remain in contact with Shiv Raj Singh. A-1 again met him in January,

1975 at his shop and enquired about delay in procuring the arms.

</p><p id="p_76">56.          In Court statement, PW-4 corroborated the version given by

PW-5 (Charan Singh), taxi driver, on all relevant and material facts. He

deposed that on 20.03.1975, A-1 came at his shop at about 02.00 P.M. and

took him to Rama Krishna Marg near Punchkuin Road on the pretext to

have something urgent to talk. A-1 introduced him with his two

companions, one of whom (Vikram) was already known to him. The other

(A-3) had purportedly come from Bihar for sight-seeing. On A-1‟s

request, he hired a taxi of a Sardarji from Gole Market, Taxi Stand. He

further deposed that they all i.e. A-1, A-3 and Vikram took seats in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 55 of 201</span>
 rear seat of the car and he sat next to the taxi driver in the front seat.

Thereafter, the taxi was taken to Budha Jayanti Park where they all four

went inside the park with the bag. After return to the taxi within 15 or 20

minutes, they went to India Gate and ate ice creams from an ice-cream

vendor for which payment was made by A-1. Leaving him and the taxi

driver, the trio went to Amar Jawan Jyoti; returned after 10 minutes;

occupied their original seats in the taxi and proceeded to Children‟s Park.

On return after 10 or 15 minutes, they appeared to be in a hurry. A-1

commanded the taxi driver to hurry up to Bhagwan Dass Road as he had

to meet someone there or else they would miss him. The taxi drove to

Bhagwan Dass Road via Stadium and Tilak Marg and the driver stopped it

at Bhagwan Dass Road near an electric pole by the side of DDA flats

facing Connaught Circus at about 04.00 P.M. A-1, A-3 and Vikram got

out the taxi and went away towards Supreme Court telling them to wait.

After a little while, the driver and he came out of the taxi. Vikram stopped

at the corner of DDA flats at the crossing; A-1 stood at the opposite corner

of the crossing of Bhagwan Dass Road and Tilak Marg and A-3 stopped at

the traffic lights towards Supreme Court. The witness further disclosed

that after 5 or 7 minutes, noise of „Pakro-Pakro, Bhag Gaya - Bhag Gaya‟

attracted his attention and he saw an individual (identified as A-3) running
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 56 of 201</span>
 bare foot; entering the taxi by opening the door. Since the taxi did not

start, A-3 immediately exited and ran towards Garhwal House. A

Constable came running from the side of DDA flats, attempted to

intercept but he eluded him and scaled the closed gate of Garhwal House

and went inside it. 4 or 5 other chasers were unsuccessful to catch hold of

him. He and the taxi driver were in a fix as to what had happened. Soon,

A-1 came from Supreme Court side and commanded the driver to take the

taxi to Connaught Circus. On getting suspicious, the driver declined and

got his fare ` 18/-. A-1 took his black bag from the taxi and they both

proceeded towards Tilak Bridge. When he enquired from A-1 about his

two companions, he advised him to keep quiet. After A-1 parted company

at the juncture of Sikandra road and Tilak Marg, he came to his shop by a

bus and did not see A-1‟s companions thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_77">57.          In the cross-examination, he reiterated the version stated in

examination-in-chief and did not deviate on material aspects. Despite

searching and detailed cross-examination, nothing cogent and material

could be extracted to shatter his testimony or to disbelieve him. No

ulterior motive was assigned to this witness implicating the accused

persons with whom he had strong bonds being followers of the same

„Organisation‟. He admitted that he did not report the police about the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 57 of 201</span>
 incident after reading about it in the newspaper on 21.03.1975. He

explained that he did not do so due to fear and was apprehensive of

elimination like other defectors. He denied the suggestion that he was

threatened by the police to give the evidence as desired or else he would

be arrayed as an accused. He had no acquaintance with the taxi driver

before and denied that he was connected with him since partition days. He

explained that CBI officials met him after the occurrence in July, 1975 at

his shop and enquired if he knew A-1. Thereafter, at Gole Market, Taxi

Stand, he identified PW-5 (Charan Singh) whose taxi was hired that day.

In para No.31 of the cross-examination, the witness gave graphic detail of

the route taken by them from Gole Market from where the taxi started and

finally halted at Bhagwan Dass Road. In the cross-examination (on behalf

of the A-3), the witness disclosed that he had participated in Satyagraha at

Delhi after the case of self-immolation at Delhi to secure the release of

Baba. Suggestion was put that he knew very well that A-1 was a fugitive

from justice and that he went along with him at that time because he

wanted to help him. He came to know about A-1‟s arrest in July 1975. He

denied the suggestion that the code word "Foreign radio" was suggested

by him. He denied that he had taken all the three persons along with him

right up to the taxi stand. In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 58 of 201</span>
 disclosed that he had pointed out towards a taxi driver at the taxi stand

when he came out of the taxi after 30 or 40 minutes of their reaching. He

denied the suggestion that in his statement recorded earlier he had not

given the number of taxi as it could result in its seizure. He admitted that

in his statement (Ex.D7) from portion „B‟ to „B‟, he did not mention that

A-3 had opened the door of his taxi, got into it and then came out. He

explained that actually that was what had happened. He admitted that he

did not see the „chappals‟ at Tilak Marg.
</p>
<p id="p_78">58.          I have scanned the testimony of this crucial witness. The

defence has not made any dent in his evidence by cross-examining him.

Certain omissions / improvements in his earlier statements recorded

before the CBI / Court were not enough to discredit his testimony in its

entirety. Various suggestions put to him in the cross-examination lend

credence to the prosecution case about the presence of this witness in the

taxi in question. PW-4 had arranged the taxi in question from a Taxi Stand

at Gole Market near his place of work and had accompanied the appellants

without nurturing any suspicion as it was pretended that A-3 who had

come from Patna would like to go for sight-seeing in the taxi. Since the

taxi was taken at different locations i.e. India Gate, Children‟s Park,

Buddha Park before arriving at the place of occurrence, this witness had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 59 of 201</span>
 no reasons to doubt or suspect the bonafide of A-1 with whom he was

associated since long and did not nurture any grudge. Apparently, he was

not aware of the plan to be executed by A-1, A-3 and approver Vikram

that day. He was very much used by A-1 without letting him know of his

exact plan. His testimony is in consonance with PW-5 (Charan Singh).

PW-4 and PW-5 corroborate the version given by approver Vikram

regarding the incident that took place on March 20, 1975. Assertions on

relevant facts have remained unchallenged and uncontroverted in the

cross-examination. PW-4 even did not lodge any complaint with the

police about the incident apparently to save the culprits. Only when the

police reached to him after A-1‟s disclosures, he divulged the sequences

of the events that occurred on March 20, 1975. PW-4‟s statement

describes the occurrence in its proper course. I do not find it appropriate to

discard his statement as not inspiring confidence. The statements of the

witness must be appreciated in proper perspective.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 60 of 201</span>
 57 (Raj Singh), soon after the incident. PW-55 deposed that on March 20,

1975 at about 09.00 P.M. at A-1‟s instance, he called PW-Ranbir Singh in

his room. A-1 gave them a „draft‟ written in Hindi to prepare its copies.

He further testified that on reading the draft, they found that it contained

matter about the hand-grenades thrown at CJI earlier that evening.

Thereupon, at their enquiry, A-1 told them "he (A-1) and his companion

had thrown bombs at the Chief Justice and that the said bombs had not

exploded". He also stated in the context that "it was the Baba‟s iccha that

Sh.Ray may live longer for some time so that he could mend his ways."

</p><p id="p_81">             PW-44 also deposed on similar lines and corroborated the

version of PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) without deviation. He deposed that A-

1 during his frequent visits to Shiv Raj Singh in PG hostel after 1972 used

to call him in his room in the hostel. On March 20, 1975 at about 08.30 or

09.00 P.M. A-1 called him through Shiv Raj Singh in his room; gave them

a Hindi draft to make number of copies. When they read the draft and

found that there was mention of throwing of hand-grenades on the car of

CJI, Shiv Raj Singh asked A-1 as to what all that was about. A-1 made the

above referred confession. PW-Ranbir was fair enough to admit in the

cross-examination that A-1 had not given the names of his companions

and they on their own, did not enquire about their number and other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 61 of 201</span>
 details from him. The reason for this was that they were afraid of A-1 and

wanted to cut the matter short; they were not interested in knowing the

number of his companions and their names. He further admitted that he

did not tell any of these things to his wife or the police.

</p><p id="p_82">60.          PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) further deposed that second

extrajudicial confession was made by A-1 when he visited him on March

24, 1975 at about 09.00 or 10.00 A.M. He told him that they had

succeeded in achieving the object of writing those copies etc. because the

same had been published in the papers. He boasted saying, "See, we had

done the L.N.Mishra kand and I and my companions had thrown hand-

grenades into the car of Chief Justice of India. So long as the Baba‟s

icchha was with us, none of us can be discovered and arrested". There is

no cross-examination on this aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_83">61.          Another confessional statement about the crime was made to

PW-57 (Raj Singh) with whom A-1 had close association since the time

he joined the „Organisation‟ in 1967. A-1 was frequent visitor to his

house. On 19th March 1975, he, A-3 and Vikram had stayed at his

residence. After the occurrence on March 20, 1975, A-3 came to his house

at about 05.45 P.M. in a nervous state of mind. As per Raj Singh‟s

testimony, he was perplexed. A-1 also arrived there at about 06.30 P.M.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 62 of 201</span>
 PW- Raj Singh recalled that both A-1 and A-3 embraced, kissed and

congratulated each other. They left his house advising him to remove all

literature concerning the „Organisation‟. PW-Raj Singh further deposed

that on March 21, 1975 morning when he was reading „The Nav-Bharat

Times‟ carrying news of unsuccessful attempt on the life of CJI, A-1

arrived there. He confronted A-1 with the news and enquired if it was

their handiwork. On that, A-1 nodded in affirmation. The exact words

uttered were :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">          "I put the news item to him and inquired if that was their
          handiwork. He nodded I expostulated asking what sin had
          been committed by poor Shri Ray that they had tried to
          kill him. Santoshanand replied that perhaps I did not
          know that Shri A.N.Ray is a Mahapapi and that he had
          rejected several applications of the Baba in the Supreme
          Court and that he is a stooge of the Government. It was
          the grace of the Baba that this Badmas had escaped death
          from the two hand grenades which they had thrown on
          him. It was the Lila of the Baba that Shri Ray had
          survived in spite of the fact that they had thrown two
          hand grenades on him, whereas Shri L.N.Misra had died
          although they had thrown only one hand grenade on him
          and he had received comparatively minor injuries.
          Behold the Lila of the Baba that the one whom he wishes
          to die dies and the one whom he does not wish to die
          survives in spite of two hand grenades thrown on him. By
          the grace of the Baba, they had escaped scot free from
          both the occurrences."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">62.          In the cross examination, A-1 did not put any suggestion

denying the above confession. PW-57 (Shiv Raj Singh) recalled that when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 63 of 201</span>
 he requested A-1 to leave him alone as he was a government servant, he

(A-1) got enraged and threatened that if he disclosed any such thing, he

would meet the same fate as had been felled L.N.Misra.

</p><p id="p_85">             Extra judicial confessions described above before PW-Shiv

Raj Singh, PW-Ranbir Singh and PW-Raj Singh on various dates have

remained un-challenged and un-assailed in the cross-examination and

were never retracted. There was nothing unusual for A-1 to make extra

judicial confessions to these persons as they were not strangers to him and

he had reposed complete confidence in them. A-1 was in close association

with them since long and had taken their assistance for the execution of

his plan about which they were not aware. A-1 had requested PW-55

(Shiv Raj Singh) to provide accommodation in the hostel in the assumed

name. PW-44 (Ranbir Singh) was even requested to procue arms to get

Baba released through violent means. A-1 had approached them after the

occurrence to prepare copies of draft. It was reasonable and natural

spontaneous reaction of the PW-55 and PW-44 to enquire on reading

contents of the draft as to how the incident had taken place. A-1 cunningly

did not divulge the names of his companions who were associated with

him in throwing of the bombs. A-1 and his associates took shelter at the

residence of PW-Raj Singh on the night intervening 19/20.03.1975. A-1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 64 of 201</span>
 handed over certain letters to PW- Raj Singh to post at GPO. These

witnesses came to know about A-1‟s involvement about throwing of the

hand-grenades on CJI‟s car only when extra judicial confessions were

made by him. These witnesses did not nurture any grievance against A-1

prior to the incident and had assisted him at various stages as per his

request without having inkling of his nefaroius plan. They had no

extraneous reasons to make false statements.
</p>
<p id="p_86">63.          In the instant case, the extra judicial confessions made by A-

1 are free from any suspicion as to their voluntary character and have also

a ring of truth in it. There is nothing improbable in A-1‟s making extra

judicial confessions to these independent witnesses. The witnesses have

reproduced the exact words used by A-1 as nearly as possible to convey

that A-1 and his companions were the perpetrators of the crime. These

extra judicial confessions can be relied upon along with other evidence for

conviction and are incriminating circumstances against A-1.

</p><p id="p_87">             The Court is not oblivious of the fact that evidence about

extra judicial confession in the very nature of things is a weak piece of

evidence. But in a case where the evidence of extra judicial confession on

scrutiny is found to be free from legal infirmity and the Court believes the

witnesses before whom the confession is made and is satisfied that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 65 of 201</span>
 confession was voluntarily, then in such a case conviction can be based on

such evidence. The law does not require that the evidence of extra judicial

confession should in all cases be corroborated. In „<a href="/doc/1381651/" id="a_92">State of U.P. vs.

M.K.Anthony</a>‟, AIR 1985 SC 48, the Supreme Court observed :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">          "15. There is neither any rule of law nor of prudence
          that evidence furnished by extra-judicial confession
          cannot be relied upon unless corroborated by some
          other credible evidence. The courts have considered
          the evidence of extra-judicial confession a weak piece
          of evidence. <a href="/doc/861564/" id="a_93">See Jagta v. State of Haryana</a> :
          1974CriLJ1010 and <a href="/doc/1995008/" id="a_94">State of Punjab v. Bhajan Singh</a>
          and Ors. : 1975CriLJ282 <a href="/doc/1643745/" id="a_95">In Sahoo v. State of U.P</a>. :
          1966CriLJ68 , it was held that 'an extra-judicial
          confession may be an expression of conflict of emotion,
          a conscious effort to stifle the pricked conscience; an
          argument to find excuse or justification for his act; or
          a penitent or remorseful act of exaggeration of his part
          in the crime.' Before evidence in this behalf is
          accepted, it must be established by cogent evidence
          what were the exact words used by the accused. The
          Court proceeded to state that even if so much was
          established, prudence and justice demand that such
          evidence cannot be made the sole ground of conviction.
          It may be used only as a corroborative piece of
          evidence. In that case, the evidence was that after the
          commission of murder the accused was heard
          muttering to himself that he has finished the deceased.
          The High Court did not interfere with the conviction
          observing that the evidence of extra-judicial confession
          is corroborated by circumstantial evidence. However,
          in <a href="/doc/1412932/" id="a_96">Pyara Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (1978) 1 SCR 661,
          this Court observed that the law does not require that
          evidence of an extra-judicial confession should in all
          cases be corroborated. It thus appears that extra-
          judicial confession appears to have been treated as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 66 of 201</span>
           weak piece of evidence but there is no rule of law nor
          rule of prudence that it cannot be acted upon unless
          corroborated. If the evidence about extra-judicial
          confession comes from the mouth of witness/witnesses
          who appear to be unbiased, not even remotely inimical
          to the accused, and in respect of whom nothing is
          brought out which may tend to indicate that he may
          have a motive for attributing an untruthful statement to
          the accused; the words spoken to by the witness are
          clear, unambiguous and unmistakably convey that the
          accused is the perpetrator of the crime and nothing is
          omitted by the witness which may militate against it,
          then after subjecting the evidence of the witness to a
          rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, if it
          passes the test, the extra-judicial confession can be
          accepted and can be the basis of a conviction. In such
          a situation to go in search of corroboration itself tends
          to cast a shadow of doubt over the evidence. If the
          evidence of extra-judicial confession is reliable, trust-
          worthy and beyond reproach the same can be relied
          upon and a conviction can be founded thereon."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_88">64.          Considering the consistency and the coherence of the

statements of the independent witnesses bearing on the confessions of the

accused, the Court is satisfied that their evidence to the said effect is

untainted and true. The confessions made by A-1 voluntarily in the normal

course without any pressure, are direct acknowledgment of the guilt of the

offence in question. The confessions contain a probable catalogue of

events and there is nothing improbable or unbelievable in it. These appear

to be spontaneous account studded with such vivid details about

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 67 of 201</span>
 background and the manner of committing of crime in question which

only perpetrator of crime could know. Moreover, the confessions fit in

well with the rest of the evidence and other facts and surrounding

circumstances discussed in this judgment. The evidence relating to these

extra-judicial confessions is found credible after being tested on the touch

stone of credibility and acceptability. These can solely form the basis of

conviction qua A-1.

             intervening 19/20.03.1975 - PW-Vikram, A-1 and A-3.

</p><p id="p_90">65.          PW-57 (Raj Singh), Post-graduate of 1956, resident of

Mehrauli, a government servant with Municipal Corporation of Delhi as

School Inspector (Physical Education) was also follower of the

„Organisation‟ since 1967 and used to participate in its various activities.

He was acquainted with A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram who used to visit and

stay occasionally at his residence while going to perform „Kapalik

Sadhana‟ near his residence. He deposed that in April, 1974, A-1 came to

his newly built house at about 10.00 P.M. At first instance, he had a little

difficulty to recognize him as he had removed his beard and cut his hair

short. A-1 spent the night with him and visited him twice or thrice

thereafter. He disclosed that A-1 used to feel sad / sentimental due to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 68 of 201</span>
 imprisonment of Baba. Elaborating his visit along with A-3 and PW-

Vikram on March 19, 1975 at around 07.30 or 08.00 P.M., he deposed

that A-3 and PW-Vikram with whom he was familiar before had secret

conversation on the terrace for about half an hour. A-1 informed him that

it was not possible to secure Baba‟s release through constitutional means

and no other course was left except to shake the Government for release

of Baba even at the cost of his own life. He further deposed that on March

20, 1975 at around 05.00 A.M., A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram got up and after

taking bath and break fast, they left the house at around 08.00 or 08.30

A.M., carrying a black bag with them. At about 05.30 P.M. when he

returned from his office, A-3 came in a distracted mood and was very

much nervous and perplexed. A-1 also arrived there at about 06.30 P.M.

Vikram did not come to him that night. The assertion of the witness about

stay of A-1 and A-3 along with Vikram on the night intervening

19/20.03.1975 at his residence remained unchallenged in the cross-

examination. No reasons were suggested by A-1 and A-3 for their stay at

PW-57‟s residence on the said night. It confirms their presence in Delhi

soon before the occurrence. In the absence of any infirmity, this Court has

no reasons to discard the version given by this witness who had no

 animosity with the appellants. The testimony of this witness is in tune

with that of PW-Vikram - approver.

<p id="p_91">(g)   Stay at Hostel in PG Guest House - A-1 &amp; A-3's involvement

</p><p id="p_92">66.          Specific case of CBI was that at A-1‟s instance, PW-55 (Shiv

Raj Singh) had reserved a room for two days in PG Guest House of the

Pusa Institute in the fictitious name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟

and that entry (Ex.PW-122/A) in PG Guest House register (Ex.P-122) was

made in this regard. While appearing as PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) a Ph.D.

student at the institute in 1975 gave narration as to how he came into

contact with A-1 through Sh. Kanwaldhari in 1972. A-1 was editor of the

„Prout‟ published from D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and was

an „Awadhoot‟ wearing saffron clothes and supporting a beard and long

hair. He was regular visitor to Pusa Institute. He further deposed that he

acceded to A-1‟s request to let him stay in the hostel during his visits to

Delhi. On March 18 or 19, 1975 at A-1‟s request, he made reservation of a

room in the hostel for some Anand Margies who were expected to arrive

in the name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟. Entry (Ex.PW-122/A) at

page 32 in the name of „Pawan Kumar‟ made on March 20, 1975 was in

his handwriting and contained his signatures at portion mark Q5A in

register (Ex.P-122). He further deposed that A-1 and A-3 had stayed in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 70 of 201</span>
 room reserved by him. The key of the room was collected by A-1 in the

evening of March 20, 1975 at around 05.30 P.M. A-1 and A-3 met him on

March 25 at about 06.00 A.M. after they had delivered the key of the

room to the chowkidar. In the cross-examination, he elaborated that he

had put his signatures on Ex.PW-122/A at Q5A in the morning of March

20, 1975, at the time of making reservation and payment of advance of

`2/-. He denied the suggestion that receipt for payment was issued to him

on March 22, 1975. He was fair enough to say that he did not personally

visit the room reserved by him. He denied the suggestion that the „guest‟

for whom the room was reserved had left it on March 22, at 05.00 P.M.

The appellants did not suggest the name of any such „guest‟ and purpose

of his visit. PW-55 was unaware as to who had made the rest of the entry

in Ex.PW-122/A. In further cross-examination, he informed that on

inquiry from A-1 as to who else was staying with him in the room on

March 20, 1975 at about 12‟o clock in the night A-1 named A-3. He

reasoned to provide accommodation to A-1 being fellow Anand Margi.

He was unaware if accommodation was used for A-3‟s stay also.

</p><p id="p_93">67.          On examination of the ocular testimony of this independent

public witness who was well acquainted with A-1 being fellow Anand

Margi, it is clear that he had no extraneous consideration to make a false
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 71 of 201</span>
 statement regarding reservation of accommodation in PG Hostel for his

stay in the name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟ as instructed by him.

The documentary evidence confirms his assertion. Register (Ex.P-122)

containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A) at Sl.No. 432 was seized after a

considerable period in July, 1975 by CBI. It contained number of various

entries with detailed particulars up to entries recorded at serial number

1028. Also receipt book (Ex.D-40) containing receipt at serial number

2584 in the name of „Pawan Kumar‟ pertaining to reservation of room

number 227 for ` 2/- was seized in July, 1975. It contained various entries

subsequent to it till entry 2600. Apparently, there was least possibility of

forging or fabricating these documents / entries maintained in the ordinary

course of business by an independent agency. The appellants examined

DW-1 (Ram Chander), a caretaker in PG Hostel from Pusa Institute in

defence. However, on the relevant date, he was on leave and had resumed

duties after the expiry of leave on March 24, 1975. Needless to say that

the entries, after his joining, were in his handwriting. The genuineness and

correctness of both register (Ex.P-122) containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A)

and receipt (Ex.D-40) were not questioned. Various doubts raised by

appellants‟ counsel during trial were out-rightly rejected in paras 184 to

189 with sound reasons in the impugned judgment. The appellants did not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 72 of 201</span>
 summon the relevant witness who had officiated in the absence of regular

caretaker on the relevant date. Para 189 records that Badrinarayan, the

Assistant Caretaker to whom Shiv Raj Singh had made the payment on

March 20, 1975 was summoned as a defence witness but he was not

examined despite his appearance in the Court on August 02, 1976. No

reasonable explanation has been offered for not examining the Assistant

Caretaker whose signatures finds mention on the receipt (Ex.D-40). There

is no substance in the appellants‟ plea that PW-55 cannot be trusted as the

form which was required to be filled for reservation was not produced

before the Court. Nothing has come on record if any form was filled up by

PW-55 at the time of getting the room reserved. DW-1 (Ram Chander)

informed that earlier a form was required to be filled by the concerned

student. Before January 1975, no such register as Ex.P-122 was being

maintained. The only record maintained at that time in the shape of forms.

After January 1975, the register as well as the form represented the record

for such reservation. It appears that PW-55 made entries in the register

(Ex.P-122) directly without filling the form. No such question was asked

from this witness if he had filled up any such „form‟. The necessity to fill

up the form was for the reason to incorporate the particulars subsequently

in the register (Ex.P-122). Since the witness had made entries directly in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 73 of 201</span>
 the register (Ex.P-122), there was no need to fill up the form particularly

when the concerned caretaker was not available. DW-1 (Ram Chander)

has admitted that whenever the form was not available, entries could be

made directly in the register. In his evidence, he disclosed that the form

relating to entry (Ex.PW-122/A) was delivered by him to Kuldeep Singh,

Sr.Technical Assistant, PG Hostel. However, no such form was seized by

the Investigating Officer Mr.Puri and he was not questioned in that regard.

Moreover, the appellants did not summon Kuldeep Singh to substantiate if

any such form was delivered to him. In fact, a specific suggestion was put

in the cross-examination that the witness had reserved the accommodation

for the „guest‟ who had left the hostel on March 22, 1975 in the evening.

This lends credence to the assertion of the witness about reservation of the

accommodation by making relevant entry in the register (Ex.P-122). The

prosecution has established beyond doubt that the accommodation was

reserved by PW-55 at the instance of A-1, and A-1 and A-3 stayed in the

said accommodation as the key of it was taken by A-1 from this witness in

the evening on March 20. It further establishes presence of A-1 and A-3 in

Delhi on these dates. No specific suggestion was put that A-1 had not

stayed in the accommodation reserved by this witness. It was within the

special knowledge of A-1 and A-3 as to why and for what purpose they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 74 of 201</span>
 had stayed in the said accommodation in the name of non-existant person

„Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟ or during which period to which period

they stayed in the said accommodation and where else they went after

vacating it. All these facts have not been divulged by A-1 or A-3.

Reservation of accommodation in the assumed name for stay during the

relevant period and complete denial about it is an incriminating

circumstance showing their unreasonable conduct during crucial period

</p><p id="p_95">68.          Another circumstance which prominently sheds light on the

involvement of A-3 relates to the discovery of factum of purchase of new

pair of „hawai‟ chappals by him soon after the incident as well as

identification of the shop from where the chappals were purchased.

</p><p id="p_96">69.          As in any crime, criminals leave some foot prints, chappals

(Ex.A1 &amp; Ex.A2) whose photographs (Ex.PW-107 to Ex.PW-119) taken

by police photographer - Khayali Ram (PW-47) discarded by the assailant

were seized at the spot by PW-Inp.Sajjan Singh soon after the incident by

a seizure memo (Ex.P-17). During investigation, these chappals were

found to be that of A-3. PW-1 (Vikram) deposed that these were the same

„hawai‟ chappals which were discarded by A-3 while fleeing the spot on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 75 of 201</span>
 the right side of the car. He further deposed that A-3 had worn these

chappals on the day of occurrence while leaving PW- Raj Singh‟s

residence in the morning. No suggestion was put by A-3 to disown

chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) or that he did not wear them at that time.

PW-2 (Jai Chand), an independent witness, having no animus, identified

A-3 to be the assailant who discarded the chappals on the right hand side

of the car at some distance and which were seized after preparing sketches

Ex.P18 and Ex.P19 bearing his signatures. PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)‟s

statement that A-3 was wearing blue shirt, biscuit colour pants and

chappals on the day of occurrence and he had seen him running bare foot

after the incident when he came to the taxi and opened the door remained

unchallenged in the cross-examination. PW-5 (Charan Singh), taxi driver,

corroborated his version and stated that he had seen A-3 running bare

foot. Similar is the testimony of PW-6 (Inder Singh) who deposed that

when he came out of the car, he saw chappals of the fleeing man lying at a

distance of 3 or 4 yards on the right hand side of the car. PW-41 (HC

Surenderpal Singh), on duty at gate „A‟ at Supreme Court on March 20,

1975 informed the Control Room and SHO PS Tilak Nagar about the

incident between 04.15 P.M. and 04.30 P.M. and disclosed about

„chappals‟ lying near the car. PW-17 (SI Inder Singh) recorded message in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 76 of 201</span>
 the prescribed form (Ex.P-45). The factum of chappals lying at the spot

finds mention in Ex.P-45. There is specific mention about it in the FIR

too. From the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that

while leaving PW-Raj Singh‟s residence for the mission on 20.03.1975,

A-3 had worn chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) and these were discarded by

him soon after the crime while fleeing bare foot from the spot apparently

to escape fastly. This Court finds that it was not suggested even remotely

to PWs that A-3 was not wearing these chappals or the same were planted

subsequently. PW-Insp. Sajjan Singh had no occasion to plant these

chappals on the day of occurrence itself as none of the appellants was a

suspect. There are no allegations against Delhi police for concocting a

false story against the appellants. PW-38 (P.S.Nayar), Senior Scientific

Officer, Incharge Finger Print Section, Central Forensic Science

Laboratory, R.K.Puram, New Delhi, received chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-

</p><p id="p_97">2) on March 22, 1975 and prepared their photographs (Ex.P90 &amp; Ex.P91)

on March 24, 1975. The Trial Court examined the chappals (Ex.A-1 and

Ex.A-2), photographs (Ex.P90 &amp; Ex.P91) and the photographic

transparencies of the footprints (Ex.P88 and Ex.P89) and was of the

opinion that these (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) were the chappals which A-3 was

wearing and had abandoned at the spot.

</p><p id="p_99"> 70.          During police custody remand on August 13, 1975. A-3 in

disclosure statement (Ex.P101) disclosed about purchase of new „hawai‟

chappals on March 20, 1975 evening from a shop in NDSC Part-I near a

bank in New Delhi. A-3 led the police team to the shop being run under

the name of M/s. Fair Deal, G-24, NDSC Part-I, New Delhi. In 313

statement, A-3 admitted about his visit to „Fair Deal‟ Shop in South

Extension. PW-42 (B.L.Kumar), UDC in the office of Superintendent

Surveyor of Work Aviation, CPWD, R.K.Puram, was associated in the

investigation and disclosure statement of A-3 (Ex.P-101) was recorded in

his presence. He deposed that after that they all including A-3 went to

South Extension and A-3 pointed out the shop from where he had

purchased the chappals; the name of said shop was „Fair Deal‟. The

pointing out memo Ex.P-102 was prepared and A-3 wrote Ex.P-102/A

there in his own hand and signatures. Cash memo book Ex.P-103 was

seized vide memo Ex.P-104. His testimony remained unchallenged in

cross-examination. Nothing was suggested if A-3 was threatened or forced

to make the disclosure statement. This official witness had no ulterior

motive to falsely implicate A-3.
</p>
<p id="p_100">             The Trial Court for valid reasons rejected the documents

(Ex.P101 and Ex.P102) being inadmissible under Section 27 of the

 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_97">Evidence Act</a>. However, it concluded that the new chappals purchased by

A-3 from the said shop coupled with other circumstances and oral

evidence was certainly a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence

against him.
</p>
<p id="p_101">71.            PW-53 (Shiv Charan), salesman, Fair Deal, South Ext. Part-I

deposed that in August 1975, A-3 was brought by CBI at his shop.

Identifying A-3, he recalled that he had come to the shop bare foot about 3

or 4 months prior to the said date and had purchased „hawai‟ chappals

from their shop at about 05.30 or 05.45 P.M. on March 20, 1975. After

seeing cash memo book (Ex.P103), cash memo (Ex.P103/A) bearing

serial number 2377 therein, he identified his signatures thereon. He

deposed that cash for sale of „chappals‟ was received by the proprietor and

the cash memo was prepared by him. He had sold „hawai‟ chappals to him

because the only item in their shop carrying a price of   ` 7.95 was the

„hawai chappals‟. Nothing was suggested to him that A-3 had not visited

the shop to purchase „hawai‟ chappals. PW-54 (Wazir Chand), partner in

M/s.Fair Deal, also supported him and deposed that the police had seized

cash memo book (Ex.P103) from their shop vide memo (Ex.P104) on

August 13, 1975. His son Vijay Kumar had put his signatures also in his

presence on that. He identified A-3 who was brought by the police at his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 79 of 201</span>
 shop in custody. He identified his signatures on Ex.P102 and Ex.P104. He

disclosed that cash memo book (Ex.P-103) was maintained in the regular

course of business. He denied the suggestion in that Ex.P102 had already

been written out by the police before arrival in the shop. Both these

witnesses had no animosity with A-3 to falsely recognize him as the

customer who had purchased new „hawai‟ chappals from their shop.

These chappals were not subject matter of the crime and were not a case

property as such.
</p>
<p id="p_102">72.          The circumstance of purchase of new chappals at about 05.30

or 05.45 P.M. from the shop at NDSC Part-I by A-3 lends credence to the

testimony of PWs-1, 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6 that soon after the occurrence, A-3 had

fled the spot bare foot after discarding chappals at the spot. CBI was not

aware of the existence of the shop in question prior to the recording of the

A-3‟s disclosure statement (Ex.P101). They were not aware if A-3 had

purchased new chappals from the shop on the day of incident. All these

facts came into their knowledge pursuant to A-3‟s disclosure statement

when he led them to the said shop where the sales man and the owner of

the shop identified him as the customer who had purchased new „hawai‟

chappals from their shop. A-3 did not controvert these facts. He did not

explain as to what had prompted him to urgently purchase new chappals
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 80 of 201</span>
 from PW-53 on March 20, 1975. He did not explain as to why he was

forced to visit the said shop bare foot. All these facts were within A-3‟s

special knowledge which he failed to explain / divulge. Under <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_98">Section

106</a> Evidence Act, an adverse inference is to be drawn against him for not

explaining them.
</p>
<p id="p_103">73.          Purchase of new chappals on March 20, 1975 after PW-1 and

other witnesses had seen him running barefoot after discarding chappals is

an incriminating circumstance to connect A-3 with the crime and to

establish his presence at the place of incident at the time of throwing of

the hand-grenades. The factum of purchase of chappals reflects the post-

event conduct of A-3 and is relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_99">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act.

</p><p id="p_104">74.          The Trial Court accepted the opinion given by PW-38

(P.S.Nayar), Senior Scientific Officer, Incharge Finger Print Section,

CFSL, R.K.Puram, New Delhi. PW-38 (P.S.Nayar) had examined

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2), their photographs (Ex.P90 and Ex.P91) and

photographic transparencies of footprints (Ex.P98 and Ex.P99), and was

of the opinion that the impressions of the five toes and the ball of the feet

on the chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) could have been formed by the feet of

A-3. He also conducted the experiment by asking A-3 to wear the

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2). He testified that as a result of the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 81 of 201</span>
 experiment, the marks made on the chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) exactly

coincided with A-3‟s five toes, the ball of his feet and the sole of feet on

both the chappals.
</p>
<p id="p_105">75.          I am in agreement with the appellants‟ contention that the

science of identification of foot print is not a fully developed science and

no reliance can be placed upon it to base conviction. However, it is also

true that the report of the expert can be taken as an additional link to

corroborate the other clinching evidence on record. In the case of

„<a href="/doc/729191/" id="a_100">Mohd.Aman, Babu Khan and Anr. vs. State of Rajasthan</a>‟ in

Crl.A.No.1749 with Crl.A.No.1833/1996 decided by the Supreme Court

on 08.05.1997, it was held :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">          "So far as the foot prints are concerned, another
          reason for which we feel it unsafe to accept the
          evidence led in this regard is that the sample foot
          prints were not taken before a Magistrate. This apart
          the science of identification of foot prints is not a fully
          developed science and therefore if in a given case -
          unlike the present one - evidence relating to the same
          is found satisfactory it may be used only to reinforce
          the conclusions as to the identity of a culprit already
          arrived at on the basis of other evidence. "</blockquote><p id="p_106">

documents (Ex.P10 to P14). The criticism against these documents are

various and varied. Attempt has been made by A-1 to disown the

documents.
</p>
<p id="p_111">77.          PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) deposed that on March 20, 1975 at

around 09.00 P.M., A-1 came and at his instance, he called PW- Ranbir

Singh to his room. Giving a draft written in Hindi, A-1 asked them to

prepare its copies. Since the draft contained objectionable material, they

showed reluctance to prepare its copies. It agitated A-1 and he extended a

threat. Thereafter, they prepared the copies in Hindi and delivered these to

A-1. On seeing their handwriting, A-1 remarked that Ranbir‟s writing was

not in order. The copies were prepared of the „draft‟ which carried the

caption "Akhal Bhartiya Sashatra Viplvi Chhater/ Yuva Singh". Ex.P10

consisted of two sheets which was in his hand and he had prepared this

copy from the manuscript prepared by A-1. The draft prepared by A-1 did

not have any date and the copies therefore, prepared by him also did not

contain any date. The witness further deposed that again, on March 21,

1975 in the evening, A-1 came and gave him a „draft‟ to prepare its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 83 of 201</span>
 copies. That was a letter addressed to Chief Justice, Sh.Ray and contained

the same caption. He prepared seven or eight copies of that letter and

delivered it to A-1. He had dated the copies as March 22, 1975 at A-1‟s

instance as he had told him that the copies would be mailed on March 22,

1975. A-1 had got written from him addresses on number of envelopes

including the one on which he had written the address of Sh.A.N.Ray,

Chief Justice of India. The other envelopes were addressed to the editors

etc., of the newspapers. Ex.P11, Ex.P12, Ex.P13, Ex.P14 and Ex.P14/A

were the envelopes which were all in his hand. The witness further

deposed that A-1 had read each and every copy prepared by him and had

made „corrections‟ in them. In Ex.P11, A-1 had made the corrections and

written the word "mend" at Q18/A. "Rule of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, it must

not subjugate its" at Q3A in Ex.P12. This line had to be added by him

because he had omitted to copy it out from the original „draft‟. Similarly,

in Ex.P13 and Ex.P14, he had made corrections and written the word

"mend" at Q4A and Q1A, respectively. The witness explained that on

March 20 when he had prepared the Hindi draft, A-1 had also made

corrections and added the words "Damit" and "Soshit" marked Q19A, and

the word "Purn" marked Q19A. A-1 again visited him on March 22,

evening. He came up with another Hindi draft and got the copies of that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 84 of 201</span>
 draft prepared from him. The draft also carried the same caption as

mentioned earlier. In the cross-examination, the witness fairly admitted

that these letters, etc. were not mailed to his knowledge. A-1 had made the

correction of a word "mend" in two or three copies only and not in all

copies. He wrote the word "mend" in the rest of the copies in his own

hand writing. He disclosed that after March 20, 1975, PW-Ranbir Singh

had met him twice and thrice and they had discussed about the preparation

of the copies of the draft and considered the risk involved in it and

decided not to do any such thing in future. He admitted that there was no

mention of A-1‟s name in the contents of the letter. The code words used

in the letter were not known to him. He denied the suggestion that Ex.P10

to Ex.P14A were his handiwork and he falsely named A-1 to save his

skin.
</p>
<p id="p_112">78.          In the cross-examination (conducted by Sh. K.L.Sharma,

Advocate), the witness stated that it was for the first time that he had

heard or read the caption "Akhil Bhartiya Shashaster Viplavi Chhatar

Yuva Sangh" on March 20, 1975. On scanning the testimony as a whole,

it transpires that A-1 did not challenge his visits to PW-55 (Shiv Raj

Singh) on March 20 and 21, 1975 to get prepare copies of the draft from

him. No suggestion was put to the witness that no such corrections in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 85 of 201</span>
 Ex.P11, Ex.P12, Ex.P13 &amp; Ex.P14 were made by him (A-1) in his own

hand writing or that these were forged or fabricated documents. PW-44

(Ranbir Singh) has corroborated PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) on all material

facts in this regard. He deposed that on being threatened by A-1, they

agreed to do his bidding and prepared three or four copies in Hindi. In the

cross-examination, he elaborated that he had enquired from A-1 as to what

he would do with the copies of the draft. A-1‟s reply to him was to carry

on with the job of copying instead of wasting time in making such

enquiries. He admitted the suggestion, "It is correct that Shiv Raj Singh

and he were busy in preparing the copies simultaneously". He admitted

that he did not read the English draft. He further deposed that A-1 had

explained at the spot that the draft would be published in the name of

"Akhil Bharatiya Sashstar Viplvi Chhatter Yuva Sangh" so that nobody

would come to know who had published it. Again, nothing material

emerged in the cross-examination to discard his version. A-1 did not deny

that the amendments in question were not made by him in his

handwriting.
</p>
<p id="p_113">79.            PW-57 (Raj Singh) supplemented the version given by PW-

54 and PW-55, and deposed that on March 22, 1975 at about 08.30 A.M.,

A-1 came to him and intended to accompany him to post certain letters at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 86 of 201</span>
 Kashmiri Gate on the way to his office. When he offered to post the letters

for him, A-1 delivered to him a packet wrapped in a piece of paper

containing postal envelopes. The witness further deposed that at GPO,

Kashmiri Gate when he opened the wrapper, he found that the very first

envelope contained the address of Sh.A.N.Ray, CJI. He was unnerved on

seeing it and could not pluck courage to see the other envelopes. He

mailed all the letters into the mail box. He identified the envelope (Ex.P-

14A) addressed to Sh.A.N.Ray. In the cross-examination, nothing material

could be extracted on this aspect and no suggestion was put that no such

envelope was handed over by A-1 to him or it was not mailed by him.

Contrary to that a suggestion was put "I deny the suggestion that I was

myself a party to the conspiracy and that I mailed the letters because that

was the job assigned to me". This suggestion clinches the issue. These

letters were subsequently, received in the offices of various newspapers.

A-1 did not offer any explanation as to for what purpose, the drafts were

prepared and dispatched to the offices of various newspapers and also to

CJI. PW-50 S.K.Gupta, PW-51 V.G.Verghese (The Hindustan Times),

PW-52 Abdul Rehman (The Indian Express) and PW-58 B.K.Joshi (The

Times of India) have confirmed this version.

He joined services of Tata but resigned in 1966 at the instance of his Guru

Anand Murti. He held various important positions in the „Organisation‟.

In 1970, he came to work as Office Secretary in Delhi in the newly

opened office of PBI at 13, Ferozshah Road. In his deposition, he claimed

that A-1 was known to him since long and they had regular visiting terms

in 1970. A-1 was working as editor of the „Prout‟ published from D-41,

South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and he used to meet him frequently at

13, Ferozshah Road and D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi. He

claimed that he was quite familiar with the handwriting of A-1 both in

Hindi and English. He identified A-1‟s handwriting on Ex.P10 (marked

Q19A); Ex.P11 (marked Q18A); document Ex.P12 (marked Q3A);

Ex.P13 (marked Q4A), Ex.P14 (marked Q1A). He further identified

document (Ex.P15) and stated that this document in its entirety was in the

handwriting of A-1. He also recognized that in Ex.P22 the writing marked

A1 to A72 were in the handwriting of A-1. In the cross-examination, he

denied that he, Vikram and Naval agreed to become witnesses in the

present case as a part of conspiracy with others including Madhvanand

and Krishnanand. No suggestion was put to the witness that A-1 had no

close association with him or that he was not familiar with his

 handwriting. No suggestion was put that the handwriting on the

questioned documents were not that of A-1. Since this witness had worked

with A-1 in Delhi in the same „Organisation‟ and was acquainted with him

since long, his testimony regarding identification of his handwriting on

the questioned documents cannot be doubted. Similar is the testimony of

PW-49 (Sudhir Kumar Basedar) who joined the „Organisation‟ in 1962

and was made an „Avadhoot‟ in 1965. He deposed that in 1968 or 1969 he

brought Vikram from Ranchi to Delhi and was in close contact with A-1

and Vikram. He was incharge of D-41, South Extension, New Delhi. A-1

was working as an editor of „Prout‟ under him. He claimed that he had

seen A-1 writing and signing and was familiar with his handwriting and

signatures. He also identified handwriting on Ex.P10 to Ex.P15 at

questioned portions to be that of A-1. He also identified exercise book

Ex.P22 and writings marked A-1 to A-72 therein both in English and

Hindi and testified that these too were in A-1‟s handwriting. In the cross-

examination, he denied          the   suggestion   that   after   leaving   the

„Organisation‟, he became a regular informer and tout of the police. A-1,

Vikram, Nitesh Kumar, Gundadhishanand, etc. used to reside at D-41,

South Extension. Bank account was also in A-1‟s name. He saw his

writings many a times and used to receive letters from A-1. No suggestion

signing umpteen times at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi when

he had been editing the papers there both in Hindi and English. The entire

contents of the document Ex.P15 were in A-1‟s handwriting. The

authored by the same person (A-1) who wrote the specimen / standard

writings. The Trial Court relied upon the opinion of the handwriting

Even if, report of handwriting expert is excluded in view of recent

Crl.A.No.804/2001 decided on 25.05.2012, it would not dilute the

conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court about A-1 to be the author of the

questioned hand-writing in view of positive and cogent evidence given by

PWs-Vikram, Ujjawal Prakash and Sudhir Kumar Basedar who were well

conversant and familiar with his handwriting. Moreover, the trial Court

itself had examined the questioned and specimen handwriting to arrive at

the said conclusion. Discretion lies with the Court to form an opinion inter

alia as to the identity of the handwriting and in so doing, it is always

permissible for the Court to compare on its own.

<p id="p_119">84.          From the testimonies of witnesses, it reveals that A-1 had

drafted the original Hindi manuscript of which he caused a copy (Ex.P10)

to be prepared by Shiv Raj Singh on March 20, 1975. He made the

corrections marked Q19A in his own handwriting that very night. On

March 21, 1975, he got prepared the copies (Ex.P11 to Ex.P14A) of an

open letter addressed to the CJI prepared from Shiv Raj Singh and made

the corrections marked Q18A, Q3A, Q4A and Q1A in those documents in

his own hand. A-1 did not offer any explanation as to why and under what

 circumstances, his handwriting appeared on these questioned documents

which contained objectionable material. He also failed to explain the

purpose of preparing these inflammatory documents soon after the

incident. These documents also confirm his presence in Delhi on these

dates. Apparently, these documents are incriminating in nature and point

an accusing finger at A-1 showing his participation in the crime.

</p><p id="p_120">85.          The prosecution examined PW-51 (B.G.Verghese), Editor of

The Hindustan Times in March, 1975 who deposed that the letter Ex.P13

received in their office was forwarded by him to Sh.N.K.Mukherjee,

Home Secretary, Govt. of India vide covering letter Ex.P80. PW-52

(Abdul Rahman), Chief Reporter, The Indian Express, in March 1975

deposed that document Ex.P10 consisting of two sheets was received in

their office on March 22, 1975. A news item (Ex.P131) was developed

and published in „The Indian Express‟ on March 24, 1975. Ex.P132 was

published in „The Times of India‟. PW-50 (S.K.Gupta), Registrar,

Supreme Court of India, in March 1975 deposed that envelope (Ex.P14/A)

was received by him from the Principal Private Secretary to Chief Justice

of India. The document (Ex.P14) was in that envelope at that time and the

envelope contained the address of CJI. The envelope along with its

contents was passed on to him either on April 01 or 02, 1975. He

 forwarded Ex.P14 with the envelope to Sh. P.N.Mehra, S.P.Security along

with other documents. Apparently, A-1 not only prepared the documents

(Ex.P10 to Ex.P14A) but also sent / mailed these to various newspapers

and to the Chief Justice of India at Supreme Court. The open letter

addressed to the Chief Justice of India was mailed after the unsuccessful

attempt on his life to intimidate him.

<p id="p_121">(j)          Performance of journey by A-1 &amp; A-3 on 25.03.1975

</p><p id="p_122">86.          After analyzing the evidence of various witnesses including

DSP B.R.Puri (PW-71), Sardari Lal (PW-21), Harbhagwan (PW-9),

Vishnu Datt Sharma (PW-10), B.R.Bakshi (PW-11), Jit Singh (PW-12),

Prem Prakash Sharma (PW-25), and the documents Ex.P-23 to Ex.P-27,

Ex.P-57, Ex.P-58, Ex.P-77, Ex.P-78 and Ex.P-127 minutely, the Trial

Court concluded that A-2 admittedly wrote Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25 and that

thereby, he made reservation of a berth in a three-tier sleeper coach in the

name of „Pankaj Kumar‟ on March 15, 1975 and of a seat in the sitting

compartment in the name of „Ramesh Kumar‟ on March 21, 1975 for

journey by 2-Down, Kalka- Howrah Mail which departed from Delhi

Main on March 25, 1975. It also relied upon the testimonies of PW-24

(Ram Prakash Babbar), PW-23 (Bhagat Ram Ahuja), PW-31 (P.S.Yadav),

PW-32 (Hari Singh) and PW-40 (Surjeet Singh Ahluwalia) to conclude
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 93 of 201</span>
 that A-2 made use of two different names and addresses (of Pankaj Kumar

and Ramesh Kumar) which were fictitious and non-existant. Under the

heading „Solution of the Riddle of Fictitious Names‟, relying on the oral

and documentary evidence, the Trial Court found that A-1 and A-3 were

the individuals who performed the actual journey on the strength of

reservation (Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25) in the said train. During arguments, A-

2 did not categorically deny and controvert the incriminating circumstance

proved against him in this regard. In his written submissions, he urged that

these tickets reserved in the fictitious names for A-1 and A-3 did not

further the alleged conspiracy which was hatched, implemented and

finished on March 20, 1975 itself. At the relevant time, A-1 was an

accused in a self-immolation case of Acharya Dhineshwaranand of which

he and his co-accused were later acquitted. A-2 being lawyer for the

followers of the „Organisation‟ at that time had defended A-1 in that case.

He further urged that from the contents of the diary (Ex.P-137) containing

an unsigned letter (Ex.P-4), seized from his house, it is apparent that A-1

did not communicate directly with him but acted through a „parokar‟. In

order to avoid arrest in the self-immolation case in which A-1 was

absconding, he (A-1) or his „parokar‟ simply wanted to obtain train tickets

on his behalf in some fictitious name for his usual travel and requested

 him (A-2) to book them. This explanation is wholly reasonable, as

reservation for train tickets did nothing whatsoever to assist or advance

the cause of conspiracy executed on March 20, 1975. Apparently, A-2 half

heartedly denied the reservation made vide Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25. The

prosecution was able to bring on record overwhelming evidence to prove

that A-1 and A-3 travelled on that day in the said train on the strength of

these tickets.
</p>
<p id="p_123">87.          Crucial testimony in this regard is that of PW-56 (Suresh

Chand Samanta) who was unacquainted with the appellants prior to the

incident and did not nurture any ill-will or grievance to falsely implicate

them. Being an Assistant Director, Tourist office, Government of India at

Calcutta, he visited Delhi to appear in an interview before UPSC on

March 24, 1975 for the post of Director of Tourism. Being a responsible

officer he was not expected to make a false declaration. He deposed that

on March 25,1975, he left Delhi for Calcutta by Kalka-Howrah Mail at

08.00 A.M. He identified A-1 unerringly to be his co-passenger in the said

train who occupied the lower berth and with whom he had conversation in

English on tourism during day time. He further disclosed that A-1 did not

have beard that time and perhaps was wearing bushirt and pants. Another

passenger Ramesh travelling in the said compartment who was going to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 95 of 201</span>
 Calcutta to see his mother had also conversed with him. He came from

Calcutta to Delhi on July 29, 1975 or so, to identify A-1 at Tihar jail. In

the cross-examination, the witness answered all the queries of the

appellants‟ counsel about his visit to Delhi. He disclosed that during

journey both, he and A-1 had taken food together; lunch was also shared

by them. He became very friendly with A-1 on the way and had given his

visiting card to him. A-1 was wearing a hearing-aid at that time. He

denied the suggestion that A-1‟s photograph was shown to him and on the

strength of that photograph, he identified him in the Court of Sh.Oberoi.

Scanning the testimony of this witness reveals that despite thorough cross-

examination, his testimony could not be shattered. The witness who had

no prior animosity with A-1 was not expected to give false statement

being a responsible officer. The prosecution was able to produce evidence

on record that this witness actually travelled in the train on that day. It is

not unusual for the passengers to become familiar with each other during

long journey and develop some intimacy. Since the witness had spent long

time with A-1 during the journey and had direct conversation with him, he

had sufficient, reasonable and fair opportunity to note and observe the

broad features to recognize him at a subsequent date. CBI was able to

reach to this witness after scanning the reservation chart prepared for that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                   Page 96 of 201</span>
 day. This witness not only identified A-1 but also willingly agreed to

participate in the TIP which the appellant declined to join. In his Court

statement, this witness had no hesitation to recognize and identify A-1.

There are no valid reasons to discard the cogent, reliable and un-

impeachable statement of this independent public witness. This witness

was fair enough not to implicate A-3.
</p>
<p id="p_124">88.          PW-30 (Ramesh Kumar Bagdi), a clerk working with

Ambica Trade Corporation at G.B.Road, Delhi, supported and

corroborated the version given by PW-56 (Suresh Chand Samanta) about

their journey in Kalka-Howrah Mail on March 25, 1975. He deposed that

on that day, he was allotted berth in the three tier sleeper vide requisition

slip Ex.P-57 and he travelled by Kalka-Howrah Mail, Delhi. He identified

A-1 having a hearing aid in his ears to be co-passenger on the lower berth

on his right side. He recalled that A-1 had played mouth organ. He

travelled with him right upto Howrah. He also recognized A-3 to be the

„passenger‟ who often used to visit A-1 during the journey at different

stations. He identified A-1 with certainty as he had long conversation with

him. He was not very sure to identify A-3 to be the „passenger‟ who used

to visit A-1. Putting his finger on A-3, he stated that „perhaps‟ he was the

person who had been visiting A-1 in the compartment. This independent

 witness had no reasons to make false statement. Discrepancies in his

statement about visit of Insp. R.N.Tiwari to him in June, 1975 were dealt

with cogent reasons by the Trial Court. It came to the conclusion after

minute discussion that PW-30 was a truthful witness though a simple

person. The Trial Court came to conclude that Mr.Tiwari had visited him

only on July 20, 1975 when his statement was recorded. There are no

sound reasons to disbelieve the witness as CBI was able to trace him on

the strength of requisition slip (Ex.P-57) which contained his address. He

was not a witness to the incident and was not acquainted with A-1 or A-3

before. He specifically gave distinctive features of A-1 whereby he used

to play mouth organ in the compartment and had a hearing-aid. A-3

though not identified with „certainty‟ was disclosed to be the „possible‟

passenger who at a halting station had missed to alight. Despite minor

discrepancies as to when his statement was recorded or if photo of A-1

was shown to him, his evidence inspires confidence. The fact that he did

not identify A-3 with „certainty‟ and admitted that photo of A-1 was

shown to him prior to Test Identification Proceedings shows that he did

not conceal any fact.

 Nand Lal Dass (PW-61), Sewa Ram (PW-29), K.B.Mishra (PW-62),

A.K.Sharma (PW-67) and Kishan Lal (PW-68), establish beyond doubt

that A-1 travelled on March 25, 1975 from Delhi to Howrah. It belies his

assertion that he was not present in Delhi before March 25, 1975. No

explanation was offered as to what was the purpose of his visit to Delhi.

The facts as to when he (A-1) visited Delhi; where he stayed before his

departure on March 25, 1975; how and by whom the tickets were reserved

in the fictitious names, etc. were all within his special knowledge and to

some extent, A-3‟s knowledge. However, none of them gave plausible

explanation to the incriminating circumstances. Under <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_102">Section 106</a>

Evidence Act, adverse inference is to be drawn against them. They cannot

get away by simply keeping quiet and offering no explanation on the

supposed premise that the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon

the prosecution. Unnatural conduct of the appellant (A-1) to travel in a

fictitious name out of Delhi soon after the occurrence is an incriminating

circumstance to connect him with the crime.

 prosecution case and the manner in which the appellants hatched the

conspiracy and executed it on March 20, 1975.
</p>
<p id="p_128">             At the outset, learned counsel for A-3 strenuously urged that

it would be inappropriate for this Court to rely on PW-1‟s testimony in

view of the specific directions by Supreme Court in Crl.A.No. 174/12

(arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 6489/06) decided on 19th January, 2012. He

urged that the Supreme Court doubted / suspected the truthfulness,

honesty and reliability of Vikram‟s statement in view of two diametrically

opposite statements; one made before CBI; and, the other before CID in

Danapur jail on 30.09.1978. The Supreme Court was of the view that one

of the statements of Vikram was false. Since it was very difficult to say at

that stage which of the statements was true and which of the statements

was made under the influence, threat or coercion by the State officers or

CBI, PW- Vikram was directed to be recalled for further examination.

Counsel further urged that it is a case in which CBI has deliberately kept

back the witness and has not deliberately produced him for cross-

examination. Vikram‟s statement before Trial Court requires to be

excluded from consideration while disposing of the appeal on merits. PW-

Vikram was the corner-stone of the prosecution case and that the entire

edifice virtually crumbled down in the absence of his evidence. Counsel

of the Constitution of India, the law laid down by Supreme Court is bound

to be followed in letter and spirit. This Court cannot deviate from the

observations made in the order dated 19.01.2012. It was further contended

that CBI was hand in glove with Vikram from the very inception. They

did not oppose grant of bail to him. Vikram did not furnish correct address

and produced fake sureties whose credientials were not verified by CBI.

He violated the bond condition not to leave Delhi till trial in L.N.Mishra

case was over. Learned Counsel for CBI urged that all sincere efforts were

made to find out the whereabouts of Vikram but he could not be traced at

his last known address and the address given in the bail bonds furnished

before the Court. It is even not clear whether he is „dead‟ or „alive‟ as he

has not been heard or seen after his release by any of his relatives. Under

</p>
<p id="p_129">91.          It is a matter of record that Crl.M.No. 5700/98 was filed on

September 16, 1998 by the appellants to summon Vikram, the approver,

for further cross-examination in terms of <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_109">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act.

The said application was disposed of by this Court by an order dated

November 22, 2006. The appellants challenged the order in Supreme

Court. After considering the relevant contentions and observing that

Vikram had made diametrically opposite statements, and CBI and State

(CID) seemed to be at logger-heads with one accusing the other of

manipulating and using Vikram for its own designs and that one of the

statements of Vikram was false, the Supreme Court set aside that part of

the High Court order and directed it to summon Vikram for his further

examination with reference to his statement made in Danapur jail on

30.09.1978 by the appellants and if so desired by the CBI. It further

reveals that CBI was directed to furnish on record the latest address of the

witness Vikram to summon him for cross-examination. Various status

reports have been placed on record by CBI on different dates. Efforts were

made to find out Vikram at the address given in the bail bond furnished by

him in the Court of <a href="/doc/160667627/" id="a_110">Sh.V.B.Bansal</a>, the then learned Addl. Sessions Judge,

 New Delhi, on 28.11.1985. Attempts were made to reach to surety

Chander Prakash at 2433, Jahangirpuri, Delhi and at his office address in

Usha Electricals at R-2/1, Jindapur Road, Uttam Nagar. However, neither

Vikram nor Chander Prakash were found available at the addresses given

at Delhi. CBI again visited village Tirar, Tehsil Sanhola, District

Bhagalpur, Vikram‟s native place. Status report reveals that CBI officials

met Vikram‟s elder brother Parmanand Dass but he was not aware of his

whereabouts since his detention in Danapur jail, Patna. His elder brother

and two sisters were found to have expired. Two sisters Kaushalya Devi

and Priya Devi who lived in their matrimonial home in Jagdishpur village

were also found dead. CBI officials met Mahender Harijan, Kaushalya

Devi‟s son who gave the said information. He also was not aware of

Vikram for the last about 40 years. It further reveals that CBI published

the information in newspapers, the photocopies of which have been placed

on record calling upon the public in general to inform it about Vikram‟s

whereabouts. The concerned responsible CBI Officers have furnished

affidavits with regard to the efforts made to find out Vikram.

</p><p id="p_130">             The appellants have also not produced on record any

document to show if after his release in 1985, Vikram lived at a particular

address or place. There is nothing to infer that CBI deliberately and

 intentionally withheld Vikram for cross-examination. Vikram after his

arrest on July 24, 1975, continuously remained in custody till his release

on bail in 1985. Prior to his arrest, he was attached to the „Organisation‟

and had no private accommodation to live in. He abandoned his native

place at the age of about 14 or 15 years. A long period has since elapsed

after his release in 1985. It is not the case of the appellants that during this

period Vikram was seen or heard at any specific place. It is not clear

whether he is „alive‟. Various reports placed on record demonstrate that

sincere and reasonable efforts were put by CBI to ensure / procure his

presence before the Court. Adverse inference cannot be drawn against

CBI for withholding the witness deliberately. There is nothing on record

to show that CBI was hand in glove with Vikram and was instrumental in

his release. The proceedings in the instant case had already been

terminated long back in 1976 and Vikram had examined himself as a

witness / approver in L.N.Mishra case. This Court vide order dated

18.10.1985 granted bail to him in L.N.Misra case. It was for the Trial

Court to ensure that the surety bond furnished by Vikram was genuine and

sound. At no stage prior to moving of the application in 1998, the

appellants accused CBI of their connivance in the release of Vikram.

</p><p id="p_131"> 92.          I have gone through the order dated 19.01.2012. In my view,

observations therein are confined only with respect to the limited question

of recalling the witness for re-examination. At no stage, the Supreme

Court judged the reliability or admissibility of Vikram‟s statements, one

before CBI in Delhi and the other before Danapur jail. Under <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_111">Section 145</a>

Cr.P.C. PW- Vikram was required to be examined to find out as to which

of the versions was correct. There are no observations / directions in the

order to exclude the statement made by Vikram before Trial Court

altogether in case of his non-availability. Apparently, recall of PW-1

(Vikram) for cross-examination was subjet to his availability. I find no

merit in the appellants‟ plea that Vikram‟s statement given before the

Court warrants outright rejection / exclusion due to CBI‟s inability to

produce him for cross-examination.

where the examination-in-chief of a witness has been completed but he

evidence of such witness cannot be rejected. Relevant para of the

judgment reads :

<p id="p_135">95.          This Court in „<a href="/doc/1589191/" id="a_114">Krishan Dayal vs. Chandu Ram</a>‟, 1969 ILR

(Delhi) 1090, held that the statement of a witness in examination-in-chief

which was admissible at the time it was recorded, cannot become

inadmissible by reason of the subsequent death of the witness before

cross-examination    and   the   absence of      cross-examination     would

undoubtedly affect the value and weight to be attached to the statement of

the witness, but it would not render the statement inadmissible or result in

its effacement and so far as the question is concerned as to what weight

should be attached to such statement made in examination-in-chief, the

Court has to keep in view the facts and circumstances of each individual

case.

others</a>‟, 1993 Crl.L.J. 3384, PW-4 (Kashiprasad Kedia) had deposed

before the Trial Court prior to the framing of the charge but was not

available to the prosecution thereafter. When he was initially available to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 107 of 201</span>
 the Trial Court and his examination-in-chief was recorded, he was cross-

examined at great length on behalf of accused No.2, though accused No.1

declined to cross-examine him at that stage. The prosecution made

reasonable efforts to procure his presence but his whereabouts were

unknown. The evidence of the witness was considered admissible. It was

held that non-availability of the witness at a later stage of the same

proceeding will not render the evidence inadmissible since an opportunity

to cross-examine was afforded to the defence at the time when the witness

was examined.

<p id="p_137">97.          In „<a href="/doc/1174790/" id="a_116">Jose vs. State of Kerala</a>‟, 1973 Cri.L.J. 687, the Supreme

Court while dealing with <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_117">Section 33</a> of the Evidence Act held that where

the presence of a witness examined in the Court of the committing

Magistrate cannot be obtained without an amount of delay and expense

which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers

unreasonable, and there was evidence to show that the attempts were

made to secure his presence in the Trial Court, his evidence can be

brought on record and will constitute substantive evidence.

</p><p id="p_138">98.          In the instant case, PW-Vikram was available to the

appellants throughout the trial which culminated in final disposal in 1976.

He was cross-examined at length by the appellants on various dates. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 108 of 201</span>
 was available for appearance before the Court being in custody till 1985

before his release on bail in L.N.Misra case. In fact, he was confronted

with the statement made by him before Danapur jail in the said

proceedings. It is pertinent to note that the appellants had moved

CM.No.6300/1998 to bring on record the statement of PW-Vikram

recorded in Sessions Case No. 121/1996 (RC.No. 175 titled <a href="/doc/320053/" id="a_118">CBI vs.

Santoshanand and ors</a>.), pending in the Court of the then learned Sessions

Judge Ms.Sharda Aggarwal. This Court allowed the application vide order

dated 22.11.2006. As observed above, efforts were made by the

prosecution to secure his presence in compliance with the order of the

Supreme Court but he was not available at both the addresses in Delhi as

well as in Bihar. There is nothing on record to show that CBI did not

make diligent search and reasonable exertion to trace the witness.

</p><p id="p_139">             Of course, the evidence of PW-Vikram who could not be

recalled for cross-examination would be viewed with a great degree of

caution. Endeavour will be made to act upon such testimony only if it is

materially corroborated or supported by the surrounding circumstances.

</p><p id="p_140">99.          Next limb of argument of the appellants‟ counsel is that PW-

Vikram is wholly unreliable and no reliance can be placed on his

evidence. The story given by the approver was a tissue of lies and was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 109 of 201</span>
 wholly improbable. Despite issuance of non-bailable warrants in

L.N.Mishra case, Vikram chose not to appear. Conduct and character of

the approver Vikram make him absolutely unreliable and untrustworthy

witness. Counsel further urged that statement of PW-Vikram is not a

statement which could come within the parameters of <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_119">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C.

as he was never a willing party to the crime. The pardon granted to him

under <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_120">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C. was illegal and unjustified as to his own

showing he was not a party to the crime. His position was not better than

that of PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and PW-57 (Raj

Singh). The investigation is tainted and unfair. It is mystery as to how

PW-Vikram was taken as an accomplice or a conspirator when PW-4,

PW-55 &amp; PW-57 with similar roles were associated as prosecution

witnesses. Total investigation including its trial was conducted by CBI

during Emergency era. PWs-44, 55 and 57 were illegally detained by CBI

and made to give evidence as per their dictates. They were bound down

for recording statements under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_121">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. He further urged that

the evidence of Vikram approver could not improve the prosecution case.

</p><p id="p_141">             Countering the appellants‟ contentions, CBI counsel urged

that evidence of Vikram has to be appreciated, keeping in view the entire

evidence and the fact that he was examined before the Court eight times at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 110 of 201</span>
 different stages and he remained consistent and supported the case of the

prosecution in its entirety. He made a voluntary statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_122">Section

164</a> Cr.P.C. before the ACMM twice on 14.08.1975 and 16.08.1975. He

again made statement before the Court of CMM, Delhi while he was

examined under <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_123">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C. before grant of pardon. Before the

case was committed to the Court of Sessions for trial, Vikram was

examined by the committal Court in L.N.Mishra case. During trial,

Vikram was examined as PW-1 over a period of time and his testimony

runs into about 225 pages. His examination as PW-2 in L.N.Mishra case

runs into 340 pages. Regarding statement allegedly made by Vikram

before Superintendent jail on 30.09.1978 at Danapur, it was strongly

urged that Vikram retracted that statement during his deposition,

subsequently, in L.N.Mishra case. The statement made before Danapur

jail authorities was recorded without any authority of law and in complete

violation of legal provisions which were outside the legal frame work. The

said statement is not admissible in evidence and appears to have been

procured putting him in fear. The evidence has been recorded in a manner

unknown to law. He further contended that report of Justice Tarakunde

was only an „opinion‟ and was not an admissible piece of evidence. There

was a conflict of interest in submitting the report as A-2 was one of his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 111 of 201</span>
 juniors and was represented by him (Justice Tarakunde) in the case. The

appellants never challenged the authenticity of the statement till 1998.

They waited for seventeen years to recall him knowing well that the said

evidence would not be available. There is nothing on record to show that

Vikram was an untrustworthy witness or he gave false evidence. As per

material available on record there is no doubt that Vikram was an

accomplice with the appellants in an attempt to murder the CJI. He was

part of the conspiracy and played an active role to achieve the object of

the conspiracy.
</p>
<p id="p_142">100.         Before adverting to the credibility of testimony of PW-

Vikram, it is pertinent to note that Vikram recorded his statement under

<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_124">Sections    164</a>     Cr.P.C.     during   investigation   before   PW-20

(Sh.R.D.Aggarwal), Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. PW-1 (Vikram)

was produced before him on August 12, 1975 at 03.00 P.M. He put certain

questions reproduced in Ex.P7 and directed Vikram to be produced on

August 14, 1975 at 10.00 A.M. He was ordered to be kept segregated

from others in the jail. As per PW-20‟s testimony. After recording the

statement (questionnaire) of Vikram, he had satisfied himself that there

was no inducement or threat of any kind and Vikram wanted to make

statement on his own accord. He again explained to Vikram that he was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 112 of 201</span>
 being sent to judicial custody so that he could compose himself and think

over as to whether he wanted to make statement. He also explained to

Vikram that he should not be under any kind of fear, because he would

not be sent back to police custody. On August 14, 1975, PW-20 explained

the whole position to Vikram once again. After satisfying himself that no

pressure of any kind had been exerted and no police officer or jail officers

had met Vikram during custody, he finally apprised Vikram that he was

not bound to make any statement before him or that any such statement (if

made) could be read in evidence against him. Vikram‟s statement (Ex.P8)

was recorded in question-answer form. After satisfying that Vikram

wanted to make a statement voluntarily without any inducement or

pressure of any kind, PW-20 recorded his statement (Ex.P9) at 11.35 A.M.

when none else was present inside the Court room. Certificate appended is

Ex.P9/A. Vikram also made endorsement (Ex.P9/C) in his own hand and

signatures. In the cross-examination, PW-20 denied the suggestion that

CBI and police officers were present in the Court room throughout when

Vikram‟s statement was recorded on August 14, 1975. He fairly admitted

that oath was administered to Vikram before recording his statement. He

denied the suggestion that Vikram had made the statement as he was

pressurized by administering the oath. He denied the suggestion that copy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 113 of 201</span>
 of the statement of Vikram as recorded by CBI was in his possession

while recording his statement.
</p>
<p id="p_143">101.         On scanning the testimony, it reveals that all the necessary

precautions were taken by the Judicial Magistrate. He was satisfied that

the statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_125">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. was being made by Vikram

voluntarily and was not the result of any duress or coercion by the police.

It was recorded after due warning and providing sufficient time to reflect.

Vikram was aware that he was making a statement before a Judicial

Magistrate independent of the police. PW-20 had given assurance of

protection against any apprehension, inducement, pressure and threat, etc.

Necessary certificate regarding the statement to be voluntary and free

from any pressure was appended by the Judicial Officer. Despite lengthy

cross-examination, nothing emerged to infer that mandatory requirements

of <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_126">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. were not adhered to before recording the statement

or that the Judicial Officer had any ulterior or extraneous consideration to

connive with CBI to record false statement at their behest as alleged.

Vikram himself appeared as PW-1 and categorically deposed that on

August 12, 1975, he told Sh.R.D. Aggarwal of his desire to make a

statement regarding the incidents at Samastipur resulting in the death of

L.N.Misra and subsequent attack on Chief Justice of India. He further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 114 of 201</span>
 deposed that he was given two days‟ time to reflect before making

statement. He was given further time to think over and was asked to sit in

the Court room and calmly deliberate about it. Statement (Ex.P9) under

<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_127">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. was made by him voluntarily of his own free will

without being influenced by anyone in any manner. The reason to make

statement was that he was convinced that he had done a wrong thing and

by giving that statement, he wanted to unburden himself. In the cross-

examination, nothing was suggested to him if the statement given by him

was under pressure or that necessary procedural safeguards were not

adhered to by the Judicial Magistrate in recording the statement. At no

stage, PW-1 (Vikram) challenged the genuineness and authenticity of the

statement (Ex.P9) made by him before the Judicial Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_144">102.         Vikram appeared as an approver before the Court and was

examined as PW-1. His Court statement runs into 162 pages (152 paras).

He gave detailed account as to how he joined the Organisation in 1965

when he was still a student of 9th class. He gave detailed history of his

association with the Organisation; the places where he stayed and

performed various jobs till July, 1974. During his short stay at D-41,

South Extension Part-I, he was introduced to A-1 an „Avadhoot‟, editor of

newspaper "Prout" printed and published from there. A-2, A-3, PW-4
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 115 of 201</span>
 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) and PW-Raj Singh were visitors to the said premises.

In the end of 1972, he went to Jaipur and stayed there as Press Manager

till June 1974. He participated in a rally organized by the „Organisation‟

to secure the release of Baba Anand Murti on April 23, 1973 and was

arrested for violation of the orders under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_128">Section 144</a> Cr.P.C. on April 24;

remained in detention for about a month or so. Acharya Dhaneshanand

had committed self-immolation in the Purana Qila. After his release, he

went back to Jaipur and returned to Delhi in June, 1974 as press at Jaipur

had gone out of order. He resumed work in the press at Delhi and began to

live there.
</p>
<p id="p_145">103.          Vikram further deposed that on July 01 or 02, 1974 when he

had gone to South Extension market at about 02.00 or 02.20 P.M. A-1

called him by his name Vikram from a distance. At first instance, he was

unable to recognize A-1 as he had shaved off his beard and moustache. A-

1 was wearing pant and shirt at that time. When he (Vikram) recognized

him from voice and face and enquired as to why he (A-1) had changed his

dress and appearance, A-1 told him that it was to avoid the police who

was searching him after self-immolation of Dhaneshanand. A-1 told

Vikram that they needed men of revolutionary type who could secure

Baba‟s release by armed revolution. On that, he (Vikram) placed himself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 116 of 201</span>
 at A-1‟s disposal and agreed to do anything entrusted to him. A-1 asked

him to meet him at Pusa Gate at about 08.00 or 08.30 A.M. next day. As

per PW-1‟s testimony, he met A-1 at Pusa Gate who took him to the room

of Shiv Raj Singh in the hostel of Pusa Institute. A-1 told him that rallies

and the self-immolation had no effect on the Government with the result

that Baba could not be released; the only way to secure the release of the

Baba was through armed revolution. PW-1 declared to carry out any

orders given to him in that behalf as he had devoted his entire life to Baba.

At A-1‟s command, he shaved off his beard and cut the hair short. An

assumed name „Subir‟ was given to him by A-1.
</p>
<p id="p_146">104.         PW-1 further testified that A-1 handed over a closed

envelope and a packet to deliver to Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh at

Bhagalpur at Anand Margi Primary School without disclosing its contents.

He left Delhi the same day by Upper India Express and delivered the

articles to Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh who hailed from Unnao

District, U.P. He introduced him to Gopal ji in village Chautham, District

Monghyr and asked him to contact him in time of need and emergency;

they all used to have meetings at his farm at a distance of 5 / 7 miles from

Chautham. He further deposed that on July 13, 1974 at about 10.00 or

11.00 when he and Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh were standing near a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 117 of 201</span>
 tomb in the vicinity of Anand Margi Primary School, the police arrested

Budhishwaranand      @     Amar    Singh.   He    informed    A-1     about

Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh‟s arrest and his inability to pick up the

bag. On that, A-1 got annoyed and told him that the said packet contained

three hand-grenades. The witness further testified that he had attended two

or three meetings for armed revolution at Gopalji‟s house and at Tilhar

farm which were also attended by A-1, A-3, Arteshanand and Gopalji etc.

A-1 used to address those meetings and refrain of his talk in all the

meetings was that they could not secure the release of Baba by legal

means and they would have to collect as many arms as possible and take

resort to armed revolution. On A-1‟s instructions, he went to Narkatiya

Ganj and Chamua for collection of arms and met Paras Nath and Roop

Nath Misir but could not succeed to procure arms from them. In

November 1974 in a meeting at Rajgir, A-1 exhorted them to work for

„Shastra Krantikari Yuvak Sangh‟ and each one of them should enroll at

least 25 members of strong determination.
</p>
<p id="p_147">             On March 17, 1975, he met A-3 at Ashok Lodge near Gandhi

Maidan at Patna where A-1 had hired a room for the members to hold

secret meetings etc. On enquiry, A-3 told him that A-1 had gone to Delhi

and they were to reach there. On March 18, 1975, he and A-3 left Patna
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 118 of 201</span>
 and arrived at Delhi on March 19. The witness revealed that A-3 had

carried a black bag with a zip from Patna to Delhi. At the time of leaving

Ashok Lodge, A-3 had asked him to be careful about the black bag which

contained three hand-grenades and it should be handled with care. At

Delhi, they went to Mehrauli bus stand where A-1 met and took them to

the house to PW-Raj Singh at Mehrauli and they spent the night there. On

March 20, when PW-Raj Singh was making arrangement for breakfast, A-

1 told him and A-3 that "Ray sahib who is the Chief Justice of India is a

„Mahapapi‟ in as much as he had rejected the bail application of Baba ji

and had refused to transfer the case outside the State of Bihar relating to

Baba ji". A-1 also said that "he (Ray sahib) was openly a henchman of the

Indira Sarkar‟. Indira Sarkar had appointed him Chief Justice by

superseding 2 / 3 other judges". He also emphasized that „so long as he

occupies the office of the Chief Justice of India it would be difficult to

secure justice for Baba ji‟. A-1 declared that "he (Ray Sahib) had to be

finished off, and that we had therefore to go towards the Supreme Court".

</p><p id="p_148">105.         The witness further informed that they arrived at the Supreme

Court from Mehrauli by a bus at about 09.30 A.M. A-1 told them that it

would not be advisable to attack the car of the Chief Justice of India in the

morning hours due to rush of people and it would be easier to attack in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 119 of 201</span>
 evening when the car would stop at traffic lights, at the junction of Tilak

Marg and Bhagwan Dass Road. At about 10.00 A.M. A-1 spotted the car

with a flag flying on the bonnet coming from the direction of India Gate.

Only Chief Justice was sitting in the back seat.
</p>
<p id="p_149">106.         Revealing the movements on that day, PW-Vikram recalled

that A-1 took him and A-3 to Rama Krishna park at Panchkuin Road at

about 11.00 A.M. There, in the park, A-1 told him that in the evening

when the car of the Chief Justice would stop at the traffic lights, he would

throw a hand-grenade into the car from the right side; A-3 would similarly

throw a hand-grenade from the left side. He further told him that if any of

those present there tried to chase A-1 or A-3, he (Vikram) would throw a

hand-grenade at the chasers. He was asked to stand on the corner towards

the DDA flats at the crossing of Tilak Marg and Bhagwan Dass Road. A-1

also showed him a torch which contained only a glass tube filled with

whitish liquid and told him that after being broken on the ground, it would

emit smoke to serve as a smoke screen to escape without being seen by

the crowd. A-1 told him that before throwing the hand-grenade, he should

break the tube to create smoke screen and in case any among the crowd

chased them, he should throw the hand-grenade at them. They stayed in

the park till 02.00 P.M. A little before 02.00 P.M. A-1 had gone towards
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 120 of 201</span>
 the direction of Panchkuin Road leaving him and A-3 behind in the park.

After 10 or 15 minutes, A-1 came back accompanied by PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia) who had a radio shop at Panchkuin Road.
</p>
<p id="p_150">107.          The witness further stated that A-1 told PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia) to arrange a taxi as they wanted to visit places in Delhi. PW-4

(Tilak Raj Bhatia) took all of them to Gole Market and booked a taxi

driven by a Sardar ji. In the taxi, first they went to Budha Jayanti Park,

then to India Gate and thereafter to Children‟s Park. At India Gate, they

all including the driver ate ice-creams. While visiting Amar Jyoti, A-1

exhorted them to take inspiration from it. At Children‟s Park, all the three

went inside it. A-1 and A-3 went away to return after easing themselves at

about 03.45 P.M. A-1 and A-3 returned after 10 or 15 minutes. A-1

ordered the taxi to hurry up to the Bhagwan Dass Road as he wanted to

meet someone there, lest he should miss him. They came to DDA flats

near Bhagwan Dass Road and stopped the taxi there. It was about 04.00

P.M. They all got down from the taxi. A-1 opened the bag; took one hand-

grenade for himself, gave one each to him and A-3. He also gave him a

torch containing a tube. The empty bag which contained clothes, etc. was

left behind in the taxi. PW- Tilak Raj Bhatia and the driver were asked to

keep sitting in the taxi till their return.

</p><p id="p_152"> 108.         Highlighting the role played by each of them in the execution

of the plan, PW-Vikram continued to reveal that after taking respective

position at the spot, a little later, the car of CJI flying the flag came out of

the gate reserved for the Judges. It stopped at the traffic lights, due to red

light, at the crossing of Tilak Marg with Bhagwan Dass Road. He further

revealed "No sooner did the car of the Chief Justice stop there than

Santoshanand (A-1) rushed towards the car with the hand-grenade

wrapped in the handkerchief in his hand. He went up to the right side rear

window of the car. Similarly, Sudevanand (A-3) also reached the rear

window on the left side of the car carrying the hand-grenade wrapped in a

handkerchief. Santoshanand (A-1) threw the hand-grenade into the car

and immediately he went towards Sudevanand (A-3) from behind the car.

Sudevanand (A-3) also threw the hand-grenade into the car and then ran

in the direction of Bhagwan Dass Road from behind the car."

</p><p id="p_153">             He further disclosed that while fleeing the spot, A-3

discarded „V‟shape „hawai‟ chappals on the right side of the car.

Describing the post-event situation, Vikram informed that Jamadar of

Chief Justice and others chased A-3 shouting „Pakaro-Pakaro‟. He was

also among the chasers. A-3 entered into the waiting taxi; came out of it;

went towards the Garhwal House and scaled over its gate. He also entered

 inside the Garhwal House and threw the hand-grenade and torch in the

bushes. He did not see A-3 thereafter. The witness gave detailed account

as to how from there, he first went to Mandi House, then to Regal

Cinema, Koria Pul, Shahadara and finally to Ghaziabad. He left for Patna

by Upper India Express. From Patna, he went to Chakia. After a few days,

on enquiry from A-3, he falsely informed him due to fear of A-1 that he

had broken the tube but it had no effect. On 07.04.1975, he met A-1 at

Ashoka Lodge and apprised him that he had broken the tube as advised.

A-1 got angry for discarding the hand-grenades in the bushes and directed

him to go back and search it out. On 09.04.1975, he went to the house of

Raj Singh in Mehrauli and under the guise of a „Kabari‟, went near

Garhwal House to retrieve the hand-grenade but finding the police

presence there, he did not dare to go and returned to Patna. The witness

revealed that meetings were held at Tilhar which were attended by all of

them including A-1 and A-3. Again, attempt was made by him to procure

arms but in vain. On 24.07.1975, he and A-3 were arrested at Bhagalpur.

PW-Vikram identified handwriting and signatures of A-1 on various

documents (Ex.P10 to Ex.P15).
</p>
<p id="p_154">109.         Vikram was cross-examined at length. He gave detailed

answers to the questions put to him regarding his arrest at Bhagalpur and

 the statement made by him in Samastipur case. He did not have any

hesitation to admit that prior to July 24, 1975, he had complete faith in

Baba and considered him incarnation of the God. He gave description of

the CJI to whom he was able to recognise if appeared before him. He was

confronted with the statement (Ex.D1) recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_129">Section 161</a>

Cr.P.C. where he had omitted to state certain facts. He gave explanation

for the said omissions. He told that on July 27, 1975, he was produced

before a Magistrate. While handing over his custody to CBI, he asked him

to keep his face covered to participate in TIP. He declined to participate in

the TIP on July 30 in Tihar jail. On August 01, 1975 during police custody

remand, he disclosed everything to the police. The pardon was granted to

him in Samastipur incident in October, 1975. Regarding his arrest at

Bhagalpur, he disclosed that he and A-3 were on their way to the Court in

a rickshaw. They had left the house at Nath Nagar on July 24, at about 12

or 01 o‟clock and were arrested in between 02.00 to 03.00 P.M. He denied

the suggestion that he was a police informer and had been instrumental in

getting these persons arrested wherever he went. He further denied that he

had planned to get A-1 and A-3 arrested at Gopalji‟s house and that it was

just a matter of chance that they had left earlier.

</p><p id="p_156"> 110.         Elaborating the crime-spot, he revealed that the taxi stood at

a distance of about 40 yards and was visible from the place where he had

taken up position. The constable was between him and the taxi and the

distance was 25 or 30 yards. He denied the suggestion that A-3 did not

enter the taxi because for one reason or the other it did not start. The

witness explained that subsequently, on enquiry from A-3 as to why he

had not escaped in the taxi after entering into it, he gave the reason that it

did not start. He disclosed that the gentleman who was sitting with the CJI

on the rear seat was 25 years of age, fair complexion and as tall as he

himself was. He admitted discarding of the hand-grenades after his escape

from the scene of Samastipur Kand due to fear of arrest by the police. He

expressed ignorance if the hand-grenades fallen from his hands had

subsequently come in the hands of a child and exploded there injuring

someone.
</p>
<p id="p_157">111.         Answering the varied queries, he further revealed that while

chasing A-3 after the incident, he had crossed Tilak Raj Bhatia before

running to the Garhwal House. He was not aware as to why Tilak Raj

Bhatia was included in the team that day as it was for A-1 to decide to

whom to include and not to include. He was not aware if Tilak Raj Bhatai

was a party to the conspiracy. He further informed that he and A-3 had

 travelled by Assam Mail from Patna to Delhi without reservation of seats.

The train arrives at Delhi at 05.00 or 06.00 P.M. after its departure on the

previous day at 10.00 or 11.00 P.M. He denied the suggestion that he

travelled from Patna to Delhi by Delhi Express on March 18 after making

reservation and was not in Delhi on March 19 evening. He claimed that

there was no quarrel between him and A-1 and denied the suggestion that

he had hit A-1 on the forehead with an iron rod in 1972. He added that

throughout his association with A-1, he had good relations with him. A-1

had trained him in the use of hand-grenades.
</p>
<p id="p_158">112.         Depicting the crime scene, he disclosed that at the place of

occurrence, A-1 and A-3 held their respective hand-grenades in one hand

from the middle of the lever. To his view, A-1 took out the hand-grenade

from his right pocket in his right hand; covered it with the handkerchief

taken out from the left hand pocket. A-1 had thrown the hand-grenade into

the car after getting quite close to it. The car of CJI had stopped at the

traffic lights with its front wheels touching the „stop‟ line. The word

"STOP" was written in a very bold letters cutting across the entire lane of

the signal stop.

<p id="p_159">113.         Regarding his visit to Pusa Institute, he deposed that he

travelled to the said institute by bus. Shiv Raj‟s room from the Pusa Gate

 was at a distance of ½ or ¾ km. He further disclosed that Raj Singh‟s

house was at a distance of about a furlang from the bus stand and it was a

„pakka‟ house having two or three rooms.
</p>
<p id="p_160">114.         In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-3), the witness gave

detailed account regarding his family; his association with the

Organisation; the oath administered to him by Parkashanand ji; his

participation in the various activities of various wings of the Organisation;

his association with A-1, A-3 and other active members of the

Organisation including Madhavanand; philosophy of the Organisation and

his meetings with Anand Murti ji twice. He denied the suggestion that he

was expelled from the „Organisation‟ for abducting a girl and committing

theft. He further denied that due to his frustration for failure to get a job,

he became a whole time worker in the „Organisation‟. He gave the names

of various Anand Margis who had defected from the „Organisation‟. He

was not aware if Madhavanand, Onkaranand, Naval Kishore, Ujjawal,

Chiranand and Chidatamanand had defected from the „Organisation‟. He

gave detailed account of the meetings that took place at Gopalji‟s house

and added that A-1, A-3, Gopal ji, Artheshanand and he had attended the

said meetings. He was not aware if any attempt was made to poison Baba

Ji to death in the jail. He denied the suggestion that he joined A-1 because
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 127 of 201</span>
 he was enraged over the news that attempt had been made to poison Baba

in jail and added that he was, however, at one, with A-1 to secure Baba‟s

release by any means. He gave detailed account regarding Sadhana Pitha

Training (SPT) in 1969 at Varansi. He disclosed that he did not know

Sudhir Kumar Basedar and was not aware if the original name of

Advetanand was Sudhir Kumar Basedar. He was questioned regarding his

association with Khub Lal who had introduced him to Paras Nath in

connection with procurement of arms. He stated that he had gone to

Narkatia Ganj in October 1974 for this purpose. He denied the suggestion

that he was arrested at Varansi on the alleged charge of conspiracy by

Anand Margis to kill Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India.

</p><p id="p_161">115.         About Tilak Raj Bhatia, he disclosed that he had visited his

shop twice or thrice and he (PW-4) knew him by the name of Vikram. He

denied the suggestion that he used to go to Tilak Raj Bhatia‟s house for

delivering newspapers „Prout‟. He admitted that PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)

did not meet him at all after this occurrence. He denied the suggestion that

he had told Tilak Raj Bhatia that day that they were in possession of hand-

grenades and that they were out to kill the CJI.
</p>
<p id="p_162">             About PW-Raj Singh, he told that he had been visiting the

press earlier and he had also visited his house five or six times before

 March 19, 1975. Raj Singh had been residing in a different house at that

time which was at a distance of 1500 to 2000 yards from the house where

he was living on March 19. He denied that when he had left Raj Singh‟s

house in the disguise of a „kabari‟, he told him that he got entangled in

that affair by deceit and that he had not done any such thing.

</p><p id="p_163">             He admitted acquaintance with Janki Prasad who had become

a member of „Akhil Bhartiya Shastra Vipalavi Chhatar Yuva Sangh‟. He

was not aware if Janki Prasad was an agent of CBI and that he in league

with him got A-3 arrested. Denying the suggestion that Janki Prasad was

the third passenger in the rickshaw at Bhagalpur where he and A-3 were

arrested, he added that he had seen Janki Prasad at the railway station on

July 24, 1975 but did not meet him.
</p>
<p id="p_164">116.         In para-87 of the statement, he disclosed that he was aware of

topography of the area due to distribution of the „paper‟ from time to time

during the period he had been working in the local press. About crime

scene, he disclosed that the car of the Chief Justice arrived at the traffic

lights 5 or 7 minutes after he had taken up position. He admitted that but

for the red lights, their decision was not to throw the hand-grenades. He

elaborated that their plan was that in case the car did not stop there, they

would try some other time. It had not been decided as to when and where
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 129 of 201</span>
 the other attempt was to be made. Their next programme in event of the

car not stopping there depended upon A-1. A-1 had told them that as soon

as the hand-grenades exploded, they would escape in the taxi in the

resultant confusion. There was no contingency plan in the event of the taxi

not being available there. He denied the suggestion that false statements

were made by him in the Court because he had joined hands with

Datgatanand, Vishokanand and Parkashanand in league with the CBI.

</p><p id="p_165">117.         In the cross-examination on behalf of Ram Nagina Prasad

(since acquitted), he denied the suggestion that he was given only a torch

without any tube in it and that the said torch was supposed to itself emit

smoke. He further disclosed that the sikh gentleman who drove the taxi

was wearing khaki pants and shirt, brown colour turban and was aged

about 35 or 40 years. He categorically stated that neither did he ask the

police to make him an approver nor did the police ask him to become an

approver. All that he had said was that he was prepared to state the truth

regardless of its consequences. He agreed to be a party to the conspiracy

of throwing the hand-grenades and breaking the tube, because the element

of fear never entered his mind. He did not break the tube because the

hand-grenades did not explode.

<p id="p_166">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 130 of 201</span>
</p><p id="p_167"> 118.         Replying the questions put in the cross-examination on

behalf of A-2, he stated that in the newspapers in 1975 he read that the

government had banned the „Organisation‟. He denied the suggestion that

from the very beginning, he had joined the „Organisation‟ with a plan to

get into it and do espionage work inside it, get some Anand Margis

involve in criminal cases and then become an approver. He denied that

after his arrest on July 24, 1975, he was subjected to severe beatings by

the police or that he was served with food and drinks and was entertained

to induce him to make a statement as they wanted. He admitted that there

was no talk at all about the conspiracy to kill the CJI in any of their

meetings held in the State of Bihar. He claimed that when he was engaged

in all these activities, he knew that he was running the risk of his life but

that did not bother him because he was prepared to do anything for Baba.

He stated that he did not give any suggestion to A-1 and A-3 any time by

way of dissent or otherwise because they were his leaders and it was his

duty to follow them. Denying the suggestion that A-1 himself used to go

to the Supreme Court for the „paravi‟ of bail applications, PW-Vikram

added that Acharya Ram Tanuk, a lawyer, used to visit the Supreme Court

for this purpose and stay at D-41, South Extension during his visits to

Delhi. It is apt to note here that name of Sh.Ram Tanuk, Advocate, finds

 mention in various orders of the Supreme Court (Ex.P-95, Ex.P-96 and

Ex.P-98) whereby he represented the head of the „Organisation‟. He

denied the suggestion that the tube was not broken to create smoke screen,

because he was a dishonest man and was in league with CBI. He

explained that he did not avail the taxi for his escape, because he wanted

to go after A-3 for his help. He admitted that he had followed A-3 keeping

in mind that if anybody tried to catch him, he would kill him by throwing

the hand-grenade.
</p>
<p id="p_168">119.         On analysis of the broad features of Vikram‟s evidence

described above, it reveals that PW-Vikram has given detailed account

from the inception to the end of all the events and his testimony is quite

expatiated. He was a dedicated follower of the „Organisation‟ which he

joined in 1965 during his childhood. He had utmost faith in the

„Organisation‟ and was ready and willing to sacrifice his life for its cause.

He was an active whole time worker of the „Organisation‟ and had deep

knowledge about its philosophy. He had close association with A-1 and

was ready and willing to obey his command at all costs. He participated in

various meetings attended by A-1 and A-3 in Delhi and outside Delhi. On

the day of arrest on July 24, 1975, he was with A-3 at Bhagalpur. Though

various suggestions have been put regarding his wrong doings in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 132 of 201</span>
 „Organisation‟, no evidence emerged on record to show if at any time his

bonafide was suspected or he was expelled from the „Organisation‟.

Nothing has come on record if A-1 or A-3 or the „Organisation‟ had any

grievance whatsoever against his conduct and behaviour before recording

statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_130">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. Even in Tihar jail, he had declined to

participate in TIP as advised by A-1. He was in a fix to make complete

disclosure of the facts during investigation till August 11 by CBI. When

he was produced on August 12, 1975 before Sh.R.D.Aggarwal, ACMM,

he expressed desire to record statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_131">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. In the

statement given to the Judicial Magistrate as well as before the Court, he

not only clearly implicated A-1 and A-3 but also involved himself for

actively participating in the execution of the conspiracy to throw hand-

grenades on the car in which CJI was travelling. His involvement in the

incident had come prior to his arrest on July 24, 1975 in this case.

</p><p id="p_169">120.         Despite lengthy and indepth cross-examination on various

dates, the appellants were unable to extract or elicit any material

discrepancy or variation to doubt the version narrated by him. He gave

minute detail of the events as to how A-1 had instigated / exhorted him to

resort to illegal means for release of Baba from jail; how he had

participated in the execution of the plan on March 20, 1975. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 133 of 201</span>
 appellants were unable to shatter his testimony on vital aspects or to bring

out any major infirmity in it. Learned counsel for the appellants assailing

the statement of approver on various grounds pointed out numerous

alleged contradictions and improvements in his statement. True, Vikram

has made certain improvements in his deposition before the Court and the

facts deposed in the Court were omitted to be so mentioned in his

statements recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_132">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. or 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_133">Cr.P.C</a>. However,

when confronted the witness gave elaborate explanation for their

omissions and furnished reasonable clarifications. The discrepancies /

improvements referred to by the appellants‟ counsel are minor,

insignificant, natural and not material. Marginal variations in the

statement cannot be dubbed as improvements as these are in fact details

and description of the narrations extracted by the defence counsel in the

lengthy cross-examination of the approver. It may be worthwhile to notice

that wherever any alleged contradiction or improvement was confronted

to the witness, the learned Trial Court had made a note of it in the

statement at the time of recording of the deposition of the witness. These

omissions do not go to the root of the prosecution case to shake its basic

structure. The law is very clear on this aspect; only such omissions which

amount to contradiction in material particulars can be used to discredit the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 134 of 201</span>
 testimony of a witness. In „Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary &amp; anr. vs.

State of Maharastra‟, 2000 (8) SCC 457, the Supreme Court held :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">          "Only such omissions which amount to contradiction in
          material particulars can be used to discredit the
          testimony of the witness. The omission in the police
          statement by itself would not necessarily render the
          testimony of witness unreliable. When the version given
          by the witness in the Court is different in material
          particulars from that disclosed in his earlier
          statements, the case of the prosecution become
          doubtful and not otherwise. Minor contradictions are
          bound to appear in the statements of truthful witnesses
          as memory sometimes plays false and the sense of
          observation differ from person to person. The
          omissions in the earlier statement if found to be of
          trivial details, as in the present case, the same would
          not cause any dent in the testimony of PW. 2. Even if
          there is contradiction of statement of a witness on any
          material point, that is no ground to reject the whole of
          the testimony of such witness."

          error committed by the investigating officer not going
          to the : root of the matter would not ordinarily permit
          rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before

           this benefit will have to attach due weight to the
          appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless
          there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not
          be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor
          variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details.
          Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some
          details unrelated to the main incident because power of
          observation, retention and reproduction differ with
          individuals. Cross examination is an unequal duel
          between a rustic and refined lawyer. Having examined
          the evidence of this witness, a friend and well-wisher of
          the family carefully giving due weight to the comments
          made by the learned Counsel for the respondent and
          the reasons assigned to by the High Court for rejecting
          his evidence simultaneously keeping in view the
          appreciation of the evidence of this witness by the trial
          court, we have no hesitation in holding that the High
          Court was in error in rejecting the testimony of witness
          Nair whose evidence appears to us trustworthy and
          credible."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_172">122.         I am satisfied that contradictions (if any) are only minimal

and would not affect the claim of the prosecution case or discredit his

statement. Contrary to that, various conflicting and inconsistent

suggestions have been given to Vikram in the cross-examination which

strengthen the deposition given by him in the Court regarding the role

attributed to the appellants. PW-Vikram had no extraneous motive to

make a false statement as he himself had remained in detention / custody

for long ten years despite being granted pardon. The suggestions given to

PW-Vikram in the cross-examination are worth-noting.

found in compromising position with one Amar Singh, indicated that the

accused did not dispute the earlier occurrence with Kulwant Singh." In

„<a href="/doc/969490/" id="a_137">Jesu Asir Singh &amp; ors. vs. State</a> through Inspector of Police‟, (2007) 12

controvert or falsify the facts disclosed by PW-Vikram in his detailed

where else he was arrested. PW-Vikram attributed and assigned definite

and specific role to each of the appellants in the occurrence minutely. His

assertion on vital facts remained unchallenged and uncontroverted in the

cross-examination. In fact, Vikram‟s cross-examination is on fringes and

reflects appellants‟ reluctance to question him on vital substantive aspects.

All sorts of questions having no relevance with the main issues have been

put to him even to test his knowledge about the philosophy of the

„Organisation‟. Nothing was suggested to PW-Vikram, an active member

of the „Organisation‟ about his presence on March 19 or 20, 1975. A-1

 and A-3 even did not deny their presence in Delhi during the relevant

period. PW-Vikram was fair enough not to implicate A-2 for joining the

conspiracy or assisting the conspirators in any manner in the execution of

the conspiracy. The only role attributed to him was that A-1 had disclosed

him that CJI was shown to him by A-2 in the Supreme Court. He did not

implicate PWs - Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv Raj Singh or Raj Singh for joining

the conspiracy. He was fair enough to reveal that before March 20, 1975

he was not aware if hand-grenades were to be thrown at the car of the CJI.

He also disclosed that he was unable to procure arms and ammunitions

despite efforts made by him. PW-Vikram‟s testimony clearly and un-

erringly establishes the active role played by A-1 and A-3 in the execution

of the plan.

<p id="p_199">127.           I do not subscribe to the appellants‟ contention that pardon

granted was not legal under <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_138">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C. The principle of

tendering pardon to an accomplice is to unravel the truth in a grave

offence so that guilt of other accused persons concerned in commission of

crime could be brought home. Detailing the object to grant pardon,

Supreme Court in „Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary &amp; anr. vs. State of

Maharastra‟ (supra), held that the accomplice‟s evidence is taken on

record as a matter of necessity in case where it is impossible to get

 sufficient evidence of a heinous crime unless one of the participators in

the crime is disposed to disclose the circumstances within his knowledge

on account of tender of pardon. Approving the observations in „<a href="/doc/144689/" id="a_139">Suresh

Chandra Bahri vs. State of Bihar</a>‟, 1995 SCC (Crl.) 60, it held : "....The

basis of the tender of pardon is not the extent of the culpability of the

person to whom pardon is granted, but the principle is to prevent the

escape of the offenders from punishment in heinous offences for lack of

evidence. There can therefore be no objection against tender of pardon to

an accomplice simply because in his confession, he does not implicate

himself to the same extent as the other accused because all that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_140">Section

306</a> requires is that pardon may be tendered to any person believed to be

involved directly or indirectly in or privy to an offence. "

commission of crime. He was privy to all the happenings at the time of

with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_141">Section 306</a> before tendering pardon to accused

Vikram who appeared as PW-1. I do not find any violation of law or

illegally in the procedure for tendering pardon to him. In my view, there

was no legal impediment in the grant of pardon to Vikram. Moreover, the

appellants never challenged the pardon during trial.

about evidentiary value of the testimony of an approver is relevant to note,

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">          "There is no antithesis between <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_142">Section 133</a> and
          illustration (b) to <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_143">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act,
          because the illustration only says that the Court 'may'
          presume a certain state of affairs. It does not seek to
          raise a conclusive and irrebuttable presumption.
          Reading the two together the position which emerges
          is that though an accomplice is a competent witness
          and though a conviction may lawfully rest upon his
          uncorroborated testimony, yet the Court is entitled to
          presume and may indeed be justified in presuming in
          the generality of cases that no reliance can be placed
          on the evidence of an accomplice unless that evidence
          is corroborated in material particulars, by which is
          meant that there has to be some independent evidence
          tending to incriminate the particular accused in the
          commission of the crime. It is hazardous, as a matter
          of prudence, to proceed upon the evidence of a self-
          confessed criminal, who, in so far as an approver is
          concerned, has to testify in terms of the pardon
          tendered to him. The risk involved in convicting an
          accused on the testimony of an accomplice, unless it
          is corroborated in material particulars, is so real and
          potent that what during the early development of law
          was felt to be a matter of prudence has been elevated
          by judicial experience into a requirement or rule of
          law. All the same, it is necessary to understand that
          what has hardened into a rule of law is not that the

           conviction is illegal if it proceeds upon the
          uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice but that
          the rule of corroboration must be present to the mind
          of the Judge and that corroboration may be dispensed
          with only if the peculiar circumstances of a case make
          if safe to dispense with it.

<p id="p_204">

          Corroboration need not be in the form of ocular
          testimony of witnesses and may be even in the form of

<p id="p_207">132.         Appreciation of Vikram‟s evidence shows that he is a reliable

witness. In his examination-in-chief, he clearly stated that he was one of

the accused in the case and during investigation he was arrested by the

CBI. In categorical terms, he asserted that he was aware of the whole

incident which led to the throwing of hand-grenades in the car of CJI and

was also connected with and involved in the incident along with others.

</p><p id="p_208">133.         From the judgment of the Trial Court, it is crystal clear that

the Court was conscious of the credibility of the approver witness and

insisted upon corroborative evidence in material particulars of the

depositions made by him to see as to whether his evidence was reliable

and whether the same was corroborated in material particulars to assume

its trueness first. The Trial Court in its judgment referred to several

corroborated circumstances and concluded that these assured the

correctness and truthfulness of the version of the approver.

</p><p id="p_209">134.         I have minutely scrutinized the evidence of PW-Vikram and

the corroborative evidence discussed in detail above and find no substance

in the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that the testimony

of PW-Vikram has not been corroborated in material particulars. In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                  Page 147 of 201</span>
 evidence given by the approver before the Trial Court, he had definitely

and unequivocally implicated A-1 &amp; A-3 in the commission of the crime.

The statement of PW-1 is vivid in explanation and inspires full confidence

of the Court. The corroborative evidence to the aforesaid statement leaves

no doubt in the mind of the Court regarding the involvement of the

appellants. He recorded his statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_147">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. before

judicial authorities without any delay ruling out possibility of tutoring.

The confessional statement recorded by Vikram amply proves the

allegations. The evidence in Court does not suffer from any infirmity.

PW-Vikram has spoken of presence of A-1 and A-3 during the whole

transaction and has unequivocally attributed specific and definite role to

each of them in the crime. In the morning, they all had gone to Supreme

Court to observe the situation. They stayed and surveyed the area and

decided to execute the plan in the evening. Vikram, who had no enmity

with the appellants, has been very consistent about the factual matrix not

only in his statements under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_148">Sections 161</a>/<a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_149">164</a> Cr.P.C. but also before the

Court and has supported the prosecution case fully. The statement of the

approver inspires confidence including the conspiracy part which gets full

support from the narration of the occurrence given by several other

impartial witnesses. There is nothing wrong in accepting his entire
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 148 of 201</span>
 statement and true disclosure of the incident coupled with corroboration

with the independent witnesses. Vikram is the solitary witness of all the

circumstances to be used against the accused persons.

</p><p id="p_210">135.         The analysis of the statements of various witnesses PW-2 (Jai

Nand), PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-5 (Charan Singh), PW-57 (Raj

Singh), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and others, clearly strengthen the case of

PW-Vikram (the approver) in all aspects including conspiracy / planning

to attack CJI for rejection of bail; to make an attempt on his life, actual

incident; role played by the assailants and subsequent events. I am

satisified that by these statements, the prosecution has strengthened its

case through PW-Vikram, the approver, and there is no reason to

disbelieve his version. Judged on the background of the legal position as

stated above, the evidence of PW-Vikram does not suffer from any

infirmity to warrant rejection for his evidence is not really uncorroborated.

Even circumstantial evidence can provide the corroboration. In the instant

case, the evidence of PW-Vikram therefore, clearly meets the requirement

of <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_150">Section 114</a> (b) in the background of <a href="/doc/274935/" id="a_151">Section 133</a> of the Evidence Act.

 accomplices / co-conspirators. All of them were aware about the

conspiracy in question from the inception and facilitated the appellants in

fulfilling its object in one way or the other. Counsel laid considerable

stress on the fact that they did not lodge a complaint to the police to

prevent the crime. They were in CBI custody for about ten days as

suspects and remained absent from their duties. Initially, they were

marked „absent‟ in their office record. Subsequently, absence period was

treated as „regular‟ and they were taken to be on „duty‟. Apparently, they

had every temptation to give evidence as desired by CBI. An accomplice

cannot corroborate another. Corroboration of one tainted evidence by

another tainted evidence can in no manner be called independent

          the Act, and should therefore be presumed to have been
          used in its ordinary sense. An accomplice means a
          guilty associate or partner in crime, or who, in some
          way or other, is connected with the offence in question,
          or who makes admissions of facts showing that ho had
          a conscious hand in the offence. In my opinion where a
          witness is not concerned with the commission of the
          crime for which the accused is charged, he cannot be
          said to be an accomplice in the crime....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">          8. In my opinion the word, "accomplice" is made at
          times to bear improperly a larger meaning than is
          permissible according to its accepted interpretation in
          law. An accomplice confesses himself a criminal who
          has been concerned in the commission of a crime,
          participles criminal, whether he is concerned in the
          strict legal propriety as principal in the first or second
          degree, or merely as accessory before or after the fact.
          It is well-settled law that all accessories before the
          fact, if they participate in the preparation for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 151 of 201</span>
           crime, are accomplices, but if their participation is
          limited to the knowledge that a crime is to be
          committed they are not accomplices. Whether a person
          is or is not an accomplice depends upon the facts in
          each particular case considered in connection with the
          nature of the crime, and persons to be accomplices
          must participate in the commission of the same crime
          as the accused persons in a trial are charged. If the
          evidence of a witness falls short of these tests, he is not
          an accomplice, and his testimony must be judged on
          principles applicable to ordinary witnesses. Where a
          witness is not concerned with the commission of the
          crime for which the accused is charged, in my opinion,
          he cannot be said to be an accomplice in the crime.
          Persons coming technically within the category of
          accomplices cannot be treated on precisely the same
          footing. In the present ease there is no evidence that
          Bashir Beg participated in the preparation for the
          crime. Ho, therefore, cannot be said to be an
          accomplice in the crime, as I have said that it is well
          settled law that all accessories before the fact, if they
          participate in the preparation for the crime, are
          accomplices."</blockquote><p id="p_218">

<p id="p_220">137.         In the instant case, nothing emerged to infer if these

witnesses had conscious hand in the crime or played an active role. It is

unclear if any of them was privy to the „conspiracy‟ or was aware of its

existence. None of them procured any arm or ammunition to carry out the

 unholy plan of the „conspiracy‟. No incriminating material was recovered

from their possession. This is true that they did not report or convey the

information to the police at the relevant time but this by itself does not

make them accomplices. The mere fact that a person did not reveal his

knowledge of the intended crime to the authorities does not make him an

accomplice. They have given reasonable explanation that due to threats

extended by the appellant and being in fear, they refrained from doing so.

(When a person under threat of death or other forms of pressure which he

is unable to resist commits a crime along with others, he is not a willing

participant in it but a victim of it. Such a person can hardly be called an

accomplice („<a href="/doc/1712115/" id="a_154">Sriniwas Mull Bairoliya &amp; Anr. vs. Emperor</a>‟, AIR 1947 PC

</p><p id="p_221">135). Omission to inform the authorities promptly does not constitute him

an accomplice. An accused is a person who has concurred in the

commission of an offence. Since all of them were followers of the same

„Organisation‟ at one time, their association with the appellants during the

relevant period cannot be taken incriminating to discredit their testimonies

and entangle them in the cobweb of the conspiracy. They appear to be

victims of circumstances. They were used by the appellants. They did not

know the nature of conspiracy hatched by the accused persons. Their

nothing by telling falsehood.

perpetrators of the crime. Specific and direct questions were put to the

appellants‟ counsel during arguments to elaborate and explain as to with

whom these witnesses were in „conspiracy‟ and what was its design or

purpose. The appellants had no answer to it.

them jointly with the accused persons on 03.05.1976. This application was

dismissed then and there as the Trial Court was not competent to take any

such cognizance. It appears that the appellant did not challenge the order

further. The contents of the application rather lend credence to the

prosecution case whereby the appellants did not deny „conspiracy‟ in

attacking CJI. Their only grievance was as to why these witnesses were

not made accused along with them and why they were taken as witnesses.

<p id="p_226">140.         It is well settled that all accessories before the fact, if they

that reason investigating agencies as well as the Court try to ascertain as

to what was the motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime in

question while examining his complicity. In a case which is based upon

circumstantial evidence, motive for committing the crime on the part of

the accused assumes greater importance. The Trial Court in para 103 of

the judgment has dealt with this circumstance extensively and was of the

definite view that A-1 and A-3 had strong and clear motive to commit the

crime. Both, A-1 and A-3 were unflinchingly committed followers of the

„Organisation‟ whose head / founder / preceptor to whom they considered

applications and transfer petition by the Bench headed by CJI. Evidence

has come on record that A-1 developed the belief that so long as

Sh.A.N.Ray (CJI) was the head of the judiciary, peaceful and legal means

would not secure release of Anand Murti and that armed revolution was

the only way to get him released. He developed a vengeful attitude

towards the CJI. This prejudice and hatred impelled A-1 to take the

extreme step. Apparently, the target of the dastardly intrigue was CJI.

PW-Vikram was categorical to depose that even on March 20, in the

morning, before leaving Raj Singh‟s house A-1 had told him and A-3 that

CJI was „Mahapapi‟ and that he had rejected the bail and transfer

applications of Anand Murti and that it would be difficult to secure the

release of Anand Murti so long as he was CJI and therefore, he had to be

finished off. The prosecution placed on record copies (Ex.P98 to Ex.P100)

of the relevant documents from the records of the Supreme Court to show

that CJI headed different Benches who dismissed the bail applications of

Anand Murti and transfer petition during the period March 25, 1974 and

October 30, 1974. Being a dedicated follower of the „Organisation‟ and

having complete faith in the head of the „Organisation‟, it was the earnest

desire of A-1 to get him released from detention at the earliest. The

 attempts to get him released on bail or to get the matter transferred did not

yield any result. It impelled A-1 even without taking into confidence the

„Organisation‟ to hatch conspiracy with Vikram, A-3 and other followers

of the „Organisation‟ to plan and attack CJI to get rid of him. For that end

in mind, he in various meetings exhorted Vikram, A-3 and others to resort

to armed revolution and even deputed them to procure arms. The planed

conspiracy came to be executed on March 20, 1975 by them.

      could go to Supreme Court unhindered to watch the proceedings in

      open Court. The entry to the Supreme Court premises was not

      regulated as is the practice prevalent now-a-days. The Court room

(b)          Circumstance No.2 :<p id="p_232">


</p><p id="p_233">144.         Appreciation of evidence led the Trial Court to conclude that

A-1 and A-3 performed journey on March 25, 1975 after A-2 reserved

berth in a three tier sleeper coach and a seat in a sitting compartment in

the fictitious names of „Pankaj Kumar‟ and „Ramesh Kumar‟, respectively


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 160 of 201</span>
 on March 15 &amp; 21, 1975 vide requisition slips Ex.P23 and Ex.P25. The

Trial Court was of the view that this circumstance confirmed that A-2 had

knowledge of the crime and carried out the job assigned by the co-

conspirators.
</p>
<p id="p_234">145.            This circumstance even if taken correct would not be

sufficient to infer hatching of conspiracy by A-2 with co-convicts.

Undoubtedly, the prosecution produced clinching evidence to establish

reservation of tickets by A-2 in the fictitious names of „Pankaj Kumar‟

and „Ramesh Kumar‟ on March 15 and 21, 1975, respectively, which

facilitated A-1 and A-3 to escape out of Delhi. The prosecution was

however unable to collect credible evidence as to at whose instance the

tickets were reserved by A-2. There is no evidence on record to infer that

these reservations were done at the behest of only A-1. A-1 and A-3 were

not in Delhi on March 15, 1975. Nothing is discernible if A-1 used to

remain in constant touch or contact with A-2. As per Vikram‟s statement,

A-1 had left Delhi after the incident of self-immolation. He avoided his

arrest and was declared Proclaimed Offender. Vikram and A-3 were

arrested for contravention of the prohibitory orders on April 24, 1973.

After release from jail, Vikram went back to Jaipur around June, 1973 and

returned to Delhi in the end of June, 1974. On July 01 or 02, 1974, he was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                              Page 161 of 201</span>
 able to spot A-1 in South Extension market in disquised appearance.

Vikram and A-3 left Patna by Assam Express on March 18, and arrived in

Delhi on March 19, 1975 at about 06.00 P.M. A-1 was already in Delhi. It

is unclear on which particular date and by which mode, A-1 arrived in

Delhi. No evidence emerged if after coming to Delhi on or before March

15,1975, A-1 contacted / instructed A-2 to reserve tickets in unreal names,

and if so, at what time and at which place. The prosecution did not

produce any evidence to ascertain A-1‟s movements after his arrival in

Delhi. It is not the prosecution case that A-1 had stayed with A-2 at his

residence. A-2 has offered plausible / reasonable explanation that A-1‟s

„parokar‟ who used to handle his cases had requested him to get the

tickets reserved for A-1. The reason to reserve tickets in the name of fake

individuals was to conceal A-1‟s identity and consequently his

apprehension by police. Admitted position is that the Government had

already banned the „Organisation‟. Since A-1 was avoiding police,

reservation of tickets in fictitious names cannot be considered an unusual

circumstance.
</p>
<p id="p_235">146.         The crucial aspect is that only „one‟ ticket was reserved in the

name of „Pankaj Kumar‟ on March 15, 1975 for A-1‟s travel to Hawrah

on March 25, 1975. Another ticket for A-3 was reserved on March 21,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 162 of 201</span>
 1975. As per prosecution, the purpose of reservation of the tickets was to

provide an escape route to A-1 and A-3 who were instrumental in

throwing the hand-grenades on CJI pursuant to the conspiracy hatched by

them. The charges were of hatching criminal conspiracy by all the

appellants and Vikram who subsequently turned approver. None of them

was a suspect on March 20, 1975 and even before the date, investigation

was taken over by CBI. Pursuant to the said conspiracy, the hand-

grenades were thrown by A-1 and A-3 in the car. Vikram who had

accompanied A-3 from Patna on March 19, 1975 had no intention to stay

in Delhi after execution of the plan and he went to Patna by Upper India

Express from Ghaziabad same evening. Had A-2 been aware of the

conspiracy as alleged, he must have booked tickes for Vikram and A-3

also along with A-1 on March 15, 1975 itself. It is unclear as to why no

reservation of ticket whatsoever was done for escape of Vikram who was

equally responsible to execute the planned conspiracy. A-1 and A-3 were

not expected to leave Vikram unprotected in Delhi to expose them on his

arrest. The prosecution has not explained as to why A-2 who allegedly

hatched conspiracy to attack and murder CJI did not get tickets reserved

for escape of Vikram. A-2 was not aware that subsequently Vikram would

turn approver.

</p><p id="p_237"> 147.         There is no evidence if A-1, A-3 and Vikram were ever seen

in close association with A-2 any time. Admitted position is that A-2

though lived in Delhi never assisted co-convicts in procuring any hide-

outs during their visits to Delhi; he was never asked to procure any arms

or ammunitions to accomplish the mission; he never made available any

weapon to the co-convicts. It is also admitted position that A-2 did not

provide any logistics to the assailants on the day of occurrence. The

prosecution did not ascertain A-2‟s presence on March 20, 1975 when the

conspiracy was executed i.e. whether he was in Supreme Court

performing his duties as a lawyer or was somewhere else. There is no

evidence if A-2 was in touch with co-convicts on the day of incident or

was conveyed the information in any manner about the attempt made on

the life of CJI. Admittedly, none of the culprit went to A-2 for shelter.

Post-event conduct of A-2 does not show if he attempted to abscond from

Delhi. A-2 was not a suspect before A-1‟s arrest. When CBI raided A-2‟s

residence in July, 1975 he was available in the house with his family.

Nothing incriminating was recovered to ascertain his involvement or

participation in the crime. A-2 had no contact or meetings with A-1 and

A-3 any time after the incident.

„Organisation‟ at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi, but denied his

acquaintance with A-1 though he represented him as a lawyer in self-

that the prosecution produced convincing evidence that A-2 was an Anand

Margi at the relevant time and was frequent visitor to D-41, South

Extension Part-I, New Delhi, where A-1 and Vikram used to reside and

work for the „Organisation‟ for Anand Marg Publication. In para (120), it

charge of criminal conspiracy.
</p>
<p id="p_242">150.         A-2 has given reasonable explanation for denial to be Anand

Margi as it was a banned „Organisation‟ at that time and he feared arrest

during Emergency era when MISA / DIR provisions were in vogue. Even

an admission to be the member of the „Organisation‟ per se would not

have strengthened the prosecution case as the „Organisation‟ itself was not

a suspect. It is true that there is ample evidence on record to prove that A-

2 knew A-1 and admittedly, represented him as a lawyer in self-

immolation case. A-2 had no reasons to deny his acquaintance with A-1.

However, mere denial is not enough in the absence of any other

incriminating material showing his knowledge or complicity in the crime.

A-2 do not establish his involvement in the conspiracy. A-2 admitted his

visits on rare occasions to D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi, for

participation in its rituals. Failure to admit to be an Anand Margi thus

cannot be used an incriminating factor against him. Mere membership of a

make an otherwise innocuous factor an incriminating circumstance‟.

Gilani also came forward with a false version that the remark soon after

the incident was made in the context of a domestic quarrel. The Supreme

Court observed "....We can only say that his conduct, which is not only

</p>
<p id="p_252">157.         In para 112, the Trial Court observed that as in the case of A-

1 and A-3, the prosecution produced equally convincing evidence about

A-2, that being a staunch Anand Margi at the relevant time, he too looked

upon Anandmurti as God-Almighty. The Court concluded that "ït would

be reasonable to believe that Anandmurti‟s dentention and the rejection of

his bail applications by the Chief Justice of India and other Hon‟ble

Judges must have triggered off equally strong feelings in A-2 against the

Chief Justice of India."

<p id="p_253">158.         A-2‟s visits to D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and

his representing some Anandmargies in various cases as a lawyer cannot

be taken to show that he had knowledge or complicity in the crime. The

prosecution was unable to prove or establish A-2‟s motive to join the

conspiracy. The prosecution witnesses have given statements regarding

outburst of A-1 and instigation by him to indulge in armed revolution on

various dates. However, there is no evidence if any time, A-2 exhorted

anyone to have recourse to violence after dismissal of the bail applications

 of his „Guru‟. The prosecution was unable to prove any direct association

of A-2 with A-1 in this regard. Gist of the offence is agreement to break

the law. The unlawful agreement and not its accomplishment is the

essence of crime of conspiracy. Mere knowledge or even discussion of the

plan is not per se enough. Those who do not form the requisite intention

cannot be roped in as conspirator on the basis of mere knowledge unless

they commit acts or omissions from which a guilty „intention‟ can be

inferred. The findings recorded by the Trial Court referred above are not

based upon any clinching evidence. These are assumptions. There is no

evidence that at any stage A-2 was agitated over the rejection of the bail.

          observations: (at paragraph 662)

          "In reaching the stage of meeting of minds, two or
          more persons share information about doing an illegal
          act or a legal act by illegal means. This is the first
          stage where each is said to have knowledge of a plan
          for committing an illegal act or a legal act by illegal
          means. Among those sharing the information some or
          all may form an intention to do an illegal act or a legal
          act by illegal means. Those who do form the requisite
          intention would be parties to the agreement and would
          be conspirators but those who drop out cannot be
          roped in as collaborators on the basis of mere
          knowledge unless they commit acts or omissions from
          which a guilty common intention can be inferred. It is
          not necessary that all the conspirators should
          participate from the inception to the end of the
          conspiracy; some may join the conspiracy after the
          time when such intention was first entertained by any
          one of them and some others may quit from the
          conspiracy. All of them cannot but be treated as
          conspirators. Where in pursuance of the agreement the
          conspirators commit offences individually or adopt
          illegal means to do a legal act which has a nexus to the
          object of conspiracy, all of them will be liable for such
          offences even if some of them have not actively
          participated in the commission of those offences.

          well known rule governing circumstantial evidence is
          that each and every incriminating circumstance must

          the occurrence can be proved to decide about the
          complicity of the accused. (vide <a href="/doc/1136663/" id="a_179">Esher Singh v. State of

          cumulative effect of the proved circumstances should
          be taken into account in determining the guilt of the
          accused rather than adopting an isolated approach to
          each of the circumstances. Of course, each one of the
          circumstances should be proved beyond reasonable
          doubt. Lastly, in regard to the appreciation of evidence
          relating to conspiracy, the Court must take care to see
          that the acts or conduct of the parties must be
          conscious and clear enough to infer their concurrence
          as to the common design and its execution. K.J. Shetty,

Shaukat two or three days prior to 13th December. The Supreme Court

observed "that there is no evidence to the effect that Gilani was

maintaining personal or telephonic contacts with any of the deceased

terrorists. There is no evidence of any participative acts in connection

with or in pursuance of the conspiracy. He was not connected with the

procurement of hideouts, chemicals and other incriminating articles used

by the terrorists. Speaking from the point of view of probabilities and the

natural course of conduct there is apparent reason why Gilani would have

been asked to join the conspiracy. It is not the case of prosecution that he

tendered any advice or gave important tips / information relevant to the

proposed attack on Parliament. None of the circumstances would lead to

an inference beyond reasonable doubt of Gilani‟s involvement in the

conspiracy."

appellants‟ counsel that the investigation was unfair, biased and tainted.

 Serious allegations were leveled against CBI officials including DSP

B.R.Puri to be instrumental in the false implication of the appellants. He

urged that from the day CBI started investigation i.e. 30.06.1975, it knew

that A-1, A-3 and Vikram were involved in the attack of CJI. This fact

was entertained by various CBI investigators especially, PW-71

(B.R.Puri), DSP, CBI, who was already involved in the investigation of

various cases relating to the „Organisation‟ including Anand Murti‟s case

and L.N.Misra case. DSP B.R.Puri was absolutely prejudiced against

workers of the „Organisation‟ and therefore, influenced the Chief

Investigating Officer to involve them. Refuting the arguments, CBI

counsel urged that the investigation was carried out honestly, fairly and

transparently. All the relevant facts for the just and fair decision of the

case were brought before the Trial Court. Fairness of the prosecution is

apparent from the circumstance that despite arrest of Gopalji and

Mahender Pratap Singh, they were not prosecuted for deficiency of

sufficient material. Mr.Abrol, who was arrested by Crime Branch of Delhi

Police was discharged when his role was not found in this case.

</p><p id="p_277">169.         The witnesses from the Police Department cannot per-se be

said to be untruthful or unreliable. It would depend upon the veracity,

credibility and un-impeachability of their testimonies. In „Tahir Vs. State

 (Delhi)‟, AIR 1996 SC 3079, Supreme Court observed „where the

evidence of the police officials, after careful scrutiny, inspires confidence

and is found to be trustworthy and reliable, it can form basis of conviction

and the absence of some independent witness of the locality to lend

corroboration to their evidence, does not in any way affect the credit

worthiness of the prosecution case.'

</p><p id="p_278">170.         In the instant case, it is significant to note that in the

searching cross-examination, none of the official witnesses has given

conflicting or evasive statements or shifted his stand. When their

testimonies have not been varied from any spectrum, there are no valid

reasons to discard it. No infirmity attaches to the testimonies of police

officials merely because they belong to the force. In this case, CBI came

into picture at a subsequent stage after the commission of crime on March

20, 1975. CBI was able to reach to the witnesses on the basis of

documentary proof with them. These witnesses including PWs-Charan

Singh, Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv Raj Singh, etc. independent witnesses from

public having no personal vendetta with the appellants were associated in

the investigation and they had no ostensible reasons to favour CBI. CBI

succeeded to unearth the deep-rooted conspiracy and collected vital

information which was hitherto unknown to it. None of the CBI officials
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 184 of 201</span>
 had any personal animosity with any of the appellants to falsely implicate

them. Number of witnesses who deposed against the appellants were not

expected to implicate them at CBI‟s instance. Those witnesses were

committed followers of the „Organisation‟ and the appellants were in

close association with them. The prosecution case does not rest on the sole

testimonies of police officials but is based upon various other

incriminating circumstances including the statement of PW-Vikram who

turned approver and deposed against the appellants.

</p><p id="p_279">171.         At no stage during investigation or trial or soon thereafter,

any complaint was lodged against any of the CBI officials for their

partisan investigation. No request was ever made for change of any

specific CBI Investigating Officer. There are no sound reasons to

disbelieve the statements of the police / CBI officials. PW-71 (B.R.Puri)

conducted investigation on few dates and his credibility remained

unchallenged in the cross-examination.

<p id="p_280">   (ii)      Criminal conspiracy

</p><p id="p_281">172.         There is clear proof that A-1 and A-3 specifically intended to

accomplish the aims of conspiracy by resort to violence. The law relating

to criminal conspiracy has been discussed extensively in the impugned

judgment and needs no further elaboration. I am in agreement with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 185 of 201</span>
 learned Counsel for the appellants that under <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_182">Section 120</a> A IPC, offence

of criminal conspiracy is committed when two or more persons agree to

do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal act by illegal means.

Unlawful agreement is the gist or essence of the offence of conspiracy.

The offence takes place with the meeting of minds even if nothing further

is done. It is not in dispute that once the object of conspiracy is achieved,

any subsequent act which though unlawful, would not make the accused a

part of the conspiracy. Criminal conspiracy is generally hatched in private

or in secrecy. It is rarely possible to establish it by direct evidence. The

offence can be proved by adducing circumstantial evidence or by

necessary implication. Both, the existence of the conspiracy and its object

have to be inferred from the circumstances and the conduct of the

accused. Criminal conspiracy is a partnership in crime and that there is in

each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the prosecution of a common

plan. A man may join a conspiracy by word or by deed. However,

criminal responsibility for a conspiracy requires more than a merely

passive attitude towards an existing conspiracy. Mere knowledge or

discussion or generation of a crime in the mind of the accused is not

sufficient. Learned CBI counsel agrees that <a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_183">Section 10</a> of the Evidence

Act has been restricted to the continuance of the conspiracy. Any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_185">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 186 of 201</span>
 statement made by a conspirator after the conspiracy is over or after the

conspirator is arrested by the police, shall be outside the purview of

<a href="/doc/1946503/" id="a_184">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_282">173.         In   the   instant   case,   the   prosecution   has   adduced

overwhelming evidence coupled with statement of PW-Vikram, who

turned approver to prove various incriminating circumstances. The

prosecution has also relied upon extra judicial confessions. From the

evidence enumerated above, inference can safely be drawn that A-1

developed a feeling that CJI was responsible for the continuous detention

of Baba Anandmurti due to rejection of bail applications repeatedly and

declining to transfer the case. He himself was absconding in the self-

immolation case; had given up his usual dress to conceal identity and

roamed in a disguised appearance. Even his close associates PW-Vikram

and PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia were unable to recognize him at first instance.

A-1 was the kingpin / mastermind of the conspiracy. He developed

unfounded feeling that Baba could not be released from jail having

recourse to legal means and decided to resort to violent means. For that

end in mind, he instigated / exhorted the followers of the „Organisation‟ to

procure arms. In various meetings, in which PW-Vikram and A-3

participated, A-1‟s refrain throughout was to go for armed revolution. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_186">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                 Page 187 of 201</span>
 associated PW-Vikram, the stanch follower of the „Organisation‟, who

from his heart wanted release of Baba to whom he considered incarnation

of God by all means. He put himself at A-1‟s disposal and agreed to do

what he desired; even to sacrifice his life. A-3 was also joined in the

conspiracy. A-3 and PW- Vikram travelled from Patna to Delhi, where A-

1 had already arrived to execute the plan. A-3 carried hand-grenades in a

bag. Evidence has come on record that on March 20, 1975, in the

morning, A-1 shared the minute details of the conspiracy and assigned

specific role to PW-Vikram and A-3 in its execution. They all surveyed

the area in the morning. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.30 P.M., A-1, A-

3 and PW-Vikram played active role to achieve the object of conspiracy.

An unsuccessful attempt was made by them to hurl hand-grenades in the

car in which CJI was travelling. The subsequent acts referred above

further lead to the inference that A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram were part of

the conspiracy. A-1 and A-3 travelled under fictitious names to leave

Delhi showing unnatural and unreasonable conduct relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_185">Section

8</a> of the Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_283">174.         A-1 had taken assistance of PW-Vikram and A-3 to get

release Baba by illegal means and had exhorted them to procure arms in

various meetings much prior to its execution on March 20, 1975. It is not

 necessary to precisely mention the starting point of conspiracy in the FIR /

Charge-sheet as it is difficult to spell out with exactutude the details

relating to the starting point of conspiracy. Nontheless A-1 divulged about

the exact conspiracy and the minute plan how it was to be executed in the

morning of March 20, 1975 to PW-Vikram and A-3. Under Section 120

A, it is not necessary that the agreement to do an illegal act must be

entered into by all the conspirators at the same time. It is not required that

each member of the conspiracy should be a member from the inception of

the scheme. The scheme may be conceived by one person and others may

join or agree to be part of it subsequently. It is not required that every

member of the conspiracy should know the identity of all or other

members of the conspiracy. It is also not necessary for the accused to

know the detailed stages of conspiracy; mere knowledge of main object or

purpose of conspiracy would suffice. In „<a href="/doc/594532/" id="a_186">Vikram Singh vs. State of

Punjab</a>‟, AIR 2010 SC 1007, Supreme Court dealt with a case where the

accused had purchased Fortwin injection and Chloroform. It was held that

since the purchase of these materials was an initial step towards the

commission of the offence, the presence of accused Sonia though not

referred by the witnesses at the time of actual kidnapping would not imply

that she was not a privi to the conspiracy. In the case in hand, A-3 and

 PW-Vikram were aware about the conspiracy hatched by A-1 on March

20, 1975, in the morning. Without objecting to it, they voluntarily

participated in it and played their respective role in its execution.

</p><p id="p_284">             As discussed above, the prosecution was not able to establish

if A-2 had knowledge of the said conspiracy or had participated in it in

any manner. PW-Vikram and other prosecution witnesses examined by

the prosecution did not attribute any overt act to A-2 in the conspiracy.

</p>
<p id="p_286">175.         A-1 and A-3 did not offer plausible explanation to the

incriminating circumstances appearing against them and did not produce

cogent, reliable and credible defence evidence to falsify / rebut the

positive testimonies of prosecution witnesses. A-1 and A-3 took up the

stand of complete denial of their involvement in the crime and offered no

satisfactory explanation to the incriminating circumstance proved against

them in their 313 statements. There was no occasion for them to deny

every material piece of evidence as well as not to give any explanation

when they were specifically asked for. Despite ample evidence on record

they denied their presence in Delhi on the fateful day or soon before that.

They even tried to implicate prosecution witnesses Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv

Raj Singh, Raj Singh as accomplices / conspirators. They did not present

 any specific defence to falsify the positive testimonies of the prosecution

witnesses emerging against them. They gave conflicting suggestions. A-1

in his 313 statement admitted himself to be Editor of the „PROUT‟ while

denying his stay at D-41, South Ext. Part-I, New Delhi. He further

claimed that he did not visit Delhi after he left in March, 1973. He,

however, was conspicuously evasive as to where he used to stay in Delhi

and at what particular place he lived / stayed after March, 1973. He did

not reveal as to where he was on March 20, 1975. He even denied his

acquaintance with A-2 though admittedly he met him in jail on September

10, 1975 and represented him in a criminal case. He alleged that after his

arrest on June 17, 1975 at Patna, he was tortured in several ways. But it is

unexplained as to why he did not lodge any complaint before the Judicial

Magistrate before whom he was produced for remand. No physical injury

was noticed by the Judicial Magistrate on his body. A-1 did not claim that

PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia, PW-Shiv Raj Singh and PW-Raj Singh were their

accomplices and had deposed against them at CBI‟s instance or they were

defectors.
</p>
<p id="p_287">176.         Similar are the evasive replies of A-3. He also came up with

the plea that after he left Delhi at the end of 1970, he never returned there.

He too did not divulge where he lived thereafter and where was his

acquaintance and familiarity with PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia and PW-Vikram;

his arrest along with PW-Vikram on July 24, 1975 at Bhagalpur. He did

not reveal how and for what purpose he was with Vikram. He also never

lodged any complaint to Judicial Magistrate for alleged physical and

mental torture during custody. None of them examined any witness in

defence to prove „alibi‟.

<p id="p_288">   (iv)      Acquittal of Ram Nagina Prasad

</p><p id="p_289">177.         Learned counsel for the appellants urged that similar charge

under <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_188">Section 4</a> (b) <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_189">Explosive Substances Act</a> 1908 was framed against

Ram Nagina Prasad who has since been acquitted. By no stretch of

imagination, the said charge can be deemed to have been proved against

A-3 since his presence at Icchapur (West Bengal) has not been proved at

all. It would be risky to rely on the same set of evidence to base

conviction of the appellants. Case of the appellants cannot be decided on

any other scale and they should have been treated at par for giving benefit

of doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_290">178.         Acquittal of co-accused Ram Nagina Prasad would not

automatically lead to the acquittal of the appellants. Since the evidence

against Ram Nagina Prasad was lacking he was acquitted of the charges.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_191">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                               Page 192 of 201</span>
 So far A-1 and A-3 are concerned, they stand on different footings. In

their case, the prosecution has produced clinching evidence to establish

their guilt whereby in the execution of the conspiracy, they threw hand-

grenades Ex.A-3 and Ex.A-4 along with their associate PW-Vikram on

March 20, 1975 in an unsuccessful attempt on the lives of occupants of

the car. It was specifically mentioned / disclosed in the charges framed

against them that they threw „hand-grenades‟. It is reasonable to infer that

they were in possession of the explosives without licence illegally soon

before using in the attack in Delhi. Apparently, omission to set out the

said charge distinctly is inconsequential as no prejudice is shown to have

caused to the appellants. The appellants were aware of the substance of

the charge from the very inception. Neither the appellants were misled nor

any prejudice, which has occasioned in failure of justice, has been caused

to them. Moreover, no such plea was taken before the Trial Court any

time. They never objected to the charges framed against them. At no stage

during trial, they complained of any prejudice. Error in the charges about

possession of Explosives only at Ichhapur and not in Delhi also is not

fatal. They can be held liable for being in possession of the explosive

substance. The charge in question contained two heads, one relating to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_192">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 193 of 201</span>
 possession at Icchapur and other use of explosives on March 20, 1975 at

Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_291">179.         Merely because some of the accused persons have been

acquitted, does not lead as a necessary corollary that those who have been

convicted must also be acquitted. If after sieving the untruth or

unacceptable portion of the evidence residue is sufficient to prove the

guilt of the accused, there is no legal impediment in convicting a person

on the evidence which has been primarily disbelieved vis a vis others. It is

always open to the Court to differentiate the accused who had been

acquitted from those who were convicted. Acquittal of some of the

accused does not necessarily result in acquittal of the rest. Hence,

acquittal of Ram Nagina Prasad for the reasons in the impugned judgment

is of no benefit to the appellants against whom the prosecution has

produced credible evidence to the hilt.
</p>
<p id="p_292">(m)          Conclusion

</p><p id="p_293">180.         In the light of above discussion, I am of the view that the

prosecution has successfully proved beyond reasonable doubt all the facts

and circumstances by convincing evidence which directly point towards

the involvement of A-1 and A-3 in the conspiracy to make an attempt on

the life of CJI. The conclusion of guilt of A-1 and A-3 is fully established
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_193">Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 &amp; 436/1976                                Page 194 of 201</span>
 and all the facts and circumstances so established are consistent with the

hypothesis of their guilt. The proved facts and circumstances completely

form a chain which go only to prove that A-1 and A-3 had committed the

crime and there is no other hypothesis except indicating that the A-1 and

A-3 conspired to commit the murder of CJI and in pursuance to the same,

they attempted on his life on March 20, 1975 by throwing hand-grenades

in his car. From the evidence, it is proved beyond doubt that only one

view is emerging and it is that the A-1 and A-3 were guilty of committing

the offence. Minor discrepancies, exaggerations and improvements

highlighted by the appellants‟ counsel do not shake the basic structure of

the prosecution case in the presence of overwhelming evidence against

them. These so called lapses cannot be allowed to defeat the course of

justice. No major lacuna in the investigation which was not restricted to

Delhi was noticed. Attempt has been made to suggest that all witnesses

including police officials, CBI personnel, experts and followers of

„Organisation‟ had conspired against the appellants and they have been

falsely implicated. No reason exists to draw such a conclusion. It is

unbelievable that everyone would need without any ulterior motive to

implicate the appellants in a false case.

when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences. The Court

punishments would consist of imprisonment to commence the one after

the expiration of the other in such order as the Court may direct subject to

rigorous imprisonment imposed on the accused for twenty years in

          Thus if the sentences are to run consecutively the
          sentence would exceed 14 years. In view of the legal
          position, the substantive sentences awarded to the
          Appellant are directed to run concurrently. In the facts
          of the case I am not inclined to reduce the fine amounts
