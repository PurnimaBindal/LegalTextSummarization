                 <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_6">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act. One of the main contention in the objections is that,

                 there are several Government Poramboke lands, temple lands situated on the

                 northern side, which will be easy to acquire for the State government to expand

                 the road. Further the acquisition proposal is vitiated by partiality and the

                 residents on the one side of the road were deprived of their entire properties and

                 this has been done with certain vested interests. Thereafter, no proceedings have

                 been initiated and all of sudden, the petitioners received notice dated 14.08.2015

                 as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_7">Section 19(2)</a> of the Act, called upon the petitioners for

                 Section (1), the government will have to show cause to the owner calling upon

                 the owner as to why the land should not be acquired. Therefore, the government

                 contemplates two notices, in which one is a personal notice to the owners or the

                                 decision in Jayaraman. But the observation is that

                                 case relating to R.Moorthy. The reason that can
                                 be culled out from reading of the above mentioned
                                 paragraphs and other relevant paragraphs of the

                                 said Writ Petitioners was also identical to that of
                                 the submissions made before us. While rejecting
                                 the said submission, it was held that the Act
                                 cannot be read and interpreted to mean that it
                                 does not empower the Government or the
                                 competent   authority    to    acquire      lands,     for

                                 road, unless and until, a road has been declared
                                 as Highways, under <a href="/doc/1163443/" id="a_79">Section 3</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_80">The Act</a>
                                 manifestly states that for the purpose of
                                 construction, maintenance or development of any
                                 highway lands can be acquired. <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_81">The Act</a> provides
                                 for construction of a highway. It provides for
                                 maintenance. An existing road can also be
                                 declared as State Highways, and developed. For
                                 the purpose of construction of a highway,
                                 maintenance, development, and in sum and
                                 substance, for the purpose of giving effect to the
                                 Act, all acts can be done by the competent
                                 authorities, which includes acquisition of lands
                                 also.”
                 Therefore, the acquisition proceedings initiated by the respondents cannot be

                 faulted and the contention advanced by the petitioners is devoid of merits. The

                 acquisition is for the benefits of the public at large and therefore, this Court

                 cannot interdict such proceedings in doing so, extraordinary reasons must exist.

                 of the Rules, on the date of hearing the objectors and the requisition body will

                 be heard. If evidence is required, the same will have to be recorded. Thereafter,
