<p id="p_2">1.    This petition, under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>,

1996 has been filed by the petitioner seeking interim relief against the

respondent, an employee of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The facts in a nutshell are as follows: The petitioner is a company



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                 OMP 241/2008                             Page 1 of 32</span>
 incorporated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and is one of

the leading institutes in imparting education and knowledge in the field of

financial services. The objective of the petitioner is to educate and develop

professionals for the securities industry in India, to disseminate information

about Indian capital markets by creating a comprehensive body of knowledge

and to contribute to the healthy development of securities market by bringing

expertise to bear on structural and policy issues concerning the securities

industry. The petitioner is also an authorized education provider of the

Financial Planner Standards Board, India (FPSB) for the Certified Financial

Planner (CFP) professional education programme in India. Details of the

courses/materials developed by the petitioner and the advertisements of the

courses offered by the petitioner since 2005 are annexed with the petition as

Annexure P-2.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    In the course of its business, the petitioner appointed the respondent as a

faculty member. The respondent was to be responsible for the development of

the petitioner's study material and teaching methodology so as to ensure that it

remained most suitable, relevant and always ahead of others. The respondent

accordingly executed an employment agreement dated 08.09.2006 (Annexure

P-3), thereby agreeing to the following among other terms and conditions:

</p><p id="p_5">           "(i) He shall be responsible for imparting 'Total Quality
           Teaching', the objective of the company by employing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                 OMP 241/2008                                Page 2 of 32</span>
 sandardized methods of teaching in the financial markets.
He shall be devoting full time without any constraint and
attention to all specified functions with day-to-day teaching
and support keeping the students' need in mind from all
perspectives and will also impart practical training at its
best. He shall be required to be at his work till regular
office hours or till the completion of day's work, without any
time constraint and may also be required to come on
Sunday for disposal of his duties as per the need of the
organization.
</p>
<p id="p_6">(ii)   He shall also design and upgrade the courses and
teaching and other course contents and also management
courses as per the main objectives of the company. The
services promised to the students shall be delivered at its
best. He shall also be contributing towards general
administration and executive help, as required. Besides,
management can assign other incidental works from time to
time, as per the need, to fulfil the objectives of BIFM.

</p><p id="p_7">(iii) He shall exhibit his high quality of competency,
commitment and initiation while performing his job and will
maintain a cordial environment, without which the objective
of BIFM would suffer irreparable loss. Hence the employee
assures BIFM for his best of the best efforts in the said
regard.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(iv) Since the mission of BIFM is a long term process
where the commitment for a longer period is required,
hence the employee commits to serve the BIFM for a
period of 5 years, taken as employment period wherein
there is no exit for a minimum period of 3 (three) years.
During the course of his stay and thereafter, the employee
further undertakes to maintain complete integrity,
confidentiality, not to leak, divulge, share or misuse any of
the business secrets, secrecy related to software &amp;
tampering or hacking strategies, plans etc. with any third
party or for himself for any oblique motive.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(v)   He shall maintain high standards of decorum and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">      OMP 241/2008                                Page 3 of 32</span>
          sense of discipline among the students befitting the image of
         a good financial education body. Further he shall not
         indulge himself in any alliance or front or politics among
         the staff members/students, including subordination.

</p><p id="p_10">         (vi) That at any stage if it is observed by BIFM that the
         employee is not performing his duties as per the terms and
         conditions of his agreement, then BIFM reserves its right to
         take appropriate disciplinary/official action against the
         employee. If the company wishes to terminate his services, it
         can do so by serving one month notice or salary in lieu
         thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         (vii) The salary revision/increment will be done on yearly
         basis. It shall be done depending upon the competence,
         performance, achievements, behavior, discipline, etc. and
         upon the sole contribution towards the growth of the
         company. Decision relating to increment shall be taken by
         compensation committee, headed by the Chairman of BIFM.

</p><p id="p_12">         (viii) He shall work with the company for 5 years with 3
         years as minimum compulsory period, but in case of some
         extra ordinary situation, if he decides to quit his job after
         the completion of the compulsory period, then he can do
         so by serving a prior notice of at least 6 months in writing
         to the company.
</p>
<p id="p_13">         (ix) Both the parties shall endeavour to resolve all the
         disputes amicably and in good faith, through mutual
         dialogue. However, all disputes which fail to resolve in that
         manner shall be subject to arbitration by a sole arbitrator
         appointed by the Chairman of the company, and to be
         conducted as per the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996
         at Delhi only."
</p>
<p id="p_14">4.   It is averred in the petition that the respondent was initially involved in

redesigning and restructuring the course content of Stock Market and

Trading Operation, a 4 month diploma programme, for which he had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">               OMP 241/2008                                 Page 4 of 32</span>
 prepared the handouts and study materials, with the help and suggestion of the

petitioner, for the students. With the growing competition in the financial

sector, however, the respondent approached the petitioner with the suggestion

of launching a few more specialized courses in order to counter the

competition faced by the petitioner. Relying solely upon the assurances and

recommendations of the respondent, the petitioner agreed to launch new course

curricula after spending considerable amount on infrastructure to the tune more

than 100 lakhs. The statement of expenses is attached with the petition as

Annexure P-4. The specialized courses upon which the respondent began his

exercise were: "Security Analysis and Portfolio Management", "Post

Graduate Diploma in Wealth Management and Planning" and

"Derivative Content and Investment Technique".
</p>
<p id="p_15">5.    The petitioner alleges that the respondent, knowing fully well that he

was holding one of the key positions in the Institute, steadily used it as a

weapon to extort money from the petitioner. He approached the petitioner in

the month of April, 2007 and asked for a salary hike along with other non-

monetary benefits, otherwise he would resign. This, despite the agreement

dated 08.09.2006, wherein it was agreed between the parties that the salary

revision of the respondent would become due upon completion of one year of

service. Such was the pressure put by the respondent on the petitioner that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                 OMP 241/2008                               Page 5 of 32</span>
 petitioner was left with no other option than to accept his unfair demand and

by letter dated 14.04.2007, the respondent's salary was increased from

Rs.30,000/- per month to Rs.47,000/- per month, besides other benefits,

effective from April, 2007. The respondent was also given the liberty of

flexible working hours, as demanded by him. It was, however, agreed that the

next salary revision would be on the annual basis during the defined

employment period with an incremental bracket of 7.5% - 15%. A copy of the

letter dated 14.04.2007 is enclosed with the petition as Annexure P-5.

</p><p id="p_16">6.    In consideration of the aforesaid, the respondent agreed vide letter

of the same date, i.e., 14.04.2007, that during the period of his stay with

the petitioner, he will not engage directly or indirectly in any business or

associate himself in any capacity with any organization dealing in stock

market/capital market/financial market education institute or serve

whether as principal, agent, partner or employee or in any other capacity,

either full time or part time, in any business whatsoever other than that of

the company.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7.    On 03.10.2007, however, the respondent in gross violation            of the

agreement dated 08.09.2006 , wherein he agreed to serve the company for a

period of 5 years with 3 years of minimum compulsory period, tendered his

resignation vide e-mail dated 3.10.2007 (Annexure P-6). In response to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                 OMP 241/2008                               Page 6 of 32</span>
 aforesaid e-mail of the respondent dated 3.10.2007, the petitioner sent an e-

mail dated 4.10.2007, that his resignation could not be accepted and called him

to discuss the cause of his resignation with an assurance that all the concerns of

the respondent would be resolved once for all (Annexure P-7).

</p><p id="p_18">8.     On 13.10.2007, the respondent was called for a meeting to discuss the

issues with regard to his resignation and to the utter shock and surprise of the

petitioner, the respondent informed the petitioner that he would call back his

resignation if he was given an increment of another Rs.50,000/- per month. He

also demanded that he be upgraded and designated as Head-Academics. The

petitioner tried its level best to explain to the respondent that the next revision

of his salary as per the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 08.09.2006

was due only in April, 2008 and not before that, but the respondent stuck to his

demand, and as such the petitioner had no option but to accede to the same.

Accordingly, the respondent's salary was revised vide letter dated 18.10.2007

(Annexure P-8) from Rs.6,37,000/- annually (Rupees Six Lacs Thirty Seven

Thousand only) to Rs.8,77,000/- annually (Rupees Eight Lacs Seventy Seven

Thousand only), and the respondent was also designated as Head-Academics.

</p><p id="p_19">9.     Still dissatisfied, the respondent on 27.11.2007 wrote to the petitioner

by an e-mail (Annexure P-9), once again demanding salary revision. A few

days later, the respondent vide e-mail dated 29.11.2007 (Annexure P-10) wrote



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                  OMP 241/2008                                 Page 7 of 32</span>
 to the petitioner as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Sir, I am sorry to say that BIFM does not deserve a talent
           like me. It's not me who wants BIFM, but it's BIFM who
           wants me. What I have delivered in 1 year to BIFM, it will
           take 10 years for others to deliver that. The only problem
           has been that I have begged for even getting my rights from
           you and I realize that was a mistake. Whatever you have
           given to me I have given many more times than that to
           BIFM. Only time will make u realize that. Thank you for
           giving me the platform to show my worth to the finance
           fraternity. Today I get more than 10 calls a day to establish
           an institution like BIFM. (emphasis supplied).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">10.    On 28.11.2007, the respondent suddenly stopped attending to work

without any kind of intimation to the petitioner and tendered his resignation

once again vide letter dated 01.12.2007, which was returned unaccepted by the

petitioner on 13.12.2007, informing the respondent that his unauthorized

absence was in breach of the terms and conditions of the employment

agreement dated 08.09.2006 (Annexure P-11 Colly).
</p>
<p id="p_21">11.    The respondent not only did not resume work, but on 14.12.2007

addressed an e-mail to all the key employees of the petitioner, wherein he

instigated and called upon the employees to act against the interest of the

petitioner, advising them not to work hard for the petitioner. The respondent

vide his reply dated 20.12.2007 to the letter of the petitioner dated 13.12.2007

also made various false and baseless allegations and claimed an amount of

Rs.1 crore from the petitioner (Annexure P-12 Colly). The petitioner wrote



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                  OMP 241/2008                               Page 8 of 32</span>
 back to the respondent vide letter dated 29.12.2007, denying the alleged

liability of Rs.1 crore and claiming that it was the respondent who should

compensate the petitioner for the losses suffered by it due to breach of

agreement by the respondent (Annexure P-13).
</p>
<p id="p_22">12.   Since the respondent neither resumed work nor compensated the

petitioner company, and continued to be unauthorizedly absent from work in

breach of the agreement dated 08.09.2006, the petitioner invoked the

arbitration clause contained in the said agreement and requested its Chairman

vide letter dated 17.12.2006 for the appointment of a sole arbitrator. Acting on

the said letter, the Chairman of the petitioner company appointed Mr.Anil

Kumar Chauhan, Advocate         to act as the sole arbitrator vide letter dated

24.03.2008. The appointment of the arbitrator was intimated to the respondent

vide letter dated 25.03.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_23">13.   On 10.04.2008, it came to the knowledge of the petitioner; when a letter

dated 30.03.2008 was received by the petitioner, that the respondent was

about to join the employment of another Financial Educational Institute of a

similar nature as that of the petitioner (Annexure P-14), contrary to the

agreement dated 08.09.2006 wherein the respondent had agreed to serve the

petitioner for a period of 5 years with a minimum compulsory period of 3 years

and in breach of the undertaking given by him in his letter dated 14.04.2007



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                 OMP 241/2008                                Page 9 of 32</span>
 that he will not engage directly or indirectly in any business or associate

himself in any capacity with any organization dealing in stock market/capital

market/financial market education institute or serve whether as principal,

agent, partner or employee or in any other capacity, either full time or part

time, in any business whatsoever, and also contrary to the oral assurances

given by the respondent to the petitioner from time to time.

</p><p id="p_24">14.    Apprehending that the respondent, unless restrained from doing so,

would divulge all the proprietary confidential information and business

strategies of the petitioner to the competitors of the petitioner, as the

respondent was holding a key position with the petitioner and had access to all

the copyrighted study materials and handouts of different specialized courses

developed by him during the course of his employment with the petitioner, and

thereby cause irreparable loss and prejudice to the petitioner, the petitioner has

filed the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_25">15.    The petitioner alleges in the petition that by attempting to join another

institute of similar nature as that of the petitioner during the course of his

employment with the petitioner and enticing/soliciting the employees of the

petitioner, in gross breach of the terms of employment, the respondent has

committed breach of the agreement dated 08.09.2006 and letter dated

14.04.2007 issued by the petitioner to the respondent, and prays for the passing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                  OMP 241/2008                                 Page 10 of 32</span>
 of orders restraining the respondent from joining any other employment, and

from divulging to any other business/firm or company any of the secrets

processes or information relating to the courses, course material and business

of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_26">16.    By an order dated 2nd May, 2008, notice of the filing of the petition was

issued to the respondent and the respondent was restrained by an ex parte

injunction from divulging to any business/firm or company any of the secrets,

processes or information relating to the courses, course material and business

of the petitioner as per the proprietary confidential systems developed and used

by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_27">17.    On 08.07.2008, while seeking extension of time for filing the reply, the

counsel for the respondent made a statement in Court that the respondent had

not joined any other employment and that he would not be joining any other

employment till the next date, that is, 5.8.2008. However, on 23.07.2008, an

application, being I.A.No.8696/2008 under Section 151 of the Code of Civil

Procedure, was filed by the respondent, which was ultimately listed before this

Court on 28th July, 2008. Through this application the respondent prayed for

vacation of the interim order dated 8th July, 2008 and that the consent given by

the respondent on the said date be deemed to be withdrawn w.e.f. 5.8.2008.

The respondent also prayed for vacation of the interim orders passed by this



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                     OMP 241/2008                           Page 11 of 32</span>
 Court on 2nd May, 2008. On 5th August, 2008, however, when the counsel for

the respondent again sought time for removing the objections on his reply and

re-filing the reply, the respondent was directed by the Court to abide by the

undertaking given by him to the Court on 8th July, 2008 till the next date fixed

for hearing, i.e., 25th August, 2008. Today, I have heard the learned counsel for

the parties and while reserving orders, have extended the interim orders in the

meanwhile.
</p>
<p id="p_28">18.   The learned senior counsel for the petitioner Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul,

relying upon clause-4 of the agreement dated 08.09.2006, vehemently

contended that the respondent was bound by the agreement to serve the

petitioner company for a period of 5 years, taken as employment period,

wherein there is no exit for a minimum period of 3 years, and was further

bound by his undertaking given in the said Clause to maintain complete

integrity and confidentiality and not to mis-use any business secrets of the

petitioner company. The said clause is, for the sake of ready reference,

reproduced hereunder as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "4. Since the mission of BIFM is a long term process
           where the commitment for a longer period is required,
           hence the employee commits to serve the BIFM for a period
           of 5 years, taken as employment period wherein there is no
           exit for a minimum period of 3 (three) years. During the
           course of his stay and thereafter, the employee further
           undertakes to maintain complete integrity, confidentiality,
           not to leak, divulge, share or misuse any of the business


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                 OMP 241/2008                                Page 12 of 32</span>
             secrets, secrecy related to software &amp; tampering or hacking
            strategies, plans etc. with any third party or for himself for
            any oblique motive."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">19.   Reliance was also placed by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner

on the provision in the agreement relating to termination of agreement to

contend that the respondent had contracted to work with the petitioner for an

employment period of five years, with three years as minimum compulsory

period in case of some extraordinary situation. Thus, if the respondent in

the case of some extraordinary situation decided to quit his job after the

completion of the compulsory period of three years, he could do so provided

he served a prior notice of at least six months in writing to the company as

stipulated in the contract. The relevant provision of the contract reads as

follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "Termination of Agreement:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            As committed above, Mr. Ramakar Jha shall work with the
            company for 5 years with 3 years as minimum compulsory
            period, but in case of some extra ordinary situation, if Mr.
            Jha decides to quit his job after the completion of the
            compulsory period, then he can do so by serving a prior
            notice of atleast 6 months in writing to the company."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">20.   The learned senior counsel for the petitioner also sought to emphasize

the fundamental difference between an employee voluntarily leaving the

service of an employer during the period of contract on the one hand, and the

termination of the services of the employee by the employer on the other hand,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                 OMP 241/2008                                 Page 13 of 32</span>
 during the aforesaid period. It was emphasized by him that in the instant case,

it was the respondent, who had left the Institute. This was not a case where his

services had been terminated by the petitioner. Emphasis was also laid on the

fact that from time to time, the respondent had blackmailed the petitioner into

increasing his salary and on such occasions, the stipulations contained in the

agreement, including the stipulation contained in Clause 4 (supra), were

reiterated by the respondent. Reference in particular was made by Mr. Kaul to

the document dated April 14, 2007 titled as "Employment Agreement dated 8th

September, 2008", "Subject: Remuneration and Greater commitment". The

said document after setting out the revised pay package and other perks of the

petitioner provided as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           "1.    The above remuneration package shall be effective
                  from April 2007 till March 2008.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           2.     As agreed and accepted vide Employment agreement
                  dated 08/09/2006 and same also given as a
                  precondition for the new remuneration package, it is
                  reiterated that you shall work with a greater
                  commitment and shall serve the company for a
                  period 5 years with 3 years as minimum compulsory
                  period including the period already served by you
                  under the said agreement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           3.     During the period your stay with the Institute the

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">22.    This was, Mr. Kaul contends, by no means the end of the matter as is

evidenced from document dated October 18, 2007 emanating from the

petitioner to the respondent regarding revision of salary and profile enrichment

with reference to the employment agreement dated 08.09.2006 and letter dated

14.04.2007 referred to hereinabove. A bare glance at the said document shows

that the salary of the respondent was again revised from Rs.40,000/- to

Rs.60,000/- with effect from 01.04.2008 and his designation upgraded as

Head-Academics. The document bears the following endorsement at the foot

thereof:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">23.    Subsequent to this, however, the learned counsel for the petitioner

points out that the respondent by his letters dated November 27, 2007,

November 29, 2007 and December 01, 2007 again expressed dissatisfaction

with his job and its attendant responsibilities. In his last letter, that is, letter

dated 1st December, 2007, he requested the management to accept his

resignation and expressed an opinion that calling it a day would be good for

both the parties.

<p id="p_31"> 24.   The learned counsel for the petitioner next drew my attention to letter

dated December 13, 2007 and in particular to the following extracts of the said

letter sent by the petitioner to the respondent, which is captioned

"Unauthorized absence w.e.f. 28.11.2007":-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">           "It is placed on records that institute enhanced your salary
           perks &amp; perquisites twice over a period of one year at your
           demands.      Despite of said enhancements you have
           abandoned your duties and more than 15 days have passed
           since your above stated unauthorized absence. Please note
           that you are in possession of confidential &amp; proprietary
           information including assets of the institute. Various
           messages were given to you to join your duties but that did
           not yield any results.

           indirectly in any business or to associate yourself in any

           Capital Market or Financial Market, Education Institute or
           to serve as principal, agent, partner or as employee either
           full time or part time. The said undertaking was reiterated
           by you while you further negotiated your salary, perks &amp;
           perquisites at Rs.47,000/- per month on April 14, 2007."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">25.   Mr. Kaul contends that on the very next day, that is, on December 14,

2007, the respondent by e-mail addressed to all the key employees of the

petitioner instigated and called upon the employees to act against the interests

of the petitioner and also advised them not to work hard for the petitioner.

This was followed by a letter dated 20th December, 2007 purporting to be a

response to the letter of the petitioner dated 13th December, 2007, making

various false and baseless allegations against the petitioner and claiming an



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                OMP 241/2008                                Page 17 of 32</span>
 amount of Rs.1 crore from the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_33">26.    The learned senior counsel for the petitioner has also vehemently urge

that a conjoint reading of the e-mail dated October 13, 2007 whereby the

respondent withdrew his resignation terming it as a "mistake" with the

document enhancing the salary of the respondent, viz., document dated

October 18, 2007 captioned ""Revision of salary and profile enrichment",

makes it amply clear that the respondent was adopting blackmailing tactics

with the petitioner for enhancement of his salary and employment profile.

The said e-mail is apposite and is accordingly reproduced hereunder:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">               "Respected Sir,
               Thank you for your time and guidance. Today's meeting
               assured lot of things and made me realize my mistake of
               deciding to part with the organization.           I sincerely
               apologize for that and once again thank you for showing me
               my growth path. I would like to assure you my continued
               commitment going forward and would like to take back my
               resignation request. It was a mistake. I am there with
               BIFM as earlier or whichever capacity the management
               feels fit. Thanking you for all the support and guidance."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">27.    A three-fold submission was raised by the learned senior counsel for the

petitioner:-
</p>
<p id="p_35">(a)    a negative covenant restraining the right of the employee, during the

       subsistence of his service contract, to engage in any business similar to,

       or competitive with that of the employer, cannot be said to be a

       covenant in restraint of trade and, therefore, hit by Section 27 of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                    OMP 241/2008                                Page 18 of 32</span>
       <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_5">Contract Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(b)   Even de hors the law, in equity jurisdiction, it is not open for the

      respondent to state that the relief prayed for by the        petitioner of

      restraining the respondent from joining any other employment or

      engaging directly or indirectly in any business similar to that of the

      petitioner for the remaining period of his employment, is unjustified.

</p><p id="p_37">(c)   A contract of service is essentially a contract of trust and faith and the

      material resources, infrastructure, etc. of the employer cannot be

      allowed to be used by a rival, through the conduit of an employee

      divulging the confidential systems developed and used by the petitioner,

      and that too during the subsistence of the employee's service agreement

      with the employer.
</p>
<p id="p_38">28.   Reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on the

principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/452434/" id="a_6">Niranjan Shankar

Golikari vs. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd</a>. (1967) 2 SCR

378 and <a href="/doc/793778/" id="a_7">Superintendence Company of India (P) Ltd. vs. Sh. Krishan Murgai</a>

(1981) 2 SCC 246, to urge that there was a clear distinction between cases

containing a negative covenant preventing the employee from working

elsewhere during the term of the agreement and cases containing a negative

covenant not to serve elsewhere after the termination of the contract. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                OMP 241/2008                                Page 19 of 32</span>
 former were specifically enforceable, while the later made the agreement void

on the ground that they were in restraint of trade and, therefore, hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_8">Section

27</a> of the Contract Act.
</p>
<p id="p_39">29.    The learned senior counsel for the petitioner next urged that the

respondent was not only under a legal but also an equitable duty to maintain

confidentiality with respect to the courses, course material and business of the

petitioner as stipulated in the agreement. He further contended, relying upon

<a href="/doc/603848/" id="a_9">Zee Telefilms Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Sundial Communications Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.

2003 (27) PTC 457 (Bom) (DB), that the right to restrain the publication of a

work using confidential information is a broader right than the proprietary right

of    copyright, though the law of confidence is different from the law of

copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_40">30.    In the above context, reference was also made to the decision rendered

by a learned Single Judge of this Court (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.) in the case of

<a href="/doc/1023088/" id="a_10">Daljeet Titus, Advocate (Mr.) vs. Mr. Alfred A. Adebare &amp; Ors</a>. 2006 VI AD

(DELHI) 117 wherein the Court in a suit for injunction for infringement of

copyright while holding that the legal pronouncements make it clear that

copyright exists not only in what is drafted and created, but also in lists of

clients and addresses specially designed by an advocate or a law firm, in

paragraph-81 of the judgment observed as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_41">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                 OMP 241/2008                                Page 20 of 32</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">            "81. ..........Court must step in to restrain a breach of
           confidence independent of any right under law. Such an
           obligation need not be expressed but be implied and the
           breach of such confidence is independent of any other right
           as stated above............."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">31.    Finally, it was contended by Mr. Kaul that the study material and

teaching methodology designed and structured by the respondent as a faculty

member of the Institute were the property of the Institute, the resources and

infrastructure of the Institute having been utilised by the respondent for the

development thereof. As set out in the petition, the Institute had invested to

the tune of more than Rs.100 crores of rupees on the launching of the new

curriculum alone in the last one year by setting up state of the art

infrastructure. The respondent was holding one of the key posts in the Institute

and was accordingly in a position to blackmail the Institute. Though the

petitioner stricto senso did not have copyright in the courses, the study

materials, the hand-outs and the teaching technology devolved by the

respondent at the expense of the petitioner, the respondent by breaching his

employment agreement and divulging to a rival business any of the secret

processes or confidential systems developed and used by the petitioner would

be subjecting the petitioner to irreparable injury.

</p><p id="p_43">32.    Per contra, a three-fold contention was also raised by the learned

counsel for the respondent Mr. Atul Bandhu, to negate the prayer of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                 OMP 241/2008                               Page 21 of 32</span>
 petitioner for interim relief. According to Mr. Bandhu,

</p><p id="p_44">(a)   <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_11">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_12">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 cannot be

      invoked by the petitioner to claim interim relief as the aforesaid

      provision does not empower the Court to grant interim measures save

      those which are necessary for the preservation of "property".

</p><p id="p_45">(b)   The consequences for the breach of the negative covenant are not

      contained in the contract and, as such, the said covenant cannot be

      enforced.
</p>
<p id="p_46">(c)   The negative covenant relied upon by the petitioner is in restraint of

      trade and, therefore, hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_13">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act.

</p><p id="p_47">33.   First a look at <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_14">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_15">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996,

           as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any

</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">34.   From the provisions of <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_17">Section 9</a> of the Act, I am unable to accede to

the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that this Court is not

empowered to pass any interim measures save those as are necessary for the

preservation and custody of any property, etc. Sub-clause (e) of Clause (ii) of

<a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_18">Section 9</a> clearly stipulates that the Court shall have the power to order "such

other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and

convenient", and "the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it

has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it". There is

no reference in the said sub-clause to any property, whether movable or

immovable. To curtail the width and magnitude of the said clause so as to

make it applicable only to movable and immovable property, in my view,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                OMP 241/2008                                Page 23 of 32</span>
 would be wholly unjustified, apart from being in violation of all canons of

interpretation. Clearly, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_19">Section 9</a> of the Act must be allowed

to go to the rescue of the petitioner, who has already invoked the arbitration

clause.
</p>
<p id="p_49">35.   The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that since the

consequences for the breach of the negative covenant are not contained in the

contract and in view of the fact that no penal consequences, either of a civil

nature or of a criminal nature, are spelt out for the aforesaid breach, the said

negative covenant cannot be enforced, is, to my mind, equally specious and

unsustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_50">36.   Finally, as regards the submission of the learned counsel for the

respondent that the covenant in the instant case is a negative covenant, which

is in restraint of trade and the said covenant cannot, therefore, be enforced

against the respondent, in my considered opinion, the Supreme Court in

Golikari's case (supra) and in Murgai's case (supra) has unambiguously laid

down the law in respect of negative covenants which are hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_20">Section 27</a> of

the Contract Act and those which are valid under the said Act. In Golikari's

case (supra), the injunction granted by the trial court was upheld by the High

Court and finally by the Supreme Court on the premise that it was confined to

the period of the agreement. The validity of Clause 17 of the agreement in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                OMP 241/2008                                Page 24 of 32</span>
 said case, which provided that in the event of the employee leaving,

abandoning or resigning the service of the company before the expiry of the

period of five years, he shall not directly or indirectly engage in the business at

present being carried on by the company for the remainder of the said period,

was upheld. It was found that Clause 17 did not prohibit the appellant from

seeking similar employment from any other manufacturer after the contractual

period was over. It was also found that there was no indication at all that if the

appellant was prevented from being employed in a similar capacity elsewhere,

he would be forced to idleness or that such a restraint would compel the

appellant to go back to the company, which would indirectly result in specific

performance of the contract to personal service. The following pertinent

observations were made by the Court in paragraph-15 of the judgment:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">       "15. The result of the above discussion is that considerations
       against restrictive covenants are different in cases where the
       restriction is to apply during the period after the termination of
       the contract than those in cases where it is to operate during the
       period of the contract. Negative covenants operative during the
       period of the contract of employment when the employee is
       bound to serve his employer exclusively are generally not
       regarded as restraint of trade and therefore do not fall under
       <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_21">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act......................"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">37.    In Murgai's case (supra), a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court

endorsing the view taken in Golikari's case (supra), after delving into all

previous precedents held that by virtue of the servant's duty of fidelity, a

 negative covenant, having regard to the interest of the employer during the

subsistence of the service agreement, is normally valid. In paragraph 58 of the

judgment, the Supreme Court held as follows:- (SCC, page 264)

           "58. The drafting of a negative covenant in a contract of
           employment is often a matter of great difficulty. In the
           employment cases so far discussed, the issue has been as to
           the validity of the covenant operating after the end of the
           period of service. Restrictions on competition during that
           period are normally valid, and indeed may be implied by
           law by virtue of the servant's duty of fidelity. In such cases
           the restriction is generally reasonable, having regard to the
           interest of the employer, and does not cause any undue
           hardship to the employee, who will receive a wage or salary
           for the period in question. But if the covenant is to operate
           after the termination of services, or is too widely worded,
           the court may refuse to enforce it.

<p id="p_52">38.   In Robb Vs. Green reported in [1895] 2 Q.B.315, the defendant was

employed as manager of the plaintiff's business. While so employed, he

surreptitiously copied from the plaintiff's books a list of names and addresses

of the plaintiff's customers, with the intention of using it for his own benefit

after he had left the plaintiff's employment and set up a similar business on his

own account. Having left the plaintiff's employment, he so used the list. The

Court of appeal, applying the dictum of Bowen, L.J. in Lamb Vs. Evans,

[1893] 1 Ch. at page 229 held that it was an implied term of the defendant's

contract of service that he would act with good faith towards his master; his

conduct was a breach of the implied term; and the plaintiff was entitled to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                 OMP 241/2008                                Page 26 of 32</span>
 damages and injunction. Lord Esher, M.R. in delivering the judgment made the

following observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "A master would not take a servant into his employ if the servant
      refused to agree to act honestly, and a servant must know that his
      master, who is going to engage him, relies on the faithful
      performance by him of the duties arising out of the confidential
      relations between them. This stipulation must have been in the
      minds of both the plaintiff and the defendant when they entered
      into the contract of service, and it is, therefore, a part of that
      contract. Bowen, L.J., in Helmore v. Smith (2) and in Lamb v.
      Evans (1), was clearly of the same opinion. He says in the latter
      case ([1893] 1 Ch. At p.229):
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">         "The common law, it is true, treats the matter from the
         point of view of an implied contract, and assumes that there
         is a promise to do that which is part of the bargain, or which
         can be fairly implied as part of the good faith which is
         necessary to make the bargain effectual. What is an implied
         contract or an implied promise in law? It is that promise
         which the law implies and authorises us to infer in order to
         give the transaction that effect which the parties must have
         intended it to have, and without which it would be futile."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       Now, a contract of service is a transaction of confidence and
      trust, and if a stipulation of faithful performance cannot be
      implied, the contract would be futile."

Denning, MR opined:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">           "The law on this subject does not depend on any implied
           contract. It depends on the broad principle of equity that he
           who has received information in confidence shall not take
           unfair advantage of it. He must not make use of it to the
           prejudice of him who gave it without obtaining his

            consent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">40. The basic principles of the law of confidence as set out in Copinger and

Skone-James on Copyright (13th Edn) paragraph 21.1, pages 720-721 are

apposite and are set out as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">           "There is a broad and developing equitable doctrine that he
           who has received information in confidence shall not take
           unfair advantage of it or profit from the wrongful use or
           publication of it. He must not make any use of it to the
           prejudice of him who gave it, without obtaining his consent
           or, at any rate, without paying him for it. It has for long
           been clear that the courts can restrain a breach of
           confidence arising out of a contract or any right to
           property..... The ground of equitable intervention is that it is
           unconscionable for a person who has received information
           on the basis that it is confidential subsequently to reveal
           that information. Acceptance of information on the basis
           that it will be kept secret affects the conscience of the
           recipient of the information. In general it is in the public
           interest that confidences should be respected, even where
           the consider can point to specific financial detriment to
           himself. If a defendant is proved to have used confidential
           information, directly or indirectly obtained from a plaintiff
           without his consent express or implied, he will be guilty of
           an infringement of the plaintiff's rights."

reported in (2006) 4 SCC 227, the Supreme Court, after reviewing the entire

case law from the 132 years old interpretation of <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_22">Section 27</a> of the Contract

Act laid down in Madhup Chunder Vs. Rajcoomar Doss, (1874) 14 Bengal

Law Reporter 76 and after reiterating the principles laid down in Golikari and

Murgi (Supra), summed up the law as follows: [SCC page 247]


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                 OMP 241/2008                                 Page 28 of 32</span>
        "63. Under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_23">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act: (a) a restrictive
       covenant extending beyond the term of the contract is void
       and not enforceable, (b) the doctrine of restraint of trade
       does not apply during the continuance of the contract for
       employment and it applies only when the contract comes to
       an end, (c) as held by this Court in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_24">Gujarat Bottling v.
       Coca-Cola</a> this doctrine is not confined only to contracts of
       employment, but is also applicable to all other contracts."

</p><p id="p_56">42.   Per contra, reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the

respondent on the judgment rendered by the Division Bench of the Delhi High

Court in Murgai's case (supra) reported in AIR 1979 DELHI 232. Far from

being of any assistance to the respondent, the said decision buttresses the

contention of the counsel for the petitioner that <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_25">Section 27</a> does not apply to a

negative covenant during the period of service as is clear from a reading of

paragraph 22 of the judgment, which reads as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">      "22. With respect, it may be pointed out that the injunction
      upheld in the Supreme Court case related to the negative
      covenant operating during the period of service. The court has
      repeatedly emphasised that <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_26">Section 27</a> does not apply to a
      negative covenant operating during the period of service. The
      Supreme Court has not upheld in that case any restrictive
      covenant which prevented the employee from carrying on a
      similar business or working with a rival employer after the period
      of service. The injunction operating after the period of service
      was confined to the divulgence of trade secrets only. In the
      present case no such trade secrets, have been shown to have been
      imparted to the defendant."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">43.   In the instant case, indubitably the respondent is in breach of the

negative covenant contained in his service agreement, during the subsistence of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                OMP 241/2008                                Page 29 of 32</span>
 his service agreement with the petitioner, and the doctrine of restraint of trade

cannot therefore be held to apply. The respondent must, accordingly, in my

opinion, be held to be bound by the terms of his service agreement, at least till

such time as the arbitrator renders his award on the dispute between the parties.

The petitioner has thus made out a prima facie case for the grant of interim

relief under <a href="/doc/1589358/" id="a_27">Section 9</a> of the Act, restraining the respondent from seeking

employment with any business rival of the petitioner or with any organization

dealing in Stock Market/Capital Market/Financial Market Education Institute.

The balance of convenience also tilts in favour of the petitioner, as the

petitioner cannot be monetarily compensated, if any of its trade secrets or

information relating to its courses, course materials and business is divulged by

the respondent to any other organization carrying on a business akin to that of

the petitioner. Irreparable injury would also undoubtedly be caused to the

petitioner's business, if such an eventuality occurs.

</p><p id="p_58">44.    In view of the aforesaid conclusion, the respondent is restrained, during

the pendency of the arbitration proceedings before the Arbitrator, from joining

any employment or engaging directly or indirectly in any business or

associating himself in any capacity with any organization dealing in Stock

Market/Capital Market/Financial Market Education Institute or serving

whether as principal, agent, partner or employee or in any other capacity, either

 full time or part time in any business whatsoever similar to that of the

petitioner. The respondent is further restrained from divulging to any other

business/firm or company any of the secret processes or information relating to

the courses, course material and business of the petitioner as per the

proprietary, confidential systems developed and used by the petitioner. The

respondent is also restrained from joining any competitor of the respondent and

from alluring or enticing any of the existing employees of the petitioner to join

any other business/firm or company.

arbitration proceedings. The nominated Arbitrator shall, however, render his

award as expeditiously as possibly and latest within three months from the date

of entering into the reference. The arbitrator shall enter upon the reference

forthwith, if already nominated and shall be nominated latest within one week,

in case no arbitrator is so far nominated. The parties shall fully cooperate in
