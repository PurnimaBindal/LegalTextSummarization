Judgment on           : 05.10.2010.



        PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE, J. :                     This appeal is directed against an

</pre><p id="p_8">judgment and order dated 5th March, 2010 passed by His Lordship in G.A.

No.614 of 2010 (C.S. No.43 of 2010) and was pleased to grant an order in terms

of prayer (d) of the Notice of Motion till twelve weeks. By the said order the

Hon'ble First Court has held that the impugned advertisement is disparaging the

petitioners' product TIDE and has resisted the appellant from broadcasting the

same.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">        Being aggrieved, this appeal has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

        The facts of the case briefly are as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_12">

        The appellant/defendant, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) manufactures

and     sells   different   varieties   of   detergents,    one    of    which    is   RIN.    The

plaintiffs/respondents are market leaders in respect of detergents in most

countries. The plaintiffs/respondents state that washing powder/detergents

bearing the mark Tide are sold in several countries through out the world. The

said mark TIDE had developed extensive goodwill and reputation throughout the

world     and    is   associated    with     quality    products    of    the    plaintiffs.   The

plaintiffs/respondents to protect their goodwill and reputation of the said mark
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>

they applied for and obtained registration thereof in various countries throughout

the world.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">      Since May 2000, TIDE products have been manufactured and marketed in

India extensively by the plaintiff No.1 under a license from plaintiff No.2. TIDE

detergents are sold in various variants, such as TIDE, TIDE (Jasmine and Rose)

and TIDE (Naturals). Such products are sold in distinctive and eye catching

packaging with distinctive get up, colour scheme and trade dress. The said mark

TIDE and the packaging are associated extensively with the plaintiffs. The same

are original artistic works within the meaning of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_1">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 and the

plaintiffs are the owners thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">      The plaintiffs have incurred enormous expenditure towards promotion and

marketing    of   their   products   under   the   said   trade   mark   TIDE.   The

appellant/defendant is the competitor of the respondents products in the field of

detergents. The allegation of the respondents is that a new advertisement

campaign has been launched by the appellant/defendant which specifically

targets the plaintiffs/respondents TIDE product, denigrates and disparages        it

harshly and attempts to show the plaintiffs and their products in poor, inferior,

unworthy and contemptible quality. It is alleged that the said advertisement is

slanderous and amounts to slander of goods. The advertising campaign was

broadcast for the first time on 26th February, 2010 and ever since has been aired

at regular intervals on prime time television throughout India. The concept of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>

such advertisement is to convey a message to the consumer public that the

plaintiffs (respondents herein) product TIDE is bad, of substandard quality,

grossly inferior and a detergent and a worthless product.



</p><p id="p_17">      It is further alleged that the advertisement on the various channels telecast

and/or broadcast and/or published by the defendant covey inter alia the

following visual and spoken matter which are slanderous and disparaging :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (a)   Two women are shown waiting at a school bus stop; each of them

            carrying vegetable baskets with them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (b)   Both the baskets are shown as kept next to each other, one

            containing a Rin packet and the other a TIDE (Naturals) packet.



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (c)   The woman with the Rin packet is showing looking into the TIDE

            (Naturals) basket of the lady with the TIDE (Naturals) packet.



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (d)   The TIDE (Naturals) woman smiles confidently and says "TIDE

            (Natural) woman and the voiceover says "TIDE hai". The Rin woman

            smirks back at her.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (e)   The TIDE (Naturals) woman again proudly smiles and says - "TIDE

            (Naturals) woman [and the voiceover says] Khushbu hai aur safedi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

      bhi. Aur kya chahiye...". The Rin woman again smirks at her and

      still says nothing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">

</blockquote><p id="p_18">(f)   The women are shown as looking at a bus coming towards them.

</p><p id="p_19">      They walk towards the bus.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">(g)   A child gets out of the bus wearing a visually dingy dirty school

      uniform.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">(h)   The Mother of the child [the lady with the TIDE (Naturals) packet

      walks towards her child and says - "TIDE (Naturals) woman [and the

      voiceover says] Aur kya chahiye...". As she says this, suddenly she

      is shown as getting shocked and surprised expression on her face.



</p><p id="p_24">(i)   Next a child of equal age shown wearing a crisp sparkling white shirt

      is shown coming out of the bus and walking along side the other boy

      with the dingy and dirty shirt.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">(j)   The TIDE (Naturals) woman is shown as getting extremely shocked

      and surprised seeing the child in the sparkling white shirt.



</p><p id="p_27">(k)   This child is shown smiling and walking confidently towards his

      mother.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6</span><p id="p_28">




</p><p id="p_29">     (l)     He asks his mother : [and the voiceover says] Mummy aunty chaunk

             kyon gayi"?. Now the woman with the Rin packet is shown smiling

             confidently.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">     (m)     Then a side-by-side comparison of a white shirt with the Rin mark

             on it on the left side of the frame and a dingy dirty shirt on the right

             side with a TIDE (Naturals) pack kept on it are shown and the

             voiceover says "TIDE se kahi behtar safedi de Rin".
</p>
<p id="p_32">     (n)     Next the Rin woman with her child are shown walking and smiling

             confidently. In the background the TIDE lady and her child are

             shown with expression on their faces shocked and surprised. Next

             the pack appear on the screen with Rs.35 being crossed to reveal a

             unit icon of Rs.25 price.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">     (o)     In the last frame we see the Rin logo with the super reading "issued

             in the interest of Rin users".
</p>
<p id="p_35">

     A copy of the storyboard is annexed to the stay petition. It is further alleged

on behalf of the plaintiffs that the impugned advertisement and the visual and

spoken content thereof are defamatory and slanderous of the plaintiffs product

TIDE which are also false, untrue and misleading besides being false and

malicious.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         7</span><p id="p_36">




</p><p id="p_37">      It is alleged that the said advertisement has conveyed and meant directly

as well as insinuations and innuendos to convey that the product TIDE is inferior

and sub-standard quality. The said advertisement of the defendants/respondents

categorically and unequivocally disparages the plaintiffs product namely, TIDE.

In these circumstances, a suit has been filed and in the said suit an interim

order was prayed where the Hon'ble Court was pleased to pass an order after

hearing the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_38">

</p><p id="p_39">      The question arose the display of the advertisement in television channels

has disparaged the goods of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_40">

</p><p id="p_41">      Mr. Anindya Mitra, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the

appellant/defendant contended that this is a comparative advertisement between

RIN and TIDE Naturals. The claim made by the defendant/appellant is that RIN

produces superior whiteness than TIDE Naturals.
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">      Mr. Mitra in support of this appeal submitted that comparison is made

between TIDE Naturals and RIN. The claim made by the defendant/appellant is

that RIN produces superior whiteness than TIDE Naturals. There is no claim in

the impugned advertisement that TIDE Naturals is bad or useless as a detergent

or that it does not deliver the purpose for which it is intended. The appellant has

emphasized only one quality (delivery of whiteness) of RIN is better than TIDE
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                        8</span>

Naturals. According to him comparative advertisement is permissible in law. The

appellant/defendant has claimed that RIN produces better whiteness than TIDE

Naturals. There is no denigration of TIDE Naturals as a detergent. Such

advertisement does not give the message that TIDE Naturals is bad or rubbish or

useless for its intended purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">      In support of this he relied upon the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_2">Reckitt &amp;

Colman of India Ltd. vs. M.P. Ramchandran &amp; Anr</a>., reported in 1999 (19)

PTC 741, where five tests have been laid down and it would be evident that it is

permissible to compare the advantages of one's goods over another.



</p><p id="p_46">      He further relied upon the decision in the case of Timothy White vs.

Gustav Mellin, reported in 1895 AC 154 where the Court held that it was also a

case of comparative advertisement where injunction was refused. It was also held

that three things should be proved by the plaintiff in order to make a case for

injunction:
</p>
<p id="p_47">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (i)         The defendant has compared with the plaintiff's goods;

</blockquote><pre id="pre_3">      (ii)        The comparison was false; and

      (iii)       Damages has resulted or was likely to result.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                           9</span>

</pre><p id="p_48">      Mr. Mitra further submitted that defence of truth is an absolute defence

and no interim injunction should be granted. In support of this he relied upon

the following decisions :-
</p>
<p id="p_49">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      1.     2003 (26) PTC 535 (Del.), (<a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_3">Reckit Benckiser (India) Limited vs.

</p><p id="p_51">      Mr. Mitra contended that the Hon'ble First Court had proceeded on the

wrong basis that the finding of defence of truth in the said judgment was arrived

at only after filing of affidavits.   He submitted that this is incorrect since no

affidavits were filed in the said case when the Court arrived at the said finding.

The proposition of the Hon'ble First Court is that whether truth is a complete

defence can be arrived at only after filing of affidavits and such is not the case

here as affidavits are awaited.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                               10</span><p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">      He further submitted that the correct proposition of law is that unless the

Court finds that the defence of truth is wholly illusory and without any basis, the

Court should refuse ad-interim injunction. The Hon'ble First Court has not

recorded any finding that the plea of truth vis-à-vis RIN and TIDE Naturals is

illusory or without any basis. He next contended that no prima facie case is a

case of malicious falsehood, in which the burden of proof is lies on the plaintiff as

held in the case of Imperial Tobacco Co.(Supra) and also in the case of Timothy

White (Supra).
</p>
<p id="p_54">

</p><p id="p_55">      Therefore, according to Mr. Mitra, the plaintiffs/respondents have no

ground       to    ask   for   injunction   restraining   any   advertisement   by   the

appellant/defendant claiming that RIN produces better whiteness than TIDE

Naturals. He further drew our attention to the report on laboratory tests and

contended that no prima facie case has been made out.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">      According to him, TIDE has three categories of packets viz.



</p><pre id="pre_4">      i)          TIDE Dirt Magnet;

      ii)         TIDE Dirt Magnet Jasmine Rose;

      iii)        TIDE Naturals.



</pre><p id="p_58">      Mr. Mitra further contended that first two packets are drastically different

from TIDE Naturals both in colour composition and get up and there is little or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                            11</span>

no scope of confusing Natural packets with a TIDE Dirt Magnet or Jasmine Rose

pack. Also, no specific case in the petition/plaint has been made that the Voice

Over would have viewers to think that RIN is being compared with TIDE Dirt

Magnet and TIDE Dirt Magnet Jasmine Rose.
</p>
<p id="p_59">

</p><p id="p_60">      It is submitted that overall impact of the advertisement of audio-visual is to

be considered, as theme/message cannot be attributed to one frame or word. It is

submitted that any reasonable viewer will understand that TIDE in this

advertisement means TIDE Naturals having regard to the visual display of the

packet of Tide Naturals only. Hearing and seeing are simultaneous and visual

impact is more important and has deeper impact. Seeing is believing. Hon'ble

First Court has accepted that "Has a very strong impact because of it being

visual". The Hon'ble First Court at the highest could have directed modification of

Voice Over from "Tide se kahin behatar safedi de Rin" to "Tide naturals se kahin

behatar safedi de Rin".
</p>
<p id="p_61">

</p><p id="p_62">      Learned Counsel further contended that the following cases have also been

considered by the Hon'ble First Court :-
</p>
<p id="p_63">

</p><pre id="pre_5">      i)     2001 FSR 541

      ii)    1998 FSR 383

      iii)   1989 (3) SCC 251
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12</span>

</pre><p id="p_64">      According to Mr. Mitra there is no justification of passing this ad-interim

injunction and submitted that it is pertinent to mention that the Hon'ble Court

First Court found one picture frame of the impugned advertisement to be

objectionable as had been recorded in the impugned order. The Hon'ble First

Court has felt that "in the sequence of the frame the attribution of dullness to the

Tide shirt becomes clear when the packet of Tide is put on the dull shirt". The

Hon'ble First Court suggested that the packet be removed from the dull shirt and

this suggestion was accepted by the appellant. The appellant has submitted a

storyboard of a version of the impugned advertisement, in which the packet has

been removed from the frame. It is usual for a Court to issue injunction not in a

blanket form as prayed by the plaintiff but in a modified way asking the

defendant to remove some of the objectionable frames from the advertisement.

Therefore, at the highest, the picture frame No.13 at page No.96 of the Stay

Petition, if removed, there would not be a case of disparagement of Tide Naturals

even according to the Hon'ble First Court. Therefore, the injunction restraining

the entire impugned advertisement and not merely for removing the objectionable

frame is bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_65">

</p><p id="p_66">      He further submitted that the following cases support the said contention

that modification orders should be granted in such cases instead of granting

blanket injunction against the whole advertisement:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                        13</span>

           Paras Pharmaceuticals Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>.</blockquote><p id="p_67">



</p><p id="p_68">     Mr. Mitra further contended that on the basis of the ratio of these

judgments, the Hon'ble First Court should have restrained the impugned

advertisement only so long as the packet on the other shirt (Frame No.13 on Page

96 of the Stay Petition) was not changed by removing the packet in that frame

and the Voice Over was not changed from TIDE to TIDE Naturals.



</p><p id="p_69">     He further submitted that the order should be set aside.       It has been

passed without proper application of mind or exercise of sound Judicial

Principles. The order is wrong both in facts and law. It is usual for a Court to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                         14</span>

issue injunction not in a blanket form as prayed by the plaintiff but in a modified

way asking the defendant to remove some of the objectionable frames from the

advertisement. The appellant's legal and constitutional right to claim superiority

in whiteness of RIN vis-à-vis Tide Naturals and publicize such superiority of the

product should not have been taken away by issuing injunction in this form.

In a democratic economy, free flow of commercial information is indispensable.

There cannot be honest and economical purchasing by the public at large

without being educated by the information disseminated through advertisements.

The economic system in a democracy would be handicapped without there being

freedom of commercial speech.       Therefore, any restraint or curtailment of

advertisements would affect the fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">Article 19(1)(a).</a>

Reliance is placed on 1995(5) SCC 139. Further the order in terms of prayer (d)

of the Petition that is to say, not only restraining the impugned advertisement

but also "however otherwise disparaging the Petitioners" product "Tide" or the

petitioner in any manner whatsoever is too wide and uncertain. It is submitted

that the words 'howsoever disparaging the plaintiff's product Tide Naturals or the

petitioner in any manner whatsoever' is too vague and is outside the scope of the

subject matter of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_70">

</p><p id="p_71">      It is further submitted that in granting an injunction against the

defendant/appellant from 'howsoever disparaging the petitioner's produce' can

give rise to frivolous contempt cases against the defendant every time the

plaintiff/respondent is of the view that an advertisement of the defendant's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                         15</span>

produce, in any manner disparages the plaintiff's product. This way, every new

cause of action can be brought within the scope of the impugned order and

serious allegations such as contempt of the Hon'ble Court be made through

contempt cases, so long as the plaintiff feels that the said advertisement is

disparaging in any manner whatsoever, no matter how outrageous or frivolous.

In fact, one such contempt petition, relating to a completely different

advertisement is being heard before the First Court since the respondent/plaintiff

is of the view that such advertisement disparages TIDE Naturals. It is further

submitted that the blanket injunction in terms of prayer (d) is not in conformity

with the reasons and ratio of the judgment.      An order must conform to the

judgment and should not be in variance to the judgment. Reliance is placed on

the judgment reported in 93 CWN 35 (Para 3).
</p>
<p id="p_72">

</p><p id="p_73">      According to Mr. Mitra the advertisement is also in conformity of the

advertising standards council of India (ASCI) which is the industry-created

regulator of advertising. Both the appellant and respondent are promoters and

members of the ASCI. Chapter IV of the 'Code for Self-Regulation in Advertising'

(Code) gives the standards of conduct to tbe maintained in           comparative

advertising. Every advertisement aired in India must adhere to the Code as per

Rule 7 sub-Rule 9 of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994. The impugned

advertisement is in conformity with the provisions of Chapter IV. Reliance is also

placed on 64 (2009) DLT 539 that allows a product to have a comparative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                         16</span>

advertisement in the interest of consumers allowed by the ASCI Code as stated

above.
</p>
<p id="p_74">

</p><p id="p_75">      Mr. S.K. Kapoor, learned Senior advocate appearing on behalf of the

respondents/plaintiffs submitted that in passing the order of injunction, the

Hon'ble Judge has held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_76">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      (a)   The depiction of the child in the dull shirt (representing TIDE)

            followed by a sparkling white shirt and a dull shirt kept side-by-side

            was objectionable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      (b)   It was further aggravated by the Tide packet being imposed on the

            dull shirt as it depicted that white shirt washed by Tide remain dull

            while those washed with Rin acquired sparkling whiteness.



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">      (c)   The defendant/appellant submitted that it was agreeable to remove

            the dullness of the shirt by using brighter and whiter shirt.



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      (d)   The defendant/appellant also agreed to remove the packet of Tide

            natural from the advertisement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">      (e)   Electronic media had a strong impact because of it is being visual

            and reaching out to millions of people.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                            17</span><blockquote id="blockquote_30">




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">      (f)     The voiceover in the advertisement was (misleading) as if referred to

              all Tide Products though displaying the packet of Tide Naturals.



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">      (g)     Removal of the dull shirt and the Tide packet without removal of the

              voiceover would not serve any purpose as the dull shirt will be

              associated with the Tide Lady's child.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">      (h)     The Laboratory Reports referred to in the affidavits were in fact not

              depicted in the advertisement.</blockquote><p id="p_77">



</p><p id="p_78">      In view of the aforesaid, the Hon'ble Judge was of the view that the

advertisement was disparaging        and    objectionable   and passed orders    of

injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_79">

</p><p id="p_80">      According to him, the fact would show that the said advertisement clearly

and unmistakably conveys the message that the plaintiffs/respondents product

TIDE are bad and unfit for the purpose of cleaning clothes. This is done

principally by use of visual images conveying that clothes washed with TIDE

became dull and dignity while clothes allegedly washed with RIN became

sparklingly bright. This clearly sends out the message that TIDE is unfit for

washing clothes and discolours and damages the same.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                         18</span>

</p><p id="p_81">      Mr. Kapoor further submitted that the clear intention of the comparison as

viewed in the impugned advertisement was to speak of the plaintiff/respondent's

products in derogatory terms and in a manner which is understood by the

viewing public to mean that the plaintiff/respondent's product was wholly unfit

and damages clothing instead of clearing them.
</p>
<p id="p_82">

</p><p id="p_83">      He further contended that by portraying the said advertisement that the

white clothes washed with TIDE become dingy, dull and discoloured, the

defendant/appellant has belittled and disparaged the plaintiff/respondent's

product which is not permissible.          The comparisons in the impugned

advertisement are not factually accurate.     It unfairly denigrates, attacks and

discredits the plaintiff/respondent's product, directly and by use of false and

manipulated     images.      The   suggestion    that   TIDE    produce   of   the

plaintiff/respondent is not whitening is false and malicious.



</p><p id="p_84">      Mr. Kapoor further submitted that there is a clear admission that the

advertisement is disparaging as the defendant/appellant volunteered to remove

from the advertisement the dull, dingy/discoloured shirt used to depict the

plaintiff/respondent's product and the packet of Tide Natural. Hence, it cannot

be contended that the advertisement was not disparaging and there can be no

question of justification.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                          19</span><p id="p_85">

</p><p id="p_86">      He further contended that in doing so the Hon'ble Judge has followed the

correct legal tests as laid down in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman Vs. M.P.

Ramchandran reported in (19 PTC 741 at page 746) and in the case of <a href="/doc/149097745/" id="a_12">Heinz

India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd</a>. reported in

2009 (2) CHN 479.
</p>
<p id="p_87">

</p><p id="p_88">      He contended that the law is well settled and sole question to be decided is

whether the advertisement       complained of disparages the product of the

plaintiff/respondent or not?
</p>
<p id="p_89">

</p><p id="p_90">      He further contended that the Hon'ble Judge has correctly exercised its

discretion and in accordance with settled principles of law. It is a well settled

principle that an Appellate Court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion

of the Trial Court on any factual matters simply on the ground that after

assessing the materials it would have itself arrived at any different conclusion

from that of the Trial Court unless, of course, it finds such conclusions to be

wholly perverse [2009 (2) CHN 479].
</p>
<p id="p_91">

</p><p id="p_92">      He further contended that the appellant can never possibly justify its

depiction of white clothes being washed with TIDE turning dull and dingy.



</p><p id="p_93">      Mr. Kapoor submitted that the appellant never sought to justify this. What

the appellant has tried to justify is that its product gives superior whiteness
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                          20</span>

which is wholly avoiding the plaintiff's grievance - this is of no consequence at

all. The question is whether the defendant/appellant was entitled to portray the

plaintiff/defendant's products as being unfit by use of the said visual images

which show that white clothes washed with Tide become dull, dingy and

discoloured. In view of the law as mentioned above, this is not permissible.



</p><p id="p_94">      He further contended that this cannot be decided on affidavit at the

interlocutory stage but at the trial. In support of this he relied on 42 PTC 88

(<a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_13">Dabur vs. Colortek Meghalaya</a>); 2009 (2) CHN 479 and 2007 (2) CHN 44 at

para 19.
</p>
<p id="p_95">

</p><p id="p_96">      It is further submitted that no damages had been claimed in the suit, nor

was leave under Order 2 Rule 2 has been obtained. He contended that the plea of

justification is not available at the interlocutory stage. Appellant has only claimed

superiority without rubbishing plaintiff's goods. The advertisement has clearly

rubbished the plaintiff's product by showing that white clothes turn dull and

dingy and are discoloured on washing with TIDE. It is well settled that this is not

permissible. In support of this learned counsel relied on White vs. Mellin's (1895

AC 154) and Reckitt &amp; Coleman's (19 PTC 741).
</p>
<p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">      Mr. Kapoor again submitted that where the impugned advertisement

"proceeds to make assertions of fact which it claims to be backed by scientific

date tending to show that the respondent's products is not suitable for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                           21</span>

intended purpose, it falls within the realm of actionable disparagement" [(2009) 2

CHN 479].     Thus it is settled that such questions of proof of falsity are to be

decided at the trial and not at the interlocutory stage.



</p><p id="p_99">        He further submitted that the advertisement is modified and a new story

board has been adduced to the stay petition. Admittedly, this was not before the

Trial   Court.    The   Hon'ble   Judge    has    stated   in     the   judgment   that

removal/changing of some offending portions would not do and on such basis

rejected the same and that the removal of some images would be inadequate as

the dull shirt would still be associated with TIDE.
</p>
<p id="p_100">

</p><p id="p_101">        Mr. Kapoor further contended that modification/editing of advertisement

by Court cannot be said to be permissible or an accepted proposition of law.

Hence he submitted that this appeal should be dismissed.



</p><p id="p_102">        It is submitted that in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. Vs.

M.P. Ramchandran reported in (1999) 19 PTC page 741 the learned Judge

summarized the law in the following terms :-
</p>
<p id="p_103">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">              "A tradesman cannot, while saying that his goods are better than his
        competitors, say that his competitors' goods are bad. If he says so, he really
        slanders the goods of his competitors.      In other words he defames his
        competitors and their goods, which is not permissible."</blockquote><p id="p_104">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                         22</span>

</p><p id="p_105">      The learned Judge went on to say that if there is no defamation to the

goods or to the manufacturers of such goods, no action lies. The Division Bench

of this Court presided over by S.S.Nijjar, C.J., (as His Lordship then was)

approved of the same and followed these principles in the case of Heniz India

Private Limited Vs. Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited reported

in (2009) 2 CHN 479.
</p>
<p id="p_106">

</p><p id="p_107">      After considering the facts and circumstances of this case we find that the

tests are well settled and sole question to be decided is whether the

advertisement complained of disparages the product of the plaintiff or not ? This

is a factual aspect which has to be proved in each case.           It is accepted

proposition of law applied by the Trial Court in coming to the conclusion.



</p><p id="p_108">      At the outset, we were invited to view the advertisement on the computer

and we have had the advantage of viewing the advertisement. In our opinion, the

advertisement clearly shows that a comparison is sought to be drawn between

the respondent's product and that of the plaintiff. In doing so it appear to us

that the respondent tried to denigrate the product of the appellant and it has

given a message to the viewer that the product of the appellant is bogus one.



</p><p id="p_109">      There is an indication that the respondent's product is inferior in quality

than that of the appellant. In 1999 PTC (19) 741 (supra) the Court has laid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                            23</span>

down five principles as a guiding factor for grant of an injunction of the nature as

prayed for herein which are as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_110">

</p><p id="p_111">      "I. A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the world even
though the declaration is untrue.
</p><p id="p_112">      II. He can also say that my goods are better than his competitors', even
though such statement is untrue.
</p><p id="p_113">      III. For the purpose of saying that his goods are the best in the world or his
goods are better than his competitors' he can even compare the advantages of his
goods over the goods of the others.
</p><p id="p_114">      IV. He, however, cannot while saying his goods are better than his
competitors', say that his competitors' goods are bad.     If he says so, he really
slanders the goods of his competitors. In other word he defames his competitors
and their goods, which is not permissible.
</p><p id="p_115">      V. If there is no defamation, to the goods or to the manufacturer of such
goods no action lies, but if there is such defamation, then the court is also
competent to grant an order of injunction restraining repetition of such defamation."



</p><p id="p_116">      Therefore, after taking into account the principles settled by the Court it

appears to us that such comparison which has been made by the respondent is

not permissible under the law.        In our considered opinion, the representation

made by the appellant is only to denigrate the product of the plaintiff by such

advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_117">

</p><p id="p_118">      In the facts and circumstances of this case, we find at this stage that

disparagement has been done by viewing the said advertisement on T.V.

Channels by the appellant and in our considered opinion, the appellant has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                           24</span>

acted within the principles laid down by the Court and hence, we do not find that

there is any illegality or irregularity in the order so passed by the Hon'ble First

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_119">
</p><p id="p_120">      The Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court in 2009(2) CHN 479 (Heinz

India Private Limited Vs. Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited &amp; Ors.)

held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_121">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">            "What emerges from the aforesaid discussion by the House of Lords
      as a principle seems to be that a tradesman can say that his goods are
      better than those of the rival. In that sense, better would mean in regard to
      the purpose for which the goods are intended. In so doing it is permissible to
      emphasise one or the other qualities being better than the quality of the rival
      product. Every extravagant statement may imply disparagement of the goods
      of others in the same field. Such disparagement is not actionable. In order to
      constitute actionable disparagement, the plaintiff must show, that the
      defendant's representations were made about the plaintiffs goods, the
      statements were untrue and they were disparaging the goods of the plaintiff
      and that they have caused special damages to the plaintiff."</blockquote><p id="p_122">



</p><p id="p_123">      In "Dabur India Ltd. case" (supra) a learned Single Judge of the Delhi

High Court held that "It is one thing to say that the defendant's product is better

than that of the plaintiff and it is another thing to say that the plaintiff's product

in inferior to that of the defendant. This will always happen in a case of

comparison. It is permissible for an advertiser to proclaim that its product is the

best." On the other hand, "disparagement of a product should be defamatory or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                          25</span>

should border on defamation. In other words, the degree of disparagement must,

be such that it would tantamount to, or almost tantamount to defamation." In

Pepsico Inc. (supra) again a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court has

held that "it is well known law that merely puffing is not dishonest and mere

'poking fun' at a competitor is a normal practice of comparative advertising and is

acceptable in the market." It is further observed that "In order to succeed in an

action, the plaintiffs have to establish the following key elements:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">      1. A false or misleading statement of fact about a product.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">      2. That statement either deceived, or had the capacity to         deceive, a
           substantial segment of potential consumer, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">      3.     The deception was material, in that it was likely to influence
           consumer's purchasing decisions."</blockquote><p id="p_124">



</p><p id="p_125">      It is also held in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. Vs. Kiwi

T.T.K., 1996 PTC (16) 393 as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_126">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">              "The settled law on the subject appears to be that a manufacturer is
      entitled to make a statement that his goods are the best and also make some
      statements for puffing of his goods and the same will not give a cause of
      action to other traders or manufacturers of similar goods to institute
      proceedings as there is no disparagement or defamation to the goods of the
      manufacturer so doing. However, a manufacturer is not entitled to say that
      his competitor's goods are bad so as to puff and promote his goods. It,
      however, appears that if an action lies for defamation an injunction may be
      granted."</blockquote><p id="p_127">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                           26</span>



</p><p id="p_128">        We have examined the entire issue on the basis of well-recognized

principles of law as indicated above. On a prima facie view of the advertisement it

is apparent that intention has been shown by the appellant to disparage or

denigrate or to defame the product of the respondent.



</p><p id="p_129">        At this ad-interim stage it appears to us that the rival claims of the parties

are still in fluid state. In our opinion, discretion has not been shown to have been

exercised by the Hon'ble Trial Court arbitrarily or capriciously or perversely

ignoring the settled principles of law regulating the grant of injunction in this

case.
</p>
<p id="p_130">

</p><p id="p_131">        Accordingly, we do not find at this stage any illegality or irregularity in

respect of the order so passed by the Hon'ble First Court and accordingly, we do

not find any reason to interfere with the discretion so exercised by His Lordship

in granting the interim relief.
</p>
<p id="p_132">

</p><p id="p_133">        We see no justification to interfere with the impugned order of the Hon'ble

Judge and we find no merit in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_134">
