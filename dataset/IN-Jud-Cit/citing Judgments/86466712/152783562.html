            ORDER UNDER SECTION 26 (1) OF COMPETITION ACT, 2002

1.</pre><p id="p_1">    The present information has been filed by Matrix Info Systems Pvt. Ltd. (the
      'Informant') under Section 19 (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_1">Competition Act</a>, 2002 (the 'Act'), against


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                        1</span>
      Intel Corporation ('Opposite Party No. 1/ OP-1') and Intel Technology India Pvt. Ltd.
     ('Opposite Party No. 2/ OP-2'), alleging contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_2">Sections 3</a>
     and <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_3">4</a> of the Act (hereinafter, OP-1 and OP-2 collectively referred to as 'Intel').
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.   The Informant is a Delhi based Information Technology ('IT') trading company which
     is engaged in the business of importing, wholesaling, distributing and supplying a wide
     range of IT products. OP-1 is a leading multinational corporation and technology
     company incorporated in USA which is engaged in the activities of designing and
     manufacturing of a wide range of IT components, peripherals, computer systems, etc. as
     well as manufacturing and distribution of electronic devices relating to communications
     and computing including micro-processors etc. OP-2 is an Indian subsidiary of OP-1.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   As per the information, in the ordinary course, IT products are sold in India by sellers
     and/ or re-sellers, by purchasing the same either directly from the manufacturing
     company or through distributors, either in India or abroad. Most of the IT products come
     with manufacturer's warranty, which is generally worldwide. However, as per the
     Informant, over past few years, big IT companies like OP-1 have entered into exclusive
     agreements with certain sellers/ distributors and appointed them as their authorised
     sellers, who directly sell the IT products of such companies to the consumers in India
     with a country-specific manufacturer's warranty instead of worldwide warranty.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   The Informant has stated itself to be a parallel importer of Intel Micro-processors in
     India, which is allowed under the Indian law. As per the Informant, parallel imports are
     beneficial for the consumers as import of goods from a country with lower prices force
     sellers in the country of destination to reduce prices. The Informant has stated that it
     imports Intel Micro-processors from OP-1's authorised distributors in other countries
     and sells the same to consumers in India at highly competitive prices.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.   As per the Informant, prior to 2016, Intel used to provide manufacturer's warranty
     within India on its Boxed Micro-Processors that may have been purchased from any
     country in the world. However, w.e.f. 25.04.2016, Intel amended its warranty policy for
     India. As per this new policy, Intel would entertain warranty requests for Intel Boxed
     Micro-processors in India only when the same are purchased from an authorised Indian
     distributor of Intel that too within the country. As a result of this country-specific
     warranty for India, Intel does not acknowledge warranty requests on its Boxed Micro-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                        2</span>
<p id="p_6">      Processors that are purchased from anywhere else in the world (even if these purchases
     are made from the authorised distributors of Intel in other nations). In support, the
     Informant has placed on record various communications that took place between the
     Informant and OP-2. As per the Informant, in some communications, OP-2 has even
     falsely alleged that such Micro-Processors are products of Original Equipment
     Manufacturers ('OEMs') i.e. Tray Micro-processors, which are different from Boxed
     Micro-processors, to avoid acknowledging the warranty.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   The Informant has stated that such change has been made by Intel without any
     legitimate justification and Intel has been behaving in a differential manner with the
     Indian market. As per the Informant, such separate warranty terms of Intel for India vis-
     Ã -vis the rest of the world, is arbitrary and unfair towards the Indian market and
     consumers. Quoting the statement of Mr. Rajiv Bhalla, Director, Direct and Channel
     Sales, Intel South Asia, published in Digit.in on 25.04.2016, the Informant has averred
     that by adopting this new Indian specific warranty policy, Intel only intends to protect
     the market share of its own authorised distributors in India.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   As per the Informant, because of this change in the warranty policy, Indian customers
     would be forced to purchase Intel's Boxed Micro-Processors only from the authorised
     distributors of Intel in India in order to avail the after-sales warranty within the country.
     This limits the choice of customers as to whom they can buy from and also affects the
     business of independent resellers and parallel importers like the Informant. Further, such
     policy change would give OP-2's Indian authorised distributors a position of power to
     sell Intel's Boxed Micro-Processors at higher prices. The Informant has claimed that
     though it may be possible to claim warranty on Intel's Boxed Micro-Processors
     purchased from outside the country by sending these abroad, it may not be feasible to do
     so on account of cross-border restrictions and cost and time implications. Hence, as per
     the Informant, such change in its warranty policy by Intel is abusive in nature and anti-
     competitive under the provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   The Informant has delineated the relevant product market as 'market for sale of boxed
     Micro-processors for Desktop and Laptop Personal Computers ('PCs')' and relevant
     geographic market as 'India'. As per the Informant, in terms of the factors contained in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                             3</span>
      <a href="/doc/702674/" id="a_4">Section 19</a> (3) of the Act, Intel holds a dominant position in the relevant market for 'sale
     of Boxed Micro-processors for Desktop and Laptop PCs in India'.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   The Informant has alleged violation of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> (2) (a) (i) of the Act by Intel as it
     imposes unfair and discriminatory conditions that warranty shall be provided only when
     a Boxed Micro-processor is purchased in India from its authorised Indian distributor and
     does not cover any other resale or imported products. Further, the Informant has alleged
     violation of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_6">Section 4</a> (2) (c) of the Act by Intel as Intel limits and restricts the business
     of other resellers and parallel importers and denies market access to them by not
     providing them warranty on Intel's Boxed Micro-Processors in India when not
     purchased from the authorised distributors of Intel. Relying on the observation of the
     Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/65387483/" id="a_7">Competition Commission of India v. Fast Way Transmission
     Pvt. Ltd. and Others</a>, (2018) 4 SCC 316, the Informant has submitted that even though
     the independent resellers and/ or parallel importers are not the competitors of Intel, yet
     denial of market access to them due to unreasonable condition of warranty put by Intel,
     is sufficient enough for applicability of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> (2) (c) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10. The Informant has also levelled allegations of contravention of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> of the Act
     against Intel. As per the Informant, the exclusive agreement between OP-2 and its
     authorised Indian distributors which gives them exclusive selling rights in India is
     violative of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> (4) (c) of the Act. This imposition of condition to purchase from
     only certain sellers/ distributors for claiming warranty in India and imposition of blanket
     ban on after-sales warranties if purchased from other sources is resulting in total
     deprivation of consumer choice which is also violative of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_11">Section 3</a> (4)
</p><p id="p_12">     (d) of the Act. Further, Intel's restriction on independent resellers and/ or parallel
     importers, by not acknowledging the warranty on Intel's Boxed Micro-Processors
     purchased from sellers other than Intel authorised distributors in India and falsely
     claiming such products to be OEM products (i.e. Tray Micro-processor), is violative of
     <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> (4) (e) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11. As per the Informant, Intel is indirectly imposing unfair disadvantage on the
     independent resellers for selling Intel Boxed Micro-Processors at lower prices in
     comparison to Intel's authorised distributors. Such conduct of Intel and its agreement




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                             4</span>
      with its Indian authorised sellers/ distributors is causing an appreciable adverse effect on
     competition ('AAEC') in terms of <a href="/doc/702674/" id="a_13">Section 19</a> (3) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12. Based on the aforesaid averments and allegations, the Informant has filed the present
     information against Intel, alleging contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_14">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_15">4</a> of
     the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13. After considering the information filed by the Informant in its ordinary meeting dated
     19.03.2019, the Commission decided to call the parties for a preliminary conference.
     One day before the date of preliminary conference, Intel filed its preliminary response
     dated 01.07.2019, to the information filed by the Informant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14. In its response, Intel has stated that no contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_16">Section 4</a> of
     the Act is made out against it. As per Intel, 'warranty' and 'warranty service' are two
     distinct concepts. Contrary to the Informant's allegations, Intel offers a 3 year limited
     warranty on all genuine Boxed Micro-processors. Under its new India specific warranty
     policy, it is only the 'warranty service' which cannot be availed in India if the Boxed
     Micro-processors are not purchased from Intel's authorised distributors in India.
     However, for such Boxed Micro-processors purchased from outside India, warranty
     service can be claimed from the place of purchase. As per Intel, such India specific
     warranty policy for Boxed Micro-processors of Intel is compatible with the Indian legal
     position. Reliance in this regard was placed on the decision of the Commission in <a href="/doc/140907210/" id="a_17">Mr.
     Ashish Ahuja v. Snapdeal</a>.com and Another, Case No. 17 of 2014 decided on
     19.05.2014. Intel has claimed that its new warranty policy is more permissive as under
     the same, Intel not only offers warranty on all genuine Boxed Micro-processors,
     whether purchased from authorised or unauthorised distributors, but also offers warranty
     service on all genuine Boxed Micro-processors at the place of purchase. Further, as per
     Intel, the legal position in India is that a manufacturer is entitled to refuse warranty
     service on products purchased from unauthorised distributors. In this regard, reliance
     has been placed on a judgment of Ld. Division Bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court
     in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_18">Kapil Wadhwa and Others v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Another</a>, 194 (2012)
     DLT 23.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15. As per Intel, no violation of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_19">Section 4</a> (2) (a) of the Act is made out as Intel's India
     specific warranty policy for Boxed Micro-processors applies to all purchasers in India


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                            5</span>
      and there is no discriminatory treatment by Intel in this regard. Further, as per Intel,
     there is no violation of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_20">Section 4</a> (2) (c) of the Act by Intel as the Informant itself, after
     change of warranty policy by Intel, has imported multiple Intel Boxed Micro-processors
     in India which evidently shows that there is no denial of market access by Intel.
</p>
<p id="p_18">16. Intel has also stated that the information filed by the Informant lacks evidence and no
     contravention of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_21">Section 3</a> (4) (c), 3 (4) (d) or 3 (4) (e) is made out against Intel. As per
     Intel, its authorised distributors are not exclusive in as much as they may sell Micro-
     processors of any other brand as well. Further, the prices at which they sell their Micro-
     Processors in India are also not set or controlled by Intel.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17. Intel has further stated that the information does not demonstrate any AAEC in India or
     meets the requirements of <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_22">Section 32</a> of the Act. Intel has averred that the entire claim
     of the Informant is based on Intel allegedly refusing to entertain its warranty service
     claims on two Boxed Micro-processors in India. As per Intel, the Informant had placed
     requests to replace 34 Micro-processors in toto. Out of the same, 29 were replaced by
     Intel, 3 were denied on the ground of being Tray Micro-processors and only on 2 Micro-
     processors, the Informant sought warranty service in India which was refused by Intel to
     be given in India. Intel has submitted when these 2 refusals are seen in the light of the
     total import of Micro-processors made in India (around 2.93 million units in 2018-19),
     the number is insignificant, thereby, demonstrating the lack of AAEC in India.
</p>
<p id="p_20">18. Further, explaining the reason for its India specific warranty, Intel has stated that India
     has a large unorganised sector engaged in computer manufacturing and assembly, which
     is serviced both by authorised distributors of IT products and peripherals as well as
     grey/ parallel market importers. It is not uncommon in India for importers to import
     goods by underinvoicing; or to import old and salvaged parts disguised as new products.
     Even the Informant has imported such underinvoiced and old products including Intel
     Micro-processors, in violation of India's export-import ('EXIM') Policy and has been
     penalised for the same by the Commissioner of Customs (Import). Even otherwise, the
     Informant has been the subject of a variety of investigations. It is to protect its
     customers from such undervalued and old products, that Intel has its exclusive India-
     specific warranty policy. Through such policy, Intel seeks to ensure that its customers
     purchase Intel's Boxed Micro-processors only through Intel's authorised distributors in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                             6</span>
      India. Intel makes investment and incurs cost to ensure that its authorised distributors in
     India provide quality service to the customers. By procuring their requirements from
     authorised distributors, customers are aware that Intel Boxed Micro-processors
     purchased by them are authentic, new and not used products. Thus, as per Intel, its India
     specific warranty policy has legitimate business justifications and the same does not
     impair genuine undistorted competition in any market.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19. Further, as per Intel, by not disclosing such material facts to the Commission, the
     Informant has approached the Commission with unclean hands. Intel has also taken a
     technical objection with regard to the Affidavit filed by the Informant in support of its
     information and failure on the part of the Informant to file a certificate under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_23">Section
     65B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 ('IEA') in support of certain documents relied
     upon by it as Annexures to its information.
</p>
<p id="p_22">20. On 02.07.2019, the Commission held a preliminary conference with the Informant and
     the Opposite Parties. The learned counsel for the Informant also showed to the
     Commission a comparison of rates of Intel Boxed Micro-processors in different
     countries including in India in support of its contentions. Thereafter on 05.07.2019, the
     Informant filed a certificate under Section 65B of the IEA in support of Annexure O of
     its information.
</p>
<p id="p_23">21. The Commission has considered aforesaid submissions of the parties made in writing as
     well as orally during the preliminary conference and has analysed the documents and
     caselaws placed on record by both the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_24">22. The Commission notes that the Informant has filed the present information alleging
     contravention of the provisions of both <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_24">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_25">4</a> of the Act. The Commission
     first proceeds to analyse the allegations of the Informant in terms of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_26">Section 4</a> of the
     Act. The Informant seems to be primarily aggrieved with the India specific warranty
     policy of Intel on its Boxed Micro-processors according to which, Intel does not provide
     warranty service within India for products that are not purchased in the country from its
     authorised Indian distributors.
</p>
<p id="p_25">23. With regard to the Relevant Product Market, the Commission notes that Micro-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     processor is a distinct product in itself not substitutable with any other product. Further,
     the Commission notes that it is also well recognised that there is no substitutability or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                            7</span>
      interchangeability of Micro-processors across end products as has been held by the
     Commission in its two prior cases involving Intel i.e. the ESYS Information
     Technologies case (supra) and in the order dated 09.11.2018 passed in Case No. 16 of
     2018 titled <a href="/doc/140203472/" id="a_27">Velankani Electronics Private Limited v. Intel Corporation</a>. Further, the
     Commission notes that Micro-processors also can be classified into two categories -
     Boxed Micro-Processors and Tray Micro-processors. Tray Micro-processors are the
     ones which Intel makes as per the requirement of the OEMs for their assembly line/
     manufacturing activities and Boxed Micro-processors are the ones which are sold by
     Intel in the open market. Intel does not provide direct warranty support on Tray
     Processors but rather the OEM or the reseller has to be contacted for seeking warranty
     support. However, warranty on Boxed Processors is provided by Intel only. Thus, the
     Commission is of the prima facie opinion that since in the present case, the end products
     being dealt with by the Informant are Desktops and Laptops, the relevant product
     markets in the present case may be taken as market for 'Boxed Micro-processors for
     Desktop PCs' and market for 'Boxed Micro-processors for Laptop PCs'.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">24. With regard to the relevant geographic market, the Commission notes that the Informant
     has alleged that Intel has changed its warranty policy specifically for India, thereby
     limiting purchases from Indian authorised distributors only for claiming Intel warranty
     service in India. Given the fact that in the present case, the Indian market and Indian
     consumers seem to have been affected and the competition conditions within the
     territory of India are homogenous, the Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the
     relevant geographic market in the present case would be the 'territory of India'.
</p>
<p id="p_27">25. Therefore, the Commission prima facie opines that the relevant markets in the present
     case would be"the market for Boxed Micro-processors for Desktop PCs in the territory
     of India" and "the market for Boxed Micro-processors for Laptop PCs in the territory of
     India".
</p>
<p id="p_28">26. On the issue of dominance, the Commission notes that in the case of ESYS Information
     Technologies (supra), the Commission had found Intel to be in a dominant position in
     the relevant markets of Micro-processors for desktops PCs in India as well as the
     relevant market of Micro-processors of mobile/ portable PCs such as laptops,
     notebooks, net-books, etc. in India. In the present case also, the Informant has placed on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                          8</span>
      record and furnished sufficient evidence in the form of Gartner's Supply Chain List of
     2018, Research Bulletin by IC Insights, Passmark Report dated 16.12.2018, statement of
     Dell's CTO John Roese and Annual Reports of the OPs and of its competitor AMD,
     which prima facie establishes that Intel is in a dominant position in the markets of
     Micro-processors for Desktop and Laptop PCs in the territory of India.
</p>
<p id="p_29">27. Further, the Commission notes that segmented data with regard to the market share of
     Intel in the Boxed and Tray Micro-processors segment is not available on record.
     However, the Informant's documents on record show that the market share of Intel is at
     least three times the market share of its only competitor in the Micro-processors market
     i.e. AMD. Further, the information available does not show that AMD specialises in
     either the Tray or the Boxed Micro-processor market. Therefore, it can safely be
     assumed that even in the segregated market of Boxed Micro-processors for Desktop and
     Laptop PCs respectively in the territory of India, Intel would be having a high market
     share. Furthermore, in terms of other factors stated in <a href="/doc/702674/" id="a_28">Section 19</a> (4) of the Act such as
     significant economic power of Intel; dependence of consumers on Intel; high entry
     barriers in the market; no countervailing buying power etc., the Commission notes that
     the dominant position of Intel in the markets of Micro-processors for Desktops and
     Laptop PCs in India is prima facie, established.
</p>
<p id="p_30">28. Now that the dominant position of Intel in the delineated relevant markets is prima facie
     established, the Commission proceeds to analyse the allegations of abuse of dominance
     made by the Informant against Intel.
</p>
<p id="p_31">29. The Commission notes from the Intel website that the worldwide warranty policy of
     Intel for Boxed Micro-processors (which was also the erstwhile warranty policy in
     India) is as follows:
</p>

              Material Authorization (RMA) number and instructions for returning the
             Product. ..."
</blockquote><p id="p_32">     On the other hand, the warranty policy of Intel for Boxed Micro-processors in India is as
     follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "HOW TO OBTAIN WARRANTY SERVICE
             You may contact your place of purchase or you may contact Intel by
             calling an Intel Customer Support (ICS) center during business hours.
             Only Intel Products sold by Intel Authorised Distributors in India and
             purchased in India are eligible for warranty service within India. The
             list of Intel Authorized Distributors in India is located at https://www-
             ssl.intel.com/content/www/xa/en/resellers/where-to-buy/overview.html.
             For Intel products purchased from other sources, please contact your

             contact details; (2) proof of purchase; (3) model name and Product

             information if necessary. If ICS confirms that the Product is eligible for
             warranty service, you will receive a Return Material Authorization
             (RMA) number and instructions for returning the Product. ... "
</blockquote><p id="p_33">30. From the above, the Commission notes that in the new warranty policy of Intel for India
     which came into effect from 25.04.2016, admittedly, the change that has been brought
     about is that only Intel Boxed Micro-Processors sold by Intel Authorised Distributors in
     India and purchased in India are eligible for warranty service in India. Though Intel
     would continue to provide warranty services on Boxed Micro-processors purchased
     through sources other than its authorised Indian distributors, unlike in other countries,
     such warranty service cannot be claimed by the purchasers directly in India by
     contacting Intel. Instead, the purchaser would have to seek warranty from the seller
     who, in turn, can contact Intel. This would be so even when the Boxed Micro-
     Processors of Intel are purchased/ imported in India from an authorised distributor of
     Intel located outside India.
</p>
<p id="p_34">31. The Commission further notes that Mr. Rajiv Bhalla, Director, Direct and Channel
     Sales, Intel South Asia, in his statement published in Digit.in on 25.04.2016 has offered
     the following explanation for such change in warranty policy that "Intel Authorised
     Distributors play a key role in our overall market strategy, which includes ensuring that
     authorized Intel Products are sold in India. The revised warranty policy ensures that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                        10</span>
      our customers will not only enjoy the authentic Intel Products purchased through our
     authorized distributors here, but also ensures an amazing service and after sales
     experience that will keep them coming back to our authorised distributors for future
     purchases."
</p>
<p id="p_35">32. Further, the Commission also notes that Intel, during the preliminary conference, has
     tried to give a commercial justification for introduction of such differentiated warranty
     policy for India. Intel has stated that in India, there is a large unorganised market and
     parallel importers (like the Informant) often underinvoice goods or import old and
     salvaged parts disguised as new products. Thereafter, when the product stops working,
     Intel receives requests for replacement of such old and used products. This, according to
     Intel, not only creates a burden upon it as it only has limited number of service centres
     in India, but also affects the consumers' interest adversely.
</p>
<p id="p_36">33. The Commission notes that under its new India specific warranty policy with regard to
     Boxed Micro-Processors, Intel does not offer warranty service to consumers in India, on
     products purchased by them from the parallel importers, even when such parallel
     imports have been made from authorised distributors of Intel abroad. For claiming
     service on such warranty, the purchasers have to contact Intel at the place of purchase
     only. The Informant has stated that though it may be possible to claim warranty on
     foreign purchased Intel Boxed Micro-Processors from outside the country, it may not be
     practical to do so on account of cross-border restrictions, cost and time implications etc.
     Further, the Commission notes that it has been contended by Intel that the business of
     parallel importers in India has not been affected by the new warranty policy of Intel in
     India, as can be seen from the imports made by the Informant recently. The
     Commission, however, is of the prima facie view that imports made by one single entity
     cannot be the sole criteria to assess the AAEC caused by the change in Intel's warranty
     policy in India.
</p>
<p id="p_37">34. Thus, the Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the India specific warranty
     policy of Intel has the potential to lead to denial of market access to the parallel
     importers and resellers of Intel Boxed Micro-Processors in India, who are competitors
     of Intel's Indian authorised distributors. The Commission also notes that the Informant
     has also made allegations that on some occasions, Intel has even falsely alleged that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                          11</span>
      Micro-Processors sought to be replaced by the Informant are products of OEMs i.e.
     Tray Micro-processors to avoid acknowledging the warranty.
</p>
<p id="p_38">35. The Commission is also of the prima facie opinion that such differentiated warranty
     policy of Intel in India also limits the choice for the Indian consumers. They may not be
     able to buy Intel Boxed Micro-processors from multiple sources because Intel would not
     provide direct warranty service in India if the Boxed Micro-processors are purchased
     from a seller other than an authorised Indian distributor of Intel in India. Rather, the
     consumer would have to contact the seller for claiming warranty. Such would be the
     situation even if the consumers purchase the product from an authorised Intel distributor
     but from outside India. In such circumstances, the consumers in India would only have
     the benefit of claiming seller's warranty and not manufacturer's warranty, unless they
     purchase their product from an authorised Intel distributor in India.
</p>
<p id="p_39">36. In the absence of competition from parallel importers, may lead to the risk of prevalence
     of higher prices for Intel Boxed Micro-Processors in India. The Commission notes that
     during the preliminary conference, the Informant has provided a comparison of rates as
     on 29.06.2019 of one type of Intel's Boxed Micro-processor (Intel i3-8300 Micro-
     processor) offered by Intel's authorised distributors in India and outside India, which are
     as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                   Country Price (INR)
                                    India    29,610
                                    Japan    18,344
                                    USA      11,307
                                   Germany   11,757
     From the above, it can be seen that the rates offered in India for the same product by
     Intel's authorised distributors in India is almost 2 times the rates offered by Intel's
     authorised distributors outside India. In fact, the Informant has argued during the
     preliminary conference that the rates at which it imports Intel's Boxed Micro-processors
     from Intel's authorised distributors outside India even when increased by the
     Informant's own profit margin, still offer price competition to the Boxed Micro-
</blockquote><p id="p_40">     processors sold by the Indian authorised distributors of Intel. Though Intel has argued
     during the preliminary conference that the prices at which Intel's authorised distributors
     in India sell their Micro-Processors are not set or controlled by Intel, the Commission


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                          12</span>
      observes that the new warranty policy of Intel in India seems to be aimed at
     disincentivising the purchase of Intel Micro-Processors from distributors other than
     Intel's authorised distributors in India even though purchased from Intel's authorised
     distributors abroad at cheaper rates. This has the effect of raising prices offered by Intel
     authorised distributors in India.
</p>
<p id="p_41">37. Therefore, in the prima facie opinion of the Commission, the distinction made by Intel
     by means of its new India specific warranty policy between the products purchased in
     India from Intel domestic authorised distributors and those purchased from Intel's
     foreign authorised distributors, is prima facie unfair and discriminatory, especially when
     seen in the light of the fact that such differential treatment is not meted out by Intel in
     other jurisdictions.
</p>
<p id="p_42">38. Further, the Commission notes that Intel has argued that its warranty policy is
     compatible with the Indian legal position by placing reliance on the Commission's
     decision in Ashish Ahuja (supra). The Commission however, observes that the facts of
     the said case are entirely different from the present case. In that case, it was not the
     situation that SanDisk would not provide warranty services on products purchased from
     authorised distributors of SanDisk merely because the purchases are made from outside
     India. Further, in that case, SanDisk did not limit its warranty policy in any particular
     country/ ies. Furthermore, the Commission notes that Intel has also placed reliance on a
     judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Kapil Wadhwa (supra) to contend that a
     manufacturer is entitled to refuse warranty service on products purchased from
     unauthorised distributors. However, the Commission, on perusal of the said judgment
     finds that in that case, refusal of warranty in India by Samsung was held by the Hon'ble
     Court to be justified in the circumstances that no warranty on those products was
     provided by the manufacturer Samsung, even in the country from which they were
     imported by the Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_43">39. The Commission also notes that even the above-extracted statement of Mr. Rajiv Bhalla,
     Director, Direct and Channel Sales, Intel South Asia, hints that the change in warranty
     policy by Intel in India has been brought about only to protect the market share of
     Intel's authorised distributors in India. Further, the Commission observes that the
     justification offered by Intel for introducing this differentiated warranty policy for India



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                           13</span>
      by stating that old and salvaged Micro-Processors are being sold as new by unauthorised
     sellers in India, also does not seem to be prima facie acceptable. Such problems of
     counterfeit goods/ sale of old products disguised as new may be subsisting in various
     parts of the world and not in India alone. Further, merely because Intel may have
     received a few requests in India for replacement of some old Boxed Micro-processors
     which may have been sold as new, Intel cannot, in a market as large as India, subject
     every consumer and/ or parallel importer/ reseller to suffer the inconvenience of
     claiming its warranty service outside India, even if the product is eventually purchased
     from an Intel authorised distributor, but outside India. Further, in the digital world
     today, technology may enable quick verification by Intel of such counterfeit, old or used
     products.
</p>
<p id="p_44">40. Thus, the Commission is of the view that such conduct and unfair warranty policy of
     Intel in India, with respect to its Boxed Micro-processors, prima facie amounts to abuse
     of dominant position by Intel in contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_29">Section 4</a> of the Act.
     The contention of Intel in this regard that it has not denied to provide warranty in India
     but only 'warranty service' in India is of no avail.
</p>
<p id="p_45">41. With regard to the alleged contravention under <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_30">Section 3</a> of the Act, the Commission
     notes that the Informant has alleged that the vertical agreement entered into between
     Intel and its authorised distributors in India is anti-competitive under the provisions of
     <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_31">Section 3</a> (4) of the Act, being in the nature of exclusive distribution agreement,
     amounting to refusal to deal as well as amounting to resale price maintenance. The
     Commission in this regard notes that during the preliminary conference, Intel has
     already stated that the agreement between Intel and its authorised distributors is not in
     the nature of exclusive distribution agreement and its authorised distributors may sell
     Micro-processors of any brand. Further, the Commission observes that the Informant's
     grievances are mainly in regard to change in the warranty policy of Intel in India upon
     its Boxed Micro-Processors. Therefore, in the opinion of the Commission, a prima facie
     case of contravention of even <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_32">Section 3</a> (4) of the Act also is not made out in the present
     matter.
</p>
<p id="p_46">42. Lastly, regarding Intel's contentions that the Informant has approached the Commission
     with unclean hands, the Commission observes that the said allegation has no bearing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Case No. 05 of 2019                                                                         14</span>
      upon the merits of the present case as the proceedings before the Commission are in rem
     and not in personam. Antecedents of the Informant cannot be a ground for the
     Commission to not take cognizance of an abusive conduct of any entity. Further,
     regarding Intel's contention that the Informant has failed to file a certificate under
     Section 65B of the IEA, the Commission observes that the Informant has already filed a
     certificate under Section 65B of the IEA on 05.07.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_47">43. Based on the above analysis of the facts and materials presented by the Informant and
     Intel, the Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the new differentiated India
     specific warranty policy of Intel in regard to its Boxed Micro-Processors is in
     contravention of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_33">Section 4</a> (2) (a) (i) of the Act. The same also prima facie results in
     limiting or restricting the market for Boxed Micro-processors for Desktop and Laptop
     PCs in the territory of India in contravention of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> (2) (b) (i) of the Act as well as
     results in denial of market access to parallel importers in contravention of <a href="/doc/1780194/" id="a_35">Section 4</a> (2)
</p><p id="p_48">     (c) of the Act. Consequently, under the provisions of <a href="/doc/27675/" id="a_36">Section 26</a> (1) of the Act, the
     Commission directs the Director General ('DG') to cause an investigation into the
     matter and submit an investigation report within a period of 150 days of receipt of this
     order.
</p>
<p id="p_49">44. Nothing stated in this order shall tantamount to expression of final opinion on the merits
