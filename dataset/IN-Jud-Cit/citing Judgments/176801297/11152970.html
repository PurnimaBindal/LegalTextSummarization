                           uninterruptedly using the said trade mark in India since 2008. The
                          trade mark, it is contended, was first used for infant foods. On 28th
                          April, 1986, the plaintiff was granted a manufacturing license, for
                          manufacturing preparations under the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;. The
                          plaintiff also applied for BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards)
                          certification, for its products being manufactured and sold under the
                          trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot; in 2007, and was granted certification as
                          sought.
</p>

<p id="p_5">                          3.    It is claimed, by the plaintiff, that the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;
                          is fanciful and inherently distinctive, and cannot be treated as
                          descriptive of the product of the plaintiff. By long and continuous
                          use, it is contended that the plaintiff has acquired exclusive rights to
                          use and exploit the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;. As is customary, the
                          plaintiff has also provided a tabular statement of the audited sales
                          figures of its products being sold under the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;,
                          during the period 2008-2009 till 2019-2020. By long and continuous
                          use, therefore, it is claimed that the plaintiff has become the owner of
                          the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;.
</p>

<p id="p_6">                          4.    It is further claimed that, in December 2019, the plaintiff
                          devised a new, unique and distinctive trade dress, for its products
                          bearing the trade mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, and also launched food
                          products for kids over 6 months of age, under the trade mark
                          &quot;MUMMUM 2&quot;.

                          the application on 4th November, 2016.       This, it is asserted, was

                          trade mark. The plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark having been registered prior in
                          point of time, it is asserted that the defendant cannot be permitted to
                          manufacture or sell its products under the &#x27;MUMUM&#x27; trade mark.

                          the plaintiff.

                          set up by the plaintiff. It is asserted, in the written statement, that the
                          two directors of the defendant-Company are both mothers, who
                          coined the &quot;MUMUM Co&quot; trade mark, to apply to snacks for children
                          of all age groups. It is further stated that, on 24thFebruary, 2017, the


                          defendant&#x27;s trade mark              was registered in Class 29, and that
                          the defendant is marketing its product, using the said trade mark, since
                          October, 2017. The application of the defendant, for registration of


                          the aforesaid Mark              in Class 30 is, it is submitted, pending
                          before the Registrar of Trade Marks, owing to the opposition filed by
                          the plaintiff.

<p id="p_15">                          11.    The defendant, in its written statement, has disputed the claim
                          of infringement and passing off, by the defendant, as set up by the
                          plaintiff. The defendant points out that the plaintiff&#x27;s products are
                          infant milk substitutes, which are covered under the description &quot;food
                          for babies&quot;, in Class 5 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks
                          Rules, 2017. The website of the plaintiff, it is submitted, does not
                          disclose the use, by the plaintiff, of the aforesaid &#x27;MUMMUM&#x27; trade
                          mark for any product falling in Class 29 or 30. &#x27;MUMMUM 2&#x27;, it is
                          submitted, which are also infant milk substitutes but intended for
                          babies over 6 months of age, has been sold by the plaintiff only since
                          December 2019. In that respect, therefore, the defendant claims to be

                          the prior adopter and use of its trade mark          , in respect of goods
                          falling under Classes 29 and 30.

                          plaintiff is not employing the said registered trade mark, but is
                          manufacturing      and    clearing    its   products   under    the    mark
                          &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, omitting the hyphen. The plaintiff cannot, therefore,

                          mark, which combines the word &quot;MUMUM&quot; with the phrases &quot;The&quot;,
                          &quot;Co&quot; and &quot;VERY VERY VERY REAL&quot;. It cannot, therefore, be said

                          as far back as in 1990, it has been squatting over the said trade mark,
                          without manufacturing or marketing any product, falling under
                          Classes 29 or 30, under the said trade mark, till date. In fact, even on
                          this ground, contends the defendant, a case for cancellation of the said
                          trade mark, under clauses (a) and (b) of <a href="/doc/165472/" id="a_2">Section 47(1)</a> of the Trade

                          made out. Further, as            is the defendant&#x27;s registered trade mark,
                          in respect of goods falling under Class 29, it is asserted that no case of
                          infringement can lie against the defendant, at the instance of the

                                   marks, in respect of goods covered by Classes 29 and 30 was

                                   Ms. Majumdar points out that &quot;use&quot;, or working, of the trade
                                   mark, started from the point of its adoption, and not from the

                                   resulted in proof of infringement. For this purpose, the plaintiff

                                   &quot;MUMUM&quot;.           This was also apparent from the defendant&#x27;s

<p id="p_41">                                   (xv) The judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_17">Nandhini Deluxe
                                   v. Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a> 12 ,
                                   on which Mr. Sinha placed reliance, was distinguishable. In
                                   that case, the Supreme Court was examining whether two trade
                                   marks could be allowed to coexist on the register. It was not
                                   examining an allegation of infringement or passing off. The
                                   Supreme Court held against the respondent, before it, on the
                                   ground that the respondent had failed to demonstrate
                                   distinctiveness in its trade mark in the short period between
                                   adoption and use by the appellants before the Supreme Court.

<p id="p_42">                                   (xvi) The reliance, by Mr. Sinha, on the Infant Milk
                                   Substitutes Act, was misplaced. The plaintiff&#x27;s registration was
                                   not for Infant Milk Substitutes nor was the regulatory
                                   permission obtained by the plaintiff limited to infant milk
                                   substitutes. There was, therefore, no such restriction on the
                                   goods which the plaintiff could clear under the brands

<p id="p_44">                                   (xviii) It was also incorrect to aver that the plaintiff&#x27;s product

                                   worker. Consultation with healthcare workers found place in
                                   the information published on the containers in which the
                                   plaintiff sold its goods, but there was no restriction or

                                   retail establishments. In fact, contends Ms. Majumdar, both the
                                   plaintiff&#x27;s and the defendant&#x27;s products were sold on the

                                   not have the effect of extinguishing the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark

</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                (i)     The plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark, of which it was seeking
                                protection, was descriptive in nature, as the word &quot;Mum&quot; meant
                                &quot;mother&quot;. The mark &quot;MUMMUM&quot; was also descriptive of the
                                products sold under the Mark, as the product was in the nature
                                of a mother&#x27;s milk substitute, for consumption by infants.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                (ii)    The plaintiff was not using its registered trade mark,
                                which was &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, with a hyphen between the two
                                &quot;Mum&quot;s. The plaintiff could not, therefore, allege that there
                                was infringement of its registered trade mark.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                (iii)   The defendant&#x27;s trade mark          was in the nature of a

                                with the words &quot;very, very, very real&quot;. While comparing rival
                                trade marks, it was not permissible to dissect, or vivisect, the
                                trade marks or trade names and then compare individual parts
                                thereof. The marks were required to be compared as a whole,
                                and not in pieces. On comparison as a whole, there was no
                                phonetic, visual or structural similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s

                                contends Mr. Sinha, are infant milk substitutes, suitable for
                                consumption only by babies.      These products could not be
                                treated as covered by Classes 29 or 30, whereunder Registration
                                No. 533221 and 533219 had been granted to the plaintiff. As
                                against this, the defendant was manufacturing and selling
                                wholesome snacks prepared from fruits, vegetables, grains,
                                cereals, etc., which were clearly classifiable under Classes 29
                                and 30. The products of the defendant were intended to serve
                                as healthy snacks, particularly for children who were either
                                suffering from malnutrition or were obese. They were meant
                                for children of over two years of age, who could eat solid foods.
                                They were unsuitable for use by infants, but could easily be
                                consumed by adults.      Even the category of users of the
                                plaintiff&#x27;s and the defendant&#x27;s products were, therefore,
                                different. They are, therefore, catering to different customer

                                relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Nandhini
                                Deluxe12.

<p id="p_58">                                (x)    Grant of injunction mandated the existence, as a prior
                                requisite, of the presence of a prima facie case in favour of the
                                plaintiff, coupled with the considerations of balance of
                                convenience and irreparable loss. Mr. Sinha invited attention to
                                the fact that the suit was filed one and half years after May,
                                2018, when, even according to the averments in the plaint, the
                                cause of action arose. The plaintiff having found no urgency,
                                for 20 months, to move the Court, it could not be said that
                                refusal of interim injunction would result in irreparable loss to
                                the plaintiff.

                                of territorial jurisdiction, as the plaintiff and the defendant were
                                both located outside the territorial jurisdiction of this Court,
                                which was sought to be invoked solely on the basis of the
                                contention that the defendant&#x27;s products were available in Delhi
                                through the Amazon portal.

                                Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of the word

                                the plaintiff did not contain any averment regarding this fact
                                and that, even otherwise, it was irrelevant to the issue at hand.
                                Mr. Sinha also pointed out that, even in affidavits before the
                                Registrar of Trade Marks, the defendant had clarified that the
                                withdrawal of its application was without prejudice to his rights
                                and was essentially intended to avoid multiplicity of

                                 (3)    How does one harmonise the tests of &quot;dominant
                                feature&quot;, with the principle of &quot;non-vivisection&quot;? Mr. Sinha
                                objects to the plaintiff extracting, from the composite part of the
                                defendant, the word &quot;MUMUM&quot;, to allege similarity with the
                                plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark. He contends that it is not permissible to
                                vivisect a trade mark in such a fashion, so as to pick out a part
                                of the trade mark and examine whether it is similar to the trade
                                mark of the plaintiff.       According to Mr. Sinha, if the

                                        trade mark of the defendant is seen as a whole, and is
                                compared with the trade mark of the plaintiff, there is neither
                                phonetic, nor visual, nor structural, similarity between the two.
                                As against this, Ms. Majumdar submits that the &quot;dominant
                                feature&quot; of the defendant&#x27;s trade mark is the word &quot;MUMUM&quot;
                                which is identical, phonetically similar, to the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                &quot;MUMMUM&quot; trade mark.
</p>

<p id="p_66">                                (4)   Is mere phonetic similarity, in the absence of visual or
                                structural similarity, enough, to make out a case of
                                infringement?     Mr. Sinha would answer in the negative,
                                whereas Ms. Majumdar would answer in the affirmative.

                           use of a deceptively similar trade mark, therefore, ipso facto confirms
                          the existence of infringement. Nothing more is required.
</p>

<p id="p_77">                          24.      The fact that, by using the same, or a deceptively similar, trade
                          mark, a trader may be infringing the trade mark of prior user does not,
                          however, necessarily lead to the implication that the trader is passing
                          off its goods as those of the registered trade mark holder. In fact, the
                          tort of passing off does not require, for its establishment, the trade
                          mark of the plaintiff to be registered. This is essentially because the
                          tort of passing off is directed against the goods, and not against the
                          mark. Simply put, one infringes a trade mark, but one passes off
                          one&#x27;s goods as those of another. Usage of a deceptively similar trade
                          mark is only the means by which the tort of passing off is committed.
                          The mere establishment of the fact that the defendant is using the
                          trade mark which is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff does
                          not, however, necessarily ipso facto lead to an inevitable inference of
                          passing off. It is open to the defendant to show, by other means, that,
                          even if the trade mark, used by the defendant, is deceptively similar to
                          that of the plaintiff, the defendant is, nevertheless, not guilty of the
                          tort of passing off, as other factors, seen cumulatively, negate the
                          possibility of the customer being deceived or confused. <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_22">In Satyam

                           tort of passing of was thus expressed by the Supreme Court, in Cadila
                          Health Care6:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                  &quot;The passing-off action depends upon the principle that
                                  nobody has a right to represent his goods as the goods of
                                  somebody. In other words and is not to sell his goods or

</blockquote>

<p id="p_78">                          The Supreme Court also and relied, in this context, on the following
                          passage, from <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_23">Kaviraj Pt. Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna
                          Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a> 17 (referred to, hereinafter, as Durga
                          Dutt Sharma):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                  &quot;While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy
                                  being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off
                                  by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not
                                  the gist of an action for infringement. The action for
                                  infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered
                                  proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of
                                  the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to
                                  those goods (Vide <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_24">Section 21</a> of the Act). The use by the
                                  defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in
                                  an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of
                                  an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in
                                  respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of
                                  a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the
                                  actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a
                                  colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action
                                  would also be such in an action for infringement of the same
                                  trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two
                                  ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
                                  doubt, make out that the use of the defendant&#x27;s mark is likely
                                  to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s and
                                  the defendant&#x27;s mark is so close either visually, phonetically
                                  or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is
                                  an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that
                                  the plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if
                                  the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have
                                  been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,

<p id="p_79">                          25.     Judgments of the Supreme Court have, over a period of time,
                          delineated, authoritatively, the torts of infringement and passing off,
                          in all their myriad colours and complexions. It would be instructive,
                          therefore, to study, chronologically, some of the pronouncements of
                          the Supreme Court, which have contributed to the crystallisation of

                          probably the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1233360/" id="a_25">National Sewing

                          National Sewing Trade Co Ltd (hereinafter referred to as &quot;NSTCL&quot;)
                          and the respondent James Chadwick &amp; Bros Ltd (hereinafter referred
                          to as &quot;JC&quot;) were both engaged in the manufacturing of sewing thread.
                          The trade mark of JC consisted of an eagle with outspread wings,
                          known as the &quot;Eagle&quot; mark. Sewing thread, bearing the Eagle mark
                          was regularly imported into, and sold in, India, on an extensive scale.
                          NSTCL, around 1940, started selling cotton sewing thread, under a
                          mark consisting of the device of a bird with outspread wings perched

                          alleged that NSTCL was passing off its goods as those of JC. The
                          challenge failed.   JC also opposed, before the Registrar of Trade
                          Marks, the application of NSTCL, for registration of its &quot;Vulture
                          Brand&quot; Mark. The Registrar of Trade Marks allowed the opposition
                          and rejected NSTCL&#x27;s application. He also held that the use of the
                          words &quot;Vulture Brand&quot;, accompanying the pictorial depiction of an
                          eagle, was misleading and liable to cause confusion.           NSTCL
                          appealed against the decision of the Registrar to the High Court of
                          Bombay. A learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the appeal
                          and directed the Registrar of Trade Marks to register the trade mark of
                          NSTCL. A Letters Patent Appeal, preferred against the decision of
                          the learned Single Judge, was allowed by the Division Bench of the
                          High Court, which restored the order of the Registrar.         NSTCL
                          appealed to the Supreme Court.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                &quot;The principles of law applicable to such cases are well
                                settled. The burden of proving that the trade mark which a
                                person seeks to register is not likely to deceive or to cause
                                confusion is upon the applicant. It is for him to satisfy the
                                Registrar that his trade mark does not fall within the
                                prohibition of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_28">Section 8</a> and therefore it should be registered.
                                Moreover, in deciding whether a particular trade mark is
                                likely to deceive or cause confusion that duty is not
                                discharged by arriving at the result by merely comparing it
                                with the trade mark which is already registered and whose
                                proprietor is offering opposition to the registration of the
                                mark. The real question to decide in such cases is to see as to
                                how a purchaser, who must be looked upon as an average
                                man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a particular

                          bound to deceive or cause confusion. It was held that &quot;the bird in the
                          appellant&#x27;s trade mark (was) likely to be mistaken by an average man
                          of ordinary intelligence as an Eagle and if he asked for Eagle goods
                          and he got goods bearing this trade mark of the appellant&#x27;s it is not
                          likely that he would reject them by saying that this cannot be an
                          Eagle&quot;. The act of NSTCL, in &quot;camouflaging an Eagle into a vulture
                          by calling it as such&quot;, it was held, was likely to cause confusion. The
                          Supreme Court, examining the mark still further, opined that the bird,
                          in the trade mark of NSTCL, &quot;certainly (did) not represent a vulture or
                          look like a vulture of any form or shape&quot;. What had, therefore, been
                          named by NSTCL as a vulture, it was held, was &quot;really an eagle
                          seated in a different posture&quot;. NSTCL had, therefore, it was held,
                          failed to discharge the burden, on it, to establish that its trade mark
                          was not likely to deceive or cause confusion.

<p id="p_83">                          29.     Having thus held against NSTCL on the aspect of infringement,
                          the Supreme Court tellingly underscored the distinction between
                          infringement and passing off, in para 24 of the report, which read
                          thus:

                                  or cause confusion had been concluded by the earlier
                                  judgment of the Madras High Court in the passing off action
                                  and already referred to in an early part of the judgment. It is
                                  quite clear that the onus in a passing off action rests on a

                          time, the matter travelled to the Supreme Court.
</p>

<p id="p_85">                          31.   The Supreme Court held, at the outset, that Corn Products&#x27;
                          mark had acquired a reputation among the public. Thereafter, on the
                          aspect of confusion, the Supreme Court noted that the High Court had
                          proceeded on the ground that the various trade marks existed, bearing
                          the suffix &quot;Gluco&quot; and &quot;Vita&quot;, which made it impossible to hold that
                          the common features &quot;Glu&quot; and &quot;Vita&quot; were only associated with the
                          biscuits manufactured by Corn Products. In para 15 and 16 of the
                          report, the Supreme Court went on to hold thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                &quot;15. Now it is a well recognised principle, that has to be
                                taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion
                                arising between any two trade marks, that, where those two
                                marks contain a common element which is also contained in a
                                number of other marks in use in the same market such a
                                common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers
                                to pay more attention to the other features of the respective
                                marks and to distinguish between them by those features.
                                This principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the
                                common element shall be in fairly extensive use and, as I
                                have mentioned, in use in the market in which the marks
                                under consideration are being or will be used.

                                elements therefore only assist the applicant when those marks
                                are in extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such
                                user is of course on the applicant, who wants to rely on those

                           syllables &quot;Glu&quot; and &quot;vi&quot; in the trade mark of JC, of the syllable &quot;co&quot;
                          resulted in absence of likelihood of confusion between the two marks.
                          In this context, the Supreme Court held, in paras 18 to 22 of the
                          report, thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                                &quot;18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is
                                well known that the question whether the two marks are likely
                                to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first
                                impression. It is for the court to decide that question.
                                English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing
                                an English word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not
                                always the same, may not be of much assistance in our
                                country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot
                                be overlooked that the word is an English word which to the
                                mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well
                                recognised that in deciding a question of similarity between
                                two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole. So
                                considered, we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the
                                marks with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart
                                from the syllable &quot;co&quot; in the appellant&#x27;s mark, the two marks
                                are identical.That syllable is not in our opinion such as would
                                enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark
                                from the other.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                                19.    We also agree with Desai, J., that the idea of the two
                                marks is the same. The marks convey the ideas of glucose and
                                life giving properties of vitamins. The Aquamatic
                                case (Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty&#x27;s Ld.) [1958 RPC 387] is a
                                recent case where the test of the commonness of the idea
                                between two marks was applied in deciding the question of
                                similarity between them. Again, in deciding the question of
                                similarity between the two marks we have to approach it from
                                the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of
                                imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural
                                and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the
                                two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between
                                them.

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                                20.    It was then said that the goods were not of the same
                                description and that therefore in spite of the similarity of the
                                two marks there would be no risk of confusion or deception.</blockquote>

                                there is evidence that glucose is used in the manufacture of
                                biscuits. That would establish a trade connection between the
                                two commodities, namely, glucose manufactured by the
                                appellant and the biscuits produced by the respondent. An
                                average purchaser would therefore be likely to think that the
                                respondent&#x27;s &#x27;Gluvita biscuits&#x27; were made with the
                                appellant&#x27;s &#x27;Glucovita&#x27; glucose. This was the kind of trade

                                deception. The goods in this case were chocolates and
                                laxatives and it was proved that laxatives were often made
                                with chocolate coatings. We may also refer to the &quot;Panda&quot;
                                case (In re: an application by LadislasJellinek [63 RPC
                                59]). The goods there concerned were shoes and shoe
                                polishes. It was observed that shoe polishes being used for
                                shoes, there was trade connection between them and that this
                                might lead to confusion or deception though the goods were
                                different. The application for registration was however
                                refused under that section of the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_32">English Act</a> which
                                corresponds to <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_33">Section 8</a> of our Act on the ground that the
                                opponents, the manufacturers of shoes, had not established a
                                reputation for their trade mark among the public.

<p id="p_88">                                21.     It is true that in both the abovementioned cases the two
                                competing trade marks were absolutely identical which is not
                                the case here. But that in our opinion makes no difference.
                                The absolute identity of the two competing marks or their
                                close resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the
                                question of likelihood of deception or confusion. Trade
                                connection between different goods is another such test. Ex
                                hypothesi, this latter test applies only when the goods are
                                different. These tests are independent tests. There is no
                                reason why the test of trade connection between different
                                goods should not apply where the competing marks closely
                                resemble each other just as much as it applies, as held in the
                                &quot;Black Magic&quot; and &quot;Panda&quot; cases, where the competing
                                marks were identical. Whether by applying these tests in a
                                particular case the conclusion that there is likelihood of
                                deception or confusion should be arrived at would depend on
                                all the facts of the case.

                                     manufactured with liquid glucose whereas the appellant&#x27;s
                                     mark only concerns powder glucose. We will assume that
                                     only liquid glucose is used in the manufacture of biscuits with
                                     glucose. But there is nothing to show that an average buyer
                                     knows with what kind of glucose, biscuits containing glucose
                                     are or can be made. ... So, a trade connection between
                                     glucose and biscuits would appear to be established. We are
                                     therefore of opinion that the commodities concerned in the

                                     deception likely in view of the similarity of the two trade

                          Gupta 20, the next in the line of authorities for consideration, desired to
                          register the tradename of a biochemical medicinal preparation
                          commonly known as &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;, which he claimed to have
                          been using since 1923, and which had achieved a distinctive
                          reputation. The appellant opposed the application on the ground that
                          the word &quot;Amritdhara&quot; was already registered as a tradename for the
                          medicinal preparation manufactured by it, which had been introduced
                          in the market in 1901 and was immensely popular. The preparation
                          being sold under the name &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; was, it was submitted,
                          the same as that which the appellant sold under the name
                          &quot;Amritdhara&quot;.          This, it was contended, was likely to confuse an
                          unwary purchaser in assuming &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; to be &quot;Amritdhara&quot;.
                          The respondent, needless to say, disputed the allegation of similarity
                          between the names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;.

</p><p id="p_93">                           33.      Two questions were framed by the Supreme Court as arising for
                          its consideration, of which we need advert only to the first, i.e.,
                          whether the name &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; was likely to deceive the public
                          or cause confusion to trade, in the light of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_34">Section 8</a> of the 1940 Act.
                          The test to be applied was thus postulated by the Supreme Court in
                          para 6 of the report, relying on the classical enunciation of the law by
                          Parker, J., in In re. Pianotist Application21:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                                   &quot;It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and
                                   relevant for our purpose are &quot;likely to deceive or cause
                                   confusion&quot;. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_35">The Act</a> does not lay down any criteria for
                                   determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
                                   Therefore, every case must depend on its own particular
                                   facts, and the value of authorities lies not so much in the
                                   actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is
                                   likely to deceive or cause confusion. On an application to
                                   register, the Registrar or an opponent may object that the
                                   trade mark is not registrable by reason of clause (a) of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_36">Section
                                   8</a>, or sub-section (I) of <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_37">Section 10</a>, as in this case. In such a
                                   case the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Registrar that
                                   the trade mark applied for is not likely to deceive or cause
                                   confusion. In cases in which the tribunal considers that there
                                   is doubt as to whether deception is likely, the application
                                   should be refused. A trade mark is likely to deceive or cause
                                   confusion by its resemblance to another already on the
                                   Register if it is likely to do so in the course of its legitimate
                                   use in a market where the two marks are assumed to be in use
                                   by traders in that market. In considering the matter, all the
                                   circumstances of the case must be considered. As was
                                   observed by Parker, J., in Pianotist Co Application [(1906) 23
                                   RPC 774] which was also a case of the comparison of two
                                   words.

                                       marks.&quot; (p. 777)

                                       For deceptive resemblance two important questions
                                       are: (1) who are the persons whom the resemblance
                                       must be likely to deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules
                                       of comparison are to be adopted in judging whether
                                       such resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is perhaps
                                       an appropriate description of the state of mind of a
                                       customer who, on seeing a mark thinks that it differs
                                       from the mark on goods which he has previously
                                       bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not
                                       due to imperfect recollection. (See Kerly on Trade

                          Court held that there was likelihood of confusion, in the mind of a
                          person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, between

                                names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshman-dhara&quot; are in use in

                                the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would
                                mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average
                                intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High
                                Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and
                                consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider

                                &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. He would go more by the overall
                                structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the
                                medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told

                                wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods largely
                                sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to
                                say that a person educated in the Hindi language would go by
                                the etymological or ideological meaning and see the
                                difference between &quot;current of nectar&quot; and &quot;current of
                                Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of Lakshman&quot; in a literal sense has no
                                meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the
                                inference that the &quot;current or stream&quot; is as pure and strong as
                                Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or
                                townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the
                                Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would
                                etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological
                                difference between &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He
                                would go more by the similarity of the two names in the
                                context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he
                                wants for his ailments.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                                8.      We agree that the use of the word &quot;dhara&quot; which
                                literally means &quot;current or stream&quot; is not by itself decisive of
                                the matter. What we have to consider here is the overall
                                similarity of the composite words, having regard to the
                                circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are
                                medicinal preparations of the same description. We are
                                aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused,
                                because unusually stupid people, &quot;fools or idiots&quot;, may be
                                deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may
                                disclose some points of difference, but an unwary purchaser
                                of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be
                                deceived by the overall similarity of the two names having
                                regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a
                                somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar
                                medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name. The
                                trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be

                          Next, the contention, of the appellant, that, owing to the dissimilarity
                          of the packing in which the goods of NPL and DDS were marketed,
                          there was no possibility of deception of confusion, was rejected by the
                          Supreme Court on the ground that these considerations were relevant
                          to action for passing off, but not for an action for infringement. Qua
                          actions for infringement, the Supreme Court went on to hold, in paras
                          28 and 29 of the report, as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">                                &quot;28. ...In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
                                doubt, make out that the use of the defendant&#x27;s mark is likely
                                to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s and
                                the defendant&#x27;s mark is so close either visually, phonetically
                                or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there
                                is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish
                                that the plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated. Expressed in another
                                way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff
                                have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,
                                packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the
                                packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
                                differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from
                                that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
                                immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant
                                may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is
                                sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">                                29.    When once the use by the defendant of the mark which
                                is claimed to infringe the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is shown to be &quot;in

                                &quot;likely to deceive&quot; and it has sometimes been answered by
                                saying that it is merely an extension of the earlier test and
                                does not add very materially to the concept indicated by the
                                earlier words &quot;likely to deceive&quot;. But this apart, as the
                                question arises in an action for infringement the onus would
                                be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark used by the
                                defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of
                                which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar. This has
                                necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two
                                marks -- the degree of resemblance which is necessary to
                                exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by
                                laying down objective standards. The persons who would be
                                deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is
                                the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of
                                consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in
                                the basic idea represented by the plaintiff&#x27;s mark. The
                                purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the
                                essential features of the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark are to be found
                                in that used by the defendant. The identification of the
                                essential features of the mark is in essence a question of fact
                                and depends on the judgment of the Court based on the
                                evidence led before it as regards the usage of the trade. It
                                should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the
                                enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the
                                defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the
                                registered mark of the plaintiff.&quot;

                          to the former, could not be said to be erroneous, especially as the

<p id="p_99">                          38.      Proceeding to 1969, two significant judgments were delivered
                          by the Supreme Court, in the said year, of which the first was <a href="/doc/280042/" id="a_41">K. R.
                          Krishna Chettiar v. Shri Ambal&amp; Co</a>.22 The appellant in that case
                          (hereinafter referred to as &quot;KRKC&quot;) applied for registration of a trade
                          mark, in respect of snuff manufactured in Madras. The trade mark
                          consisted of a label containing three panels, of which the first and
                          third panels contained the words &quot;Shri Andal Madras Snuff&quot;, whereas
                          the centre panel contained the picture of the goddess Andal, with the
                          legend &quot;Sri Andal&quot;. The application of KRKC was opposed by the
                          respondent (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SAC&quot;) on the ground that it
                          was deceptively similar to the registered trade marks of SAC, one of
                          which contained a device of the goddess Sri Ambal seated on a globe
                          floating on water enclosed in a circular frame with the legend &quot;Sri

                          expression &quot;Sri Ambal&quot;. The Supreme Court decided the matter, in
                          paras 5 to 10 of the report, thus:

                                 feature of the trade marks. The common &quot;Sri&quot; is the
                                subsidiary part, of the two words &quot;Ambal&quot; is the more
                                distinctive and fixes itself in the recollection of an average
                                buyer with imperfect recollection.

<p id="p_101">                                6.     The vital question in issue is whether, if the appellant&#x27;s
                                mark is used in a normal and fair manner in connection with
                                the snuff and if similarly fair and normal user is assumed of
                                the existing registered marks, will there be such a likelihood
                                of deception that the mark ought not to be allowed to be
                                registered    (see In    the     matter    of      Broadhead&#x27;s
                                Application [(1950) 57 RPC 209, 214] for registration of a
                                trade mark). It is for the court to decide the question on a
                                comparison of the competing marks as a whole and their
                                distinctive and essential features. We have no doubt in our
                                mind that if the proposed mark is used in a normal and fair
                                manner the mark would come to be known by its
                                distinguishing feature &quot;Andal&quot;. There is a striking similarity
                                and affinity of sound between the words &quot;Andal&quot; and
                                &quot;Ambal&quot;. Giving due weight to the judgment of the Registrar
                                and bearing in mind the conclusions of the learned Single
                                Judge and the Divisional Bench, we are satisfied that there is
                                a real danger of confusion between the two marks.
</p>
<p id="p_102">                                7.      There is no evidence of actual confusion, but that
                                might be due to the fact that the appellant&#x27;s trade is not of
                                long standing. There is no visual resemblance between the
                                two marks, but ocular comparison is not always the decisive
                                test. The resemblance between the two marks must be
                                considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye. There
                                is a close affinity of sound between Ambal and Andal.

<p id="p_103">                                8.     In the case of Coca-Cola Co. of Canada v. Pepsi-Cola
                                Co. of Canada Ltd. [1942 59 RPC 127] it was found that cola
                                was in common use in Canada for naming the beverages. The
                                distinguishing feature of the mark Coca Cola was coca and
                                not cola. For the same reason the distinguishing feature of the
                                mark Pepsi Cola was Pepsi and not cola. It was not likely that
                                any one would confuse the word Pepsi with Coca. In the
                                present case the word &quot;Sri&quot; may be regarded as in common
                                use. The distinguishing feature of the respondent&#x27;s mark is
                                Ambal while that of the appellant&#x27;s mark is Andal. The two
                                words are deceptively similar in sound.

</p><p id="p_105">                                 9.     The name Andal does not cease to be deceptively
                                similar because it is used in conjunction with a pictorial
                                device. The case of De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co. [1951
                                68 RPC 103] is instructive. From the appendix printed at p.
                                270 of the same volume it appears that Vick Chemical
                                Company were the proprietors of the registered trade mark
                                consisting of the word &quot;Vaporub&quot; and another registered
                                trade mark consisting of a design of which the words &quot;Vicks
                                Vaporub Salve&quot; formed a part. The appendix at p. 226 shows
                                that the defendants advertised their ointment as
                                &quot;KarsoteVapour Rub&quot;. It was held that the defendants had
                                infringed the registered marks. Lord Radcliffe said: &quot;... a
                                mark is infringed by another trader if, even without using the
                                whole of it upon or in connection with his goods, he uses one
                                or more of its essential features&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_106">                                10.     Mr Sen stressed the point that the words Ambal and
                                Andal had distinct meanings. Ambal is the consort of Lard
                                Siva and Andal is the consort of Ranganatha. He said that in
                                view of the distinct ideas conveyed by the two words a mere
                                accidental phonetic resemblance could not lead to confusion.
                                In this connection he relied on Venkateswaran Law of Trade
                                and Merchandise Marks, 1963 Ed., p. 214, Kerly Law of
                                Trade marks and Trade Names, 9th Edn., p. 465, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_42">Article
                                852and</a> the decision Application by Thomas A. Smith Ltd., to
                                Register a trade mark. [1913 30 RPC 363] In that case
                                Neville, J., held that the words &quot;limit&quot; and &quot;summit&quot; were
                                words in common use, each conveying a distinctly&#x27; definite
                                idea; that there was no possibility of any one being deceived
                                by the two marks; and there was no ground for refusing
                                registration. Mr Sen&#x27;s argument loses sight of the realities of
                                the case. The Hindus in the south of India may be well aware
                                that the words Ambal and Andal represent the names of two
                                distinct Goddesses. But the respondent&#x27;s customers are not
                                confined to Hindus alone. Many of their customers are
                                Charistians, Parsees, Muslims and persons of other religious
                                denominations. Moreover, their business is not confined to
                                south of India. The customers who are not Hindus or who do
                                not belong to the south of India may not know the difference
                                between the words Andal and Ambal. The words have no
                                direct reference to the character and quality of snuff. The
                                customers who use the respondent&#x27;s goods will have a
                                recollection that they are known by the word Ambal. They
                                may also have a vague recollection of the portrait of a benign

                          SAC to the trade mark of KRKC.
</p>

<p id="p_109">                          40.      The second important judgment, also in 1969, is <a href="/doc/1389940/" id="a_43">F. Hoffmann-
                          La Roche &amp; Co. Ltd v. Geoffrey Manners &amp; Co. Pvt Ltd</a> 23. On the
                          aspect of phonetic similarity, this judgment is particularly significant.
                          Without intricately going into the facts, it may be noted that the
                          controversy, before the Supreme Court, in this case, was whether the
                          word &quot;Dropovit&quot; was deceptively similar to the word &quot;Protovit&quot;. In
                          this context, the Supreme Court observed, in para 6 of the report, that
                          it was not necessary that there should be intent to deceive or cause
                          confusion; the probability thereof was sufficient. The Supreme Court,
                          thereafter, relied on the following passage, from the judgment of Lord
                          Denning in Parker-Knoll Ltd v. Knoll International Ltd 24, to
                          highlight       the   distinction   between   &quot;deception&quot;     and    &quot;causing
                          confusion&quot;:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">                                   &quot;Secondly, &#x27;to deceive&#x27; is one thing. To &#x27;cause confusion&#x27; is
                                   another. The difference is this: When you deceive a man, you
                                   tell him a lie. You make a false representation to him and
                                   thereby cause him to believe a thing to be true which is false.</blockquote>

                                   without telling him a lie at all, and without making any false
                                   representation to him. You may indeed tell him the truth, the

                          the Supreme Court relied, with approval, on the enunciation of the law
                          in In re. Pianotist Application21, already quoted supra. Thereafter,
                          the Supreme Court went on to observe, in para 7 of the report, thus,

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">                                &quot;It is necessary to apply both the visual and phonetic tests.

                                words &quot;Aristoc&quot; and &quot;Rysta&quot;. The view taken was that
                                considering the way the words were pronounced in English,
                                the one was likely to be mistaken for the other. Viscount
                                Maugham cited the following passage of Lord Justice

                                      confused. It is the person who only knows the one word
                                      and has perhaps an imperfect recollection of it who is
                                      likely to be deceived or confused. Little assistance,
                                      therefore, is to be obtained from a meticulous
                                      comparison of the two words, letter by letter and
                                      syllable by syllable, pronounced with the clarity to be
                                      expected from a teacher of elocution. The Court must
                                      be careful to make allowance for imperfect
                                      recollection and the effect of careless pronunciation
                                      and speech on the part not only of the person seeking
                                      to buy under the trade description, but also of the shop

                                 It is also important that the marks must be compared as
                                wholes. It is not right to take a portion of the word and say
                                that because that portion of the word differs from the
                                corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is
                                no sufficient, similarity to cause confusion. The true test is
                                whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it
                                is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the
                                minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark. Thus

                                the purchase. In such a case, except in the event of the
                                handwriting of the doctor being very bad or illegible the
                                chance of confusion is remote. As we have already observed
                                the evidence shows that there are as many as 57 trade marks
                                in the Register of Trade Marks with the suffix &quot;Vit&quot;.
                                Therefore, even an average customer would know that in
                                respect of Vitamin preparations the word &quot;Vit&quot; occurs in
                                large number of trade marks and because of this he would
                                naturally be on his guard and take special care against
                                making a mistake. In this connection the provisions of the
                                Drug Rules, 1945 are also relevant. Under Rule 61(2) vitamin
                                preparations would be covered by Item 5 in Schedule C(1) to
                                the Rules and a licence would be required to stock such
                                vitamin preparations and to sell them retail. The question of
                                confuse must hence be determined on the basis that the goods
                                with one of the two rival trade marks would be sold only by
                                such a licensed dealer and would not be available in any
                                other shop. The fact that the vendor would be licensed dealer
                                reduces the possibility of confusion to a considerable extent.&quot;

                          to the Supreme Court, at the instance of CHCL.

<p id="p_114">                          44.   The Supreme Court, at the outset, in para 10 of the report,
                          delineated the contours of passing off actions, in the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">                                &quot;Under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_48">Section 28</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_49">Merchandise Marks Act</a>
                                on the registration of a trade mark in Part A or B of the
                                register, a registered proprietor gets an exclusive right to use
                                the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the
                                trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of
                                infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the
                                Act. In the case of an unregistered trade mark, <a href="/doc/262896/" id="a_50">Section 27(1)</a>
                                provides that no person shall be entitled to institute any
                                proceeding to prevent, or to recover damages for, the
                                infringement of an unregistered trade mark. Sub-section (2) of
                                <a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_51">Section 27</a> provides that the Act shall not be deemed to affect
                                rights of action against any person for passing off goods as
                                the goods of another person or the remedies in respect
                                thereof. In other words in the case of unregistered trade
                                marks, a passing-off action is maintainable. The passing-off
                                action depends upon the principle that nobody has a right to
                                represent his goods as the goods of somebody. In other words
                                a man is not to sell his goods or services under the pretence
                                that they are those of another person. As per Lord Diplock

                                trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate

                           &quot;Mahendra &amp; Mahendra&quot;, or any word which was deceptively similar
                          to &quot;Mahindra&quot; or &quot;Mahindra &amp; Mahindra&quot;. MML claim that the word
                          &quot;Mahindra&quot; was its registered trade mark, in respect of goods in Class
                          12, and was the dominant and significant part of the trade mark of the
                          respondent and other companies of its group, which were engaged in
                          industrial and trading activities in multiple fields such as
                          manufacturing of cars, jeeps, tractors, farming equipment, chemicals,
                          hotels, real estate, etc. The name and trade mark &quot;Mahindra&quot;,
                          contended MML, was indelibly associated with its products and
                          services. The word &quot;Mahendra&quot;, it was contended, was phonetically,
                          visually and structurally almost identical to the word &quot;Mahindra&quot;.
                          This, it was alleged, was done in order to defraud the public into
                          believing that MMP was an associate of MML, and, thereby, to pass
                          off its business and products as those of MML and, therefore,
                          amounted to trading on the goodwill and reputation of MML. As
                          against this, MMP contended that &quot;Mahendra &amp; Mahendra&quot; was a
                          continuation of their business name, in use since 1974 for various
                          businesses. Mahendra, contended MMP, was a household name in
                          Gujarat. It was also pointed out that the products of MMP were in no
                          way similar to the products or businesses of MML and that there was
                          no overlap between the activities of the two companies.

                          instance of MMP, was dismissed by the Division Bench, resulting in
                          MMP approaching the Supreme Court.

</p><p id="p_119">                           49.        Before the Supreme Court, MMP contended that the action
                          brought against it by MML was one of passing off, and not of
                          infringement and, therefore, required, for its sustenance, similarity of

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">                                     &quot;This question has been considered by different High Courts
                                     and this Court in umpteen cases from time to time. On
                                     analysis of the principles laid down in the decisions, certain
                                     recognised parameters relating to the matter have emerged.
                                     Without intending to be exhaustive some of the principles
                                     which are accepted as well settled may be stated thus: that
                                     whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion
                                     arising is a matter for decision by the court, and no witness is
                                     entitled to say whether the mark is likely to deceive or to
                                     cause confusion; that all factors which are likely to create or
                                     allay deception or confusion must be considered in
                                     combination; that broadly speaking, factors creating
                                     confusion would be, for example, the nature of the market
                                     itself, the class of customers, the extent of the reputation, the
                                     trade channels, the existence of any connection in course of
                                     trade, and others.&quot;

                           defendant Pyare Lal &amp; Co., against an action of passing off brought
                          by the plaintiff Bata India Ltd (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Bata&quot;), to
                          the effect that Bata was not manufacturing foam, which was the
                          product manufactured by the defendant, held that this distinction was
                          &quot;not enough to hold that there could be no passing off action in
                          respect of the user of the name &#x27;Bata&#x27; to the products marketed by the
                          defendants&quot;. To so hold, the High Court observed that &quot;the name
                          &#x27;Bata&#x27; was well known in the market and the user of such an name
                          (was) likely to cause not only deception in the mind of an ordinary
                          customer but... also cause injury to the plaintiff Company&quot;. The mere
                          use, by the defendant, of the name or Mark &#x27;Bata&#x27;, it was held, was
                          &quot;indicative of their intent&quot;.    The passages, from Kirloskar Diesel
                          Recon27, which were approved by the Supreme Court in Mahendra &amp;
                          Mahendra Paper Mills25 highlight the aspect of balance of
                          convenience, in a case where the trade mark of the plaintiff is of
                          considerable vintage, and the defendant is a comparatively new player
                          in the field, and deserve to be reproduced, thus:

                                each appeal is very recent whereas the existence of the
                                respondents belonging to &#x27;Kirloskar Group of Companies&#x27;
                                has been for over a period of 50 years. On their own showing,
                                the appellants are not using the word &#x27;Kirloskar&#x27; as trade
                                mark but as part of trading style whereas the respondents
                                have not only acquired distinctiveness and goodwill in the
                                word &#x27;Kirloskar&#x27; but it is even the registered trade mark of the
                                1st respondent. There is sufficient evidence on record to show
                                that the huge business is carried by &#x27;Kirloskar Group of

                                The real question in each case is whether there is as a result
                                of misrepresentation a real likelihood of confusion or
                                deception of the public and consequent damage to the
                                plaintiff. The focus is shifted from the external objective test
                                of making comparison of activities of parties to the state of
                                mind of public in deciding whether it will be confused. With
                                the passage of time and reputation acquired, the trade mark
                                &#x27;Kirloskar&#x27; has acquired the secondary meaning and has
                                become almost a household word. The judgments relied upon
                                by Mr. Kane pertain to the cases of one type of business and
                                not where variety of businesses have been carried by the
                                plaintiff and the defendant as in the instant case. The business
                                activities of the Respondents vary from pin to piano as borne
                                out from the object clauses of the Memorandums of
                                Association of the Respondents. The Appellants have still to
                                commence their business activities but as mentioned in the
                                Memorandums of Association of the 1st Appellant in each
                                appeal, some of the object clauses therein overlap with the
                                activities of Respondents and more particularly of

                          Shah (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Chetanbhai&quot;) was proposing to
                          commence a similar business, by adopting the name and style of
                          &quot;Muktajivan Colour Lab and Studio&quot;. LVP filed a suit, alleging
                          passing off, by Chetanbhai, of his business as that of LVP, and sought
                          permanent preventive injunction, as well as ad interim injunction in
                          the interregnum. LVP lost in its attempt to obtain interim injunction,
                          both before the learned Trial Court as well as the High Court. The
                          Supreme Court, seized with the matter in appeal, observed, at the

                          into existence on or a little before the institution of the suit by LVP.
                          The &quot;principal issue determinative of the grant of temporary
                          injunction&quot; was identified, in para 7 of the report, as &quot;whether the
                          business of the plaintiff run in a tradename of which &#x27;Muktajivan&#x27; is a

                          in the plaintiff so as to restrain the use of the word &quot;Muktajivan&quot; in
                          the business name of a similar trade by a competitor i.e. the
                          defendants&quot;. The ingredients of an action for passing off, and the
                          rationale behind the grant of injunction in such cases were briefly
                          delineated, in para 8 of the report, thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">                                &quot;An action for passing-off will then lie wherever the

                                plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion between the two
                                businesses. If this is not made out there is no case. The
                                ground is not to be limited to the date of the proceedings; the
                                court will have regard to the way in which the business may
                                be carried on in the future, and to its not being carried on
                                precisely as carried on at the date of the proceedings. Where
                                there is probability of confusion in business, an injunction
                                will be granted even though the defendants adopted the name
                                innocently.&quot;

                                business of one who has the property in that name. The law
                                does not permit any one to carry on his business in such a

                                       business, commercial or professional reputation or
                                       goodwill. So to sell merchandise or carry on business

                                       such a manner as to mislead the public into believing
                                       that the merchandise or business is that of another

                                       person. This form of injury is commonly, though
                                       awkwardly, termed that of passing-off one&#x27;s goods or

                                       most important example of the wrong of injurious
                                       falsehood. The gist of the conception of passing-off is
                                       that the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about
                                       themselves, are saying something about themselves
                                       which is calculated to mislead. The law on this matter
                                       is designed to protect traders against that form of
                                       unfair competition which consists in acquiring for
                                       oneself, by means of false or misleading devices, the
                                       benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival

                                the gist of passing-off action was defined by stating that it
                                was essential to the success of any claim to passing-off based
                                on the use of given mark or get-up that the plaintiff should be
                                able to show that the disputed mark or get-up has become by
                                user in the country distinctive of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods so that
                                the use in relation to any goods of the kind dealt in by the
                                plaintiff of that mark or get-up will be understood by the
                                trade and the public in that country as meaning that the
                                goods are the plaintiff&#x27;s goods. It is in the nature of
                                acquisition of a quasi-proprietary right to the exclusive use of
                                the mark or get-up in relation to goods of that kind because of
                                the plaintiff having used or made it known that the mark or
                                get-up has relation to his goods. Such right is invaded by
                                anyone using the same or some deceptively similar mark, get-
                                up or name in relation to goods not of plaintiff. The three
                                elements of passing-off action are the reputation of goods,
                                possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the
                                plaintiff. In our opinion, the same principle, which applies to
                                trade mark, is applicable to trade name.

<blockquote id="blockquote_70">                                13.     In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather essential,
                                to seek an injunction, temporary or ad interim. The principles
                                for the grant of such injunction are the same as in the case of
                                any other action against injury complained of. The plaintiff
                                must prove a prima facie case, availability of balance of
                                convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable
                                injury in the absence of grant of injunction. According to
                                Kerly (ibid, para 16.16) passing-off cases are often cases of
                                deliberate and intentional misrepresentation, but it is well
                                settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of
                                action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a
                                defence, though proof of fraudulent intention may materially
                                assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception.
                                Christopher Wadlowin Law of Passing-Off (1995Edn., at p.
                                3.06) states that the plaintiff does not have to prove actual
                                damage in order to succeed in an action for passing-off.</blockquote>
<p id="p_122">                                Likelihood of damage is sufficient. The same learned author
                                states that the defendant&#x27;s state of mind is wholly irrelevant to
                                the existence of the cause of action for passing-off (ibid,
                                paras 4.20 and 7.15). As to how the injunction granted by the
                                court would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of
                                each case. Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">                                &quot;In the present case the plaintiff claims to have been running
                                his business in the name and style of Muktajivan Colour Lab
                                and Studio since 1982. He has produced material enabling a
                                finding being arrived at in that regard. However, the trial
                                court has found him using Muktajivan as part of his business
                                name at least since 1995. The plaintiff is expanding his
                                business and exploiting the reputation and goodwill
                                associated with Muktajivan in the business of colour lab and
                                photo by expanding the business through his wife and
                                brother-in-law. On or about the date of the institution of the
                                suit the defendant was about to commence or had just
                                commenced an identical business by adopting the word
                                Muktajivan as a part of his business name although till then
                                his business was being run in the name and style of Gokul
                                Studio. The intention of the defendant to make use of the
                                business name of the plaintiff so as to divert his business or
                                customers to himself is apparent. It is not the case of the
                                defendant that he was not aware of the word Muktajivan
                                being the property of the plaintiff or the plaintiff running his
                                business in that name, though such a plea could only have
                                indicated the innocence of the defendant and yet no difference
                                would have resulted in the matter of grant of relief to the
                                plaintiff because the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff was
                                writ large. It is difficult to subscribe to the logic adopted by
                                the trial court, as also the High Court, behind reasoning that
                                the defendants&#x27; business was situated at a distance of 4 or 5
                                km from the plaintiff&#x27;s business and therefore the plaintiff
                                could not have sought for an injunction. In a city a difference
                                of 4 or 5 km does not matter much. In the event of the
                                plaintiff having acquired a goodwill as to the quality of
                                services being rendered by him, a resident of Ahmedabad city
                                would not mind travelling a distance of a few kilometres for
                                the purpose of availing a better quality of services. Once a
                                case of passing-off is made out the practice is generally to
                                grant a prompt ex parte injunction followed by appointment
                                of Local Commissioner, if necessary. In our opinion the trial
                                court was fully justified in granting the ex parte injunction to

<p id="p_125">                          55.   In Satyam Infoway Ltd16, the Supreme Court was seized with a
                          case of alleged infringement of trade mark in a domain name, adopted
                          by the respondents before it. This decision authoritatively held such
                          action to be maintainable; for the purposes of the present dispute,
                          however, it is not necessary to enter into that aspect of the matter.
                          Suffice it to state that the appellant before the Supreme Court, Satyam
                          Infoway Ltd (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SIL&quot;) had registered several
                          domain names, such as www.sifynet, www.sifymall.com and
                          www.sifyrealestate.com, in June 1999, with the Internet Corporation
                          for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the World Intellectual
                          Property Organisation (WIPO), and claimed a wide reputation and
                          goodwill in the name &quot;Sify&quot;, which it claimed to have invented. The
                          respondent before the Supreme Court, Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd
                          (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SSPL&quot;) was engaged in the business of
                          Internet marketing, using the domain names www.siffynet.net and
                          www.siffynet.com, since June, 2021. SIL sought an injunction, against
                          SSPL, from using the name &quot;Siffy&quot; as part of its domain names.
                          Injunction, as sought, was granted by the learned Trial Court, but was
                          disallowed by the High Court in appeal, inter alia on the ground that
                          the finding, of the learned Trial Court, that SIL had earned a reputation
                          and goodwill in respect of the domain name &quot;Sify&quot; was not based on a

                           showed, on the other hand, that the business of SSPL was different
                          from that of SIL, with no similarity between them, thereby obviating
                          the possibility of any confusion or deception in the minds of
                          customers.    Paras 13 to 15 of the report, in the judgment of the
                          Supreme Court, set out, precisely, the three elements governing an
                          action for passing off, thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">                                &quot;13. The next question is, would the principles of trade
                                mark law and in particular those relating to passing off apply?
                                An action for passing off, as the phrase &quot;passing off&quot; itself
                                suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passingoff its
                                goods or services to the public as that of the plaintiff&#x27;s. It is
                                an action not only to preserve the reputation of the plaintiff
                                but also to safeguard the public. The defendant must have
                                sold its goods or offered its services in a manner which has
                                deceived or would be likely to deceive the public into thinking
                                that the defendant&#x27;s goods or services are the plaintiff&#x27;s. The
                                action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive
                                trade mark and the person who, if the word or name is an
                                invented one, invents and uses it. If two trade rivals claim to
                                have individually invented the same mark, then the trader
                                who is able to establish prior user will succeed. The question
                                is, as has been aptly put, who gets these first? It is not
                                essential for the plaintiff to prove long user to establish
                                reputation in a passing-off action. It would depend upon the
                                volume of sales and extent of advertisement.

<blockquote id="blockquote_73">                                14.     The second element that must be established by a
                                plaintiff in a passing-off action is misrepresentation by the
                                defendant to the public. The word misrepresentation does not
                                mean that the plaintiff has to prove any mala fide intention on
                                the part of the defendant. Of course, if the misrepresentation
                                is intentional, it might lead to an inference that the reputation
                                of the plaintiff is such that it is worth the defendant&#x27;s while to
                                cash in on it. An innocent misrepresentation would be
                                relevant only on the question of the ultimate relief which
                                would be granted to the plaintiff [Cadbury Schweppes v. Pub

                                parties. As we have already said, a passing-off action is based
                                on the goodwill that a trader has in his name unlike an action
                                for infringement of a trade mark where a trader&#x27;s right is
                                based on property in the name as such. Therefore, unless
                                goodwill can be established by the appellant by showing that
                                the public associates the name &quot;Sify&quot; with the services

                                appellant&#x27;s corporate site www.sifycorp.com. A number of

                                Sify&quot;, &quot;Messaging solutions from Sify&quot; have also been filed.
                                It is unfortunate that none of these documents were even

                                and &quot;Siffy&quot;, there is phonetic similarity between the two
                                names. The addition of &quot;net&quot; to &quot;Siffy&quot; does not detract from
                                this similarity.

                                admittedly, adopted the mark after the appellant. The
                                appellant is the prior user and has the right to debar the
                                respondent from eating into the goodwill it may have built up
                                in connection with the name.

<p id="p_133">                                32.     Another facet of passing off is the likelihood of
                                confusion with possible injury to the public and consequential
                                loss to the appellant. The similarity in the name may lead an
                                unwary user of the internet of average intelligence and
                                imperfect recollection to assume a business connection
                                between the two. Such user may, while trying to access the
                                information or services provided by the appellant, put in that
                                extra &#x27;f&#x27; and be disappointed with the result. Documents have
                                been filed by the respondent directed at establishing that the
                                appellant&#x27;s name Sify was similar to other domain names such
                                as Scifinet, Scifi.com, etc. The exercise has been undertaken
                                by the respondent presumably to show that the word &quot;Sify&quot; is
                                not an original word and that several marks which were
                                phonetically similar to the appellant&#x27;s trade name are already
                                registered. We are not prepared to deny the appellant&#x27;s claim
                                merely on the aforesaid basis. For one, none of the alleged
                                previous registrants are before us. For another, the word &quot;sci-
                                fi&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;science fiction&quot; and is phonetically
                                dissimilar to the word Sify. (See Collins Dictionary of the
                                English Language.)

                                because they operate in different fields. According to the
                                respondent its business is limited to network marketing unlike
                                the appellant which carries on the business of software
                                development, software solution and connected activities. The
                                respondent&#x27;s assertion is factually incorrect and legally
                                untenable. A domain name is accessible by all internet users
                                and the need to maintain an exclusive symbol for such access
                                is crucial as we have earlier noted. Therefore a deceptively
                                similar domain name may not only lead to a confusion of the

                                 source but the receipt of unsought-for services. Besides the
                                appellant has brought on record printouts of the respondent&#x27;s
                                website in which it has advertised itself as providing inter
                                alia software solution, integrating and management solutions
                                and software development covering the same field as the
                                appellant. To take a specific example, the respondent&#x27;s
                                brochure explicitly offers intranet and extranet solutions
                                which are also explicitly offered by the appellant. There is
                                clearly an overlap of identical or similar services. It may be
                                difficult for the appellant to prove actual loss having regard
                                to the nature of the service and the means of access but the
                                possibility of loss in the form of diverted customers is more
                                than reasonably probable.
</p>
<p id="p_135">                                34.    The last question is, where does the balance of
                                convenience lie? Given the nature of the business, it is
                                necessary to maintain the exclusive identity which a domain
                                name requires. In other words, either &quot;Sify&quot; or &quot;Siffy&quot; must
                                go. Apart from being the prior user, the appellant has adduced
                                sufficient evidence to show that the public associates the trade
                                name SIFY with the appellant. The respondent on the other
                                hand has produced little proof to establish the averments in
                                support of its case that it had a membership of 50,000. We are
                                unable to hold, while not commenting on the authenticity of
                                the bills relied on by the respondent, as the High Court has
                                done, that the bills by themselves show that the respondent
                                &quot;has been carrying on conferences at different places and
                                enrolling members who would be transacting with them in the
                                business and like that they have enrolled about 50,000
                                members already&quot;. Similarly, several bills raised in the name
                                of the respondent in respect of different items do not by
                                themselves establish that the members of the public have
                                come to associate the word &quot;Siffy&quot; only with the respondent.
                                Weighed in the balance of comparative hardship, it is difficult
                                to hold that the respondent would suffer any such loss as the
                                appellant would unless an injunction is granted. The
                                respondent can carry on its business and inform its members
                                of the change of name. We are conscious of the fact that the
                                grant of an interlocutory order may disrupt the respondent&#x27;s
                                business. But that cannot be seen as an argument which
                                should deter us from granting relief to the appellant to which
                                we are otherwise satisfied it is entitled.

</p><p id="p_137">                                 35.    The High Court&#x27;s finding that no prejudice would be
                                caused to the appellant because it had another domain name
                                was a consideration which might have been relevant if there
                                was a case of bona fide concurrent use and where the right to
                                use was coequal. The doubtful explanation given by the
                                respondent for the choice of the word &quot;Siffy&quot; coupled with
                                the reputation of the appellant can rationally lead us to the
                                conclusion that the respondent was seeking to cash in on the
                                appellant&#x27;s reputation as a provider of service on the internet.
                                In view of our findings albeit prima facie on the dishonest
                                adoption of the appellant&#x27;s trade name by the respondent, the
                                investments made by the appellant in connection with the
                                trade name, and the public association of the trade name Sify
                                with the appellant, the appellant is entitled to the relief it
                                claims. A different conclusion may be arrived at if evidence
                                to the contrary is adduced at the trial. But at this stage and on
                                the material before the Court, we are of the view that the
                                conclusion of the High Court to the contrary was
                                unwarranted.&quot;

                          allusion would follow hereinafter - the judgment in Satyam Infoway
                          Ltd16 instructively pronounces on two principles, which essentially
                          stem from equity, in such cases; firstly, that, though grant of an
                          interlocutory order may disrupt the business of the defendant, grant of
                          relief cannot be inhibited on that consideration, if the plaintiff is
                          otherwise found to be entitled to relief and, secondly, that the court
                          seized with the issue of whether to grant, or not grant, interlocutory
                          injunction, should not be concerned, more than necessary, with the
                          possibility of a different conclusion emerging consequent to trial.

                          Distilleries Ltd v. Scotch Whisky Association29</a>, is somewhat peculiar,
                          as it did not involve competing trade marks, but involved,
                          nevertheless, an allegation of passing off.         Khoday Distilleries
                          Limited (hereinafter referred to as &quot;KDL&quot;) manufactured &quot;Peter Scot&quot;
                          whisky, in respect of which the trade mark &quot;Peter Scot&quot; had been
                          granted registration.      The Scotch Whisky Association (hereinafter
                          referred to as &quot;SWA&quot;) alleged that, by use of the words &quot;Peter Scot&quot;,
                          KDL was deceiving customers into believing that it was
                          manufacturing Scotch whisky and was, therefore, passing off the
                          whisky manufactured by it as Scotch whisky. The Supreme Court
                          identified the issue arising for consideration as &quot;whether the term
                          &quot;Scot&quot; would itself be a sufficient ground to opine that the Mark
                          &quot;Peter Scot&quot; is deceptive or confusing&quot;. &quot;Indisputably&quot;, held the
                          Supreme Court, the onus of proof, in this regard, would be on SWA.

<p id="p_142">                          59.        Inasmuch as the nature of the controversy, before the Supreme
                          Court, was fundamentally different from that in the present
                          proceedings, it is not necessary to advert to the facts, in this decision,
                          in any great detail. The Supreme Court, however, held, in para 42 of
                          the report, that the issue of whether a misrepresentation was, or was
                          not, made, was a question of fact, which depended on many factors.
                          Thereafter, in para 61 of the report, the Supreme Court held that a
                          cause of action could be brought by those who (i) owned or had a
                          sufficient proprietary interest in the requisite goodwill, provided (ii)
                          the goodwill so owned was really likely to be damaged by the alleged

                                     principles in mind, it is difficult to appreciate as to how there
                                     is even a remote possibility of any customer being misled. In
                                     my opinion, when a customer goes to a shop to buy the
                                     plaintiffs&#x27; product, he will not ask for &#x27;Duet&#x27; or &#x27;Gin N Lime&#x27;
                                     or &#x27;Gin N Orange&#x27; but he will ask for a &#x27;Blue Riband Gin N
                                     Lime&#x27; or &#x27;Blue Riband Tango Gin N Orange&#x27;. Further having
                                     regard to the fact that the customer who is likely to buy the
                                     products of the plaintiffs and the defendants will be normally
                                     educated and discerning type, it is impossible to hold that
                                     there is any likelihood of confusion. It is pertinent to note that
                                     the plaintiffs have failed to cite even a single instance
                                     showing that there was confusion in the minds of the
                                     customers. The absence of evidence of actual deception is a
                                     circumstance which definitely weighs in favour of the
                                     defendants. It is also necessary to mention that the defendants
                                     have produced on record voluminous evidence showing that
                                     such premixtures are sold by several other companies under
                                     the names &#x27;American Extra Dry Gin with Lime Duet Plus&#x27;,
                                     &#x27;Forbes Two in One Dry Gin and Lime&#x27;, &#x27;Rainbow Gemlet
                                     Gin and Lime&#x27;, etc. In my opinion, there is no possibility of
                                     any confusion in this case at all.&quot;

                                no consequence because the arrangement of the letters is
                                entirely different, as is the phonetic and visual result. I also
                                agree with the submission made by the learned counsel for
                                the defendant that the intending purchasers of the competing
                                products are literate persons belonging to the affluent class of
                                society and who would be in a position to easily
                                distinguish SMIRNOFF from BRISNOFF particularly when the

                                given up by the defendant. The average person with imperfect

                                such persons i.e. discerning consumers of vodka. My prima
                                facie view is that the trade mark BRISNOFF is not deceptively
                                similar to, nor can it be confused with the plaintiffs&#x27; trade

                          running restaurants, and had adopted the mark &quot;NANDHINI&quot;, for its
                          restaurants, in 1989. ND had also applied for registration of the trade
                          mark &quot;NANDHINI&quot; in respect of various foodstuffs sold in its
                          restaurants. KCMP objected to the trade mark &quot;NANDHINI&quot;, of ND,
                          on the ground that it was deceptively similar to the &quot;NANDINI&quot; trade
                          mark of KCMP, and confusion was likely to occur. The dispute
                          travelled to the Supreme Court.

<p id="p_145">                          63.   The Supreme Court observed, at the outset, that the milk
                          products of KCMP fell under Clauses 29 and 30 of Schedule IV to the
                          Trade Marks Rules, whereas the foodstuffs sold by ND in its
                          restaurants fell under Clauses 29 and 30 as well as other classes.
                          Nevertheless, observed the Supreme Court, the goods of ND were
                          different from those of KCMP, as KCMP was producing and selling
                          only milk and milk products, whereas ND was trading in fish, meat,
                          poultry, meat extracts, preserved, dried fruits and vegetables, edible
                          oils and fats, salad dressings, preserves, etc., and had given up its
                          claim qua milk and milk products. The Supreme Court also observed
                          that both NANDINI and NANDHINI were generic expressions,
                          representing the name of a goddess and a cow in Hindu mythology,
                          and could not be regarded as words invented or coined by KCMP.
                          Keeping in mind these facts, the Supreme Court held that, despite the
                          phonetic similarity between NANDHINI and NANDINI, the marks of
                          ND and KCMP could not be regarded as deceptively similar. Paras

                                     aforesaid salient features, it is difficult to sustain the
                                     conclusion of IPAB in its order dated 4-10-2011 as well as in
                                     the impugned order of the High Court that the mark adopted
                                     by the appellant will cause any confusion in the mind of
                                     consumers, what to talk of deception. We do not find that the
                                     two marks are deceptively similar.&quot;

                          injunction was, in this case, sought solely on the allegation of passing
                          off.        Wockhardt was the registered holder of the trade mark
                          &quot;CHYMORAL&quot; and &quot;CHYMORAL FORTE&quot;, which are drugs
                          administered after surgery, to treat postsurgical wounds.                  The
                          respondent Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd (hereinafter referred to as
                          &quot;Torrent&quot;) claimed that Wockhardt was passing off its goods as those
                          of Torrent and, accordingly, sued Wockhardt. The High Court held in
                          favour of Torrent, holding that the triple test for passing off, i.e.
                          establishment of reputation, misrepresentation as understood in law
                          and likelihood of injury or damage caused to Torrent, had been found
                          to exist. The Supreme Court, in appeal, after extracting the principles
                          enunciated in its earlier decisions in <a href="/doc/125822018/" id="a_64">Laxmikant V. Patel28 and Satyam
                          Infoway Ltd16</a>, regarding the ingredients of passing off, upheld the
                          decision of the High Court.

</p><p id="p_155">                           65.        From the aforenoted decisions, the following clear principles
                          emerge:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_90">                                     (i)      Passing off, though an action based on deceit, does not
                                     require the establishment of fraud as a necessary element to
                                     sustain the action. Imitation or adoption, by the defendant, of
                                     the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark, in such manner as to cause confusion
                                     or deception in the mind of prospective customers, is
                                     sufficient.33


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_91">                                     (ii)     The principles for grant of injunction, in passing off
                                     actions, are the same as those which govern the grant of
                                     injunctions in other cases, i.e. the existence of a prima facie
                                     case, the balance of convenience, and the likelihood of
                                     irreparable loss in issuing to the plaintiff, were injunction not to
                                     be granted. 33

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_92">                                     (iii)    Proof of actual damage is not necessary, to establish
                                     passing off.33 However, proof of misrepresentation is necessary,
                                     even if intent to misrepresent is not approved. The question of
                                     intent may, nevertheless, be relevant, when it comes to the
                                     ultimate relief to be granted to the plaintiff. 34

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_93">                                     (iv)     Passing off may be alleged by a claimant who owns

                                  goods or services supplied by him, (d) calculated to injure the

                                  based on the goodwill that the trader has in his name, whereas
                                  infringement is based on the trader&#x27;s proprietary right in the
                                  name, registered in his favour. 43 Passing off is an action for
                                  deceit, involving passing off the goods of one person as those
                                  of another, whereas an action for infringement is a statutory
                                  remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered
                                  trade mark for vindication of its exclusive right to use the trade
                                  mark in relation to the goods in respect of which registration
                                  has been granted.44 Use of the trade mark by the defendant is
                                  not necessary for infringement, but it is a sine qua non for
                                  passing off.44 Once sufficient similarity, as is likely to deceive,
                                  is shown, infringement stands established.           Passing off,
                                  however, may be resisted on the ground of added material, such
                                  as packing, procurement through different trade channels, etc.,
                                  which would distinguish the goods of the defendant from those
                                  of the plaintiff and belie the possibility of confusion or

                                           similarity is on the defendant who seeks non-registration,

                                           has been held that deceptive similarity cannot be found to
                                           exist merely on the basis of phonetic similarity or even
                                           identity. 61 The matter, apparently, is always one of fact.
                                           The Court would have to decide, on a comparison of the
                                           two marks, and the parts thereof which are phonetically
                                           similar, as to whether such phonetic similarity is likely,
                                           considering all other circumstances, to confuse or
                                           deceive a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
                                           recollection, always bearing in mind the nature of the
                                           goods, and the degree of circumspection which would be
                                           expected of the purchasers who would purchase such
                                           goods.

                          case for grant of interlocutory injunction, applying the principles of
                          existence of a prima facie case, balance of convenience and likelihood

                          present, the court has to be doubly cautious while relying, on facts, or
                          earlier precedents. The Supreme Court has underscored this position
                          in its decisions in Khoday Distilleries29, Amritdhara Pharmacy20 and
                          Cadila Health Care6, all of which hold that the value of precedents, in

                          these are essentially allegations which involve disputed factual issues,
                          and would have to be thrashed out during the course of trial. What is
                          required to be examined is whether, viewed prima facie, a case for
                          grant of interlocutory injunction exists, or does not exist.

<blockquote id="blockquote_119">                                (i)    The defendant&#x27;s trade mark, holistically seen, cannot be
                                said to have, as its &quot;dominant&quot; feature, the word &quot;MUMUM&quot;.
                                The mark reads &quot;The MUMUM Co ... very very very real&quot;. In
                                my view, the words &quot;The&quot; and &quot;Co ... very very very real&quot;
                                cannot be said to have been used, in the trade mark of the
                                defendant, so inconspicuously, as to be dominated by the word
                                &quot;MUMUM&quot;. Plainly said, the trade mark of the defendant
                                cannot be said to be &quot;MUMUM&quot; which the words &quot;The&quot; and
                                &quot;Co very very very real&quot; forming inconspicuous and
                                inconsequential appendages thereto. The trade mark is &quot;The
                                MUMUM Co very very very real&quot;, and not &quot;MUMMUM&quot; or
                                even &quot;MUMUM&quot;. Applying the principle that the trade mark is
                                to be seen as a whole, and that one cannot extricate, from the
                                trade mark of the defendant, one particular word, for purposes
                                of comparison with the trade mark of the plaintiff, I am unable
                                to hold that there is deceptive similarity between the marks of
                                the plaintiff and the defendant, merely on the ground of
                                phonetic similarity between &quot;MUMMUM&quot; and &quot;MUMUM&quot;.

                                the defendant are, at a plain glance, completely different, and
                                cannot be regarded as confusing, or even similar, in the least.
                                There is no similarity of colour, pictorial representation, font,
                                lettering or even orientation.    The plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark is

                                &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, and the defendant&#x27;s trade mark is                .They
                                are completely distinct.    The two marks are so completely
                                dissimilar, both in their whole composition as well as visually,
                                that no case of infringement can be said to exist. (Besides, as
                                pointed out by Mr. Sinha, the registered trade mark of the
                                plaintiff is not &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, but &quot;MUM-MUM&quot;.)

</p><p id="p_187">                                (iii)   The customers, to whom the products of the plaintiff and
                                the defendant cater, are also different. As has been correctly
                                pointed out by Mr. Sinha, the products of the defendant cannot
                                be consumed by infants, who constitute the customer base of
                                the plaintiff, whether in the case of &quot;MUMMUM&quot; or
                                &quot;MUMMUM 2&quot;. &quot;MUMMUM&quot; is intended for consumption
                                by infants below the age of 6 months, whereas &quot;MUMMUM 2&quot;
                                is intended for infants above the age of 6 months. In either
                                case, the product is to be consumed by infants. The defendant&#x27;s
                                products are, on the other hand, snacks, to be consumed by
                                children over the age of 2 years. Etymologically and otherwise,
                                infants are not children, and children are not infants.      The
                                infants, who would consume the plaintiff&#x27;s products, cannot

                                plaintiff&#x27;s products must be a man of extraordinary tastes.
                                There is no customer overlap, therefore, between the products
                                of the plaintiff and those of the defendant.

<p id="p_188">                                (iv)   Applying the test of the &quot;nature of customer&quot; who would
                                buy the products of the plaintiff and the defendant, it is obvious
                                that no parent would seek to feed, to her or his infant, the
                                products of the defendant, and no parent of a grown-up child,
                                who is capable of consuming the defendant&#x27;s product, would
                                feed the child the products of the plaintiff. The purveyors of the
                                products would, nearly inevitably, be parents of children, or the
                                children themselves. They cannot be presumed to be liable to
                                confuse the products of the plaintiff for those of the defendant,
                                or vice versa. Besides, it is a matter of plain common sense that
                                there is no meeting ground, whatsoever, between infant milk
                                substitutes manufactured by the plaintiff and the snacks
                                manufactured by the defendant. The snacks of the defendant
                                are not even made of milk, but are prepared from fruits,
                                vegetables, grains and cereals, etc. No possibility, therefore, of

                                therefore, legitimately take judicial notice, that purchasers of
                                children&#x27;s - or, even more particularly, infants&#x27; - food items,
                                are as a rule careful about the products they purchase, which
                                would ultimately be consumed by the child, or the infant, for

                                large business houses engaging in activities which span the
                                spectrum from aircraft to alcohol, or from hospitals and hotels
                                to biscuits and sweets. That, however, is not the issue. The
                                Court is required to view the matter realistically, from the point
                                of view of the customer for whom the products of the parties
                                before it are meant to cater. The parent who walks into the
                                chemist&#x27;s shop seeking to purchase a tin of &quot;MUMMUM&quot;, or
                                even &quot;MUMMUM 2&quot;, for his baby&#x27;s consumption, is least
                                likely to settle, instead, for the savouries manufactured by the
                                defendant. No casual approach can reasonably be expected of
                                customers of such products.

                                as those of the plaintiff, or that the defendant is seeking to
                                capitalize on the goodwill earned by the plaintiff. No injury to

                                able to seriously traverse this submission. The mere fact that,

                                report, in my opinion, constitute a definitive declaration of the
                                law, within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution of

                                circumstances, and it would be impermissible for this Court to
                                seek to escape the application of the said passage, and the
                                principles enunciated therein, by seeking to ferret out factual

</p><p id="p_196">                                 (ix)   I am not inclined, therefore, to accept the submission, of
                                Ms. Majumdar, that the products of the plaintiff and the
                                defendant were allied, or similar.       They are, in my view,
                                completely distinct and different. They cater to different, and
                                non-overlapping, consumer segments, with the consumers of
                                the plaintiff&#x27;s products being incapable of consuming the
                                defendant&#x27;s products, and the consumers of the defendant&#x27;s
                                products being, ordinarily, incapable of consuming the
                                plaintiff&#x27;s products. (That some adults may, with relish, enjoy
                                infant milk substitutes, is another matter altogether.)

</p><p id="p_197">                                (x)    Ms. Majumdar is right in contending that, in such cases,
                                the approach of the Court is required to be geared towards
                                assessing whether there are similarities between the goods
                                before it, and not dissimilarities. The only similarity, between
                                the products of the plaintiff and the defendant is, however, in
                                my view, the phonetic similarity between &quot;MUMUM&quot; and
                                &quot;MUMMUM&quot;. This single factor is, prima facie, too loose a
                                peg, on which to hang the case of the plaintiff.

                                outlets, catering to different customers, as in the present case,
                                prima facie, no question of &quot;initial interest confusion&quot; can exist.

                           the plaintiff. Mrs X, the proud mother of a four year old daughter,
                          wishes to purchase a snack, for her daughter, who is underweight, to
                          consume. The snack should be healthy; she does not want a namkeen,
                          in the classical sense. She has heard, in some party perhaps, that such
                          products are available. During her child&#x27;s toddling years, she has
                          been feeding her the plaintiff&#x27;s &#x27;MUMMUM&#x27; (which, I hasten to add,
                          may not be the reason for her child being underweight). She knows of
                          the plaintiff&#x27;s product. She walks into the shop and asks the shop
                          assistant for a children&#x27;s snack, which could be consumed by her four-
                          year old.   The shop assistant hands her a packet of one of the
                          defendant&#x27;s products. Is she likely, on seeing the logo on the packet,
                          to connect it with the &#x27;MUMMUM&#x27; which she had been feeding her
                          child as an infant? At a plain glance, the answer has, prima facie, to
                          be in the negative. Is she likely to confuse the defendant&#x27;s product as
                          having been manufactured by the plaintiff, or purchase the
                          defendant&#x27;s product because she believes it to have been
                          manufactured by the plaintiff? The decision, if any, would have to be
                          taken by her on viewing the mark on the defendant&#x27;s packet. Merely
                          because the mark contains the word &quot;MUMUM&quot;, would one expect
                          Mrs X to notice, solely, the said word, latch onto its phonetic
                          similarity with &quot;MUMMUM&quot; and, therefore, regard the product of the
                          defendant as having been manufactured by the plaintiff, not noticing
                          the obvious dissimilarity, in all other respects, of the two marks?
                          Given the essentially different nature of the products themselves, the
                          answer has, prima facie, in my view, to be in the negative. If she
                          purchases the defendant&#x27;s product, she would do so solely on its own
                          strength, and not because she believes it to be a product manufactured

                           by the plaintiff. The defendant&#x27;s products cannot, therefore, in my
                          view, be legitimately be regarded as capitalizing on the goodwill
                          earned by the plaintiff, for their dissemination and sale. I cannot
                          reasonably hold that the defendant is &quot;passing off&quot; its goods as those
                          manufactured by the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_200">                          71.   Holistically seen, therefore, I am of the view that there is no
                          such deceptive similarity, between the mark of the plaintiff and the
                          mark of the defendant, as could make out a case either of infringement
                          of passing off. I do not deem it necessary to burden this order, which
                          is only prima facie in nature, addressing the prayer for interlocutory
                          injunction, with any detailed analysis of all other considerations, to
                          which my attention was drawn and which stand noted hereinabove,
                          including (i) the extent to which difference in classification of the
                          goods, under the schedule to the Trade Marks Rules would be
                          determinative, (ii) the issue of whether a prior adopter can infringe a
                          trade mark, the &quot;distinctive character and repute&quot;, stated to be
                          possessed by the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark, (iii) the conferment of rights
                          over the word contained in a logo, consequent on registration of the
                          logo, (iv) the import of the Infant Milk Substitutes Act on the
                          controversy in the present case, or (v) the allegedly &quot;descriptive&quot;
                          nature of the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark. All these issues are left open for
                          argument and consideration, at a later, and appropriate, stage.

<p id="p_201">                          72.   In substance, therefore, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has
                          not been able to make out a case for injuncting the defendant, during
                          the pendency of the present suit, from manufacturing or marketing its

                           products.    The competing trademarks being completely distinct,
                          visually and otherwise, the mere phonetic similarity between the
                          words &quot;MUMMUM&quot; and &quot;MUMUM&quot; is, in my view, insufficient to
                          make out a case of infringement. Given the nature of the products, the
                          fact that they cater to different customer groups, and other factors
                          highlighted hereinabove, I am not satisfied that, prima facie, a case for
                          passing off can be said to exist, either.
</p>
<p id="p_202">                          73.   I have also kept in mind, in this process, the consideration that
                          the defendant is not a new entrant in the field, or an entity which is yet
                          to commence the process of manufacture. The defendant has been
                          marketing its product since long, and its product has been extensively
                          advertised and is extensively sold both online and offline. At this
                          stage, on the material that has been adduced, and the submissions that
                          have been advanced, I am of the view that the balance of convenience
                          would not justify bringing, to a halt, the business of the defendant, in
                          respect of the allegedly infringing products.
