<p id="p_1">THE HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE


The matters have been referred to Full  Bench  to  answer  whether  a  private
company  is amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of Constitution of
India and if so what are the parameters.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      These matters relate to transfer of  employees  of  Sri  Chakra  Tyres
Limited.,  T.V.S.Suziki  Limited, Axle India Limited, ICICI Bank India Limited
and G.E.  Power Controls India Limited.   While  the  employees  complain  the
managements'  act  of  their  transfers as a measure of victimization and thus
extraneous and  mala  fide,  the  managements  counter  the  said  allegations


asserting  that  transfers  are  made  in exigencies of service and for better
performance of the companies, and not for  any  extraneous  reasons  or  as  a
measure of victimization.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      The learned single Judge has upheld the contention raised on behalf of
the  Managements  that  the  Writ  Petition  is  not maintainable and that the
employees have to approach the forums created under  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_9">Industrial  Disputes
Act</a>, hereinafter  referred to as the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_10">ID Act</a>.  Writ Appeals have been preferred
by the employees before the Division Bench and then other Writ Petitions  were
also  tagged  on  to the said Writ Appeals and after hearing the matters, by a
common order passed on 31.10.2003, the Division Bench was inclined  to  concur
with  the  findings  of  the learned single Judges but felt that the matter be
referred to the Full Bench as another coordinate  Bench  in  <a href="/doc/452915/" id="a_11">CHEMPLAST  SANMAR
LTD.  v.  METTUR CHEMICALS PODHU THOZHILALAR SANGAM &amp; ANOTHER</a> (2000 (1) L.L.J.
1  335) took a view that for violation of a statutory provision, Writ Petition
is maintainable even against a private company.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.  W.A.Nos.1387 to 1389 of 2002 relate to Sri Chakra Tyres Ltd., and filed by
the employees against the order of the learned single Judge.  W.A.Nos.1390  to
1392 of  2002 are filed by employees of T.V.S.  Suziki Ltd., against the order
of the learned single Judge.  W.A.Nos.1392 to 1411 of 2002 have been filed  by
the  employees  of  the Axle India Ltd., aggrieved by the order of the learned
single Judge.  So far as the writ petitions  are  concerned,  they  have  been
referred to be heard along with the writ appeals, when they came up before the
learned single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      Mr.V.Prakash,  the  learned  counsel appearing for the writ appellants
and writ petitioners strenuously contended that the transfers, which have been
effected, are mala fide due to extraneous reasons and  not  in  exigencies  of
service  as  projected by the management, that a reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_12">Section 10</a> of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is not an answer to redress the grievance of
the employees, and that in fact, such a reference at the instance  of  certain
individuals  is  not maintainable as only Employees Union can avail of <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_13">Section
10</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  As such, alternative remedy  doesn't
exist, and  even  if  it  exists, it is not efficacious.  It is also argued by
Mr.V.Prakash, learned counsel for the employees that civil  suits  are  barred
and  there  is no remedy under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_14">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947, and the only
remedy, which is available is the  one  provided  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article  226</a>  of  the
Constitution  of  India,  and  this  Court  shall  not  shut  the doors to the
employees.  He also submitted that in the case of ICICI  Bank  the  pensionery
benefits  are  being  curtailed and that is a change in service condition, and
pension  being  a  fundamental  right  traceable  under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article  21</a>  of   the
Constitution of  India,  writ  petition is maintainable.  There is no need for
adjudication, so far as the pensionery benefits are concerned,  as  we  record
the statement  made by Mr.A.  L.Somayaji, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the ICICI Bank that no pensionery benefits of the employees before this  Court
shall be affected.  What remains is the adjudication relating to transfers.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.  The managements before us are all companies registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_17">Companies
Act</a>, 1956.    They do not come within the definition of State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a>
of the Indian Constitution.  Unfair Labour Practice, particularly, Clause  (7)
of  Schedule  V  of Industrial Disputes Act, 194 7, which reads "to transfer a
workman mala fide from one place to another,  under  the  guise  of  following
management  policy"  is  being  pleaded in the instant cases by the employees,
while it is seriously disputed by the managements.  In the case of Sri  Chakra
Tyres Ltd.,, the appellants are transferred to outside states.  So also in the
case of  appellants  in  TVS  Suzuki  Limited.    In  Axle  India  Limited the
appellants are sought to be transferred from Sriperumbudur  to  Gummidipoondi,
both in Tamil  Nadu.   In ICICI Bank Ltd., and G.E.  Power Controls India Pvt.
Ltd.  some appellants are transferred within Tamil Nadu and  some  to  outside
States.  The   transfers   are  from  Hosur  to  New  Delhi.    The  jobs  are
transferable.  The question is whether the  transfers  are  in  exigencies  of
service  or  for  extraneous  reasons,  so  as to say that they are mala fide,
coming within the mischief of unfair  labour  practice  on  the  part  of  the
managements.  Two questions are to be addressed namely.,

(1)  whether  there  is  no remedy under common law or before the Forums under
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_19">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 to the appellants/employees;
</p>
<p id="p_7">(2) whether <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is the proper  remedy  to
redress their grievances.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.      General  contract  of  employment  is  governed  by common law and any
breach of the contract and dispute arising therefrom is to be  adjudicated  by
common law court.    But  if  the  matter  is governed by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_21">I.D.  Act</a> or the
Standing Orders relating thereto, by necessary  implication,  the  common  law
remedy  is  barred and more so, if the adjudicatory forums, be it Labour Court
or Industrial Tribunal, are constituted under <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_22">I.D.   Act</a>.    Earliest  is  the
judgment of  the  Supreme  Court  in  <a href="/doc/321104/" id="a_23">PREMIER AUTOMOBILES LIMITED v.  KAMLAKAR
SHANTARAM WADKE AND OTHERS</a> (1975 (2) LLJ 445).  In the said case, there was  a
dispute  as to whether a civil suit was maintainable in a matter arising under
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_24">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  The case related to the payment of  the  amounts
under  the  Memorandum of Settlement and as to whether there was an infraction
of <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_25">Section 9A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  A suit in  representative
capacity  was filed under Order I Rule 8 of C.P.C., and it was partly decreed,
against which an appeal was filed questioning the jurisdiction  of  the  civil
court, but  the  appeal failed.  Then the matter was taken in a Letters Patent
Appeal, but there also the finding with regard to sustainability of  the  suit
before  the  civil court was upheld, and later on the matter landed in Supreme
Court.  The legal contentions were comprehensively considered by referring  to
several  important  judgments and following are the legal principles stated in
the said case;
</p><p id="p_9">(i) If the dispute is not  an  industrial  dispute,  nor  does  it  relate  to
enforcement of any other right under the Act the remedy lies only in the civil
court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(ii)  If  the  dispute  is  an  industrial  dispute  arising out of a right or
liability under the  general  or  common  law  and  not  under  the  Act,  the
jurisdiction  of the civil court is alternative, leaving it to the election of
the suitor concerned to choose his remedy for the relief, which  is  competent
to be granted in a particular remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(iii)  If  the  industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right or an
obligation created under the Act, then the only remedy available to the suitor
is to get an adjudication under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(iv) If the right which is sought to be enforced is a right created under  the
Act  such  as Chapter VA then the remedy for its enforcement is either <a href="/doc/759209/" id="a_26">Section
33C</a> or the raising of an industrial dispute, as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.      A learned Judge of this Court in <a href="/doc/76973/" id="a_27">T.RAJAIAH AND  OTHERS  v.    SOUTHERN
ROADWAYS LTD.,  (REP</a>.    BY  ITS SECRETARY), MADURAI AND ANOTHER (1993 (3) LLJ
(Supp) 719) has  followed  the  above  Supreme  Court  Judgment  in  identical
circumstances like  the  present one.  The said case also related to transfers
in a private company from one place to another place and  were  questioned  on
the ground of mala fides by filing a suit, which came by way of Civil Revision
Petition.   The  contentious  issue  was  the maintainability of the suit, and
distinction was sought to be made regarding transfer simpliciter  as  compared
to transfer mala fide.  A further contention was raised that a Reference under
Section 10 of  I.  D.  Act having not been made by the Government, the suit is
maintainable.  The learned single Judge has held  that  the  employees  had  a
choice  of either approaching the Civil Court or availing the remedy under the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_28">I.D.  Act</a> and as they have availed the remedy under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_29">I.D.  Act</a> by seeking a
Reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_30">Section 10</a> thereof and the Government having refused to  refer
the  matter  and  even  affirmed  the same on a Review Petition, the employees
cannot turn back and invoke the common law remedy by filing  the  suit.    The
learned  single  Judge has invoked the doctrine of election on the ground that
if a litigant, having a choice of any of the legal  forums,  chooses  one,  he
cannot  choose  the another even if he is unsuccessful before the first forum.
The principle laid down by the learned single Judge is in consonance with  the
point  (ii)  of  the legal principles stated above in PREMIER AUTOMOBILES LTD.
(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.      Next authoritative judgment on  the  point  is  <a href="/doc/677949/" id="a_31">RAJASTHAN  STATE  ROAD
TRANSPORT CORPORATION  AND  ANOTHER  v.   KRISHNA KANT AND OTHERS</a> (1995) 5 SCC
</p><p id="p_15">75).  The employees of the Rajasthan State  Road  Transport  Corporation  were
dismissed  after  holding disciplinary enquiries on the charge of mis-conduct.
But, their suits before  the  civil  court  were  decreed  setting  aside  the
dismissals  and the said decrees were upheld by the first and second appellate
courts i.e., District Judge and the High Court respectively.  When the  appeal
was  filed  before  the  Supreme Court, the Supreme Court went into the matter
very comprehensively on the question of jurisdiction and  affirming  the  view
taken  in  Premier Automobiles Case (cited supra) has held that the remedy lay
before the Forum under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_32">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  We feel it apt to extract
the summery of the principles laid down in the above case,  which  is  to  the
following effect:
</p><p id="p_16">(1) Where the dispute arises from general law of contract, i.e., where reliefs
are claimed on the basis of the general law of contract, a suit filed in civil
court  cannot  be  said to be not maintainable, even though such a dispute may
also constitute an "industrial dispute" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_33">Section 2(k)</a>  or
<a href="/doc/1377486/" id="a_34">Section 2-A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
</p>
<p id="p_17">(2)   Where,   however,   the  dispute  involves  recognition,  observance  or
enforcement of any of the rights or  obligations  created  by  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_35">Industrial
Disputes  Act</a>,  the  only remedy is to approach the forums created by the said
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_18">(3) Similarly, where the  dispute  involves  the  recognition,  observance  or
enforcement  of  rights  and obligations created by enactments like <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_36">Industrial
Employment  (Standing  Orders)  Act</a>,  1946  -  which  can  be  called  "sister
enactments"  to <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_37">Industrial Disputes Act</a> - and which do not provide a forum for
resolution of such disputes, the only remedy shall be to approach  the  forums
created  by  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">Industrial  Disputes Act</a> provided they constitute industrial
disputes within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_39">Section 2(k)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1377486/" id="a_40">Section  2-A</a>  of  Industrial
Disputes  Act  or  where such enactment says that such dispute shall be either
treated as an industrial dispute or says that it shall be adjudicated  by  any
of the  forums created by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_41">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  Otherwise, recourse to
civil court is open.
</p>
<p id="p_19">(4) It is not correct to say that the  remedies  provided  by  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_42">Industrial
Disputes Act</a> are not equally effective for the reason that access to the forum
depends upon  a reference being made by the appropriate Government.  The power
to make a reference conferred upon  the  Government  is  to  be  exercised  to
effectuate the object of the enactment and hence not unguided.  The rule is to
make  a reference unless, of course, the dispute raised is a totally frivolous
one ex facie.  The power conferred is the power to refer and not the power  to
decide,  thought  it may be that the Government is entitled to examine whether
the dispute is ex facie frivolous, not meriting an adjudication.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(5) Consistent with the policy of law aforesaid, we commend to Parliament  and
the  State Legislatures to make a provision enabling a workman to approach the
Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal direcly - ie., without the requirement  of  a
reference  by  the  Government  -  in  case  of industrial disputes covered by
<a href="/doc/1377486/" id="a_43">Section 2-A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act.  This  would  go  a  long  way  in
removing  the  misgivings  with  respect  to the effectiveness of the remedies
provided by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_44">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(6) The certified Standing Orders framed under  and  in  accordance  with  the
<a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_45">Industrial  Employment  (Standing  Orders)  Act</a>,  1946 are statutorily imposed
conditions of service and are binding both upon the employers  and  employees,
though they  do  not amount to "statutory provisions".  Any violation of these
Standing Orders entitles an employee to appropriate relief either  before  the
forums  created  by  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_46">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  or  the civil court where
recourse to civil court is open according to the principles indicated herein.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(7) The policy of law emerging from <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_47">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>  and  its  sister
enactments  is  to  provide an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism to the
workmen, a mechanism which is speedy, inexpensive, informal  and  unencumbered
by  the  plethora  of  procedural  laws and appeals upon appeals and revisions
applicable to civil courts.  Indeed, the powers of the  courts  and  tribunals
under  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_48">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a> are far more extensive in the sense that
they can grant such relief as they think appropriate in the circumstances  for
putting an end to an industrial dispute."
</p>
<p id="p_23">10.     Latest  on  the  point  is the one decided by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_49">VST
INDUSTRIES LTD.  v.  VST INDUSTRIES WORKERS' UNION AND ANOTHER</a> (2001 )  1  SCC
</p><p id="p_24">298).  There  a  private  company was running a canteen.  The employees of the
canteen were later entrusted to a contractor as the company could not run  the
canteen by  itself.   The question was whether the canteen employees had to be
treated as the workmen of the company or of the contractor.   The  High  Court
held  that  the  running of a canteen is a statutory obligation on the part of
the company and as such, the employees had  to  be  treated  as  that  of  the
company and  issued a Writ as sought for.  The matter ultimately landed in the
Supreme Court.  Even though the Supreme  Court  did  not  disturb  the  relief
granted  by the High Court, the High Court's finding on the amenability to the
writ jurisdiction has been set aside.  It has been held by the  Supreme  Court
that the crucial factor for determining as to whether a company is amenable to
writ  jurisdiction or not depends as to whether a person, be it real person or
a legal one, performs a public duty or not.  It has been emphatically held  by
the  Supreme  Court  that any matter touching upon the service condition of an
employee is private to that employee or  group  of  employees  and  cannot  be
termed  as  public  duties  so  as to come within the domain of the public law
remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_25">11.     <a href="/doc/452915/" id="a_50">In CHEMPLAST SANMAR LTD.   v.    METTUR  CHEMICALS  PODHU  THOZHILALAR
SANGAM  AND  ANOTHER</a>  (2000  (1)  LLJ  1335)  cited supra, the facts are quite
different.  There the factual position is admitted.  There  was  a  settlement
under  <a href="/doc/664381/" id="a_51">Section 18(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for payment of fixed
monthly amount at the rate of 56.5% of  wages  for  the  circumstances  stated
therein.  The  time of the settlement expired.  The question for consideration
was whether after the expiry of the term of settlement the benefits under  the
settlement  enure  to  the  benefit  of  the  workmen till a new settlement is
arrived at substituting the old settlement.  Basing upon the law laid down  by
the  Supreme Court in the cases referred there to, it was held by the Division
Bench that the benefit in the old settlement continues even after  the  expiry
of its  term till a new settlement is arrived at substituting the old one.  It
was also held that in not honouring the commitment to pay  the  amounts  under
the  old  settlement, there was alteration of service condition without notice
to the employees, thus violating <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_52">Section 9A</a> of the  Industrial  Disputes  Act.
In  that  case  there  was no dispute with regard to questions of fact and the
entire matter lay on the  interpretation  of  <a href="/doc/509428/" id="a_53">Section  18</a>  of  the  Industrial
Disputes  Act,  in  the light of the legal principles laid down by the Supreme
Court.  In the instant case, the dispute is entirely different  as  there  are
serious  disputed  questions  of  fact which need to be probed, for which fact
finding is necessary, which can be made only after elaborate enquiry and  that
is  only  possible  either  before the Labour Court or by referring industrial
disputes under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_54">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.  In this  regard  the  dicta
laid  down by the Supreme Court for exercising the jurisdiction and the remedy
under the  <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_55">Special  Act</a>,  i.e.    <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_56">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>,   19   47   needs
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        12.     Transfers  of  the employees effected are personal to them and
do not involve any public duties.   For  making  out  a  statutory  violation,
fact-finding  is  necessary and the employees have to seek recourse to <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_57">Section
10</a> of I.D.  Act.  There is no embargo on the part of even one  employee  or  a
group  of  employees, even without any reference to any Union, for approaching
the Government under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_58">Section 10</a> of ID Act seeking a reference.  In the  matter
of  seeking reference, the guiding principles are already there and enunciated
in the case  of  RAJASTHAN  STATE  ROAD  TRANSPORT  CORPORATION  (supra)  that
reference is the rule and not referring is an exception, unless the Government
feels that the averments seeking reference result in abuse of process of law.
</p>


<p id="p_27">        13.     The  apprehension  of  delay  in  adjudication  by  the forums
created under <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_59">ID Act</a> cannot be a ground  to  invoke  Writ  jurisdiction.    As
already  stated  above,  Writ  jurisdiction can be invoked only when an action
involves a public duty.  However, in appropriate cases,  the  High  Court  can
always fix  a  time  for  adjudicating  the  disputes.   In some cases, as the
employees have failed to comply with the orders of transfer by joining at  the
transferred  places, they have been dismissed from service without holding any
enquiry.  In those cases, the matter has to be  viewed  with  some  mercy  and
there  is  no  need  for  emphasis that justice should always be tempered with
mercy.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        14.     In view of what is stated supra, we hold that

</p><p id="p_29">(i)     only such violations under <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_60">I.D.  Act</a>, which involve public duties, are
amenable to Writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_61">Article 226</a> of Constitution of India;
</p>
<p id="p_30">(ii)    dismissals,  transfers  and  other  matters  concerning  the   service
conditions of  employees governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_62">I.D.  Act</a>, have to be adjudicated only by
the forums created under the said statute and not otherwise;
</p>
<p id="p_31">(iii)   it is needless to mention that the disputes relating  to  matters  not
governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_63">I.D.  Act</a> have to be resolved only by common law Courts;
</p>
<p id="p_32">(iv)    the transfers effected in these cases do not involve any public duties
and  involve  the  disputed questions of fact and they should be resolved only
before the forums under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_64">I.D.  Act</a>;
</p>
<p id="p_33">(v)     the appellants/petitioners-employees shall be  entitled  to  seek  for
reference  by  filing  application  under  <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_65">Section 10</a> of the ID Act within two
weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order;
</p>
<p id="p_34">(vi)    if any industrial disputes are raised, then the concerned  forums,  be
it  Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal, shall dispose of the same within four
months from the date of receipt of the reference, after affording  opportunity
to either party;
</p>
<p id="p_35">(vii)   without    prejudice   to   the   contentions   of   the   appellants/
petitioners-employees, one week time from the date of receipt  of  a  copy  of
this  order is given to the employees to join at the transferred places and in
respect  to  such  of  those  dismissed  employees,  for  non-joining  at  the
transferred places, the delay is condoned if they join as stipulated above and
in  that  event, dismissal orders passed against them disappear automatically;
and

</p><p id="p_36">(viii)  the  respondents-managements  shall   sympathetically   consider   the
payments  of  wages/salaries  to the appellants/petitioners-employees so as to
maintain the industrial peace and harmony.
</p>

<p id="p_37">The Writ Appeals and Writ Petitions are disposed of accordingly.    No  costs.
Consequently, the connected W.A.M.Ps.  are closed.
