HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT

</pre><p id="p_5">1.    This proceeding, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, requires the
examination of questions and issues involving declaration as to personal assets of judges
of the Supreme Court, made to the Chief Justice of India, pursuant to a Full Court
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                        Page 1
 resolution of the Supreme Court of India, made in 1997. The petitioners challenge an
order of the Central Information Commission, dated 6 th January, 2009, upholding the
request of the respondent who had applied for disclosure of certain information
concerning such declaration of personal assets, by the judges (of the Supreme Court).
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.     The facts of the case are that the Respondent (hereafter "applicant") had, on
10.11.2007 required the Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India
("the CPIO"), nominated under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_2">Information Act</a> (hereafter "the Act") to
furnish a copy of the resolution dated 7.5.1997 of the Full Court of the Supreme Court,
("the 1997 resolution") which requires every judge to make a declaration of all assets.
He further sought for information relating to declaration of assets etc, furnished by the
respective Chief Justices of States. By order dated 30 th November, 2007, the CPIO
informed the applicant that a copy of the resolution dated 7.5.1997 would be furnished
on remitting the requisite charges. He was also told that information relating to
declaration of assets by the judges was not held by or under the control of the Registry
of the Supreme Court and, therefore, it could not be furnished.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.     The applicant appealed to the nominated Appellate authority, who, after hearing
him, recorded satisfaction (of the applicant) about receipt of a copy of the resolution; he
nevertheless, challenged the second part of the impugned order which held that the
CPIO did not hold any information regarding the declaration of assets. It was also
contended that if the CPIO was not holding the information, he should have disclosed
the authority holding such information and should have referred the application to such
an authority, invoking <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_3">Section 6</a> (3) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_4">Information Act</a>. It was also
contended out that assuming that the CPIO did not hold the information, since the
applicant had sought information regarding the declaration of assets made by the
various Chief Justice of the States, the CPIO, Supreme Court should have transferred the



W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 2
 matter to the respective CPIOs. The appellate authority remanded the matter for
reconsideration, to the CPIO, observing as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "A perusal of the application dated 10.11.2007 discloses that the appellant had
       sought for information relating, to the declaration of assets by the Hon'ble Judges
       of the Supreme Court as well as the Chief Justice of the States. The order of the
       CPIO is silent regarding <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_5">Section 6</a> (3) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_6">Information Act</a>. to the above
       extent, I feel that the appellant is justified in contending that if the CPIO was not
       holding the information, he should have considered the question of <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_7">Section 6</a> (3).
       Regarding the respective States, if the CPIO was not holding information, he
       should have considered whether he should have invoked the provision under
       <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_8">Section 6</a> (3) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_9">Information Act</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       In the above circumstances, the impugned order to the above extent is liable to be
       remanded back. The matter is remanded to the CPIO to consider the question
       whether <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_10">Section 6(3)</a> of the Act, is liable to be invoked by the CPIO.
       The matter is remanded to the CPIO for afresh consideration on the above limited
       point after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the appellant.
       The Appellant, if aggrieved by this order, is entitled to file a second appeal before
       the Central Information Commission, New Delhi under <a href="/doc/1852611/" id="a_11">Section 19(3)</a> of the Right
       to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_12">Information Act</a> within 90 days from the date of communication of this order."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">After remission, the CPIO rejected the application, stating as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "In the case at hand, you yourself knew that the information sought by you is
       related to various High Court in the country and instead of applying to those
       Public Authorities you have taken a short circuit procedure by approaching the
       CPIO, Supreme Court of India remitting the fee of Rs.10/- payable to one authority
       and getting it referred to all the public authorities at the expense of one Central
       Public Information Officer. In view of this, the relief sought by you cannot be
       appreciated and is against the spirit of <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_13">Section 6</a> (3) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_14">Information
       Act</a>, 2005.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       You may, if so advised approach the concerned public authorities for desired
       information".
</blockquote><p id="p_9">4.     The Applicant approached the Central Information Commission (CIC). It was
contended that the CPIO had not followed the directions of the appellate authority,
which originally remanded the case, and decided whether the application had to be sent

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 3
 to another authority, as it was expected to. It was also contended that the CPIO's order
maintained a studied silence about disclosure of information about asset declaration by
judges of the Supreme Court to the Chief Justice of India ("CJI") in accordance with the
1997 Resolution. The CPIO contended, before the CIC, that the RTI application had two
parts, the first part related to copy of Resolution, which was provided to the applicant,
and the second part related to declaration of assets by the Supreme Court judges. The
CPIO submitted that the Registrar of the Supreme Court did not hold the information. It
was submitted that the 1997 Resolution was an in-house exercise; and the declaration
regarding assets of the judges is only voluntary. The resolution itself describes
submission of such declarations as "Confidential". It was also contended that disclosure
of the declarations would be breach of a fiduciary relationship. The CPIO further
submitted that the declarations were submitted to the Chief Justice of India not in his
official capacity but in his personal capacity and that any disclosure would be violate of
the 1997 resolution, deemed such declarations 'confidential'. It was also contended that
the disclosure would be contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_15">section 8(1)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.     The CIC, in its impugned order, reasoned that since the Supreme Court was
established by the Constitution of India and is a public authority within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/22242358/" id="a_16">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/190028862/" id="a_17">Section 2(e)</a> (i) was referred, to say that the Chief Justice of India
was a competent authority, under the Act, empowered to frame Rules under <a href="/doc/612223/" id="a_18">Section 28</a>
of the Act to carry out provisions of the Act. It was held that rule making power is
conferred by provisions of the Act, upon the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court, who
cannot disclaim being public authorities. The applicant's appeal was allowed, on the
following reasoning:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "16. The rule making power has been explicitly given for the purpose of carrying
       out the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_19">RTI Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_20">The Act</a>, therefore, empowers the Supreme Court
       and the other competent authorities under the act and entrusts upon them an
       additional responsibility of ensuring that the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_21">RTI Act</a> is implemented in letter and
       spirit. In view of this, the contention of the respondent public authority that the
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                      Page 4
      provisions of Right to Information act are not applicable in case of Supreme Court
     cannot be accepted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     17.     The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Supreme Court during the
     course of hearing argued that the information concerning the declaration of
     assets by the judges is provided to the Chief Justice of India in his personal
     capacity and it is "voluntary' and "confidential". From what was presented before
     us. It can be inferred that the declaration of assets are filed with the Chief Justice
     of India and the office of the Chief Justice of India is the custodian of this
     information. The information is maintained in a confidential manner and like any
     other official information it is available for perusal and inspection to every
     succeeding Chief Justice of India. The information, therefore, cannot be
     categorized as "personal information" available with the Chief Justices in their
     personal capacity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     18.    The only issue that needs to be determined is as to whether the Chief
     Justice of India and the Supreme Court of India are two distinct Public Authorities
     or one Public Authority. In this context, it would be pertinent to refer again to the
     provisions of <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_22">section 2</a> (h) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_23">Information Act</a>, the relevant part of
     which reads as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "2(h) "Public authority" means any authority or body or institution of self -
       government established or constituted..."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     19.     The Public Authority, therefore, can only be an "authority" 'body' or an
     "institution" of self, government, established or constituted, by or under the
     Constitution or by any other law, or by an order made by the appropriate
     government.</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     20.    The words "Authority, "body" or "institution" has not been distinctly
     defined in the Act, the expression "authority" in its etymological sense means a
     Body invested with power to command or give an ultimate decision, or enforce
     obedience or having a legal right to command and be obeyed. Webster's
     Dictionary of the English language defined "authorities as "official bodies that
     control a particular department or activity, especially of the Government. The
     expression other authorities has been explained as authorities entrusted with a
     power of issuing directions, disobedience of which is punishable as an offence, or
     bodies exercising legislative or executive functions of the state or bodies which
     exercise part of the sovereign power or authority of the State and which have
     power to make rules and regulations and to administer or enforce them to the
     detriment of the citizens. In the absence of any statutory definition or judicial


W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 5
      interpretation to the contrary, the normal etymological meaning of the
     expression, has to be accepted as the true and correct meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     21.    According to the dictionary meaning, the term "institution" means a body
     or organization or an association brought into being for the purpose of achieving
     some object. Oxford Dictionary defines an "institution as a establishment,
     organization or an association instituted for the promotion of some objects
     especially one of public or general utility, religious, charitable, educational etc.,
     The definition of the 'institution', therefore, includes an authority as well as a
     body. By very implication, the three terms exclude an "individual". Even the
     Hon'ble Apex Court in Kamaraju Venkata Krishna Rao Vs. Sub - collector, Ongole
</p><p id="p_13">     - AIR 1969 SC 563 has observed that it is by no means easy to give definition of
     the word "institution" that would cover every use of it. Its meaning must always
     depend upon the context in which it is found.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     22.     If the provisions of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_24">Article 124</a> of the Constitution are read in view of the
     above perspective, it would be clear that the Supreme Court of India, consisting of
     the Chief Justice of India and such number of judges as the Parliament may by law
     prescribe, is an institution or authority of which the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India
     is the Head. The institution and its Head cannot be two distinct public authorities.
     They are one and the same. Information, therefore, available with the Chief
     Justice of India must be deemed to be available with the Supreme Court of India.
     The Registrar of the Supreme Court of India, which is only a part of the Supreme
     Court cannot be categorized as a Public Authority independent and distinct from
     the Supreme Court itself.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     23.    In view of this, the question of transferring an application under <a href="/doc/666037/" id="a_25">Section
     6(3)</a> of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_26">Information Act</a> by the CPIO of the Supreme Court cannot
     arise. It is the duty of the CPIO to obtain the information that is held by or
     available with the public authority. Each of the sections or department of a public
     Authority cannot be treated as a separate or distinct public authority. If any
     information is available with one section or the department, it shall be deemed to
     be available with the Public Authority as one single entity CPIO cannot take a view
     contrary to this.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     24.    In the instant case, admittedly, the information concerning the judges of
     the Supreme Court is available with the Supreme Court and the CPIO represents
     the Supreme Court as a public authority. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_27">Under the RTI Act</a>, he is, therefore,
     obliged to provide this information to a citizen making an application under the
     <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_28">RTI Act</a> unless the disclosure of such information is exempted under the law.
</p>


<p id="p_17">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 6
</p><p id="p_18">      25.    During course of hearing, it has been argued that the declaration of assets
     submitted by the judges of the Supreme Court are confidential and the
     information has been provided to the chief justice of India in a fiduciary
     relationship and as such, its disclosure is exempted under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_29">Section 8(1)</a> (e) of the
     <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_30">RTI Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_19">     26.     In this context it will be pertinent to reiterate what the appellant has asked
     for in his RTI Application and which is as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_20">     I will be obliged if your honour very kindly arranges to send me a copy of the said
     resolution passed by the judges of the Supreme Court on 7.5.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     I will be obliged if your honour kindly provides me information on any such
     declaration of assets etc ever filed by Honourable judges of the Supreme Court.
     Kindly also arrange information if High Court judges are submitting declaration
     about their assets etc to respective Chief Justices in States.
</p><p id="p_22">     27.    The information in regard to point (i) as above has already been provided.
     As regards the information covered by point No. (ii) &amp; (iii) above, the same has
     been denied on the ground that it is not held by or under the control of the
     Registrar of the Supreme Court of India and, therefore, cannot be furnished by the
     CPIO.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     28.     The First Appellant Authority while deciding the matter assumed that the
     CPIO of the Supreme Court was not holding the information concerning the
     declaration of the assets made by the High Court judges and that this information
     is held by the chief justices of the State High Courts and accordingly, he observed
     that the appellant is justified in contending that if the CPIO was not holding the
     information, he should have considered the question of invoking <a href="/doc/666037/" id="a_31">Section 6(3)</a> of
     the RTI Act. accordingly, the matter was remanded back by him to the CPIO of the
     Supreme Court for fresh consideration on limited point i.e. transfer of application
     to various High Courts u/s 6(3) of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_32">RTI Act</a>. It will not be out of context to
     reproduce what the Appellate Authority has decided in his order:
</p>
<p id="p_24">       "In the above circumstances, the impugned order to the above extent is liable to
       be remanded back. The matter is remanded to the CPIO to consider the question
       whether <a href="/doc/666037/" id="a_33">section 6(3)</a> of the Act, is liable to be invoked by the CPIO.
       The matter is remanded to the CPIO for afresh consideration on the above
       limited point after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the
       appellant."
</p><p id="p_25">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 7
</p><p id="p_26">      29.     CPIO on receiving the matter back on remand rejected the application of
     the appellant. It appears that both the CPIO and the first Appellant Authority have
     remained silent as regards the information concerning declaration of assets by
     the judges of the Supreme Court. At the time of hearing, it was admitted that the
     information concerning declaration of the assets by the judges of the Supreme
     Court is not available with the Registry, but the office of the Chief Justice of India
     holds the same. The information requested under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_34">RTI Act</a> was denied only on
     the ground that the Registry does not hold the information. But the first
     appellate authority did not find as to where the information is available. The CPIO
     maintained silence as regards this matter even after he received the matter on
     remand. At the time of hearing before this Commission, however, it was
     submitted that the information might be available with the office of the Chief
     Justice of India. It is clear that neither the CPIO nor the First Appellate Authority
     has claimed that the information asked for by the appellant is exempt either
     under <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_35">Section 8</a> (1) (e) of the Act being received in fiduciary relationship or that
     this information is 'personal information' attracting exemption under <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_36">section 8</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_27">     (j).
</p><p id="p_28">     30.    The appellant Shri S.C. Agrawal is apparently not seeking a copy of the
     declarations or the contents therein or even the names etc. of the judges filing the
     declaration, or is he requesting inspection of any such declaration already filed.
     He is seeking simple information as to whether any such declaration of assets etc.,
     has ever been filled by the judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts. What he is
     seeking cannot be held to attract exemption under <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_37">Sections 8(1)(e)</a> or 8(1) (j).
</p><p id="p_29">     31.     The only question that remains to be decided is as to whether CPIO was
     justified in turning down the request of the Appellant to transfer the RTI
     application to the concerned CPIO of the High Courts even after the Fist Appellate
     Authority remanded the case to him. In this connection, it may be mentioned that
     the request for transfer under <a href="/doc/666037/" id="a_38">section 6(3)</a> of the Right to information Act has
     been turned down on the ground that the appellant was well award that the
     information is available with the respective High Courts which are separate and
     distinct public authorities. This point has not been pressed at the time of hearing
     as Such, it is not necessary to decide this issue at this stage.

<p id="p_30">     32.    In view of what has been observed above, the CPIO of this Supreme Court is
     directed to provide the information asked for by the appellant in his RTI
     application as to whether such declaration of assets etc. has been filed by the
     Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court or not within ten working day form the date

</p><p id="p_32"> 6.     When presented, the CPIO was the sole writ petitioner; later, however, the
Registrar, Supreme Court was added as a party. The petitioners were represented by
the (then) Solicitor General, Mr. Goolam E. Vahanvati (hereafter referred to as "the
petitioners' counsel"); Mr. Prashant Bhushan argued on behalf of the respondent
applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_33">7.     It is argued at the outset that the petition, is not filed with a view to raise
technical objections to avoid declaring assets of the judges, but on a fundamental
question of law with regard to scope and applicability of RTI; it is also clarified that the
learned judges of the Supreme Court are not opposed to declaring their assets, provided
that such declarations are made in accordance with due procedure laid down by a law
which would prescribe (a) the authority to which the declaration would be made (b) the
form in which the declaration should be made, with definitional clarity of what are
'assets'; and (c) proper safeguards, checks and balances to prevent misuse of
information made available.
</p>
<p id="p_34">8.     The petitioners argue that the information sought for, by the applicant, is not in
the public domain. In support, it is submitted that the expression "right to information"
defined by <a href="/doc/13329432/" id="a_39">Section 2(j)</a> envisions information "accessible, in this Act, which is held by or
under the control of any public authority..." The petitioners contend that the source of
the right to seek information, is not any law, but a non-binding obligation, on account of
the 1997 resolution. It is argued that there is no Constitutional or legal obligation to
furnish such declaration. Though it was urged that the CJI is not a public authority, the
counsel submitted that the terms of the Act would show that in fact, he is one. In the
petition it has been submitted that the office of the CJI is distinct from the Registry, and
the CIC's findings in that regard are erroneous; the petitioners emphasize that the CJI is
required, by provisions of the Constitution, and different laws, and also the decision in
Supreme Court Advocates on <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_40">Record Association v. Union of India</a>, (1993) 4 SCC 441 to

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 9
 perform various functions that are distinct from his role as Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court. Therefore, the impugned order, according to them, is unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_35">9.     The petitioners urge that for anything, to constitute information, it should be in
the public domain, and should be held by a public authority under the mandate of law;
the law should prescribe that something should be done, or not be done, and must be
accompanied by sanction for its non-performance. In support, reliance is placed on the
judgment reported as Kruze v. Johnson 1895 All ER 105; Dwarkanath Tewari v. State of
Bihar AIR 1959 SC 259 and <a href="/doc/225779/" id="a_41">Indian Airlines Corporation v. Sukhdev Rai</a> 1971 (2) SCC 192. It
is urged that individual judges have the choice of declaring, or not declaring assets; an
autonomy that cannot be commented upon, or interfered with by the CJI. It is likewise
argued that non-disclosure does not result in any breach of law, or attract any sanction,
which clearly demonstrate that the 1997 resolution is not binding. The petitioners'
counsel submits that the resolution cannot also be described as containing "Rules". In
this context, counsel urges that rules are made unilaterally by the concerned authority,
and are not dependent upon their binding nature on the choice or exercise of volition of
anyone, subjected to them. Reliance is placed on Sirsi Municipality v. Cecilia Con. Francis
Tellis 1973 (1) SCC 409.
</p>
<p id="p_36">10.    Learned counsel for the petitioner urges that the ruling in <a href="/doc/1117276/" id="a_42">Indira Jaising v.
Registrar General</a> 2003 (5) SCC 494 held that deliberations during the "in house
procedure" evolved as a result of the resolution of the Chief Justices' Conference (in
1999) cannot be the subject matter of disclosure. Reliance is placed on the following
observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "Therefore, in the hierarchy of the courts, the Supreme Court does not have any
       disciplinary control over the High Court Judges, much less the Chief Justice of India
       has any disciplinary control over any of the Judges. That position in law is very
       clear. Thus, the only source or authority by which the Chief Justice of India can
       exercise this power of inquiry is moral or ethical and not in exercise of powers

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 10
        under any law. Exercise of such power of the Chief Justice of India based on moral
       authority cannot be made the subject-matter of a writ petition to disclose a
       report made to him."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">It is submitted that there is nothing in the 1997 Resolution involving processes of
government; reliance is also placed on the following passage from Indira Jaising:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "Heavy reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1294854/" id="a_43">S. P. Gupta v.
       Union of India</a> (1981 Supp SCC 87), <a href="/doc/438670/" id="a_44">State of U.P. v. Raj Narain</a> ((1975) 4 SCC 428),
       <a href="/doc/195331/" id="a_45">Union of India v. Assn</a>. for Democratic Rights ((2002) 5 SCC 294) and <a href="/doc/539407/" id="a_46">Secy.,
       Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting, Govt. of India v. Cricket Assn. of Bengal</a>
       ((1995) 2 SCC 161). The principles stated in these decisions have been
       reconsidered by this Court in People's Union for <a href="/doc/31276692/" id="a_47">Civil Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of
       India</a> ((2003) 4 SCC 399 : JT (2003) 2 SC 528). It is no doubt true that in a
       democratic framework free flow of information to the citizens is necessary for
       proper functioning particularly in matters which form part of a public record. The
       decisions relied upon by the learned counsel of the petitioner do not also say that
       right to information is absolute. There are several areas where such information
       need not be furnished. Even the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, to which also
       reference has been made by the learned counsel of the petitioner, does not say in
       absolute terms that information gathered at any level in any manner for any
       purpose shall be disclosed to the public. The inquiry ordered and the report made
       to the Chief Justice of India being confidential and discreet is only for the purpose
       of his information and not for the purpose of disclosure to any other person. The
       principles stated in the above decisions are in different context and those
       principles cannot be invoked in a case of this nature, which is of an exceptional
       category. Therefore, the first contention advanced on behalf of the petitioner by
       Shri Shanti Bhushan for a direction to release the said report has got to be
       rejected in limine."
</blockquote><p id="p_38">11.    It is next argued that any disclosure made by judges, pursuant to the 1997
resolution, is not a public act done in the discharge of duties of their office. The
petitioners elaborate this by saying that the Act is aimed at ensuring access to all actions
of public officials done or performed during the course of their official duties. Such
being the case, the declaration of personal assets, by individual judges, has nothing to
do with their duties, as judges. The petitioners again emphasize the voluntary nature of
such disclosure, and absence of any legal sanction as a result of non-disclosure.
</p>
<p id="p_39">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 11
</p><p id="p_40"> 12.    The second limb of the petitioners' submission is that the information, about
assets of judges, if such facts are deemed "information" is exempt from disclosure, by
virtue of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_48">Section 8(1)</a> (e) which casts a fiduciary duty on the CJI to hold the asset
declarations in confidence. Here, the petitioners emphasize that the Resolution which
says that the "declaration made by the judges or the Chief Justice as the case may be,
shall be confidential.." It is submitted that such being the case, asking disclosure, would
be compelling the CJI to breach the fiduciary nature of his duty to keep the asset
declarations confidential. The petitioners submit that the fiduciary nature of duty
applies even in respect of the nature of information sought, i.e. details of whether
judges declared their assets, to the CJI.
</p>
<p id="p_41">13.    The petitioners contend that though the question of what has been declared
(contents of individual asset details provided by the judges to CJI) is not subject matter
of these proceedings, the question of its access would arise, if it is held that such
declarations are "information" under the Act. The contention is that the information - if
asset declarations are to be deemed as such, are exempt by virtue of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_49">Section 8(1)</a> (j) of
the Act, which provides that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has
       no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause
       unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public
       Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate
       authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies
       the disclosure of such information:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">              Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or
       a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person."
</blockquote><p id="p_42">14.    Counsel argues that in the absence of any legally binding norm, declaration of
assets by judges, if construed to be "information" is private, and as such exempt from
the Act. Counsel points to the non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_50">Section 8</a> and submits that
Parliament intended that such personal matters are kept out of bounds, as they involve

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 12
 issues of privacy and confidentiality. The petitioners lastly argue that there is lack of
clarity in the resolutions, about "assets" and "investments" which can easily lead to
confusion, and that lack of appropriate guidelines in this regard, would lead to unknown
consequences.
</p>
<p id="p_43">Respondents' contentions

</p><p id="p_44">15.    The respondent applicant contests the argument that information which is not in
the public domain cannot be accessed, and terms it as begging the question. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_51">The Act</a>,
says the applicant, defines which information will be in the public domain and is widely
cast, to allay any doubts in that regard. Referring to the definition, it is submitted that
irrespective of whether such notes, e-mails, advice, memos, etc. were marked
confidential and made by civil servants to be kept outside the public domain, the Act
expressly places them in the public domain and available to the people on the principle
laid down in the matter of <a href="/doc/438670/" id="a_52">State of UP v. Raj Narain</a>, AIR 1975 SC 865. Reliance is placed
on the following observations in that judgment:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "*I+n a government of responsibility like ours, where all the agents of the public
       must be responsible for their conduct, there can be put few secrets. The people of
       this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a
       public way, by their functionaries... The right to know, which is derived from the
       concept of freedom of speech, though not absolute, is a factor which should make
       one way, when secrecy is claimed for transactions which can, at any rate, have n
       o repercussion on public security. To cover with veil of secrecy, the common
       routine business is not in the interest of public."
</blockquote><p id="p_45">The respondent contends that in a democracy, people are the masters and all civil
servants or any other public servants are their servants and therefore, the masters have
a right to know what their servants are doing in every detail and in every aspect which
includes the decision making process. That is why notings, e-mails, memos,
correspondence, advice, etc., were expressly included within the definition of



W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 13
 information accessible under the Act. Learned counsel submitted that the Act has
overriding effect, by reason of <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_53">Section 22</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_46">16.    The respondent next submits that <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_54">Section 8</a> of the Act, in the statutory scheme,
exempts certain classes of information. (The provision begins with a non-obstante
clause); it is argued that exemptions contain several legitimate grounds for excluding
information from public scrutiny in public interest. No other ground for excluding
information which exists with any public authority can be deduced under the Act,
particularly in respect of information merely marked "confidential". The only exemption
there in connection with this is the exemption under clause 8 (1) (j) which deals with
information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not
relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted
invasion of the privacy of the individual. However this information may also be disclosed
if the Central Public Information officer or the State Public Information Officer or the
appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest
justifies the disclosure of such information. It is argued that by no stretch of imagination
can the query whether judges have declared their assets, be considered exempt; there
is no question of any confidentiality or privacy. The respondents argue that the
information sought is only in this regard. It was however argued, that the question of
contents of asset declarations and access are also intrinsically linked to this issue, since
they involve the examination of the same legal regime.
</p>
<p id="p_47">17.    It is submitted that this issue has been settled by the Supreme Court in 2002, and
2003 in its judgment in <a href="/doc/195331/" id="a_55">Union of India v. Association</a> for Democratic Reforms, AIR 2002
SC 2112, and People's Union for <a href="/doc/110957682/" id="a_56">Civil Liberties v. Union of India</a>, AIR 2003 SC 2363, where
the Court held that the fundamental right of citizens, under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_57">Article 19 (1) (a)</a> includes
the citizens' right to know the assets and liabilities of candidates contesting elections to
parliament or to the State Legislatures, thereby seeking to hold positions of

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 14
 responsibility in Government. In para 50 of their judgment in the Association for
Democratic Reforms case, it was held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "Mr. Ashwni Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenor
      submitted that the aforesaid observations are with regard to citizens right to
      know about the affairs of the Government, but this would not mean that citizens
      have a right to know the personal affairs of MPs or MLAs. In our view this
      submission is totally misconceived. There is no question of knowing personal
      affairs of MP's or MLAs. The limited information is whether the person who is
      contesting elections is involved in any criminal case and if involved, what is the
      result ? Further, there are widespread allegations of corruption against the
      persons holding post and power. In such a situation, question is not of knowing
      personal affairs but to have openness in democracy for attempting to cure
      cancerous growth of corruption by few rays of light. Hence, citizens who elect
      MPs or MLAs are entitled to know that their representative has not misconducted
      himself in collecting wealth after being elected. This information could be easily
      gathered only if prior to election, the assets of such person are disclosed..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">18.   The respondent also refers to a Code of Conduct, (hereafter "the Code") evolved
in the Chief Justices' Conference, (hereafter, "the Conference") in 1999, which
reiterated and adopted the 1997 resolution, and says that the said Code established a
mechanism and an in-house procedure to enquire into complaints against Judges,
through a Committee of Judges, constituted by the CJI, to take action against those
violating the Code. A copy of the resolution has been produced; the respondent says
that the CJI has implemented this mechanism in several past instances, which reveals
that judges have considered that these are binding standards. Extending the logic, it is
emphasized that, therefore, the 1997 resolution cannot be disclaimed, as it was a
conscious decision taken by judges, who hold high public office, under the Constitution
of India. Counsel contends therefore, that the said resolution has the force of law, and
alludes to the 1999 Conference Resolution, which states that it is a "restatement of pre-
existing and universally accepted norms, guidelines and conventions.." Reacting to the
petitioners' submission that the 1997 resolution or the 1999 Conference resolution
cannot be enforced legally, it is argued that the binding nature of either resolution

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                Page 15
 cannot be undermined, and that it is for the CJI or the individual High Court Chief
Justice, to take such appropriate measures as are warranted to ensure that declaration
of assets takes place.
</p>
<p id="p_49">19.    The respondent disputes that the information given by judges (of the Supreme
Court) to the CJI is retained by him in a fiduciary capacity, and say that "fiduciary"
relationship has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary as "one founded on trust or
confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another." Similarly, the
respondent places reliance on the following extracts from the definition in the
Permanent Edition of "Words and Phrases":
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       "Generally, the term 'fiduciary' applies to any person who occupies a position of
       peculiar confidence towards another. It refers to integrity and fidelity. It
       contemplates fair dealing and good faith, rather than legal obligation, as the
       basis of the transaction. The term includes those informal relations which exist
       whenever one party trusts and relies upon another....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       ... a 'fiduciary' or confidential relation in sense that a 'fiduciary' is required to
       render an account exists in all cases where there has been a special confidence
       reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith
       and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing the confidence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       ..The word fiduciary implies that the relationship exists only when there is a
       reposing of faith, confidence and trust and the placing of reliance by one upon the
       judgment and advice of another."
</blockquote><p id="p_50">20.    It is argued that a fiduciary relationship, therefore, is based on trust and good
faith, rather than legal obligation. Such relationship obligates the fiduciary to act for the
benefit and interests of him, who reposes the trust in him (i.e. the fiduciary), in regard
to the matter of trust. It is argued that judges, while declaring their assets, do so in their
capacity as judges, and not as private individuals; the Chief Justice does not act as a
fiduciary, while keeping the information given to him by them. But for the status as
judge, the individual concerned would not have furnished any declaration to the CJI.
According to the respondent, the process of information gathering, by the CJI is an

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                     Page 16
 official process, in his official capacity; hence, no fiduciary relationship is involved. The
CJI does not exercise any control over the judges, as they are holders of Constitutional
office, in their right.
</p>
<p id="p_51">21.    Dealing with the contention regarding exemption under <a href="/doc/223928/" id="a_58">Section 8(1)(j)</a>, the
respondent argues that asset information of electoral aspirants are not deemed private
or personal information, and blanket exemption cannot be granted; reliance is placed
on the Association for Democratic Reforms case. It is also contended that likewise judges
are public functionaries, and in their official capacity, make declarations, and immunity
cannot be granted to them. Counsel disputes the petitioners' submission that
independence of the judiciary would be undermined, if access to asset declaration is
permitted. It is emphasized that if information is given to the Government, possibly
independence of the judiciary would be compromised; however, public disclosure of the
declaration, under the Act will allow access to the public, which would thwart attempt
at blackmailing of individual judges, or "corrosion" of their independence.
</p>
<p id="p_52">22.    The Delhi High Court Bar Association, ("DHBA") added as a party, with consent of
the petitioners and the respondent, argues that the Supreme Court, and the High Court
are authorities under the Constitution of India and squarely covered by the definition
"public authority" similarly, it is argued that CJI and Chief Justices of High Courts are
public authorities. The DHBA adopts the respondent's arguments, and further submits
that the petitioners' stand that asset declarations and information about who gave
declarations not being "information" is untenable. It is submitted that right to
information is now a part of right to freedom of speech, and the Act merely confers
statutory recognition. The definition of "information" is sufficiently wide to cover all
kinds of records and information. It is submitted that the 1997 resolution was to
reinforce faith in the judiciary, and the present denial of information tends to

 undermine it. DHBA argues that the Act nowhere restricts information furnished to be
only in respect of duties of public servants or officials.
</p>
<p id="p_53">23.    Counsel for DHBA submits that the issue of judges' asset disclosure should not be
considered in isolation, but in the context of the 1999 Conference resolution; here too
reference is made to the "in-house" procedure or mechanism to deal with complaints
against judges. It is emphasized that the Code, adopted by the Conference in 1999, is to
be followed with a view to affirm people's faith in the judiciary. Contrasting the position
in the case of the lower judiciary, who are obligated by specific service rules, to declare
their assets, through annual returns, the DHBA submits that such specific rules may not
exist in the case of the higher judiciary, yet the duty to do so arises by virtue of the high
office their members occupy. Reliance is placed on the observations of the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/686645/" id="a_59">C.Ravichandran Iyer v. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee &amp; Others</a> 1995 (5) SCC 457:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "21. Judicial office is essentially a public trust. Society is, therefore, entitled to
       expect that a Judge must be a man of high integrity, honesty and required to have
       moral vigour, ethical firmness and impervious to corrupt or venial influences. He is
       required to keep most exacting standards of propriety in judicial conduct. Any
       conduct which tends to undermine public confidence in the integrity and
       impartiality of the court would be deleterious to the efficacy of judicial process.
       Society, therefore, expects higher standards of conduct and rectitude from a
       Judge. Unwritten code of conduct is writ large for judicial officers to emulate and
       imbibe high moral or ethical standards expected of a higher judicial functionary,
       as wholesome standard of conduct which would generate public confidence,
       accord dignity to the judicial office and enhance public image, not only of the
       Judge but the court itself. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that a Judge's
       official and personal conduct be free from impropriety; the same must be in tune
       with the highest standard of propriety and probity. The standard of conduct is
       higher than that expected of a layman and also higher than that expected of an
       advocate. In fact, even his private life must adhere to high standards of probity
       and propriety, higher than those deemed acceptable for others. Therefore, the
       Judge can ill-afford to seek shelter from the fallen standard in the society...."

AIR 1982 SC 149 are relied on to say that while an independent judiciary is a must to
cure legislative and executive excesses or transgressions of law or the Constitution,
judges should not claim special privileges and immunities, while they impose duties of
transparency upon other public officials and legislative candidates. It was submitted that
the Constitution has designed elaborate safeguards to secure the tenure, salary and
conditions of service of judges, with the aim of insulating them from outside influences,
as they are expected to act fairly and fearlessly. This imposes a duty upon them to
maintain high standards and ensure public faith. The DHBA relies on observations in the
judgment reported as Supreme Court Advocate on <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_63">Record Association v. Union of India</a>
(1993) 4 SCC 441 and says that absence of statute law does not mean that declaration of
assets by judges to the CJI is without legal sanction; judges function under the
Constitution, and owe their existence to it. If, in the course of their tenure, decisions to
declare their personal assets are taken, with a view to establishing conventions, for
future adherence, such practices have the sanctity of law, as conventions of the
Constitution.

<p id="p_55">25.    Mr. P.N. Lekhi, appeared for the intervenor, with the permission of the court. He
challenged the petitioners' locus standi and submitted that they are fighting a "proxy"
battle for Supreme Court judges. He submitted that judicial review can be availed of
only if there is a lis, and the court should refrain from examining the various issues that
are sought to be canvassed in these proceedings. It is argued that what the petitioners
are seeking to achieve would strike at the foundation of democracy, under the Indian
Constitution, and place judges of the higher judiciary above other sections of the people
of India, which conflicts with its "basic structure". He therefore urged that the writ
petition should be dismissed.

omission or commission do not follow the universally accepted values of judicial life
including those indicated in the "Restatement of Values of Judicial Life."

<p id="p_61">       RESOLVED FURTHER THAT every Judge should make a declaration of all his/her
assets in the form of real estate or investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or
in the name of his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her) within a reasonable
time of assuming office and in the case of sitting Judges within a reasonable time of
adoption of this Resolution and thereafter whenever any acquisition of a substantial
nature is made, it shall be disclosed within a reasonable time. The declaration so made
should be to the Chief Justice of the Court. The Chief Justice should make a similar

CHIEF JUSTICES' CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER 1999

       The Conference of Chief Justices of all High Courts was held on 3 rd and 4th
December, 1999 in the Supreme Court premises. During the said Conference, the Chief
Justices unanimously resolved to adopt the "Restatement of Values of Judicial Life" (Code

7, 1997, to finalize the 'Restatement of Values of Judicial Life' after taking note of the
draft Restatement of Values of Judicial Life prepared by a Committee appointed

to be observed by Judges, essential for an independent, strong and respected judiciary,
indispensable in the impartial administration of justice, as redrafted, has been

has been ADOPTED for due observance.
</p><p id="p_70">RESTATEMENT OF VALUES OF JUDICIAL LIFE:
</p><p id="p_71">(1)     Justice must not merely be done but it must also be seen to be done. The
behaviour and conduct of members of the higher judiciary must reaffirm the people's
faith in the impartiality of the judiciary. Accordingly, any act of a Judge of the Supreme
Court or a High Court, whether in official or personal capacity, which erodes the
credibility of this perception has to be avoided.
</p><p id="p_72">(2)    A Judge should not contest the election to any office of a Club, society or other
association; further he shall not hold such elective office except in a society or
association connected with the law.
</p><p id="p_73">(3)    Close association with individual members of the Bar, particularly those who
practice in the same court, shall be eschewed.
</p><p id="p_74">(4)    A Judge should not permit any member of his immediate family, such as spouse,
son, daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law or any other close relative, if a member of
the Bar, to appear before him or even be associated in any manner with a cause to be
dealt with by him.

 (5)    No member of his family, who is a member of the Bar, shall be permitted to use
</pre><p id="p_75">the residence in which the Judge actually resides or other facilities for professional work.
</p>
<p id="p_76">(6)     A Judge should practice a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his
office.
</p><p id="p_77">(7)    A Judge shall not hear and decide a matter in which a member of his family, a
close relation or a friend is concerned.
</p><p id="p_78">(8)   A Judge shall not enter into public debate or express his views in public on political
matters or on matters that are pending or are likely to arise for judicial determination.
(9)    A Judge is expected to let his judgments speak for themselves; he shall not give
interview to the media.
</p><p id="p_79">(10) A Judge shall not accept gifts or hospitality except from his family, close relations
and friends.
</p><p id="p_80">(11) A Judge shall not hear and decide a matter in which a company in which he holds
shares is concerned unless he has disclosed his interest and no objection to his hearing
and deciding the matter is raised.

<p id="p_82">(13) A Judge should not engage directly or indirectly in trade or business, either by
himself or in association with any other person. (Publication of a legal treatise or any
activity in the nature of a hobby shall not be construed as trade or business).
(14) A Judge should not ask for, accept contributions or otherwise actively associate
himself with the raising of any fund for any purpose.
</p><p id="p_83">(15) A Judge should not seek any financial benefit in the form of a perquisite or
privilege attached to his office unless it is clearly available. Any doubt in this behalf must
be got resolved and clarified though the Chief Justice.

there should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he
occupies and the public esteem in which that office is held.

</p>
<p id="p_117">(3)    Whether asset declarations by Supreme Court judges, pursuant to the 1997
Resolution is "information", under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_70">Information Act</a>, 2005;

 (4)    If such asset declarations are "information" does the CJI hold them in a

<p id="p_119">(5)    Whether such information is exempt from disclosure by reason of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_71">Section 8(1)</a> (j)
of the Act;
</p>
<p id="p_120">(6)    Whether the lack of clarity about the details of asset declaration and about their
details, as well as lack of security renders asset declarations and their disclosure,
unworkable.
</p>
<p id="p_121">Point Nos. 1 and 2:
</p>
<p id="p_122">28.    Both these points are taken up for consideration, together, for convenience, as
they involve analysis of related issues. Before a decision on the point, a few words about
the Act are necessary. Under the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_72">Information Act</a>, "record",
"information", are held by defined "public authorities". By virtue of <a href="/doc/1869099/" id="a_73">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_74">5</a>, <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_75">6</a> and
<a href="/doc/562193/" id="a_76">7</a>, every public authority requested to provide information is under a positive obligation
to do so; the information seeker is under no obligation to disclose why he requests it.
Public authorities, as noticed above are defined by <a href="/doc/22242358/" id="a_77">Section 2(h)</a> as-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       "means any authority or body or institution of self - government established or
       constituted-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">              (a) by or under the Constitution of India."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22"><a href="/doc/492974/" id="a_78">Section 4</a> obliges public authorities to publish various specified classes of information.
</blockquote><p id="p_123">The information provider or the concerned agency is, under the Act, obliged to decide
the applications, of information seekers, within prescribed time limits. A hierarchy of
authorities is created with the CIC, at the apex to decide disputes pertaining to
information disclosure. In this Scheme, the Parliament has in its wisdom, visualized
certain exemptions. <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_79">Section 6</a> enjoins that information disclosure is the norm; in case
the public authority who is approached, does not possess the information sought, the

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 26
 Public Information Officer (PIO) has to forward the application, under <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_80">Section 6(3)</a> to the
authority who actually holds the information; in that situation, the latter authority is
accountable for disclosure of the information. <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_81">Section 8</a> lists exemptions; it opens with a
non-obstante clause, signifying the intention that irrespective of the rights of the
information seeker, in regard to matters listed under that provision, the information
providers can justifiably withhold access to the information seeker the record,
information or queries sought for by him (i.e. the information seeker or applicant).
</p>
<p id="p_124">29.   <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_82">The Act</a> arguably is one of the most important pieces of legislation, in the post
independence era, to effectuate democracy. It may be likened to a powerful beacon,
which illuminates unlit corners of state activity, and those of public authorities which
impact citizens' daily lives, to which they previously had no access. It mandates
disclosure of all manner of information, and abolishes the concept of locus standi, of the
information applicant; no justification for applying (for information) is necessary;
indeed, <a href="/doc/419386/" id="a_83">Section 6(2)</a> enjoins that reasons for seeking such information cannot be
sought- (to a certain extent, this bar is relieved, by <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_84">Section 8</a>). Decisions and decision
making processes, which affect lives of individuals and collectives can now been
subjected to gaze; if improper motives, or reasons contrary to law or avowed policies
are discernable, those actions can be questioned. Parliamentary intention in enacting
this law was to arm citizens with the mechanism to scrutinize government and public
processes, and ensure transparency. At the same time, however, the needs of society at
large, and governments as well as individuals in particular, to ensure that sensitive
information is kept out of bounds, have also been accommodated, under the Act. This
has been addressed at two levels: one, by taking a number of security and intelligence
related organizations out of purview of the Act, and two, by enacting specified
exemptions - from disclosure, on grounds of public interest.
</p>



<p id="p_125">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 27
</p><p id="p_126"> 30.    As noted previously, "public authority" has been widely defined; it includes an
authority created by or under the Constitution of India. The CIC concluded that the CJI is
a public authority, on a facial reading of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_85">Article 124.</a> The provision is under the heading
"Establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court," and in the relevant part, it says
that "There shall be a Supreme Court of India consisting of a Chief Justice of India and..."
<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_86">The Act</a>, notes the CIC, also provides for competent authorities defined by <a href="/doc/190028862/" id="a_87">Section 2(e)</a>.
The CJI is one such specified competent authority, in relation to the Supreme Court,
under <a href="/doc/190028862/" id="a_88">Section 2(e)</a> (ii) of the Act and <a href="/doc/612223/" id="a_89">Section 28</a> empowers him to frame Rules to carry
out purposes of the Act. In view of these provisions, the court is of opinion that the CIC
did not commit any error in concluding that the CJI is a public authority.
</p>
<p id="p_127">31.    The second point, which flows out of the first, requires further examination. It is
contended that the office of the CJI is different from that of the Registry (of the
Supreme Court); the further contention here appears to be that the CJI performs a
verisimilitude of functions, than merely as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and in
such capacity, through his office, separately holds asset declarations, and information
relating to it, pursuant to the 1997 resolution.
</p>
<p id="p_128">32.    That the Constitution recognizes the CJI's prominent role in higher judicial
appointments is stating the obvious. He is, unlike the United States (where the Chief
Justice is the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court) the Chief Justice of India. This
prominent role as "head of the judiciary" or the judicial family, if one may use a well
worn term, was underlined by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_90">K.
Veeraswami v. Union of India</a> 1991 (3) SCC 655, where the court, by the majority and
concurring judgments held that members of the higher judiciary (High Courts and the
Supreme Court) are covered by the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_91">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, and can be
prosecuted, provided the CJI is consulted beforehand, and consents to that course. Mr.
Justice J.S. Verma (who later held the office of Chief Justice of India with distinction)

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 28
 dissented; he held that the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_92">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, according to its scheme, as
existing, does not apply to constitutional functionaries, such as Judges of the High
Courts, Judges of the Supreme Court, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief
Election Commissioner. Though not a "vertical" superior (to borrow a phrase from the
dissenting opinion in Veeraswami) nevertheless the CJI discharges various other
functions. The question is whether those are exempted from the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_129">33.    It would be necessary to recollect here that initially, in this case, the Appellate
authority had remitted the matter for consideration of the respondent's query- which
was in two parts, one, being information about whether declarations were made by
Supreme Court judges, and two, being about declarations made by High Court judges to
the respective Chief Justices. The appellate authority held, inter alia, that:

India performs a multitude of tasks, specifically assigned to him under the Constitution
and various enactments; he is involved in the process of appointment of judges of High
Courts, Chief Justices of High Courts, appointment of Judges of Supreme Court, transfer
of High Court judges and so on. Besides, he discharges administrative functions under
various enactments or rules, concerning appointment of members of quasi judicial


W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 29
 tribunals; this may be by him, or nominees (other Supreme Court judges) appointed by
him. He is also involved in the administration of legal aid, and heads policy formulation
bodies, under law, in that regard, at the national level; he heads the judicial education
programme initiative, at the national level. It is quite possible therefore, that the Chief
Justice, for convenience maintains a separate office or establishment. However, the
petitioners did not urge about these aspects, or bring any other facts to this court's
notice.
</p>
<p id="p_132">35.    What this court cannot ignore, regardless of the varied roles of the CJI, is that
they are directly relatable to his holding the office of CJI, and heading the Supreme
Court. His role as Chief Justice of India, is by reason of appointment to the high office of
the head of the Supreme Court. The first petitioner did not assign the application to
either the CJI or any other office or authority; it is not also urged that such office has a
separate establishment, with its own Public Information Office, under the Act. There is
no provision, other than <a href="/doc/1040076/" id="a_98">Section 24</a>, exemption organizations. That provision exempts,
through the Second Schedule (to the Act), the Intelligence Bureau, Research and
Analysis Wing of the Cabinet Secretariat; Directorate of Revenue Intelligence; Central
Economic Intelligence Bureau, Directorate of Enforcement, Narcotic Control Bureau,
Aviation   Research    Centre,   various    para-military   forces,   and   named     police
establishments. <a href="/doc/1040076/" id="a_99">Section 24(2)</a> empowers the Central Government, by notification to
vary the Second Schedule, and add other organizations. There is no clue in these
provisions, that the office of the Chief Justice of India, is exempt; on the contrary,
internal indications in the enactment point to even the President of India, being covered
by the Act (<a href="/doc/22242358/" id="a_100">Section 2(h)</a> and <a href="/doc/190028862/" id="a_101">Section 2(e)</a> (iv)). To conclude that the CJI does not hold
asset declaration information in his capacity as Chief Justice of India, would also be
incongruous, since the 1997 resolution explicitly states that the information would be
given to him.    In these circumstances the court concludes that the CJI holds the
information pertaining to asset declarations in his capacity as Chief Justice; that office is
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 30
 a "public authority" under the Act and is covered by its provisions. The second point
stands decided, accordingly.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Point No. 3</span>

<p id="p_133">36.    The definition of "information" under Section (f) is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       ""information" means any material in any form, including records, documents,
       memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks,
       contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic
       form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a
       public authority under any other law for the time being in force.."
</blockquote><p id="p_134">As evident, the definition is extremely wide; the crucial words are "any material in any
form". The other terms amplify these words, explaining the kind of forms that
information could be held by an authority. It also includes "information relating to any
private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the
time being in force". Facially, the definition comprehends all matters which fall within
the expression "material in any form". There is no justification in cutting down their
amplitude by importing notions of those materials which are mandatorily held by it. The
emphasis is on the information available, having regard to the objectives of the Act; not
the manner in which information is obtained or secured by the authority. Thus, inter se
correspondence of public authorities may lead to exchange of information or file
sharing; in the course of such consultative process, if the authority borrowing the
information is possessed of it, even temporarily, it has to account for it, as it is
"material" held. As far as the later part of the definition, i.e. accessing of information by
or under any law, is concerned, it appears that this refers to what is with a private
organization, but can be accessed by the public authority, under law. The court deduces
this, because the theme is included by the conjunctive "and"; but for such inclusion,
such private information would not have been subjected to the regime of the Act.
Therefore, it is held that all "material in any form" includes all manner of information;

 the absence of specific exclusion leads this court to conclude that asset declarations by
judges, held by the CJI are "information", under <a href="/doc/138145044/" id="a_102">Section 2(f)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_136">37.    The court would now proceed to discuss the decisions cited by the petitioners. In
Dwarkanath Tewari, the question was take-over of management of a school, under
provisions of an Education Code. The Supreme Court held that the action was unlawful,
as the Education Code did not have the force of law:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">       "the Code has no greater sanction than an administrative order or rule, and is not
       based on any statutory authority or other authority which could give it the force
       of law. Naturally, therefore, the learned Solicitor General, with his usual fairness,
       conceded that the article relied upon by the respondents as having the force of
       law, has no such force, and could not, therefore, deprive the petitioners of their
       rights in the properties aforesaid."
</blockquote><p id="p_137">In Kruze v. Johnson (supra) the court considered the validity of a bye-law, framed by a
county council, saying that it was one having the force of law as one affecting the public
or some section of the public, imposed by some authority clothed with statutory
powers, ordering something to be done or not to be done and accompanied by some
sanction or penalty for its non-observance. If validly made such a bye-law has the force
of law within the sphere of its legitimate operation. The function of such bye-laws is to
supplement the general law by which the legislature delegates its own power to make
them. This holding was followed by our Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/225779/" id="a_103">Indian Airlines Corpn. v.
Sukhdeo Rai</a>, (1971) 2 SCC 192.
</p>
<p id="p_138">38.    The above decisions were rendered at a time, when administrative law in this
country was in a nascent stage of development. Early decisions of the Supreme Court
had ruled that in absence of a duty under a statute or law, a writ of mandamus would
not lie. This perception slowly changed, after the decision in <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_104">A.K. Kraipak v. Union of
India</a> 1969 (2) SCC 262, where it was held that the line between quasi-judicial orders and
administrative orders had thinned. The court said that arriving at a just decision was the

 aim of both quasi-judicial enquiries as well as administrative enquiries and that an
unjust decision in an administrative enquiry may have more far reaching effect than a
decision in a quasi-judicial enquiry. Similarly, enforceability of non-statutory norms
through writ proceedings was underlined, in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_105">Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee
Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust v. V.R. Rudani</a>, (1989) 2 SCC 691:

<blockquote id="blockquote_26">       "..They may cover any other person or body performing public duty. The form of
       the body concerned is not very much relevant. What is relevant is the nature of
       the duty imposed on the body. The duty must be judged in the light of positive
       obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party. No matter by
       what means the duty is imposed, if a positive obligation exists, mandamus cannot
       be denied."
</blockquote><p id="p_139">It may be worthwhile mentioning, that far back, in <a href="/doc/1476635/" id="a_106">B.N. Nagarajan v. State of
Mysore</a>,(1966) 3 SCR 682, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court rejected a
submission that absence of rules framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_107">Article 309</a>, or a legislation, constrained
the executive from prescribing terms and conditions of service of its employees. The
court observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">       "We see nothing in the terms of <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_108">Article 309</a> of the Constitution which abridges the
       power of the executive to act under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_109">Article 162</a> of the Constitution without a law.
       It is hardly necessary to mention that if there is a statutory rule or an act on the
       matter, the executive must abide by that act or rule and it cannot in exercise of
       the executive power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_110">Article 162</a> of the Constitution ignore or act contrary to
       that rule or act."
</blockquote><p id="p_140">For these reasons, and in the light of the previous conclusion regarding whether
declarations had to be mandated by norms having the force of law, the court is of the
view that the cases cited on behalf of the petitioners are not apt, for a decision in these
proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_141">39.    The next limb of the question is the important ground for the petitioners'
questioning the impugned order was that the 1997 Resolution is non-binding and
entirely volitional, vis-à-vis judges of the Supreme Court. The petitioners argued that

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 33
 though the Resolution commended declaration of assets to the CJI, it did not have any
legal sanctity, and was not based on any legal obligation. Thus, if an individual judge
were not to furnish a declaration, as was expected by the Resolution, the omission could
not be addressed. It was emphasized that dependence on an individual's volition,
afforded an extremely tenuous foundation, (equal to none) to say that there existed a
legal obligation. At best the Resolution encapsulated a hope, and recorded an
unenforceable moral declaration by those making it. The further argument was that the
CJI had no power under the Constitution, or any law, to compel the individual Justice
omitting to declare his assets, or take remedial measures, was underlined as a strong
indicator that the obligation, if so termed, was moral, and not legal. Reliance was placed
upon for the submission that duties to be termed as such are to be founded on some
legal provision. The context of this argument was that any matter or material held
without mandate of law, or not mandated by law, is not "information".
</p>
<p id="p_142">40.   The respondent and the interveners countered the petitioners' submission by
saying that the Resolutions were meant to be complied with, and not otherwise.
Commenting on the lack of any mechanism for it's (the Resolution's) enforcement, it
was argued that the method of dealing with it would be for the CJI to consider. The
interveners argued that the Chief Justices' Conferences, held annually, are not
sanctioned by law- in the sense understood; each High Court is autonomous, under the
Constitution, and yet no one questions this annual practice, for which considerable
public expenditure is incurred. These, say the interveners, establish that the foundations
of the obligation (to declare personal assets) are not confined to the provisions of the
Constitution, or any law, but on conventions and practices which develop around them,
and crystallize into binding norms. For support, reliance was placed upon the judgment
of the Supreme Court, in the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association case.
</p>



<p id="p_143">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 34
</p><p id="p_144"> 41.    The merits of the argument - about whether the Resolution's provisions for
declaration (of assets, by judges) involve, to a great extent, an examination of Judges'
role in society, and under the Constitution. India adopted her Constitution 62 years ago
with the avowed objective of ushering a Democratic state. The scheme of power-sharing
envisions both horizontal distribution (between the three branches, i.e. legislature,
executive and judicial) and vertical -Centre, State, Local bodies and Panchayats.
Autonomy is granted to certain specifically created bodies (Election Commission,
Comptroller and Auditor Genral, Union Public Service Commission), which are mandated
to be independent in their functioning, to effectuate democratic guarantees, and
fairness in official functioning. The Courts play a pivotal role in this scheme; they arbiter
disputes that arise between these wings, - between states, between individuals or
citizens and states or their agencies, between disputing citizens and so on. The duty of
interpreting the Constitution is that of the courts (the Supreme Court and the High
Courts). Judicial review - through Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution forms a critical
component of this unique structure; it is deemed almost inviolate; and non-derogable
(<a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_111">L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India</a> 1997 (3) SCC 261; Minerva Mills v. Minerva Mills v.

</p>
<p id="p_146">42.    The underlying premise of every modern Constitution is that power, wherever
given, is held and exercised in trust. Thus provisions are made to account for the use of
such power; these are often alluded to as a system of checks and balances, whereby the
tendency of one wing of the state overstepping its bounds, is curtailed. To the legislator
or Parliamentarian, is added on additional check of public opinion, and the attendant
voter rejection, (for perceived misdeeds, inaction or abuse of power) in an election. A
minister's tenure is guaranteed as long as he has the confidence of the Chief Minister or
Prime Minister, or as long as the Council of Ministers has the confidence of the
legislature. A Civil Servant, however, enjoys greater assurance of tenure, and can be
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 35
 removed or dismissed on previously prescribed grounds, after following fair procedures,
mandated by rules of legal provisions. In this context, the judicial role is unique, and the
measure of confidence placed on judges is reflected in the protection afforded to their
tenure, as well as the extent their functioning is insulated from other branches (of
government) and all sources of potential influence. The protection given, in India, is of a
very high order, to members of the higher judiciary. They cannot be removed from
office, except for proved misbehavior; the removal can be only by two-thirds majority of
each House of Parliament followed by an address to the President; this is to be
preceded by findings of a three-member inquiry; the composition of this tribunal lends
objectivity to the process, of a very high order. One may well ask why such a high
degree of protection is granted. If the answer were to be summed up in one word, it is
independence. Independence is multidimensional - it is hierarchal (i.e. freedom to
decide according to law, -which includes binding precedent- unconstrained by dictates
of judicial hierarchy); it is the independence to decide irrespective of parties'
expectations; to decide unconstrained by the individual judge's expectations of public
approbation or condemnation, about the result; to decide on the basis of objectively
known and discernable, binding, legal principles, rather than caprice or humour. The
inalienable value of independence of the judiciary - achieved through entrenched
provisions in the Constitution of India - has been repeatedly emphasized in several
decisions, during the last 59 years (<a href="/doc/1720564/" id="a_112">J. P. Mitter v. Chief Justice, Calcutta</a> AIR 1965 SC 961;

<p id="p_148">43.    A judge's independence, paradoxically imposes duties on him (or her): duty to
decide according to law and binding precedent, rather than individual choice of the
judge's notion of justice of the case; the duty to not only do justice, but follow a fair
procedure which accords with notions of justice: "appear to be doing justice", which in
turn would mean that the judge is not completely "free" to follow a personal agenda,
but has to decide the merits of the case, according to facts presented by parties. This
aspect is summed up by Dr. Frances Kahn Zemans, in her article "The Accountable Judge:
Guardian of Judicial Independence," 72 S. CAL. L. REV. 625, 646-47 (1999) as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">       "The impression that the judge relies on fairness as the standard against which to
       measure decisions can have dangerous implications that the judge is free to
       follow her conscience despite the law. Sometimes the law itself is unfair or
       unwise, but lacking a constitutional infirmity the judge is bound by it. And unless
       there is a legal basis, the judge cannot right every wrong. In addition, judges do
       not set their own agendas. Thus, they are dependent on others to bring claims
       before them. While these are quite obvious to judges and lawyers, they may not
       be so obvious to those who need to be convinced that judicial independence is to
       be valued and protected..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_149">44.    The second duty - another dimension of independence- is that judges do not
decide cases by dictates of popularly held notions of right and wrong. Indeed a crucial
part of the judge's mandate is to uphold those fundamental values upon which society
organizes itself; here, if the judge were to follow transient "popular" notions of justice,
the guarantees of individual freedoms, entrenched in the Constitution, would be
rendered meaningless. Again, Justice Micheal Kirby, an outstanding contemporary jurist,
underlined this value of independence in the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">       "In a pluralist society judges are the essential equalisers. They serve no majority
       or any minority either. Their duty is to the law and to justice. They do not bend the
       knee to the governments, to particular religions, to the military, to money, to

        tabloid media or the screaming mob. In upholding law and justice, judges have a
       vital function in a pluralist society to make sure that diversity is respected and the
       rights of all protected."
</blockquote><p id="p_150">Dr. Aharon Barack, former Chief Justice of Israel, in his acclaimed work "Judges in a
Democracy" underlines that transient "popular" notions of justice can never be the basis
of a proper verdict. He summarizes this paradox as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">       "...An essential condition for realizing the judicial role is public confidence in the
       judge. This means confidence in judicial independence, fairness and impartiality.
       It means public confidence in the ethical standards of the judge. It means public
       confidence that judges are not interested parties to the legal struggle and that
       they are not fighting for their own power but to protect the constitution and
       democracy. It means that public confidence that the judge does not express his
       own personal views but rather the fundamental beliefs of the nation...This fact
       means that the public recognizes the legitimacy of judicial decisions, even if it
       disagrees with their content.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">              The precondition of 'public confidence' runs the risk of being
       misunderstood. The need to ensure public confidence does not mean the need to
       ensure popularity. Public confidence does not mean following popular trends or
       public opinion polls. Public confidence does not mean accountability to the public
       in the way the executive and the legislature are accountable. Public confidence
       does not mean pleasing the public; public confidence does not mean ruling
       contrary to the law or contrary to the judge's conscience to bring about a result
       that the public desires. On the contrary, public confidence means ruling according
       to the law and according to the judge's conscience, whatever the attitude of the
       public may be..."
</blockquote><p id="p_151">45.    Having set this backdrop, it is necessary to examine the rival contentions. That
the Resolution, so far as it mandates judges' asset disclosure to the CJI is not grounded
on any law, or founded on a Constitutional provision, or that there are no provisions
similar to the Ethics in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_117">Government Act</a>, 1978 as in the United States, explicitly obliging
judges and other public servants to disclose personal assets, cannot be doubted. Yet,
the debate cannot end on that note itself. Judges, in a modern society - more so in
India, in the legitimate exercise of their jurisdiction, handle complex social, political and
economic issues. Very frequently, this means that significant policy gaps in legislation, or

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 38
 executive determinations are to be commented, or ruled upon. Such filling in of the
"gaps" is recognized as falling within the legitimate domain of the courts. Rights and
liberties of individuals and collectives, as well as duties and limitations placed upon
governments, or their myriad agencies, are routinely examined and adjudicated upon,
by courts. In the exercise of such jurisdiction, courts generally and judges in particular
act as neutral and impartial arbiters; while discharging such powers, they are custodians
of the law. The power is undeniably vast and the impact of judgments, depending on
what is in issue, wide and sweeping. If the courts and judges are placed in the context of
a modern democracy, it is imperative that the value of independence and freedom from
bias and other unwanted tendencies ought to be- in principle- accounted for. The
system of checks and balances, which ensures, at two levels - internally (through
appeals, reviews and overruling of precedents by larger bench decisions), and
externally, through overbearing legislation of a verdict, deemed unworkable or not in
accord with the law which is interpreted, guarantees institutional accountability.
</p>
<p id="p_152">46.    If one considers that Legislators, Parliamentarians and Administrators are held to
standards of disclosure (of personal assets) whether by express rules (as in the case of
the civil services) or so mandated, by virtue of the elective office legislators aspire to (by
reason of the law declared by the Supreme Court, in the Association for Democratic
Reforms case) the petitioners' argument seems strained. Judges - of the Supreme Court
and the High Courts, swear to uphold the Constitution and the laws. The oath poignantly
reminds the judge who dons the robes would decide "without fear or favour" - an
obvious reference to the independent role. It would be highly anomalous to say that in
exercise of the legitimate jurisdiction to impact peoples' lives, property, liberties and
individual freedoms, as well as interpret duties and limitations placed upon state and
non-state agencies, barring the institutional accountability standards existing in the
Constitution, judges have no obligation to disclose their personal assets, to someone or
authority.

Constitution. Holders of power too are expected to live by the standards they set,
interpret, or enforce, at least to the extent their office demands. Conventions and
practices, long followed, are known to be legitimate sources, and as binding upon those
concerned, as the express provisions themselves. This was emphasized, by a nine-judge

<p id="p_155">48.    The 1997 Resolution (and the 1999 Judicial Conference resolution) were
intended, in this Court's opinion to reflect the best practices to be followed, and form
the standards of ethical behaviour of judges of the higher judiciary. As observed earlier,
independence and impartiality of judges are "core" judicial values. There are others,
equally, if not more important. Those values - or canons, as the 1999 Judicial
Conference Resolution puts it - flesh out what all judges should conform to, such as
avoidance of certain types of conduct, rectitude in public and private life, avoidance of
any relationship that could potentially conflict with judicial functions, avoidance of
spouses' and children practicing in the Court of the judge concerned, prohibition of
certain kinds of investment, avoiding airing views by the judge in the press or
newspaper (in sensitive or controversial matters, or those likely to be considered by the
Court) and so on. That these canons are an inalienable part of what a judge is and how
he or she is expected to behave, is not doubted. The declaration of assets by such
judges to their respective Chief Justices was a part of that codification process; the 1999
Judicial Conference Resolution sees the 1997 Resolution (of the Supreme Court) as such.
It might arguably be stated that no such norm existed, before the 1997 Resolution,
requiring declaration of assets by judges. That might be so; yet such ethical norms are
neither static nor are in a vacuum. They are in one sense universal (as in the case of the
need to be unbiased, impartial, independent and maintain probity and rectitude); at the
same time, they are contextual to the times - particularly when they pertain to the
kinds of behaviour, relationships and investments that could be deemed acceptable - or
not acceptable- having regard to a judge's role and challenges faced by Court during

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 41
 particular times. Seen from this dynamic, norms of judicial ethics are placed in a
continuum, evolving with contemporary challenges. Therefore, the introduction of the
stipulation of declaring personal assets, is to be seen as an essential ingredient of
contemporary acceptable behaviour and establishing a convention.
</p>
<p id="p_156">49.    This court is of the opinion that the volitional nature of the resolutions, should be
seen as the higher judiciary's commitment to essential ethical behaviour, and its resolve
to abide by it. Therefore, that such need to declare assets is not mandated by
Parliamentary law, or any statutory instrument, becomes of secondary importance. The
mere fact that Supreme Court judges (through the 1997 Resolution) and members of
the higher judiciary (through the Judicial Conference Resolution) recognize these as
normative, and governing their conduct, is sufficient to bind them. They formed a set of
conventions of the Constitution. To conclude otherwise would endanger credibility of
the institution, which prides - by its adherence to the doctrines of precedent, and stare
decisis (in the discharge of its constitutional obligation in judging) - in consistency, and
by meaning what it says, and saying what it means. This aspect is summed up aptly by
an Australian Judge in the following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">       "Some standards can be prescribed by law, but the spirit of, and the quality of the
       service rendered by; a profession depends far more on its observance of ethical
       standards. These are far more rigorous than legal standards.... They are learnt
       not by precept but by the example and influence of respected peers. Judicial
       standards are acquired, so to speak, by professional osmosis. They are enforced
       immediately by conscience."

that such executive determinations are binding on the authority making it ("executive
authority must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes"- Ramana
Dayaram; supra). While there cannot be any dispute that the 1997 Resolution was made
by a body- Full Court of the Supreme Court, and the 1999 Resolution, through a Chief
Justices' conference - which is not accorded constitutional status, and granted that High
Courts are not "subordinate" to the Supreme Court in the sense that the latter has no
powers of superintendence, yet, those bodies (the conference) are undeniably collegial,
consisting of the highest judicial authorities of each High Court, and the Supreme Court.
The decisions taken, and resolutions adopted during their deliberations are aimed at
arriving at common solutions to grapple problems that beset the legal system of the
country as a whole. The resolutions and decisions are taken seriously, and with the
intention of implementation. To put it otherwise, the resolutions were made (and
similar resolutions, are made) to be followed and adhered to. In these circumstances, it
would be robbing the solemnity of the Resolutions adopted in 1997 to say that they
were made with the expectation of not being implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_159">51.   This court, is also mindful that the law declared in Supreme Court, based on the
existence of conventions of the Constitution, in the Supreme Court Advocates on Record
Association case, ushered a new chapter in the annals of our Constitutional history,
whereby the function of recommending appointments to the higher judiciary was left
almost exclusively to the senior most echelons of the High Court and Supreme Court (for
High Courts') and for the Supreme Court, exclusively to a defined collegial body of its
five senior most judges. One (perhaps) implied and inarticulate premise of the judgment
was the emergence of professionally better equipped judges, with the required degree
of independence, insulated from potential conflicts and capable of handling complex

 legal issues for the years to come. The 1997 Resolution, and the Judicial Conference
Resolution of 1999 have to be placed in perspective, and this historical contest, where
the higher judiciary - in the wake of the 1993 judgment, committed itself, for the first
time, to a declared set of codified standards. In view of the above discussion, the court
finds that the 1997 Resolution binds all those covered by it.
</p>
<p id="p_160">52.    The last submission of the petitioners' counsel, on this point, was while
emphasizing that the 1997 Resolution was at best a moral declaration, that it could not,
in the event of its non-compliance be enforced. No doubt, the CJI is not a "vertical"
superior (to borrow the phrase from the dissenting opinion in K. Veeraswami). In that
sense, there is vacuum, in regard to a prescribed mechanism for ensuring compliance,
by all those who make, and are governed, by the Resolution. Yet, as underlined in the
preceding part of this judgment, this aspect of the matter cannot be viewed from the
traditional duty-breach-enforcement perspective. The Resolution of 1997 is meant to be
adhered to; the question of its non-adherence should not be debated. Members of the
higher judiciary in this country occupy high Constitutional office; the Constitution
designedly devised only one procedure for removal, and conferred immense confidence
on these functionaries. The assumption was, and continues to be that holders of these
offices are women and men of impeccable credentials, and maintain the highest
standards of probity in their professional and personal lives. They are deemed to be
aware of the demands of their office, and the role of judges. Therefore, if they
consciously decide to create a self-regulatory norms, their adherence is guaranteed.
That there is no objective mechanism to ensure its implementation is in the
circumstances, of little or no moment, because the consequence of not complying -
with the Resolution, is linked to the faith in the system: the thought alone is sufficient to
incentivize compliance. Moreover, the question of enforceability should be seen in the
context of a given situation. Peer pressure, the administrative options available with the


W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 44
 CJI and the Chief Justices of High Courts, would be weighed carefully, with the aim of
seeing that asset declarations are made.
</p>
<p id="p_161">53.    In view of the above discussion, it is held that the second part of the
respondent's application, relating to declaration of assets by the Supreme Court judges,
is "information" within the meaning of the expression, under <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_123">Section 2</a> (f) of the Act.
The point is answered accordingly; the information pertaining to declarations given, to
the CJI and the contents of such declaration are "information" and subject to the
provisions of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_124">Information Act</a>.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Point No. 4</span>

<p id="p_162">54.    The petitioners argue that assuming that asset declarations, in terms of the 1997
constitute "information" under the Act, yet they cannot be disclosed - or even
particulars about whether, and who made such declarations, cannot be disclosed - as it
would entail breach of a fiduciary duty by the CJI. The petitioners rely on <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_125">Section 8</a> (1) (f)
to submit that a public authority is under no obligation to furnish "information available
to a person in his fiduciary relationship". The petitioners emphasize that the 1997
Resolution crucially states that:
</p>
<p id="p_163">       "The declaration made by the Judges or the Chief Justice, as the case may be,
       shall be confidential."
</p><p id="p_164">The respondent, and interveners, counter the submission and say that CJI does not
stand in the position of a fiduciary to the judges of the Supreme Court, who occupy high
Constitutional office; they enjoy the same judicial powers, and immunities and that the
CJI cannot exercise any kind of control over them. In these circumstances, there is no
"fiduciary" relationship, least of all in relation to making the asset declarations available
to the CJI, who holds it because of his status as CJI. It is argued that a fiduciary
relationship is created, where one person depends, on, or entrusts his affairs to

 someone, who has superior knowledge, or enjoys an advantage, which would be
beneficial to the person entrusting the subject matter of trust.
</p>
<p id="p_165">55.    It is necessary to first discern what a fiduciary relationship is, since the term has
not been defined in the Act. In Bristol &amp; West Building Society v. Mothew [1998] Ch 1,
the term "fiduciary", was described as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">       "A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in
       a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and

       has traditionally be recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a lawyer and
      a client, or a stockbroker and a customer"
</p>
<p id="p_172">58.   From the above discussion, it may be seen that a fiduciary relationship is one
whereby a person places complete confidence in another in regard to a particular
transaction or his general affairs or business. The relationship need not be "formally" or
"legally" ordained, or established, like in the case of a written trust; but can be one of
moral or personal responsibility, due to the better or superior knowledge or training, or
superior status of the fiduciary as compared to the one whose affairs he handles. If
viewed from this perspective, it is immediately apparent that the CJI cannot be a
fiduciary vis-à-vis Judges of the Supreme Court; he cannot be said to have superior
knowledge, or be better trained, to aid or control their affairs or conduct. Judges of the
Supreme Court hold independent office, and are there is no hierarchy, in their judicial
functions, which places them at a different plane than the CJI. In these circumstances, it
cannot be held that asset information shared with the CJI, by the judges of the Supreme
Court, are held by him in the capacity of a fiduciary, which if directed to be revealed,
would result in breach of such duty. So far as the argument that the 1997 Resolution
had imposed a confidentiality obligation on the CJI to ensure non-disclosure of the asset
declarations, is concerned, the court is of opinion that with the advent of the Act, and
the provision in <a href="/doc/1864010/" id="a_136">Section 22</a> - which overrides all other laws, etc. (even overriding the
<a href="/doc/61492784/" id="a_137">Official Secrets Act</a>) the argument about such a confidentiality condition is on a weak
foundation. The mere marking of a document, as "confidential", in this case, does not
undermine the overbearing nature of <a href="/doc/1864010/" id="a_138">Section 22</a>. Concededly, the confidentiality clause
(in the 1997 Resolution) operated, and many might have bona fide believed that it
would ensure immunity from access. Yet the advent of the Act changed all that; all
classes of information became its subject matter. <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_139">Section 8(1)</a> (f) affords protection to
one such class, i.e. fiduciaries. The content of such provision may include certain kinds
of relationships of public officials, such as doctor-patient relations; teacher-pupil


W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 48
 relationships, in government schools and colleges; agents of governments; even
attorneys and lawyers who appear and advise public authorities covered by the Act.
However, it does not cover asset declarations made by Judges of the Supreme Court,
and held by the CJI.
</p>
<p id="p_173">59.    For the above reasons, the court concludes the petitioners' argument about the
CJI holding asset declarations in a fiduciary capacity, (which would be breached if it is
directed to be disclosed, in the manner sought by the applicant) to be insubstantial. The
CJI does not hold such declarations in a fiduciary capacity or relationship.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Point No. 5</span>

<p id="p_174">60.    The petitioners argue that the information sought for is exempt from disclosure
by reason of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_140">Section 8</a> (1) (j) of the Act. The argument here is that such class of
information - about personal asset declarations has nothing to do with the individual's
duties required to be discharged, as a judge, an obvious reference to the first part of
<a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_141">Section 8</a> (1) (j); it is also emphasized that access to such information would result in
unwarranted intrusion of privacy. The applicant counters the submission and says that
details of whether declarations have been made, to the CJI can hardly be said to be
called "private" and that declarations are made by individual judges to the CJI in their
capacity as judges. It is submitted that the present proceeding is not concerned with the
content of asset declarations.
</p>
<p id="p_175">61.    The scheme of the Act, visualizes certain exemptions from information
disclosure. <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_142">Section 8</a> lists these exemptions; it opens with a non-obstante clause,
signifying the intention that irrespective of the rights of the information seeker, in
regard to matters listed under that provision, the information providers can justifiably
withhold access to the information seeker the record, information or queries sought for
by him. <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_143">Section 8</a> (1) (j) says that disclosure may be refused if the request pertains to:

</p>
<p id="p_178">62.    The right to access public information, that is, information in the possession of
state agencies and governments, in democracies is an accountability measure
empowering citizens to be aware of the actions taken by such state "actors". This
transparency value, at the same time, has to be reconciled with the legal interests
protected by law, such as other fundamental rights, particularly the fundamental right
to privacy. Certain conflicts may underlie particular cases of access to information and
the protection of personal data, arising from the fact that both rights cannot be
exercised absolutely in all cases. The rights of all those affected must be respected, and
no single right must prevail over others, except in clear and express circumstances. To
achieve these objectives, and resolve the underlying the tension between the two
(sometimes) conflicting values, the Act reveals a well-defined list of 11 kinds of matters
that cannot be made public, under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_144">section 8(1)(j)</a>. There are two types of information
seen as exceptions to access; the first usually refers to those matters limited only to the
State in protection of the general public good, such as national security, international
relations, confidentiality in cabinet meetings, etc. The second class of information with
state or its agencies, is personal data of individual citizens, investigative processes, or
confidential information disclosed by artificial or juristic entities, like corporations, etc.
Individuals' personal data is protected by the laws of access to confidential data and by
privacy rights. Often these guarantees - right to access information, and right to privacy,
occur at the same regulatory level. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, through

 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_145">Article 19</a> articulates the right to information; <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_146">Article 12</a>, at the same time, protects the
right to privacy:

       or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has
       the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".
</blockquote><p id="p_179">63.    There can be no doubt that the Act is premised on disclosure being the norm, and
refusal, the exception. As noticed, besides the exemptions, non-disclosure is also
mandated in respect of information relating to second schedule institutions. Though by
<a href="/doc/1864010/" id="a_147">Section 22</a>, the Act overrides other laws, the opening non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_148">Section 8</a>
("notwithstanding anything contained in this Act") confers primacy to the exemptions,
enacted under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_149">Section 8</a>. Clause (j) of Sub-section (1) embodies the exception of
information in the possession of the public authority which relates to a third party.
Simply put, this exception is that if the information concerns a third party (i.e. a party
other than the information seeker and the information provider), unless a public
interest in disclosure is shown, information would not be given; information may also be
refused on the ground that disclosure may result in unwarranted intrusion of privacy of
the individual. Significantly, the enactment makes no distinction between a private
individual third party and a public servant or public official third party.

<p id="p_180">64.    Ironically the right to privacy, a recognized fundamental right by our Supreme
Court, has found articulation - through a safeguard, though limited, against information
disclosure, under the Act. In India, there is no law relating to data protection, or privacy;
these have evolved through the interpretive process. The right to privacy, characterized
by Justice Brandeis in his memorable dissent, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 US 438
(1928) as ""right to be let alone... the most comprehensive of rights and the right most
valued by civilised men" is recognized under our Constitution by the Supreme Court in
four rulings - Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (1964) 1 SCR 332; <a href="/doc/845196/" id="a_150">Gobind v. State of M.P</a>.,
(1975) 2 SCC 148; <a href="/doc/501107/" id="a_151">R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N</a>., (1994) 6 SCC 632; and District Registrar

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 51
 and <a href="/doc/1068532/" id="a_152">Collector v. Canara Bank</a>,(2005) 1 SCC 496. These judgments, however did not
explore the latent tension between the two values of information rights and privacy
rights; Rajagopal, which is nearest in point, was concerned to an extent with publication
of material that was part of court records.

<p id="p_181">65.   It has been held by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court that an individual
does not forfeit his fundamental rights, by becoming a public servant, in <a href="/doc/1681994/" id="a_153">O.K. Ghosh v.
E.X. Joseph</a> AIR 1963 SC 812. <a href="/doc/687159/" id="a_154">In Kameshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar</a> AIR 1962 1166, the
Supreme Court repelled an argument that public servants do not possess fundamental
rights, through another Constitution Bench, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">      "It was said that a Government servant who was posted to a particular place
      could obviously not exercise the freedom to move throughout the territory of
      India and similarly, his right to reside and settle in any part of India could be said
      to be violated by his being posted to any particular place. Similarly, so long as he
      was in government service he would not be entitled to practice any profession or
      trade and it was therefore urged that to hold that these freedoms guaranteed
      under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_155">Art. 19</a> were applicable to government servants would render public service
      or administration impossible....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">      ......................      .........................    ..........................
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">      We find ourselves unable to accept the argument that the Constitution excludes
      Government servants as a class from the protection of the several rights
      guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III save in those cases where such
      persons were specifically named.</blockquote>
<p id="p_182">      14. In our opinion, this argument even if otherwise possible, has to be repelled in
      view of the terms of <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_156">Art. 33.</a> That Article select two of the Services under the
      State-members of the armed forces charged with the maintenance of public order
      and saves the rules prescribing the conditions of service in regard to them - from
      invalidity on the ground of violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed
      by Part III and also defines the purpose for which such abrogation or restriction
      might take place, this being limited to ensure the proper discharge of duties and
      the maintenance of discipline among them. The Article having thus selected the
      Services members of which might be deprived of the benefit of the fundamental
      rights guaranteed to other persons and citizens and also having prescribed the
      limits within which such restrictions or abrogation might take place, we consider
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                            Page 52
        that other classes of servants of Government in common with other persons and
       other citizens of the country cannot be excluded from the protection of the rights
       guaranteed by Part III by reason merely of their being Government servants and
       the nature and incidents of the duties which they have to discharge in that
       capacity might necessarily involve restrictions of certain freedoms as we have
       pointed out in relation to <a href="/doc/844404/" id="a_157">Art. 19(1)(e)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_158">(g)."</a>

The above discussion would mean that an individual or citizen's fundamental rights,
which include the right to privacy - are not subsumed or extinguished if he accepts or
holds public office. <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_159">Section 8(1)</a> (j) is an affirmation of this; it ensures that all
information furnished to public authorities - including personal information (such as
asset disclosures) are not given blanket access; the information seeker has to disclose a
sustainable public interest element for release of the information.
</p>
<p id="p_184">66.    It could arguably be said that that privacy rights, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_160">Section 8(1)(j)</a>
whenever asserted, would prevail. However, that is not always the case, since the public
interest element, seeps through that provision. Thus when a member of the public
requests personal information about a public servant, - such as asset declarations made
by him- a distinction must be made between the personal data inherent to the position
and those that are not, and therefore affect only his/her private life. This balancing task
appears to be easy; but is in practice, not so, having regard to the dynamics inherent in
the conflict. If public access to the personal data containing details, like photographs of
public servants, personal particulars such as their dates of birth, personal identification
numbers, or other personal information furnished to public agencies, is requested, the
balancing exercise, necessarily dependant and evolving on a case by case basis, would
take into account of many factors which would require examination, having regard to
circumstances of each case. These may include:
</p>



<p id="p_185">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 53
</p><p id="p_186"> i) whether the disclosure of the personal information is with the aim of providing
knowledge of the proper performance of the duties and tasks assigned to the public

</p>
<p id="p_187">ii) whether the information is deemed to comprise the individual's private details,
unrelated to his position in the organization, and,

</p><p id="p_188">iii) whether the disclosure will furnish any information required to establish
accountability or transparency in the use of public resources.
</p>
<p id="p_189"><a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_161">Section 8(1)(j)</a>'s explicit mention of privacy, therefore, has to be viewed in the context.
Lord Denning in his "What next in Law", presciently emphasized the need to suitably
balance the competing values, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">       "English law should recognise a right to privacy. Any infringement of it should give
       a cause of action for damages or an injunction as the case may require. It should
       also recognise a right of confidence for all correspondence and communications
       which expressly or impliedly are given in confidence. None of these rights is
       absolute. Each is subject to exceptions. These exceptions are to be allowed
       whenever the public interest in openness outweighs the public interest in privacy
       or confidentiality. In every instance it is a balancing exercise for the Courts. As
       each case is decided, it will form a precedent for others. So a body of case-law will
       be established."
</blockquote><p id="p_190">67.    A private citizen's privacy right is undoubtedly of the same nature and character
as that of a public servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive
rights of the two differ. Yet, inherent in the situation of the latter is the premise that he
acts for the public good, in the discharge of his duties, and is accountable for them. The
character of protection, therefore, afforded to the two classes - public servants and
private individuals, is to be viewed from this perspective. The nature of restriction on
the right to privacy is therefore of a different order; in the case of private individuals,
the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of
protection can be lower, depending on what is at stake. Therefore, if an important value

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                    Page 54
 in public disclosure of personal information is demonstrated, in the particular facts of a
case, by way of objective material or evidence, furnished by the information seeker, the
protection afforded by <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_162">Section 8(1)(j)</a> may not be available; in such case, the
information officer can proceed to the next step of issuing notice to the concerned
public official, as a "third party" and consider his views on why there should be no
disclosure. The onus of showing that disclosure should be made, is upon the individual
asserting it; he cannot merely say that as the information relates to a public official,
there is a public interest element. Adopting such a simplistic argument would defeat the
objective of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_163">Section 8(1)(j)</a>; Parliamentary intention in carving out an exception from the
normal rule requiring no "locus" by virtue of <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_164">Section 6</a>, in the case of exemptions, is
explicit through the non-obstante clause.
</p>
<p id="p_191">68.    This court cannot be unmindful of the fact that several categories of public
servants, including Central and State Government servants, as well as public sector
employees and officers of statutory corporations are required by service rules to declare
their assets, periodically. Settled procedures have been prescribed, both as to
periodicity as well as contents of such asset disclosure. The regime ushered under the
Act no doubt mandates, by <a href="/doc/492974/" id="a_165">Section 4</a>, disclosure of a wide spectrum of information held
by each public authority to be disseminated to the public; it can even be through the
medium of the internet. Yet, that provision is overridden by <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_166">Section 8</a> - by virtue of the
non-obstante clause. This means that such personal information - regarding asset
disclosures, need not be made public, unless public interest considerations dictate it,
under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_167">Section 8(1)(j)</a>. Any other interpretation would rob this clause of its vitality, as the
value of privacy would be completely eroded, and the information would be
disseminated without following the procedure prescribed.

<p id="p_194">70.    The obligation to provide unimpeded access, to information, even through the
internet, however, is lifted in case of the 11 categories or classes of information,
mentioned in <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_170">Section 8</a>; this is apparent from the opening words "Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen..." If these
two provisions are seen together, the primary obligation to facilitate public access -
even through internet, cast by <a href="/doc/492974/" id="a_171">Section 4</a>, does not apply in respect of information that
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                     Page 56
 would fall under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_172">Section 8</a>. The norm, (by virtue of the subject matter of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_173">Section 8</a>, and
the non-obstante clause) is non-disclosure, of those categories which fall under the
exemptions. Now, <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_174">Section 8</a> (1) (j) clearly alludes to personal information the disclosure
of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause
unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. If public servants - here the
expression is used expansively to include members of the higher judiciary too - are
obliged to furnish asset declarations, the mere fact that they have to furnish such
declaration would not mean that it is part of public activity, or "interest". As observed
earlier, a public servant does not cease to enjoy fundamental rights, upon assuming
office. That the public servant has to make disclosures is a part of the system's endeavor
to appraise itself of potential asset acquisitions, which may have to be explained
properly. However, such acquisitions can be made legitimately; no law bars public
servants from acquiring properties, or investing their income. The obligation to disclose
these investments and assets is to check the propensity to abuse a public office, for
private gain. If the information applicant is able to demonstrate what <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_175">Section 8(1)</a> (j)
enjoins the information seeker to, i.e. that "the larger public interest justifies the
disclosure of such information" the authority deciding the application can proceed to the
next step, after recording its prima facie satisfaction, to issue notice to the "third party"
i.e. the public servant who is the information subject, why the information sought
should not be disclosed. After considering all these views and materials, the CPIO or
concerned State PIO, as the case may be can pass appropriate orders, including directing
disclosure. This order is appealable.

contended that in a democracy, public officials, including members of the higher
judiciary are under a duty to disclose their assets. The context of that decision was
whether electoral aspirants, i.e. candidates to elective office, in the absence of statutory
obligation, could be compelled to disclose their assets. The Supreme Court said that
they could be, affirming this court's decision, and significantly observing that if a law
had existed, courts would have been bound by its terms. The court held that:

      democracy the little man -- voter -- has overwhelming importance on the point
      and the little-large Indian (voter) should not be hijacked from the course of free
      and fair elections by subtle perversion of discretion of casting votes. In a continual
      participative operation of periodical election, the voter does a social audit of his
      candidate and for such audit he must be well informed about the past of his
      candidate. Further, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_183">Article 324</a> operates in areas left unoccupied by legislation
      and the words "superintendence, direction and control" as well as "conduct of all

      effect except where it flows from necessary implication. Therefore, in our view, it

      General and Mr Ashwani Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
      the intervenor that if there is no provision in the Act or the Rules, the High Court
      ought not to have issued such directions to the Election Commission. It is settled
      that the power of the Commission is plenary in character in exercise thereof. In
      statutory provisions or rules, it is known that every contingency could not be

statutory vacuum. The value it reached out to, underlines the foundation of our republic
i.e. democracy, and the voter's right to make an informed choice while exercising his
franchise. Being a participant in the democratic process, where law and policy makers

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 59
 are elected, the court reasoned that the "little" man cannot be kept in the dark, about
the individuals who offer themselves as candidates, in elections. The situation here is
radically different, to say the least. One, a statute occupies the field, in the form of the
Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_184">Information Act</a>, whose provisions were not considered by the Supreme Court, in
the above case. Two, India did not choose the US model of either electing judges, or
subjecting their appointment to a confirmation process (as in the case of the Federal
Judiciary) where the legislature plays a prominent participatory role. Three, any
obligations and safeguards have to be seen in the context of the statutory mandate, and
the court cannot, on vague notions of transparency, detract from well established
values of independence. It is one thing to say that judges are accountable, and have to
make asset declarations; for extension of complete and uninhibited access to the
contents, of asset declarations, by invoking transparency, a mere demand is insufficient,
as the court would be decreeing something which the law not only does not provide,
but for which the existing law makes explicit provisions to the contrary. Most
importantly, it would be wrong for the court to, for this purpose equate the two class of
public servants - i.e. legislators and members of the higher judiciary. Apart from the
inalienable value of independence of the judiciary, which is entrenched in the
Constitution, and guaranteed by various provisions, judges' tenure is secured till
retirement, subject to good behaviour (the threshold of their removal being very high),
whereas legislators, Parliamentarians and the top most echelons of the Government, at
ministerial level, occupy office as long as the people choose to keep them there, or as
long as the concerned individual has the confidence of the Prime Minister or Chief
Minister (in the case of a minister, in the cabinet or council of minister). Rhetoric and
polemics apart, there is no reason to undermine the protections provided by law,
merely because some members of the public believe that judges ought to permit
unimpeded disclosure of their personal assets to the public. The obligation to give
access or deny access to information, is today controlled by provisions of the Act, as it

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 60
 presently exists. It nowhere obliges disclosure of assets of spouses, dependants and
children - of judges. Members of the higher judiciary are, in this respect entitled to the
same protection - and exemptions- as in the case of other public servants, including
judicial officers up to the District Judge level, members of All India services, and other
services under the Union. The acceptance of such contentions, in disregard of express
provisions of law, can possibly lead to utterly unreasonable demands for all kinds of
disclosure, from all classes of public servants - which would be contrary to statutory
intendment.
</p><p id="p_204">74.    In this court's opinion <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_185">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is both a check on the power of requiring
information dissemination, (having regard to its potential impact on individual privacy
rights,) as well as a mechanism whereby individuals have limited control over whether
personal details can be made public. This safeguard is made in public interest in favour
of all public officials and public servants. There can be no manner of doubt that
Supreme Court and High Court judges are public servants (K. Veeraswami established
that). They are no doubt given a high status, and afforded considerable degree of
protections, under the Constitution; yet that does not make them public servants any
less. If that is the true position, the protection afforded by <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_186">Section 8(1)</a> (j) to judges is of
no lesser quality than that given to other public servants, in this regard. To hold
otherwise would be incongruous, because, members of the higher judiciary are held to
self imposed obligatory Constitutional standards, and their asset disclosures are held,
(by this judgment), to be "information" held by the CJI, a public authority, under the Act;
yet, they would be deprived of the protection that the same enactment extends to all
those covered by it. It cannot be that judges' being held to high standards, on the basis
of norms articulated by the 1997 resolution and the judicial conference resolution of
1999, should place their asset declarations outside of the Act - a demand never made
by the applicant, whose case from inception of these proceeding has been that they are
subjected to the Act, being "information". Therefore, as regards contents of the

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                      Page 61
 declaration, information applicants would have to, whenever they approach the
authorities, under the Act, satisfy them under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_187">Section 8(1)(j)</a> and cross the threshold of
revealing the "larger public interest" for disclosure, as in the case of all those covered by
the said provision. For the purposes of this case, however, the particulars sought do not
justify or warrant that protection; all that the applicant sought is whether the 1997
resolution was complied with. That kind of innocuous information does not warrant the
protection granted by <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_188">Section 8</a> (1)(j).
</p>
<p id="p_205">75.    In view of the above discussion, it is held that the contents of asset declarations,
pursuant to the 1997 resolution - and the 1999 Conference resolution- are entitled to
be treated as personal information, and may be accessed in accordance with the
procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_189">Section 8(1)(j)</a>; they are not otherwise subject to disclosure.
As far as the information sought by the applicant in this case is concerned, (i.e. whether
the declarations were made pursuant to the 1997 resolution) the procedure under
<a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_190">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is inapplicable.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Point No. 6</span>

<p id="p_206">74.    This point was urged by the petitioners, in support of the submission that the
1997 resolution does not state with clarity, what are "assets" and "investments" and
that this ambiguity, which renders the system unworkable.
</p>
<p id="p_207">75.    The 1997 resolution says, inter alia, that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">       "...every Judge should make a declaration of all his/her assets in the form of real
       estate or investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or in the name of
       his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her) within a reasonable time of
       assuming office..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_208">It is no doubt true that the resolution lacks particulars about what constitutes "assets"
and "investments". The lack of clarity, understandably means the likelihood of individual

 Justices of the Supreme Court, interpreting the expression differently, leading to some
confusion. In that sense, the argument does raise some concern.
</p>
<p id="p_209">76.    The Ethics in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_191">Government Act</a>, 1978 was enacted by the US Congress; it applies to
all levels of federal judges (known as "Article III judges" since they are usually appointed
for life, and cannot be removed except through a process analogous to impeachment).
The enactment obliges federal judges to disclose personal and financial information
each year; the sources of income, other than what is earned as an "employee of the
United State" (since judges in the US are free to receive remuneration through writing,
teaching, and lecturing, provided such activity does not hinder their duties) received
during a preceding calendar year, the source, description and value of gifts beyond a
defined value too are to be declared. The US Congress passed what are known as
"redaction" provisions to the Ethics in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_192">Government Act</a>, for the first time in 1998,
allowing members of the judiciary to withdraw, or withhold certain information "to the
extent necessary to protect the individual who filed the report". Redaction is permitted
after the individual judge demonstrates the existence of objective factors which justify
withholding of part of the information, mandated to be revealed. The US Judicial
Conference (which is a statutorily created body, by virtue of Congressional law, and
comprises of 13 representatives among District Judges, equal representation from
Circuit (Appeal Court) judges, and two judges of the US Supreme Court, with the Chief
Justice of the US Supreme Court as the Chairman) submits reports; it also examines
redaction applications, by judges, through a committee known as "Subcommittee on
Public Access and Security". The procedure followed has been described in the article
"Re-examining Financial Disclosure Procedures for the Federal Judiciary" (The
Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, Summer 2005, by Sarah Goldstein):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">       "The Committee has developed a multi-phase process for reviewing judges'
       redaction requests and public requests for copies of judges' reports. When a
       member of the public requests a copy of a judge's financial disclosure report, the

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 63
       Committee sends a notification of the request to the judge in question and
      concurrently contacts the United States Marshals Service ("USMS") for a security
      consultation. The public request must be made on "an original, signed form listing
      the judges whose reports [the requester is] seeking and any individuals on whose
      behalf the requests are being made." When the Committee notifies the judge of
      the public request for the report, it asks the judge to respond in writing within
      fourteen days as to whether the judge would like to request new or additional
      redactions of information; however, the Committee can extend this response
      period if the judge so requests. If the judge does not request a redaction from his
      or her report at this time, the Committee staff sends a cost letter to the requester,
      the requester pays for the report, and the Committee then releases a copy of the
      report to the requester. However, if the judge requests a redaction upon receiving
      notification of the request for a copy of the report, the Committee staff sends the
      results of USMS security consultations, original requests for the judge's report,
      and the judge's redaction requests to members of the Subcommittee. The
      Subcommittee then votes on the redaction requests, with a majority needed to
      approve or deny the request, and the Subcommittee vote is forwarded to the
      Committee staff. As with reports where the judge has not requested a redaction,
      the staff then sends a cost letter to the requester, and the requester pays for the
      report. Finally, the Committee releases a copy of the report, with approved
      redactions, to the requester."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_210">77.   As may be seen from the above discussion and from the extracts quoted, fairly
well established norms defining what kinds of information should be disclosed; the
safeguards, and provision for public disclosure of the information furnished by the
concerned US federal judges, exist. Absence of particularization or lack of uniformity
about the content, of asset declarations, pursuant to the 1997 resolution, can therefore,
result in confusion. However, these are not insurmountable obstacles; the CJI, if he
deems it appropriate, may in consultation with the Supreme Court judges, evolve
uniform standards, devising the nature of information, relevant formats, and if required,
the periodicity of the declarations to be made. The forms evolved, as well as the
procedures followed in the United States, - including the redaction norms- under the
Ethics in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_193">Government Act</a>, 1978, reports of the US Judicial Conference, as well as the
Judicial Disclosure Responsibility Act, 2007, which amends the Ethics in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_194">Government Act</a>
of 1978 to: (1) restrict disclosure of personal information about family members of
W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 64
 judges whose revelation might endanger them; and (2) extend the authority of the
Judicial Conference to redact certain personal information of judges from financial
disclosure reports may be considered. Such forms may be circulated to various High
Courts, for consideration. Under the scheme of the Constitution, High Courts are
independent, and would have to decide on such matters after due deliberation (See
Indira Jaising where it was held that "in the hierarchy of the courts, the Supreme Court
does not have any disciplinary control over the High Court Judges, much less the Chief
Justice of India has any disciplinary control over any of the Judges.").
</p>
<p id="p_211">78.    There is one more area, which may be appropriately considered. With this court
holding that asset declarations are "information", in the event of applications under the
Act, seeking access to content of such declarations, it may become necessary for the
CPIOs concerned to examine, while considering the requests, the existing information.
The evolution of formats assumes importance in this context; if such forms are evolved,
claim of various applicants will have to be effectively adjudicated. The CJI may consider
the feasibility of constituting a CPIO of sufficient seniority, as well as an Appellate
authority, in this regard. The court would refrain from expressing anything more, as
those are administrative concerns, which are not within the purview of discussion, here.
</p>
<p id="p_212">Postscript

</p><p id="p_213">79.    The intervening developments have focused on "accountability" of judges. As this
judgment has sought to demonstrate, a judge is not "unaccountable" as is sometimes
wrongly understood; and is subject to several constraints. The judicial branch lacks
either the "sword or the purse" controlled by the other two branches. Through its
judgments, upholds values such as equality, fundamental human rights, freedom of
speech and the press, dignity of human beings, and acts as bulwark against
contemporary majoritarian impulses, that could threaten democratic values - be it on
the basis of region, class, caste, religion, or even political persuasion (such as against

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                 Page 65
 McCarthyism). Even while independent, judges are under several visible constraints
unlike the executive branch, they are to conduct proceedings in open court. This holds
great value, since publicity of proceedings is, in the words of Lord Shaw (Ref. Scott -vs-
Scott 1913 AC 417):
</p><p id="p_214">       "the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all
       guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial..."
</p>

<p id="p_215">Again, unlike Parliament, which enacts laws, which apply generally, the judge is an
occasional, or casual law-maker, "filling in" small gaps, through his interpretive role; he
never does that in vacuum. Most importantly, judgments of courts are to be based on
reason, and discuss fairly, what is argued. Judges, unlike other sections of members of
the public cannot meet unjustified personal attacks or tirades carried out against them,
or anyone from their fraternity; no clarifications can be issued, no justification is given;
propriety and canons of judicial ethics require them to maintain silence. Standards of
judicial ethics require that judges are not heard in public (See Canons of Ethics, Judicial
Conference Resolution of 1999 that "(8)A Judge shall not enter into public debate or
express his views in public on political matters or on matters that are pending or are
likely to arise for judicial determination." The judge is thus unable to go and explain his
position to the people. An honest, but strict or unpopular judge can be unfairly vilified,
without anyone giving his version; similarly, unfounded allegations of improper personal
behaviour cannot be defended by the judge in public, even though they can be levelled
freely; they may tarnish his reputation or worse, and he would have to smart under
them, under the haunting prospect of its being resuscitated every now and then.
</p><p id="p_216">80.    Anecdotal references to corruption - in the absence of any empirical materials, by
those who formerly held high judicial offices, have tended to undermine the judicial
branch; this denigration persists, unfortunately, even as regards the judicial role. Those
who know, keep quiet about the crushing burdens that members of the judiciary -
including the higher judiciary have to shoulder. The number of cases filed, continue to

W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                   Page 66
 increase; expenditure on the judicial branch is infinitesimal. The CJ's conference of 2008,
in its agenda, noted that the Ninth (five year) Plan (1997-2000) released, for priority
demands of the judiciary released a meager 0.071 percent of the total expenditure; for
the tenth plan, the expenditure was 0.0078 percent.
</p><p id="p_217">81.    The perception that the wheels of justice grind too slowly, in the meanwhile,
continues. For the litigant, who pins his hopes on speedy resolution of his disputes,
these explanations may wear thin; yet the judge who tries cases is not superhuman; the
judge is as human as any other citizen. In 1987, the Law Commission recommended
appointment of 107 judges per million people, when it found that at that time the ratio
was only 10.5 judges per million people and it wished the same to begin with
appointment of 50 judges per million people. Most states have not been able to achieve
it even today. The popular public perception is that judges do not work after official
hours, and enjoy long vacations, a hangover of the British Raj. On the contrary, a
crushing load ensures that judges put in equal number of hours, sometimes more, than
what is spent by them, in open court, resulting typically in 10-14 hour working days, at
times more. Most Saturdays are working days, if the judicial officer or the judge has to
be "on par" with the judgments and orders that are to be prepared and announced. If
judges have to understand and deal with all the cases listed before their courts, they
would also have to spend some time, beforehand, reading up the previous day. They
would have to also spare time to think, reflect and write judgments; the day's orders
have to be corrected and signed by them, each day; often, these are extremely urgent,
and concern vital matters, such as bails, interim injunctions, and the like. If an analysis
of the number of judgments impacting litigants were to be made, some startling facts
would emerge. These are not peculiar to Indian courts; Courts in the United Kingdom,
too have a similar structure, as the website of the Judiciary of England and Wales,
suggests      (http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/keyfacts/legal_year/judicial_sitting_days.htm;
</p>


<p id="p_218">W.P.(C) 288/2009                                                                  Page 67
 accessed at 20:20 hours, 29th July, 2009). There, Court of Appeal and High Court judges
are expected to devote themselves to judicial business throughout the legal year

      "..which usually amounts to somewhere in the region of 185-190 days....Circuit
      judges are expected to sit for a minimum of 210 days, although the expectation is
      for between 215-220 per year....District judges are expected to sit for a minimum
      of 215 days....Judges also have out of court duties to perform such as reading case
      papers, writing judgments, and keeping up to date with new developments in the
      law."
</p>
<p id="p_219">82.   In a report ("Too many cases" Vol. 26, issue No. 1, January 3-16, 2009, "The
Frontline") a commentator - Nick Robinson noted that the Supreme Court of India
heard 57,000 "admission" matters, and accepted 6900 for hearing in 2007, when it
decided 5000 cases. The report noted that in the United States, an appeal to the
Supreme Court is "fairly easy", yet, the court accepts about 1 per cent of those appeals
and "generally hears less than a hundred cases each year." The report noted that
curtailing court's vacation was not a good idea:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">      "Judges in India though appear far more days in court than their counterparts in
      most other countries (the Supreme Court heard arguments for 190 days in 2007,
      while the U.S. Supreme Court sat for only 38 days). Additionally, many judges use
      their "vacation time" to research and write major decisions, go through briefs to
      prepare for cases, and engage in professional development such as reading recent
      legal publications or attending conferences..."

<p id="p_220">83.   The intervening events after the hearings were concluded in this case, has seen
some developments; the Full Court of the Supreme Court has resolved to place the
information in the Court website, after modalities are duly worked out. A statement to
this effect was made by the petitioner's counsel, who has, in the meanwhile been
appointed as the Attorney General for India. Some High Courts, including the Delhi High
Court, have resolved similarly to make the information public. This judgment does not
wish to comment on those developments; the findings in this case, should place
everything in their legal and contextual perspective. In the ultimate analysis, the faith

 and confidence of the people in the institution of the judiciary cannot depend only on
whether, and to what extent judicial ethics are evolved, or adhered to; that is no doubt
important, in a modern democracy. Yet what really matters is that impartiality and
diligence are an inalienable part of every judge's function; he or she has the
responsibility of unceasing commitment to these values, and unwavering fidelity to the
rule of law. It would be useful to quote Dr. Barrack, from "The Judge in a Democracy"
again, as it summarizes the values which every judge is committed to live by:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">       " As a judge, I do not have a political platform. I am not a political person. Right
       and left, religious and secular, rich and poor, man and woman, disabled and
       nondisabled, all are equal in my eyes. All are human beings, created in the image
       of the Creator. I will protect the human dignity of each. I do not aspire to power. I
       do not seek to rule. I am aware of the chains that bind me as a judge and as the
       president of the Supreme Court. I have repeatedly emphasized the rule of law and
       not of the judge. I am aware of the importance of the other branches of
       government - legislative and executive - which give expression to democracy.
       Between those two branches are connecting bridges and checks and balances.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">              I view my office as a mission. Judging is not a job. It is a way of life.
       Whenever I enter the courtroom, I do so with the deep sense that, as I sit at trial, I
       stand on trial."
</blockquote><p id="p_221">To this court, this case and the present judgment has been a humbling experience; it
required distancing from subjective perceptions to various issues, and a detached
analysis of each point argued, by the parties. The task was not made any lighter, since it
involved balancing of varied sensitivities. That the court was called upon to decide
these issues, is an affirmation of the rule of law, and the intervener uncharitably
characterized the petitioners as lacking locus standi. That these issues have to be
addressed by courts - which are required to interpret the law and the Constitution,
cannot be denied by anyone. That the petition involved consideration of serious and
important legal issues, was also not disputed by the parties to these proceedings. In
these circumstances, dismissal of the petition on the narrow ground of lack of standing,
would have resulted in the court failing to discharge its primary duty.

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_224">Re Point Nos. 1 &amp; 2 Whether the CJI is a public authority and whether the CPIO, of the
Supreme Court of India, is different from the office of the CJI; and if so, whether the Act
covers the office of the CJI;
</p>
<p id="p_225">Answer:        The CJI is a public authority under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_195">Information Act</a> and the CJI
holds the information pertaining to asset declarations in his capacity as Chief Justice;
that office is a "public authority" under the Act and is covered by its provisions.

<p id="p_226">Re Point No. 3: Whether asset declaration by Supreme Court judges, pursuant to the

</p>
<p id="p_227">Answer: It is held that the second part of the respondent's application, relating to
declaration of assets by the Supreme Court judges, is "information" within the meaning

information pertaining to declarations given, to the CJI and the contents of such
declaration are "information" and subject to the provisions of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_198">Information

<p id="p_228">Re Point No. 4:       If such asset declarations are "information" does the CJI hold them
in a "fiduciary" capacity, and are they therefore, exempt from disclosure under the Act

Answer:        The petitioners' argument about the CJI holding asset declarations in a
fiduciary capacity, (which would be breached if it is directed to be disclosed, in the
manner sought by the applicant) is insubstantial. The CJI does not hold such declarations
in a fiduciary capacity or relationship.
