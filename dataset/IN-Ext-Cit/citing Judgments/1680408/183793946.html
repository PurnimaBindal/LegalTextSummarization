</pre>
<p id="p_1">J.Chelameswar, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The unsuccessful petitioners in W.P.(C) No.18789 of

2010 are the appellants aggrieved by judgment dated

23.07.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            2. Of the two appellants, the first appellant claims

to be a person with disability of Cerebral Palsy assessed to be a

disability of 50% by the medical board constituted by the

District Medical Officer and evidenced by Ext.P1(b) certificate

dated 22.04.2010. The second appellant claims to be a person

belonging to a Scheduled Caste.              The writ petition is filed

challenging Ext.P3 notification issued by the respondent

University dated 04.09.2008. The prayers in the writ petition

are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                       "i) Call for the records leading to Ext.P3 and

          quash the same.</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">                       ii) Issue a writ of mandamus commanding the

          respondent to issue fresh notification to the posts of

          Assistants notified in Ext.P3 for recruitment following the

WA No. 491 of 2011

          principles of reservation as required under Kannur University

          Act, KS and SSR and Persons with Disabilities (Equal

          Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act,

          1995.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                       iii) Pass such other orders that this Hon'ble

          Court may deems fit and proper in he facts and

          circumstances of the case; and

</p><p id="p_7">                       iv) to award cost of the writ petition."
</p>
<p id="p_8">


</p><p id="p_9">            3. It may be mentioned here that the writ petition is

filed on 16.06.2010, almost after a lapse of one year 9 months

reckoned from the date of Ext.P3 notification. By the impugned

notification the respondent University invited applications from

persons qualified for appointment to the various posts indicated

in the notification. By the said notification 53 posts were sought

to be filled up.      The objection of the appellants to the said

notification is that the notification does not indicate that either

rules of reservation provided under Rules 14, 15, 16 and 17 of

the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules or the

reservation provided under the Persons with Disabilities (Equal

Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act,

WA No. 491 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     -:3:-</span>


1995 are applicable to the recruitment covered by the notification

in question.    In this regard, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the writ

petition reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                      "6. The respondent is legally bound to notify the

         post for recruitment making clear that the reserved

         communities and physically handicapped persons will be

         considered for recruitment. In fact, as and when the posts

         are notified, the notification would specify whether vacancies

         notified would be filled by following communal reservation and

         the reservation for scheduled caste/scheduled tribe and

         physically handicapped persons. The respondent it appears

         has   deliberately   denied    reservation to  the   deserving

         communities by notifying the post for recruitment in open

         quota.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      7.     It is submitted that the recruitment

         proceedings initiated by Ext.P3 is therefore hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a>

         and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_2">16</a> of the Constitution of India and it is liable to be

         quashed in as much as the petitioners' right to reserved posts

         under reserved quota has been affected.       The respondent

         cannot fill the vacancies of Assistants without following the

         provisions of the Kannur University Act and the Statutes."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">           4. By the judgment under appeal, a learned Judge of

this Court dismissed the writ petition essentially on the ground

that the same is barred by laches. The relative portion of the

judgment reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_12">WA No. 491 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  -:4:-</span>


                    "As already noticed, this writ petition is liable to

        be dismissed on the sole ground of delay and laches."

     Hence the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">           5.   The learned counsel for the appellants, Sri.P.K.

Ibrahim, very emphatically argued that the appellants cannot be

denied the protection afforded to them both under the provisions

of the Constitution as well as the Persons with Disabilities (Equal

Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act on a

technical ground that they approached the Court 'belatedly'. It is

further submitted that the appellants had no knowledge of the

impugned notification till recently and immediately on coming to

know of the notification, the appellants approached this court

during the pendency of the recruitment process contemplated

under the impugned notification and therefore it cannot be said

that they are guilty of either delay or laches.

</p><p id="p_14">           6. In support of his submission, the learned counsel

relied upon the following judgments; <a href="/doc/1680408/" id="a_3">State of Manipur v. Y.

Token Singh</a> [AIR 2010 SC 3502], <a href="/doc/22933940/" id="a_4">Ramesh Gajendra Jadha v.

Secretary, Late S. G. S. P. Mandal</a> [AIR 2007 SCW 1995] and

WA No. 491 of 2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -:5:-</span>


<a href="/doc/1264484/" id="a_5">P.V. Antony v. State of Kerala</a> [2008(2) KLJ 257]. We are of

the opinion that all the three judgments deal with the legal

obligations while making appointments either by the State or

bodies which fall within the definition of expression State under

<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12.</a>  In our opinion, none of the decisions are relevant to

the context of the issue on hand.         Whether a person who

belatedly approaches the Court is entitled to raise the objection

that there was some illegality in the process adopted in making

appointment to posts either by the Government or some other

public body was not the issue in any one of the said cases.

</p><p id="p_15">           7. Apart from that, it is not the case of the appellants

that they applied in response to the impugned notification and

their cases have not been considered.      Their grievance is that

the notification does not indicate that appropriate rules of

reservation are applicable to the recruitment process. We are of

the opinion that whether the notification contains such a

declaration or not, the rules of reservation such as the one relied

upon by the appellants per se apply by operation of law and it

does not depend upon the volition or otherwise of the

employer/State. On the other hand, the respondent University in

the statement filed in the writ petition made a categoric

statement that rules of reservation are strictly followed by the

respondent University.
</p>
<p id="p_16">           In the circumstances, we do not see any merit in the

appeal. The Writ Appeal is dismissed at the admission stage.
