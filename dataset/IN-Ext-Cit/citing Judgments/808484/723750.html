Rasila   S.   Mehta   challenging   the   order   dated   07.05.2010

<p id="p_6">4)    Since   all   the   parties   in   the   above   appeals   are   family 



members of late Harshad S. Mehta and the orders challenged 



were  of the  Special Court,  the  same  are  being   disposed of  by 



the following common judgment.
</p>

<pre id="pre_2">5)    Brief Facts:


a)    Sometime   in   1992,   it   was   noticed   that   frauds   and 



</pre><p id="p_7">irregularities   involving   colossal   amounts   of   money   were 



committed by certain stock brokers and other persons as also 



by   certain   banks   and   financial   institutions.   The   amounts 



involved   in   the   said   frauds   and/or   irregularities   were 



estimated   to   run   into   several   thousand   crores.     The   Central 



Government,   therefore,   formed   an   opinion   that   it   was 



necessary   to   take   immediate   steps   to   try   offences   relating   to 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                            3</span>


such   transactions   in   securities   and   for   matters   connected 



therewith   or   incidental   thereto.     The   President   of   India 



thereupon promulgated an Ordinance on 6th June 1992 known 



as the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions 



in   Securities)   Ordinance   1992   and   the   said   Ordinance   came 



into   force   on   the   same   day.   The   said   Ordinance   with   certain 



modifications became the Act when the assent of the President 



was   given   thereto   on   18th  August   1992   and   the   said   Act   was 



deemed to have come into force on 6th June 1992, namely, the 



date on which the said Ordinance had been promulgated.
</p>


<p id="p_8">b)    On   6th  June,   1992   the   Central   Government   had   also 



framed certain rules under the provisions of <a href="/doc/344136/" id="a_3">Section 14</a> of the 



said   Ordinance   known   as   the   Special   Court   (Trial   of 



Offences   Relating   to   Transactions   in   Securities)   Rules,   1992 



(hereinafter referred to as `the Rules'). The said rules came into 



force   on   the   6th  June   1992   and   continue   in   force   after   the 



enactment   of   the   Act   under   <a href="/doc/1667178/" id="a_4">section   15(2)</a>   of   the   Act   and/or 



<a href="/doc/1921918/" id="a_5">Section 24</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
</p>


<p id="p_9">c)    The   object   of   the   Act,   as   apparent   from   the   provisions 



thereof,   is   to   ensure   that   offences   relating   to   securities   were

expeditiously   tried   and   it,   therefore,   provides   for   the 



establishment   of   a   Special   Court.   <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_6">The   Act</a>   also   provides   that 



an appeal lies from the judgment, sentence or order, not being 



interlocutory  order,  of  the   said   Special   Court  to   the   Supreme 



Court of India both on facts and on law. An important object of 



the said Act is to ensure speedy recovery of the huge amounts 



involved, to punish the guilty in such irregularities or fraud, to 



restore   confidence   in   and   maintain   the   basic   integrity   and 



credibility of the banks and financial institutions.  
</p>


<p id="p_10">d)    On   13.05.1992,   the   Central   Bureau   of   Investigation   (in 



short "the CBI") issued freeze orders under <a href="/doc/648213/" id="a_7">Section 102</a> of the 



Code of Criminal Procedure (in short `the Code) on all the bank 



accounts of Smt. Rasila S. Mehta and Smt. Rina S. Mehta on 



the   ground   that   the   appellants   are   recipients   of   monies 



diverted   by   M/s   Harshad   S.   Mehta   from   banks   and   financial 



institutions. This was a preventive measure taken by the CBI 



which   powers   are   normally   invoked   pending   investigation   to 



bring   within   their   fold,   any   property   which   is   the   subject-
</p>


<p id="p_11">matter of an offence.  Since then, all the charge-sheets came to 



be   filed   by   the   CBI   after   thorough   investigation   and   trial   has

been   completed   in   several   cases.     Based   on  the   provisions   of 



the   Act,   on   08.06.1992,   the   Custodian   notified   29   entities 



except   the   appellants   (Smt.   Rasila   S.   Mehta   and   Smt.   Rina 



S.   Mehta)   in   the   Mehta   family   comprising   four   brothers,   the 



wives of three brothers, their three HUFs, a partnership firm, 



three   brokerage   firms   in   the   family   and   15   corporate   entities 



promoted by them.   These persons were notified  on the basis 



of   information/complaint   received   from   the   Ministry   of 



Finance   in   which   the   Janakiraman   Committee   report   was 



cited and relied upon. 
</p>


<p id="p_12">e)    On   25.01.1994,   an   amendment   was   carried   out   in   the 



Act,   wherein,   <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_8">Section   9-A</a>   was   inserted   to   confer   civil 



jurisdiction   to   the   Special   Court.     Smt.   Rasila   S.   Mehta   and 



Smt.  Rina S. Mehta were active  investors  and had built up a 



portfolio   of   investments   which   has   appreciated   in   value   over 



the years, more particularly, during the last three years.  They 



own one each of the nine flats at Madhuli Cooperative Housing 



Society   Limited   which   are   merged/amalgamated   with   other 



flats   under   the   occupation   of   the   joint   family.     The   bank 



accounts   and   shareholdings   of   these   appellants   are   held

jointly   where   the   appellants   are   the   first   holders   and   their 



family members are joint/second holders.  Due to the fact that 



joint/second   holders   are   notified   entities,   the   assets   of   the 



appellants   have   been   treated   as   attached   on   and   from 



08.06.1992 and the same are being managed by the Custodian 



for the last 15 years.  On 21.07.2006, the Custodian preferred 



a common Misc. petition No. 20 of 2006 against Smt. Rasila S. 
</p>


<p id="p_13">Mehta and Smt. Rina S. Mehta seeking relief of a declaration 



that   the   said   appellants   are   benamis   and   fronts   of   late 



Harshad   S.   Mehta   and   other   notified   entities   and,   therefore, 



their assets should be utilized in discharge of their liabilities. 
</p>


<p id="p_14">The   appellants   also   filed   M.A.   No.   291/2006   on   11.09.2007 



seeking   relief   of   a   declaration   that   all   the   assets   belonged   to 



them and they were the first holders, namely, bank accounts 



and fixed deposits and the shareholdings may be declared as 



free from attachment.

<p id="p_15">f)    On   04.01.2007,   the   Custodian   issued   a   notification 



notifying both the appellants under <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_9">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act for 



which   a   public   notice   was   published   in   the   newspapers   on

No.  1 of 2007 and  on 18.06.2007,  Smt.  Rasila S. Mehta  filed 



Misc.   Petition   No.   2   of   2007   for   the   relief   of   de-notification 



under <a href="/doc/680734/" id="a_10">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act.  It transpired that the appellants 



were notified on the basis of the alleged complaint by Canbank 



Financial   Services   Ltd.   (in   short   "Canfina").     On   considering 



the   materials,   the   Special   Court,   by   impugned   order   dated

<p id="p_20">7)  Mr. Syed, learned counsel for the appellants after taking us 



through   the   relevant   provisions   of   the   Act,   Rules   and   the 



materials   available   with   the   Custodian   as   well   as   the 



reasonings   of   the   Special   Court   raised   the   following 



contentions:
</p>


<p id="p_21">(i)     The   impugned   notification   is   non-reasoned   and   non-
</p>


<p id="p_22">speaking.   The validity of a statutory order must be judged by 



a court of law by the reasons mentioned in the order itself and 



a   statutory   order   cannot   be   explained   and   supplemented   by 



fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise whereas in 



the present case the Special Court accepted the same which is 



contrary to settled law.
</p>


<p id="p_23">(ii)     Delay   of   15   years   in   passing   the   order   of   notification   is 



unreasonable.     The   explanation   offered   for   delay   is   also 



unacceptable.  
</p>


<p id="p_24">(iii)     Material   relied   upon   in   passing   the   order   of   notification 



i.e.   Canfina's   letter   dated   28.12.2006   is   not   supported   by   an 



affidavit   which   could   not   have   been   relied   upon   as   it   is 



contrary to proviso to Rule 2 of the Rules.
</p>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                                   9</span>


<p id="p_25">(iv)  Reliance on the reports of Joint Parliamentary Committee, 



Jankiraman   Committee,   IDG   and   Chartered   Accountants'   by 



the Custodian is unacceptable.
</p>


<p id="p_26">(v)  Pre-decisional hearing by the Custodian was required to be 



given   and   in   the   case   on   hand   such   opportunity   was   not 



afforded.  
</p>


<p id="p_27">(vi)  No effective post-decisional hearing as the materials relied 



upon was not supplied in time.
</p>


<p id="p_28">(vii)   The Special Court erroneously held the transaction to be 



benami   in   general   on   the   basis   of   Chartered   Accountants' 



reports without examining individual transactions.
</p>


<p id="p_29">(viii)     The   onus  to   establish   the   validity,   correctness,   legality, 



propriety   of   the   notification   order   is   on   the   Custodian   but 



wrongly shifted on the appellants.
</p>


<p id="p_30">(ix)     Satisfaction   of   Custodian   while   passing   an   order   of 



notification   should   be   objective   and   based   on   materials   as 



provided in the Rules.
</p>


<p id="p_31">(x)  The Special Court erroneously held that the meaning of the 



phrase   "involved   an   offence"   has   attained   finality   by   this 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                               10</span>


Court, though the said question was left open.   In any event, 



the case of the Custodian was that a sum of Rs. 50 crores was 



diverted   by   M/s   Harshad   S.   Mehta   to   the   appellants   during 



the   period   01.04.1990   to   06.06.1992.   In   such   event,   monies 



transferred/diverted from the banks/financial institutions can 



only be recovered from the appellants and nothing more.
</p>


<p id="p_32">(xi)     The   jurisdiction   of   the   Special   Court   is   limited   to   the 



statutory period only, i.e. 01.04.1991 to 06.06.1992. 
</p>


<p id="p_33">(xii)  No interest can be levied on the notified parties as per the 



judgment   of   this   Court   in  <a href="/doc/58677/" id="a_11">Harshad   Shantilal   Mehta  vs. 


Custodian and Ors</a>. (1998) 5 SCC 1.   
</p>


<p id="p_34">8)   On   the   other   hand,   Mr.   Subramonium   Prasad,   learned 



counsel for the Custodian heavily relying on the circumstances 



for passing the Act, the statement of Objects and Reasons and 



the relevant provisions submitted that:
</p>


<p id="p_35">(i)     The   impugned   order   of  the   Special   Court  is   valid   and  the 



appellants have not made out any case for interference by this 



Court.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                               11</span>


<p id="p_36">(ii)     As   per   <a href="/doc/680734/" id="a_12">Section   4(2)</a>   of   the   Act,   it   is   for   the   appellants   to 



show   to   the   Special   Court   that   they   are   not   involved   in   any 



offence in securities between 01.04.1991 to 06.06.1992.
</p>


<p id="p_37">(iii)     A   perusal   of   various   reports   like   the   Auditor's   report, 



Janakiraman   Committee's   report,   report   of   Inter   Disciplinary 



Group   (IDG),   report   of   Vinod   K.   Aggarwal   and   Company 



coupled   with   materials   placed   and   discussed,   the   impugned 



decision of the Special Court cannot be faulted with.
</p>


<p id="p_38">(iv)    From the materials placed, it is clear that the appellants 



are   nothing   but   front   benamidars   of   Harshad   S.   Mehta   and 



there   is   no   acceptable   material   to   show   that   the   appellants 



were   having   sufficient   funds   in   their   hands   due   to   the 



purchase   and   sale   of   shares   by   placing   acceptable   materials 



such   as   income-tax   returns   etc.     Inasmuch   as   the   Special 



Court is manned by or presided over by a sitting Judge of High 



Court,   sufficient   safeguards   are   provided   in   the   Act   and,   in 



any event, the appellants have no way prejudiced. 
</p>

enacted   to   meet   this   situation.     It   is   a   short   Act   containing 



only 15 sections. It deals with establishment of Courts, defines 



jurisdiction   and   powers   of   Special   Court.   It   also   defines   civil 



jurisdiction   of   such   Special   Courts.     Provision   of   arbitration 



was   reserved   and   appeal   could   also   be   preferred   under   the 



Act. Much protection was given for acts done in good faith and 



punishment   for   contempt   was   also   provided   so   that   the 



provisions of the Act would be more strictly implemented.

</blockquote><p id="p_44">12)  It is settled law that the objects and reasons of the Act are 



to be taken into consideration in interpreting the provisions of 



the   statute.     It   is   incumbent   on   the   court   to   strive   and 



interpret the statute as to protect and advance the object and 



purpose   of   the   enactment.              Any   narrow   or   technical 



interpretation   of   the   provisions   would   defeat   the   legislative 



policy.     The   Court   must,   therefore,   keep   the   legislative   policy 



in mind while applying the provisions of the Act to the facts of 



the case.  It is a cardinal principle of construction of statute or 



the   statutory   rule   that   efforts   should   be   made   in   construing 



the   different   provisions,   so   that   each   provision   may   have 



effective meaning and implementation and in the event of any 



conflict a harmonious construction should be given.  It is also 



settled law that literal meaning of the statute must be adhered 



to   when   there   is   no   absurdity   in   ascertaining   the   legislative 



intendment and for that purpose the broad features of the Act 



can   be   looked   into.     The   main   function   of   the   Court   is   to 



merely interpret the section and in doing so it cannot re-write

&amp; Anr</a>., 1992 (3) Bomb. C.R. 716.    It was argued before the

provisions are contrary to the principles of natural justice and 



be   struck   down.     The   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   in 



paragraph 8 of the said judgment observed as follows:

<p id="p_61">"Had the provision been confined to <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_61">Section 3</a>, sub-sections 

(2) and (3), the argument which is advanced before us would 

have   had   considerable   force.     It   is   undoubtedly   true   that 

neither in sub-Section (2) nor in (3) is there any provision for 

any hearing being given to the person who may be notified; 
</p>
<p id="p_62">nor   is   there   any   provision   for   any   reasoned   order   being 

passed by the Custodian at the time when he notifies such a 

person.     There   is,   however,   a   further   sub-Section,   namely, 

sub-Section (4) of <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_62">Section 3</a> which provides as follows:
</p>



<p id="p_63"><a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_63">Section   3</a>   (4)  :  The   property   attached  under   sub-Section  (3) 

shall be dealt with by the Custodian in such manner as the 

Special Court may direct.
</p>



<p id="p_64">This  sub-section  clearly   contemplates  that  the  power  of  the 

Custodian   to   deal   with   the   property   of   a   person   who   has 

been   notified   is   subject   to   the   orders   and   directions   of   the 

Special   Court.     Now,   in   the   first   place,   the   Special   Court 

under   the   Ordinance   is   a   Court   presided   over   by   a   sitting 

Judge   of   a   High   Court.     This   itself   is   a   check   on   any 

arbitrary exercise of powers by the Custodian.  Secondly, the 

power   of   the   Special   Court   to   give   directions   to   the 

Custodian   in   respect   of   any   attached   property   must 

necessarily   bring   within   its   ambit,   the   power   to   order   the 

release of such property or any part of its from attachment. 
</p>
<p id="p_65">If   the   person   who   is   aggrieved   by   his   name   being   notified 

under   sub-section   (2)   approaches   the   Special   Court   and 

makes   out,   for   example,   a   case   that   the   property   which   is 

attached or a portion of its has no nexus of any sort with the 

illegal dealings in securities belonging to banks and financial 

institutions during the relevant period and/or that there are 

no   claims   or   liabilities   which   have   to   be   satisfied   by 

attachment   and   sale   of   such   property,   in   our   view,   the 

Special Court would have the power to direct the custodian 

to release such property from attachment.  In the same way, 

if   ultimately,   the   Special   Court,   after   looking   at   all   the 

relevant   circumstances,   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   the 

entire   property   should   be   released   from   attachment,   we   do 

not see any reason why such a direction also cannot be given 

by   the   Special   Court   under   <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_64">Section   3</a>,   sub-section   (4).     In 

such   a   situation,   if   the   entire   property   is   required   to   be 

released   from   attachment,   the   Special   Court,   in   our   view, 

can  also  direct   the  Custodian  that   the   name  of  the   notified 

person   should   be   de-notified.     This   would   be   a   necessary

       directions   in   connection   with   the   property   which   the 

       Custodian seeks to attach.   If sub-section (4) is read in this 

       light, the grievance of the petitioner relating to the validity of

<p id="p_77">"19.   It   is   thus   that   the   said   Act   lays   down   a 

responsibility   on   the   Court   to   recover   the   properties. 
</p>
<p id="p_78">So   far   as   monies   are   concerned,   undoubtedly   the 

particular   coin   or   particular   currency   note   given   to   a 

debtor   would   no   longer   be   available.   That   however 

does not mean that the lender does not have any right 

to monies. What is payable is the loan i.e. the amount 

which has been lent. The right which the creditor has 

is not a `right to recover' the money. The creditor has 

the   title/right   in   the   money   itself.   An   equivalent 

amount   is   recoverable   by   him   and   the   title   in   any 

equivalent amount remains with  the lender. Thus the 

property which a notified party would have is not the 

right to recover but the `title in the money itself'. Thus 

under   <a href="/doc/1249080/" id="a_89">Section   3(3)</a>   what   would   stand   attached   would 

be   the   title/right   in   the   money   itself.   Of   course   what 

would   be   recoverable   would   be   an   equivalent   of   that 

money.   Once   the   money   stands   attached   then   no 

application   is   required   to   be   made   by   any   parties   for 

recovery of that money. It is then the duty of the court 

to recover the money. No period of limitation can apply 

to any act to be done by a court. Therefore in all such 

applications   the   only   question   which   remains   is 

whether on the date of the notification the right in the 

property   existed.   If   the   right   in   the   property   existed 

then   irrespective   of   the   fact   that   the   right   to   recover 

may be barred by limitation there would be a statutory 

attachment of that property. Once there is a statutory 

attachment of that property the court is duty-bound to 

recover   it   for   the   purposes   of   distribution.   There   can 

be   no   period   of   limitation   for   acts   which   a   court   is 

bound   to   perform.   In   this   case   since   the   court   is 

compulsorily bound to recover the money there can be 

no   limitation   to   such   recovery   proceedings.   To   be 

remembered   that   <a href="/doc/1249080/" id="a_90">Section   3(3)</a>   as   well   as   <a href="/doc/209430/" id="a_91">Section   13</a> 

provide   that   provisions   of   the   said   Act   would   prevail 

over any other law. This would include the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_92">Limitation

       mind of the Court is to see that the liabilities are discharged 

       and   not   beyond   the   same.    It   is   with   that   end   in  view   that

not provide for a pre-decisional hearing is not contrary to the

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">       "Rules   of   natural   justice   are   not   embodied   rules.   Being 

       means   to   an   end   and   not   an   end   in   themselves,   it   is   not 

       possible to make an exhaustive catalogue of such rules. But 

       there are two fundamental maxims of natural justice viz. (i) 

       audi alteram partem and (ii)  nemo judex in re sua. The  audi  

       alteram  partem  rule has many facets, two of them being (a) 

       notice of the case to be met; and (b) opportunity to explain. 

       This rule cannot be sacrificed at the altar of administrative 

       convenience   or   celerity.   The   general   principle--as 

       distinguished from an absolute rule of uniform application--

       seems to be that where a statute does not, in terms, exclude 

       this rule of prior hearing but contemplates a post-decisional 

       hearing  amounting  to  a  full review  of  the  original  order  on 

       merits,   then   such   a   statute   would   be   construed   as 

       excluding the audi alteram partem rule at the pre-decisional 

       stage.   Conversely  if   the   statute   conferring   the   power   is 

       silent   with   regard   to   the   giving   of   a   pre-decisional 

       hearing   to   the   person   affected   and   the   administrative 

       decision   taken   by   the   authority   involves   civil

       appeal   on   merits   against   that   decision   is   provided, 

       courts   will   be   extremely   reluctant   to   construe   such   a 

       statute   as   excluding   the   duty   of   affording   even   a 

       minimal   hearing,   shorn   of   all   its   formal   trappings   and 

       dilatory   features   at   the   pre-decisional   stage,   unless, 

       viewed   pragmatically,   it   would   paralyse   the 

       administrative process or frustrate the need for utmost 

       promptitude.  In   short,   this   rule   of   fair   play   must   not   be 

       jettisoned   save   in   very   exceptional   circumstances   where 

       compulsive   necessity   so   demands.   The   court   must   make 

       every   effort   to   salvage   this   cardinal   rule   to   the   maximum 

       extent possible, with situational modifications. But, the core 

       of   it   must,   however,   remain,   namely,   that   the   person 

       affected   must   have   reasonable   opportunity   of   being   heard 

       and   the   hearing   must   be   a   genuine   hearing   and   not   an

by   certain   financial   brokers   and   financial   institutions.   The 



Central   Government,   to   combat   with   the   situation, 



promulgated  an  ordinance  on  6.6.1992  known as the  Special 



Court (Trial of Offences relating to Transactions in Securities) 



Ordinance, 1992. On 08.06.1992 Mr. Harshad S. Mehta (since

Bank of India constituted the Janakiraman Committee to look 



into   the   diversion   of   funds.   The   Janakiraman   Committee   in 



March 1993 brought out the 4th Interim Report. Para 2.3 of the

that   the   shares   received   at   these   addresses   were   handed 

over mainly to one Shri Vinod Mehta, an uncle of HSM, who 

died in February, 1993.  Subsequent to his death, these were 

handed   over   to   his   wife,   Smt.   Vanita   Mehta   who   confirmed 

that her husband was receiving these shares, and that after 

his death she had, on instructions from HSM, handed them

process   involving   examination   and   correlation   of   every 

investment   transaction   of   the   brokers   and   banks.     The 

following were among the more important constraints:
</p>
<p id="p_93">-      Entries in the books of one counterparty bank did not 

       correspond with that of the other counterparty.

<p id="p_100">33)    Mr.   Syed   heavily   contended   that   the   Custodian   and   the 



Special   Court   ought   not   to   have   based   reliance   on   these 



reports   since   the   appellants   were   not   afforded   opportunity   to 



go through the contents of the same.  This objection is liable to 



be   rejected.     First   of   all,   there   is   no   criminal   prosecution 



against   these   appellants   and   in   the   event   of   prosecution,   all 



documents relied on by them could be furnished.  These are all 



materials from various bodies constituted by the Reserve Bank 



of   India/Government   of   India   about   the   scam   created   at   the 



instance of Harshad Mehta.  These bodies consist of experts in 



various fields, particularly, from the financial side.  The Special 



Court is fully justified in relying on these Reports.

Allan   John   Waters   &amp;   Ors.,   JT   2011(3)   SC   750,   while 


considering   the   plight   of   street   children   in   Bombay,   heavily 



relied on the evidence of PW-2 &amp; PW-3, who were the members 



of   NGOs,   who   highlighted   the   plight   of   street   children   in   a 



shelter home at Bombay.   Similar objection was raised in that

on   the   statements   of   PWs   2   &amp;   3,   members   of   NGOs   the 



accused  persons   cannot   be   convicted   but   taking   into  account 



their   initiation,   work   done,   interview   with   the   children, 



interaction   with   the   children   at   the   shelter   homes   which   laid 



the   foundation   for   the   investigation   and   to   that   extent   their 



statements   and   actions   are   reliable   and   acceptable.     By 



applying   the   same   analogy,   inasmuch   as   the   scam   relates   to 



accounts and money transactions by way of transfer of shares 



through nationalized banks and financial institutions, various 



committees   were   appointed   by   the   Union   of   India   which 



collected   relevant   materials   and   unearthed   the   persons 



involved,   hence   the   Custodian   and   the   Special   Court   are 



justified   in   relying   on   those   reports   in   order   to   ascertain   the 



correctness   or  otherwise   of   the   transactions.     Accordingly,   we 



reject the objection of the counsel for the appellants relating to 



the report of various Committees mentioned above.

interest to the lender.  I state that the same is computed on

transactions remaining unascertained we have not been able

       permanency   in   view   of   the   daily   operations   in   the   Money 

       Market and result in a pool of funds float.  This float of funds

       my family members.  I take justifiable pride in asserting that 

       it is the combination of the efforts of all the members of my 

       family   that   has   been   responsible   for   our   expansion   and 

       growth   in   terms   of   volume   since   1988.     Each   and   every 

       member  of  the family is taking charge of some or  the other 

       vital   functions   in   the   organization   creating   controls   and 

       checks   which   are   so   very   essential   for   generating, 

       maintaining and reaping the fruits  of any business activity. 

       Almost   all   of   them   are   very   well   attained   and   qualified   and 

       do   business   in   their   individual   capacities   and   possess   a 

       sound and thorough knowledge of Investments, Finance and

       Ours   is   an   investor   family   committed   to   growth   through 

       capital appreciation and holds a mix of both short term and 

       long term portfolio of shares.  In brief, we owe our success to 

       our   coordinated   endeavours   and   investment   philosophy. 

       The sharp growth in income in the last two years from 1988 

       is only after entering the Money Market. .... ......

       factors   that   has   contributed   to  the   growth   of   our   business. 

       Our   business   is   such   that   it   requires   very   close   control   at 

       the   operational   level.     The   different   members   of   the   family

      12.1 HSM diverted his funds  to his family members as and 

      when   he   received   funds   generated   form   PSU   banks   and 

      financial   institutions.   We   have   drawn   a   statement   of   funds 

      diverted   to  family   members   and  his   associate   companies   in 

      Annexure No. 7. We have also checked these figures from the 

      audited   reports   of   his   family   members   and   associate 

      companies   and   comparative   chart   is   enclosed   in   Annexure

      12.2   Further   we   studied   the   end   use   of   funds   diverted   to 

      family members and associate companies of HSM group and 

      found that either funds were used for purchase of immovable 

      properties or for purchase of shares and securities. HSM has 

      not   charged   interest   from   his   family   members   and   his 

      associate   companies.   The   details   of   end   use   (broadly)   by

      12.3 It is a case of one man show i.e. Mr. H.S. Mehta,  who 

      generated   funds   from   PSU   banks   and   financial   institutions 

      and diverted funds to his group entities. There is no ban on 

      payment/receipt   of   funds   from   one   family   member   to 

      another member of the family. But then all prudential norms 

      should   have   been   followed.   In   this   case   no   interest   was 

      charged/paid and there are huge differences in the balances 

      of both the books.

</blockquote><p id="p_124">12.4   The   concept   of   corporate   entity   was   evolved   to 

encourage   and   promote   trade   and   commerce   but   not   to 

commit   illegalities   or   to   defraud   people   where   therefore   the 

corporate   character   is   employed   for   the   purpose   of 

committing   illegality   or   for   defrauding   other   the   corporate 

character   should   be   ignored   and   will   look   at   the   reality 

behind the corporate veil.
</p>


<p id="p_125">12.5  We  have  found  that  these  corporate  bodies  are merely 

cloaks   behind   which   lurks   HSM   and/or   member   of   his 

family   are   involved   and   the   device   of   incorporation     was 

really   a   ploy   adopted   for   committing   illegalities   and/or   to 

defraud   revenue   and   other   people.   Finally   to   get   protection 

by law, in case HSM gets exposed the property belonging to 

his family members may be protected.

<p id="p_126">12.6   Further   we   have   studied   the   accounts   of   Smt.   Rasila 

Mehta and Reena Mehta who is not notified parties and their 

accounts   were   not   subject   to   audit.   The   total   balances

         We are enclosing the copies of accounts of Smt. Rasila 

Mehta   and   Reena   Mehta   appearing   in   the   books   of   M/s 

HSM. From the accounts we observed that M/s HSM paid a 

sum   of   Rs.   30   Lacs   on   16th  April   1990   and   a   sum   of   Rs.

dates   when   other   members   of   the   family   purchased   flat   in 

`Madhuli'. Therefore in our opinion these funds were diverted 

by M/s HSM to Smt. Rasila Mehta (mother) for purchase of 

flat   in   `Madhuli'.   Further   we   have   also   observed   that   M/s 

HSM   debited   the   account   of   Smt.   Rasila   on   account   of 

purchases of shares in different companies. Similarly in case 

of Smt. Reena Mehta huge quantity of share were purchased 

by her, which were funded by M/s HSM. Copy of accounts of 

Mrs   Rasila   &amp;   Mrs   Reena   Mehta   is   enclosed   in   annexure

12.7   The   above   funds   diverted   by   HSM   to   his   family 

members   were   certainly   for   purchase   of   immovable 

properties   and   shares.   Therefore   all   assets   so   called 

belonging to above persons should go back to HSM only."

</pre><p id="p_134">After   perusing   the   Report   of   M/s   Vyas   &amp;   Vyas,   the   Special 



Court came to a conclusion that the appellants are only fronts 



of   late   Harshad   S.   Mehta.     It   further   concluded   that   the 



appellants   are   only   housewives   and   were   given   loan   by   the 



brokerage   firms   for   purchase   of   shares.     The   Special   Court, 



therefore, rightly held that the money and assets were diverted 



to   the   appellants   by   the   brokerage   firms   who   were   notified 



parties.  Mr. Syed objected to the order of the Special Court for 



fully relying on the Auditor's report.  We reject his objection for 



the   following   reasons.     First   of   all,   the   issue   relates   to 



accounting   of   several   persons.     Several   volumes   of   accounts 



relating   to   various   members   of   late   Harshad   Mehta's   family 



have to be scrutinized.  The Court and members of the bar are 



not   conversant   with   the   accounting   procedures   and   in   such 



event   assistance   from   an   established   Chartered   Accountant 



Firm is needed.   In fact, even during the course of arguments 



in respect of questions by the Court, Mr. Syed himself sought 



the   assistance   of   persons   who   are   conversant   with 



accountancy.     In   view   of   complicity   in   the   matter,   there   is 



nothing wrong on the part of the Special Court getting report 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                            55</span>


from   M/s   Vyas   and   Vyas   who   are   recognized   Chartered 



Accountants.     The   order   of   the   Special   Court   does   not   suffer 



from any infirmity and there was sufficient material before the 



Custodian   to   arrive   at   a   satisfaction   that   monies   had   been 



diverted by late Harshad S. Mehta to the appellants.
</p>


<p id="p_135">47)  Whether the appellants being not involved in offences 


in   transactions   in   securities   could   have   been   proceeded 


against in terms of the provisions of the Act? 
</p>

<p id="p_136">      The contention of the appellants that since they have not 



been   charged   for   any   offence,   they   cannot   be   notified   under 



the   Act.  According   to   the   appellants,   the   phrase   "involved   in 



the   offence"   could   only   mean   "accused   of   the   offence"   and 



since   they   are   not   charged   with   any   offence   they   can   not   be 



notified.   In   construing   the   above   mentioned   words   which   are 



used   in   association   with   each   other,   the   rule   of   construction 



noscitur   a   sociis  may   be   applied.     It   is   a   legitimate   rule   of 



construction   to   construe   words   in   an   Act   of   Parliament   with 



reference to words found in immediate connection with them. 
</p>


<p id="p_137">The   actual   order   of   these   three   words   in   juxtaposition 



indicates that meaning of one takes colour from the other. The 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                                56</span>


rule   is   explained   differently:   'that   meaning   of   doubtful   words 



may   be   ascertained   by   reference   to   the   meaning   of   words 



associated   with   it.   (vide  <a href="/doc/494100/" id="a_106">Ahmedabad   Teachers'   Association  


vs. Administrative Officer</a>, AIR 2004 SC 1426). 
</p>

<p id="p_138">48)    Therefore, in the present case the nature of  "offence",  in 



which the appellants are allegedly involved, is to be taken into 



consideration. <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_107">The Act</a> does not create an offence for which a 



particular person has to be charged or held guilty.   Thus the 



phrase   "involved   in   the   offence"   would   not   mean   "accused   of 



the offence".  Also, the  appellants  could have been reasonably 



suspected   to   have   been   involved   in   the   offence   after 



consideration   of   the   various   reports   of   the   Janakiraman 



Committee,   Joint   Parliamentary   Committee   and   the   Inter 



Disciplinary Group (IDG); and also the fact that 28 members of 



the   M/s   Harshad   S.   Mehta   group   including   his   family 



members/entities   were   notified   under   the   <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_108">Special   Act</a> 



Ordinance   itself.   The   above   factual   matrix   was   sufficient   for 



the satisfaction of the Custodian to notify the Appellants.   The 



object of the Act is not merely to bring the offender to book but 



also to recover what are ultimately public funds.  Even if there 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                            57</span>


is a nexus between a third party, an offender and/or property 



the   third   party   can   also   be   notified.     The   word   "involved"   in 



<a href="/doc/558490/" id="a_109">Section   3(2)</a>   of  the   Special   Court  Act  has  to be  interpreted   in 



such a manner so as to achieve the purpose of the Act.   This 



Court   in  <a href="/doc/808484/" id="a_110">Ashwin   S.   Mehta  vs.  Custodian   &amp;   Ors</a>.,  (2006)   2 



SCC 386 has observed as under:
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_68">       "Although, we do not intend to enter into the correctness or 

       otherwise   of   the   said   contention   of   the   appellants   at   this 

       stage,  however,   there   cannot  be   any   doubt  whatsoever  that 

       they   being   notified   persons,   all   their   properties   would   be 

       deemed   to   be   automatically   attached   as   a   consequence 

       thereto.  For the said purpose, it is not necessary that they 

       should be accused of commission of an offence as such."

10 SCC 564, this Court from para 33 to 38 has held that the 



<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_112">Special Court Act</a> is a special statute and is a complete code in 



itself.  The purpose and object for which it was created was to 



punish the persons who were involved  in the  act for criminal 



misconduct   in   respect   of   defrauding   banks   and   financial 



institutions   and   its   object   was   to   see   that   the   properties   of 



those   who   were   involved   shall   be   appropriated   for   the 



discharge   of   liabilities   of   not   only   banks   and   financial 



institutions   but   also   other   governmental   agencies.                              In

construing   the   statute   of   this   nature   the   court   should   not 



always   adhere   to   a   literal   meaning   but   should   construe   the 



same,   keeping   in   view   in   the   larger   public   interest.     For   the 



said   purpose,   the   court   may   also   take   recourse   to   the   basic 



rules   of   interpretation,   namely,  ut   res   magis   valeat   quam  



pereat  to   see   that   a   machinery   must   be   so   construed   as   to 



effectuate the liability imposed by the charging section and to 



make   the   machinery   workable.     The   statutes   must   be 



construed  in  a   manner   which   will   suppress   the   mischief   and 



advance   the   object   the   legislature   had   in   view.     A   narrow 



construction   which   tends   to   stultify   the   law   must   not   be 



taken.     Contextual   reading   is   a   well-known   proposition   of 



interpretation   of   statute.     The   clauses   of   a   statute   should   be 



construed   with   reference   to   the   context   vis-`-vis   the   other 



provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole 



statute   relating   to   the   subject-matter.     Furthermore,   even   in 



relation   to   a   penal   statute   any   narrow   and   pedantic,   literal 



and   lexical   construction   may   not   always   be   given   effect   to. 
</p>


<p id="p_140">The   law   would   have   to   be   interpreted   having   regard   to   the 



subject-matter of the offence and the object of the law it seeks 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                               59</span>


to achieve.  The purpose of the law is not to allow the offender 



to   sneak   out   the   meshes   of   law.     The   courts   will   reject   the 



construction   which   will   defeat   the   plain   intention   of   the 



legislature even though there may be some inexactitude in the 



language   used.     Reducing   the   legislation   futility   shall   be 



avoided   and   in   a   case   where   the   intention   of   the   legislature 



cannot   be   given   effect   to,   the   courts  would   accept   the   bolder 



construction   for   the   purpose   of   bringing   about   an   effective 



result.   The   courts,   when   rule   of   purposive   construction   is 



gaining   momentum,   should   be   very   reluctant   to   hold   that 



Parliament has achieved nothing by the language it used when 



it is tolerably plain what it seeks to achieve.

<p id="p_142">       The complaint has been received from Canfina which is a 



100%   subsidiary   of   Canara   Bank,     a   nationalized   bank.   The

of various banks and financial institutions whose monies were 



siphoned   out.   Thus   the   Statement   of   Objects   and   Reasons 



makes it clear that the purpose and the object of the Act was 



to   recover   and   return   monies   to   those   banks   and   financial 



institutions   from   whom   the   monies   were   siphoned   out.   It   is 



thus   clear   that   the   bodies   which   were   sought   to   be   covered 



were   the   banks   and   financial   institutions   whose   affairs   were 



investigated   into   by   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India.     The 



investigation   was   conducted   by   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India 



through   Janakiraman   Committee;   the   Joint   Parliamentary 



Committee,   and   the   Inter   Disciplinary   Group.   The   affairs   of 



Canfina were also investigated by the various committees as a 



financial institution. It has come to light that there were large 



scale siphoning out of monies from Canfina also as held by the 



Special   Court   in   its   order   dated   25.06.1997   in   the   matter   of

strict definition of the term but involved in the securities scam

information or complaint, or is vague or does not contain the 



name and address of the sender. This rule also does not make 



it mandatory on the Custodian to reject a complaint if it does 



not   accompany   the   above   details.   If   the   material   information 



or   the   documents   received  by   the   Custodian   are   sufficient   in 



his   opinion,   to   reveal   that   a   person   is   involved   in   an   offence 



referred   to   in   sub-section   (2)   of   <a href="/doc/1249080/" id="a_121">section   3</a>   of   the   Act,   he   may

Court.

<p id="p_152">55)    In view of the same, we are in entire agreement with the 



conclusion   arrived   at   by   the   Special   Court   and   unable   to

      With regard to the above appeals filed against the orders 



of the Special Court approving their report of the Custodian for 



realization of certain amounts  payable  to the Society towards 



repairs   and   maintenance   charges,   interest   and   penalty   for 



belated   payment,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   again 



raised   various   objections,   inasmuch   as   the   claim   of   the 



Custodian depends upon the outcome of the other appeals i.e. 



Civil Appeal Nos. 2924 of 2008 and 2915 of 2008 and in view 



of our conclusion on these  appeals, we are not inclined to go 



into   all   those   details   once   again.     Since   we   agree   with   the 



claim   of   the   Custodian   and   various   steps   taken   by   him   and 



the   ultimate   order   of   the   Special   Court   in   the   normal 



circumstance,   present   appeals   are   also   to   be   dismissed.     We 



have   already   noted   that   Smt.   Jyoti   H.   Mehta   and   six   other 



family members of late  Harshad S. Mehta were notified under 



the   Act.     Upon   enforcement   of   the   aforesaid   Act,   all   the 



properties of late Harshad S. Mehta and his family members, 



including the six appellants in Civil Appeal No. 3377 of 2009

Cooperative Housing Society Limited at Dr. Anne Besant Road, 



Worli, Mumbai continue to remain attached under the Act by 



the Custodian.  Since the aforesaid eight residential properties 



remain   attached   with   the   Custodian   their   upkeep/repair   is 



essential   so   that   the   market   value   of   the   said   attached 



properties   does   not   get   depreciated   and   that   they   may   fetch 



best market value as and when the same are permitted to be 



sold   by   the   Special   Court   so   as   to   pay   the   liabilities   of   the

attached account of the notified parties.  Regarding payment of 



maintenance   and   repair   charges,   there   cannot   be   any   doubt 



that   the   Custodian   is   liable   to   pay   the   same   to   the   society.

<p id="p_158">60)    In   the   same   way,   in   Civil   Appeal   No.   4764   of   2010,   the

owner   of   the   attached   property   failed   to   pay   to   the   Madhuli

Custodian and on the orders of the Special Court. 
</p>


<p id="p_160">62)    It is also brought to our notice that during the course of 



hearing,   either   before   the   Special   Court   or   in   this   Court, 



certain   amounts   have   been   paid/deposited   by   the   appellant. 
</p>


<p id="p_161">Considering   the   fact   that   the   appellants   are   agitating   the 



matter   at   the   hands   of   the   Custodian,   the   Special   Court   and 



before   this   Court,   we   feel   that   the   appellants   need   not   be 



burdened with interest and penal charges for non-payment of 



maintenance   and   repair   charges   to   the   society.     Accordingly, 



while   sustaining   the   claim   of   the   Custodian   as   approved   by 



the Special Court in view of the reasons mentioned above, we 



clarify   that   the   Custodian   is   not   permitted   to   collect   interest 



and   penalty   charges   from   the   arrears   of   maintenance   and 



repair charges.  This position is also clear from the decision of 



this   Court   in  <a href="/doc/58677/" id="a_123">Harshad   Shantilal   Mehta  vs.  Custodian   &amp;  


Ors</a>,   (1998)   5   SCC   1.     The   Custodian   is   free   to   adjust   the

Court   or   the   Special   Court.     With   the   above   direction,   the 



impugned order in both the appeals is modified to the limited 



extent. 
</p>


<p id="p_162">63)    In   the   light   of   the   above   discussion,   we   do  not  find   any 



merit in Civil Appeal Nos. 2924 of 2008 and 2915 of 2008 and 



accordingly   they   are   dismissed.     Civil   Appeal   Nos.   3377   of 



2009   and  4764   of  2010   are   disposed   of  granting   the   relief   to
