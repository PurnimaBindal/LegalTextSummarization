deceased was 18 years old when she got married to the respondent No.

1998. Before her marriage, Geeta Bai along with her mother, Kamla Bai

and her brother used to reside with her maternal uncle, Bansi Lal [PW-

1]. In less than four years of her marriage, Geeta Bai committed suicide

at her matrimonial home by pouring kerosene oil and setting herself on

fire. She was admitted in a burnt condition in the Community Health

Centre, Baroda on 20th April, 2002 and breathed her last on the same

day.        At that time, she was five months pregnant.            On receiving

information from the attending doctor, an FIR was lodged on 23 rd April,

2002 [Exhibit P-13].              On completion of the investigation, the charge-

Jitender [A-4] – brother-in-law of the deceased, but convicted both the

respondents[A-1 and A-2] [husband and father-in-law of the deceased]

under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_6">Sections 304-B</a>, <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_7">306</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">498-A</a> IPC and imposed a sentence of

rigorous imprisonment3 for life for the first offence, RI for a period of

seven years with fine for the second offence and RI for three years with

fine for the third offence. The conviction and sentence imposed on the

respondents was primarily based on the evidence of Bansi Lal [P.W.-1],

Shyam Bihari [P.W.-2] and Amrit Lal [P.W.-4], maternal uncles of the

deceased who stated that the respondents had been demanding money

from the deceased for constructing a house which her family members

were unable to give. As a result, she was constantly harassed and

subjected to cruelty, finally leading to her committing suicide.   Dr. V.K.

Garg [P.W.-8], who had conducted the post-mortem examination [Ex. P-

7] on the dead body of the deceased, had deposed that on examining

the uterus, there was a foetus of five months in a dead condition and, in

his opinion, the death of Geeta Bai had taken place due to burning.

aside the order of conviction in respect of the respondent No.1 [A-1]

respondent No.1 was sustained under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_11">Section 498-A</a> IPC, but the

sentence of RI for three years imposed on him was reduced to the period

already undergone by him. For arriving at such a conclusion, the High

Court was persuaded by the rulings in <a href="/doc/1250057/" id="a_12">K. Prema S. Rao and Another v.

Yadla Srinivasa Rao</a> and <a href="/doc/63843/" id="a_13">Others4, Saro Rana and Others v. State of

Jharkhand5</a> and <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_14">Appasaheb and Another v. State of Maharashtra</a> 6

and held that the demand of money for construction of a house cannot

be treated as a demand for dowry. The High Court agreed with the

submission made by the learned counsel for A-1 and A-2, respondents

herein that the offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_15">Section 304-B</a> was not established against

them as the demand allegedly made on the deceased was for money to

construct a house, which cannot be treated as a dowry demand for

connecting her death to the said cause. The respondents were also

acquitted for the offence under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_16">Section 306</a> IPC as the High Court was of

the opinion that, from a scrutiny of the depositions of P.W.-1, P.W.-2,

P.W.-4 and P.W.-6, there was nothing to sustain the conclusion that the

respondents had abetted the deceased to commit suicide. As for the

offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_17">Section 498-A</a> relating to cruelty meted out to the

deceased, the High Court acquitted the respondent No. 2, while

maintaining the conviction order in respect of the respondent No. 1.

State of Madhya Pradesh.

</p><p id="p_12">5.        Mr. Prashant Singh, learned Advocate General for the appellant-

State has assailed the impugned judgment and contended that the High

Court has failed to appreciate the harassment caused to the deceased

at the hands of the respondents who had been constantly demanding

money from her to construct a house and purchase a plot of land; that

the High Court did not consider the testimonies of Bansi Lal [P.W.-1],

Shyam Bihari [P.W.-2], Amrit Lal [P.W.-4] and Rajesh Bhai [P.W.-6], who

had unanimously stated that whenever the deceased used to visit her

parental home, she would complain that she was being subjected to

assault by the respondents for bringing a sum of ₹50,000/- [Rupees Fifty

thousand] for constructing a house and that it was due to this

harassment caused by them that the deceased got fed up and was

forced to commit suicide. Learned counsel argued that contribution of

money to construct a house, as demanded by the respondents from the

deceased ought to be treated as a dowry demand and it is quite

apparently a case where the offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_18">Section 304-B</a> was made

out. It was also submitted that this was a clear-cut case of abetment to

commit suicide and both the respondents had rightly been convicted for

                    thousand for construction of house. So they had used to beat

                    they did not agree. Gitabai had also discussed about demand
                    of rupees fifty thousand with my sister and wife.

                    thousand thereafter Gitabai was beaten consequently her finger
                    was also fractured. Her husband has committed beating.
                    Badriprasad had also expelled to Gitabai and Jogendra from
                    the house. After ouster from the house, Gitabai and Jogendra
                    had lived near the father of Badriprasad in Khanpur. Then both
                    of them had come to Kota from there. They had lived in Kota
                    for 7-8 months. After spending of money in Kota, both of them
                    arrived near my sister Kamlabai in Takarbada. Both of them
                    had stayed in Takarbada for 1-2 days. Jogendra demanded
                    rupees twenty thousand from my sister in Takarbada. My sister
                    had told me about it. Rupees twenty thousand was demanded

                    was used to demand as dowry. I had not given rupees. Then
                    due to not giving of money, threatening to my niece Gitabai, he

examination are also extracted below:

                    in-laws house and she had stayed for 6-7 months and when
                    we had used to go to take her then in-laws of Gitabai had not
                    used to send her. Witness himself said that their harassment
                    process had started during this time. My younger brother
                    had gone to take her for 6-7 times in this period. I had used
                    to live in Kota. After this when my mother had died then
                    Gitabai had come and she had also come for one more
                    programme. When Gitabai had gone to in-laws house after
                    6 months then after that I had met with her at the time of
                    death of my mother. When my mother had died then Gitabai
                    had come then she had stayed with my brother for 6 months.
                    When my mother had died then Jogendra had come with
                    Gitabai on third day and he had also caused beating before
                    us. He had not got tea so Jogendra had caused beating.
                    When Gitabai lived with brothers for 6 months then I had
                    gone there for many times during that period. Accused and
                    Sushilabai and Badri had also come there at the time of
                    death of my mother. I had stayed in the village for 12 days.
                    It is incorrect to say when Gitabai had stayed in Takarwada
                    at the time of death of mother then she had not made any
                    complaint of in-laws there. This fact is correct that first of all
                    Gitabai had complained at the time of death of mother.

</p><p id="p_22">8.        It is clear that during his extensive cross-examination, P.W.-1 firmly

stuck to his statements that the harassment of his niece, Geeta Bai had

started within six months of her wedding with the respondent No.1 who

had asked her to fetch a sum of ₹20,000/-[Rupees Twenty thousand]

from her mother and P.W.-1 for construction of a house.                       The said

demand was also made by the respondent No.1 on P.W.-1 directly.

P.W.-1 stated that the deceased had also informed him that her father-in-

law, respondent No.2 had raised a demand of ₹50,000/- [Rupees Fifty

thousand] on her for construction of a house, which she was asked to

convey to him.                    The said witness was consistent in his deposition that

he used to give money to his deceased niece and her husband –

respondent No. 1 towards expenses and that both of them had

demanded a sum of ₹50,000/-[Rupees Fifty thousand] for construction

of a house, which he had declined to give. Pertinently, Shyam Bihari

[P.W.-2] and Amrit Lal [P.W.-4], both maternal uncles of the deceased,

had the same version to narrate as P.W.-1.                       Thus, the prosecution

version was that the respondents used to harass the deceased and that

the respondent No. 1 had demanded a sum of ₹20,000/-[Rupees Twenty

thousand], whereas the respondent No. 2 had demanded ₹50,000/-

[Rupees Fifty thousand] from the deceased for constructing a house and

for buying a plot of land. Fed up with the constant dowry demands made

                             width and would, therefore, include within it
                             property and valuable security of any kind

                             property or security is, therefore, not necessary.
                        (3) Such property or security can be given or agreed to
                             be given either directly or indirectly.

</p><p id="p_34">12.       In the light of the above provision that defines the word “dowry” and

takes in its ambit any kind of property or valuable security, in our opinion,

the High Court fell into an error by holding that the demand of money for

construction of a house cannot be treated as a dowry demand.                In

Appasaheb’s case [supra] referred to in the impugned judgment, this

Court had held that a demand for money from the parents of the

deceased woman to purchase manure would not fall within the purview

of “dowry”, thereby strictly interpreting the definition of dowry. This view

has, however, not been subscribed to in Rajinder Singh’s case [supra]

wherein it has been held that the said decision as also the one in the

case of Vipin Jaiswal[a-1] v. State of Andhra Pradesh represented by

Public Prosecutor10, do not state the law correctly.          Noting that the

aforesaid decisions were distinct from four other decisions of this Court,

viz., <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_28">Bachni Devi and Another v. State of Haryana</a> 11, <a href="/doc/640713/" id="a_29">Kulwant Singh

that keeping in mind the fact that <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_32">Section 304-B</a> was inserted in the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a>

proportions, it cannot be argued that in case of an ambiguity in the

language used in the provision, the same ought to be construed strictly

as that would amount to defeating the very object of the provision. In

other words, the Court leaned in favour of assigning an expansive

meaning to the expression “dowry” and held thus :-

promote the object sought to be achieved through the legislation meant

any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a

valuable security of any nature. When dealing with cases under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_37">Section

304-B</a> IPC, a provision legislated to act as a deterrent in the society and

curb the heinous crime of dowry demands, the shift in the approach of

the courts ought to be from strict to liberal, from constricted to dilated.

Any rigid meaning would tend to bring to naught, the real object of the

provision.            Therefore, a push in the right direction is required to

accomplish the task of eradicating this evil which has become deeply

entrenched in our society.

Court has correctly interpreted the demand for money raised by the

respondents on the deceased for construction of a house as falling within

the definition of the word “dowry”. The submission made by learned

counsel for the respondents that the deceased was also a party to such

a demand as she had on her own asked her mother and maternal uncle

to contribute to the construction of the house, must be understood in the

correct perspective.              It cannot be lost sight of that the respondents had

been constantly tormenting the deceased and asking her to approach

her family members for money to build a house and it was only on their

persistence and insistence that she was compelled to ask them to

contribute some amount for constructing a house. The Court must be

sensitive to the social milieu from which the parties hail. The fact that the

marriage of the deceased and the respondent No.1 was conducted in a

community marriage organization where some couples would have tied

the knot goes to show that the parties were financially not so well off.

This position is also borne out from the deposition of P.W.-1 who had

stated that he used to bear the expenses of the couple. Before the

marriage of the deceased also, P.W.-1 had stated that he used to bear

her expenses and that of her mother and brother [his sister and nephew]

as her father had abandoned them. In this background, the High Court

fell in an error in drawing an inference that since the deceased had

herself joined her husband and father-in-law, respondents herein and

asked her mother or uncle to contribute money to construct a house,

such demand cannot be treated as a “dowry demand”. On the contrary,

the evidence brought on record shows that the deceased was

pressurized to make such a request for money to her mother and uncle.

It was not a case of complicity but a case of sheer helplessness faced by

the deceased in such adverse circumstances.

<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">15.       Now, coming to the second point urged by learned counsel for the

State that the High Court has overlooked the fact that Geeta Bai had

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012




counsel for the respondents, we may note that the meaning of the

expression “soon before her death” has been discussed threadbare in

several judgments.                In Surinder Singh (supra), while relying on the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_38">Section 113-B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 15 and

<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_39">Section 304-B</a> IPC, where the words “soon before her death” find

mention, the following pertinent observations have been made: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                    “17. Thus, the words “soon before” appear in <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_40">Section
                    113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and also in <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_41">Section 304-</a>
                    B IPC. For the presumptions contemplated under these
                    sections to spring into action, it is necessary to show
                    that the cruelty or harassment was caused soon before
                    the death. The interpretation of the words “soon before”
                    is, therefore, important. The question is how “soon
                    before”? This would obviously depend on the facts and
                    circumstances of each case. The cruelty or harassment
                    differs from case to case. It relates to the mindset of people
                    which varies from person to person. Cruelty can be mental or
                    it can be physical. Mental cruelty is also of different shades.
                    It can be verbal or emotional like insulting or ridiculing or
                    humiliating a woman. It can be giving threats of injury to her
                    or her near and dear ones. It can be depriving her of
                    economic resources or essential amenities of life. It can be
                    putting restraints on her movements. It can be not allowing
                    her to talk to the outside world. The list is illustrative and not
                    exhaustive. Physical cruelty could be actual beating or
                    causing pain and harm to the person of a woman. Every
                    such instance of cruelty and related harassment has a
                    different impact on the mind of a woman. Some instances
                    may be so grave as to have a lasting impact on a woman.
                    Some instances which degrade her dignity may remain
                    etched in her memory for a long time. Therefore, “soon
                    before” is a relative term. In matters of emotions we
                    cannot have fixed formulae. The time-lag may differ from
                    case to case. This must be kept in mind while examining
                    each case of dowry death.

                         fixing any time-limit. This expression is
                         pregnant with the idea of proximity test. The
                         term ‘soon before’ is not synonymous with
                         the term ‘immediately before’ and is opposite
                         of the expression ‘soon after’ as used and

                         contemplates the reasonable time which, as
                         earlier noticed, has to be understood and
                         determined under the peculiar circumstances of
                         each case. In relation to dowry deaths, the
                         circumstances showing the existence of
                         cruelty or harassment to the deceased are not
                         restricted to a particular instance but
                         normally refer to a course of conduct. Such
                         conduct may be spread over a period of time.

                         deemed to be ‘soon before death’ if any other

                         date of death. It does not, however, mean that
                         such time can be stretched to any period.
</p><p id="p_44">                         Proximate and live link between the effect of

                         consequential death is required to be proved by
                         the prosecution. The demand of dowry, cruelty or
                         harassment based upon such demand and the
                         date of death should not be too remote in time
                         which, under the circumstances, be treated as
                         having become stale enough.”
                    Thus, there must be a nexus between the demand of
                    dowry, cruelty or harassment, based upon such demand
                    and the date of death. The test of proximity will have to
                    be applied. But, it is not a rigid test. It depends on the
                    facts and circumstances of each case and calls for a

<a href="/doc/36736141/" id="a_48">Sher Singh @ Partapa v. State of Haryana</a> 18, it has been emphasized

that “soon before” is not synonymous to “immediately before” and the

following observations have been made: -

                        What must be borne in mind is that the word “soon”
                        does not mean “immediate”. A fair and pragmatic
                        construction keeping in mind the great social evil that has
                        led to the enactment of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_49">Section 304-B</a> would make it clear

                        that the demand for dowry should not be stale but
                        should be the continuing cause for the death of the

a three Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/166116150/" id="a_51">Gurmeet Singh v. State of

                    The prosecution must establish existence of “proximate and
                    live link” between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment
                    for dowry demand by the husband or his relatives.
                    38.4. <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_60">Section 304-B</a> IPC does not take a pigeonhole
                    approach in categorising death as homicidal or suicidal or
                    accidental. The reason for such non-categorisation is due to
                    the fact that death occurring “otherwise than under normal
                    circumstances” can, in cases, be homicidal or suicidal or
                    accidental.”

</p><p id="p_49">18.       In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the marriage between

the deceased and the respondent No. 1 – accused had taken place on

7th May, 1998 and the deceased was brought in a severely burnt

condition from her matrimonial home to the Health Care Centre at

Baroda on 20th April, 2002 and she had expired on the very same day. It

is also not in dispute that the death had occurred on account of the

deceased dowsing kerosene oil and setting herself on fire.                         The

evidence brought on record amply demonstrates that the harassment of

the deceased for money had commenced within a few months of her

marriage and had continued thereafter on several occasions. This fact is

borne out from the deposition of PW-1, which shows that on not being

able to fulfil the demand for ₹50,000/- [Rupees Fifty thousand] made by

the respondent No. 2 [father-in-law], he had thrown out the deceased

and the respondent No.1 from the matrimonial home. They had then

shifted to Kota and resided there.                    Thereafter, respondent No.2 had

brought the couple back to Baroda and had again started demanding

money from the deceased. Then the deceased and the respondent No.

demanded a sum of ₹20,000/- [Rupees Twenty thousand] from the

deceased and her uncle for constructing a house. On being persistently

hounded with the repeated demands for money made on her which her

family could not fulfil, the hapless deceased who was well into the

second trimester of her pregnancy, immolated herself at her matrimonial

home.

hardly mitigate the offence of the respondents or take the case out of the

purview of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_61">Section 304-B</a> IPC, when all the four pre-requisites for

invoking the said provision stand satisfied, namely, that the death of

Geeta Bai took place at her matrimonial home within seven years of her

marriage; that the said death took place in abnormal circumstances on

account of burning and that too when she was five months pregnant; that

she had been subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondents

soon before her death and such cruelty/harassment was in connection

with demand for dowry. Though the High Court found the testimony of

P.W.-1 [maternal uncle of the deceased] to be trustworthy and consistent

and no credible evidence could be produced by the respondents to

demolish the prosecution version, surprisingly, their conviction under

<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_62">Section 304-B</a> IPC has been set aside and furthermore, respondent No.

</p><p id="p_53">20.       Taking into account the evidence brought on record by the

prosecution, particularly, the testimony of P.W.-1, this Court has no

hesitation in holding that the analysis of the trial Court was correct and

the respondents deserved to be convicted under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_64">Sections 304-B</a> and

<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_65">498-A</a> IPC.                    However, we do not propose to disturb the findings

returned by the High Court that has acquitted the respondents for the

offence of abetment to commit suicide under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_66">Section 306</a> IPC, as the

prosecution could not bring any conclusive evidence on record to

satisfactorily demonstrate that it was due to the abetment on the part of

the respondents that the deceased had committed suicide by immolating

herself. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by

the trial Court in respect of both the respondents under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_67">Section 304-B</a>

and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_68">Section 498-A</a> IPC, is restored. However, the sentence imposed on

them by the trial Court of RI for life is reduced to RI for seven years,

which is the minimum sentence prescribed for an offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_69">Section

304-B</a> IPC.
