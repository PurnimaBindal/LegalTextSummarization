                             ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>


<p id="p_1">      The present petition has been filed by the petitioners under Articles
14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 226 of the Constitution of India as well as under the
Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Act') read with the <a href="/doc/1005850/" id="a_1">Urban Land Ceiling Act</a>, 1976 for
the prayers, inter alia, that appropriate writ, order or direction may be
issued to hold that the action of the respondents is illegal and the final
scheme is not as per the procedure of law. Further, it is prayed that the
respondent authorities have no power under the Town Planning Act and
therefore the action is unconstitutional and illegal. It is also prayed that
appropriate writ, order or direction may be issued to the Government to
revise the scheme which is finalised without inviting objections from the
petitioners and invite fresh objections for Scheme No. 37 Final Plot No.
23 on the grounds stated in the petition.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.    Heard learned advocate Shri Ekrama Qureshi appearing with
learned advocate Shri Hashim Qureshi for the petitioners.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    Learned advocate Shri Qureshi has referred to the papers at length
and submitted that no procedure before finalisation of the scheme has
been followed. He has referred to the scheme of the Act and submitted
that no notice has been served individually, though the petitioners are
members of the association known as "Jay Bharat Kabadi Market
Association". Referring to the provisions of the Act in detail, learned
advocate Shri Qureshi submitted that straightway notice under sec. 68 of
the Act for eviction has been issued, but there is no mention about any
procedure which can be said to have been followed prior thereto. He
emphasised that no notice has been issued, nor any procedure under the
Act has been followed and the petitioners are not aware about publication
of any notification.      Learned advocate Shri Qureshi referred to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  Page 2 of 14</span>
         C/SCA/8479/1997                                     JUDGMENT




provisions of the Act and the scheme and pointedly referred to sec. 40 of
the Act and submitted that Chapter V, sec. 40, refers to "Making and
contents of a town planning scheme".
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.    Learned advocate Shri Qureshi submitted that the draft scheme is
required to be published and also the procedure is required to be followed
including inviting objections which has not been done and therefore the
rules of natural justice have been violated. He pointedly referred to sec.
42(3) of the Act and submitted that as provided in this section, if the
publication of the draft scheme is not made within the prescribed period,
it shall not be competent for the appropriate authority to declare the
intention to make the town planning scheme. He submitted that the
"appropriate authority" is required to be considered as defined in the Act
in sec. 2(iii). He has also submitted that sec. 2(iii) also defines the Urban
Development Authority and submitted that the Corporation is not the
Authority. Learned advocate Shri Qureshi referred to the affidavit-in-
reply filed by the respondents and submitted that it is a vague reply and it
is not a reply. He referred to the provisions and submitted that the
scheme must have been under the Bombay Town Planning Act and
subsequently when it is said to have been finalised in purported exercise
of power under the Gujarat Town Planing Act it is not valid inasmuch as
the provisions of the Act are inconsistent.      In   support     of      his
submissions, learned advocate Shri Qureshi has referred to and relied
upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1996 SC
2804. He, therefore, reiterated that the procedure as prescribed under sec.
40, 41 are not followed and substantial rights of the petitioners are
violated. He has also submitted that if the notification is issued, it is
required to be published in the Gazette and it could have been produced
on record.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.    Learned advocate Shri Qureshi also submitted that had an


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  Page 3 of 14</span>
         C/SCA/8479/1997                                    JUDGMENT




opportunity been given to raise the objections, they could have raised the
objections to point out that the members of the Association are doing the
work/business and therefore there was no need for the proposed
construction including the swimming pool, etc. and no public interest
could be served. He has also stated that even assuming that notice under
sec. 68 is served, it has to be by AUDA and not by the Corporation as the
Corporation is not the implementing authority. He submitted that the
provisions of sec. 23(2) were amended in 1995, whereas the notice under
sec. 68 were issued in 1990, where the Municipal Corporation could not
be the authority and was not empowered for implementation and
therefore the present petition may be allowed. Learned advocate Shri
Qureshi also submitted that though the notice is said to have been issued
in 1990, till 1997 no steps were taken and therefore if there is a delay,
the scheme cannot be implemented as it is required to be implemented
within a prescribed period. He also submitted that earlier Special Civil
Application No. 5079 of 1990 was filed under the <a href="/doc/1005850/" id="a_2">ULC Act</a> and it has an
overriding effect and stay was operating and therefore also it could not
have been implemented. He has referred to and relied upon the judgment
of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1784729/" id="a_3">Ahmedabad Urban Development
Authority v. Manilal Gordhandas and ors</a>., reported in AIR 1991 SC 2130
(para 16). He has also referred to the judgment of the Division Bench of
this High Court in the case of Kishanbhai Hargovandas Patel &amp; anr. v.
State of Gujarat &amp; ors., reported in 2010(4) GLR 2867.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.    Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Prashant Desai appearing with learned
advocate Shri Kaushal Pandya for the respondents submitted that the
petitioner has no locus standi to file the present petition. He submitted
that the conduct of the petitioner is required to be considered for which he
referred to the affidavit-in-reply in detail. He submitted that for the same
issue or grievance the petitioners who are members of the Association
have already filed Civil Suit No. 5318/97 which is pending and therefore


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 Page 4 of 14</span>
          C/SCA/8479/1997                                     JUDGMENT




this petition would not be maintainable as the petitioners cannot be
permitted to ride two horses, particularly when the petitioners have no
locus standi. He has also submitted that the petitioners claim to be
members of the "Jay Bharat Kabadi Market Association" and he
pointedly referred to the papers of this petition and submitted that in fact
the members of this association have repeatedly made representations,
objections have been raised particularly with regard to             the same
objection that they are doing the business and construction of recreation
facilities or swimming pool etc. is not in public interest.             He also
submitted that in spite of that, such submissions are made. He pointedly
referred to Annexure VI dated 18.6.1997 and also the annexures to the
affidavit-in-reply and particularly the communications addressed by the
association in and about 1990 where it has been specifically admitted that
the notice has been served to the association. He pointedly referred to the
notice dated 27.2.1991 addressed to the Secretary and the Chairman of
the association and submitted that it was specifically intimated that the
scheme has been approved by the Government and therefore the same
may be vacated. In response thereto, one Yunusbhai Haji Usufbhai,
petitioner No. 6, has addressed a letter dated 29.8.1990. Similarly,
petitioner No. 1 has also addressed a letter dated 29.8.1990 and there are
letters from others. Reply has been given to the objections vide letter
dated 27.2.1991. He submitted that thereafter the association has made
representations/raised objections which have been considered as late as in
1997 and again the association has made the representation dated
18.6.1997 produced at Annexure-VI reiterating the same thing and
therefore the contentions which have been raised are far from the truth
and the petition may not be entertained. Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai
has also referred to the affidavit-in-reply and submitted that the
objections which have been raised have been considered as stated in
detail in the affidavit-in-reply in para 5. Apart from this, it is also rquired
to be considered that the the occupation of particular shop may have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  Page 5 of 14</span>
           C/SCA/8479/1997                                      JUDGMENT




changed in some cases, but that would not make any difference and in
any case it is well-settled that individual notices are not required to be
served.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.     Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai submitted that apart from this
factual background, the law is very well-settled. He submitted that as
observed in the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_4">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v.
Surat Municipal Corporation &amp; ors</a>., reported in AIR 2008 SC 2919,
individual notices are not required to be served once the notification has
been published. He pointedly referred to the scheme of the Act and
submitted that as provided the preliminary draft             scheme is there.
Thereafter the preliminary scheme is considered and the Town Planning
Officer is appointed as officer and after considering the objections as per
the procedure, normally, when it is approved, it becomes part of the Act.
He referred to sub-sec. (3) of sec. 17 of the Act and submitted that the
procedure has been followed and thereafter the final notice for eviction of
possession has been issued in purported exercise of power under Rule 13
read with sec. 67, 68 of the Act.           He therefore submitted that the
submissions which have been made are required to be considered in
background of these facts.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.     Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai submitted that the petition is filed
in the year 1997 whereas the scheme has been finalised in the year 1988
after following the procedure and for the first time the petition is filed in
1997 challenging the scheme on such grounds which cannot be believed
or accepted. Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai submitted that in any case
the civil suit is also filed and therefore it is now too late for the petitioners
to take any such contentions in background of the facts and when the
procedure as required under the law has been followed which is evident
from the record including the fact that notices are also served.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   Page 6 of 14</span>
<p id="p_9">            C/SCA/8479/1997                                 JUDGMENT




</p><p id="p_10">9.    Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai has emphasised that the main
contention which is sought to be raised that at the stage of sec. 67, 68
notice has been issued but the prior procedure is not followed is also
belied from the fact that even in the year 1990 when the notices are issued
the petitioners could have raised the objections but they have not chosen
to file any proceedings or petition till the year 1997 and therefore it
cannot be now permitted to be argued that the procedure has not been
followed and the opportunity of hearing has not been given. Learned Sr.
Counsel Shri Desai submitted that in any case in light of the fact that now
the scheme has been accepted and has become part of the law, the
petitioners cannot go behind it and the clock cannot be put back. He
submitted that in any case when prima facie the procedure has been
followed, the presumption should be made in favour of the procedure and
the act which is done under the Act and therefore also now it cannot be
questioned.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10.   In support of his submissions, learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai has
referred to and relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_5">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v. Surat Municipal Corporation &amp;
ors</a>., reported in AIR 2008 SC 2919 = 2008 (3) GLH 137 and emphasised
the observations made in para 15, 26 and 33. He submitted that the rules
do not contemplate service of individual notice. Reference is made to the
observations in this judgment with regard to the procedure based on the
fact that the scheme having attained finality the equitable relief cannot be
claimed.      Again, learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai also referred to the
conduct of the petitioner. He has also referred to the judgment of the
Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court in the case of Kashiben wd/o
Pitamber Devchand &amp; anr. v. State of Gujarat &amp; ors., reported in 1989(2)
GLR 1176. He emphasised that the same contention was raised and it has
been negatived and submitted that sec. 124 of the Bombay Town
Planning Act has been referred to and it would save the actions and the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 Page 7 of 14</span>
         C/SCA/8479/1997                                   JUDGMENT




steps which have been taken.       Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai also
therefore submitted that presumption has to be made that when the
scheme has been sanctioned, every procedure as required under the law
has been followed. He submitted that the person who rises from the
slumber after 10 years cannot be heard or permitted to raise any such
question. In any case, learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai submitted that the
petitioners have no locus standi as it was the association which was the
petitioner and also individual notices at a later stage were given to the
respective occupants. He submitted that when individual notices for the
possession has been given to the respective occupants, such contention is
sought to be raised that individual notices were not given at the earlier
stage. He therefore submitted that the association was contesting and it
was on the basis of the details given in the prescribed form the notices
were served which is stated in detail in the affidavit.       He therefore
submitted that the present petition may not be entertained.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11.   In view of these rival submissions, it is required to be considered
whether the present petition can be entertained.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12.   As it transpires from the record, the petition is a classic case of
abuse of the process of law. Admittedly,        "Jay Bharat Kabadi Market
Association" of which the petitioners are members, has filed Civil Suit
No. 5318/97 before the City Civil &amp; Sessions Court, Ahmedabad, which
is pending with regard to the same subject-matter. In spite of this, the
present petition is filed by the petitioners raising the same or similar
issues and contentions are sought to be raised based on the violation of
the rules of natural justice, non-compliance with the procedure under the
Act read with the Rules. The emphasis has been made with regard to
voilation of the rules of natural justice or denial of any opportunity of
hearing and the notice for following the procedure particularly individual
notices under the Act read with the Rules have not been issued.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 Page 8 of 14</span>
<p id="p_14">           C/SCA/8479/1997                                   JUDGMENT




</p><p id="p_15">13.     As could be seen from the affidavit-in-reply, which has dealt with
these aspects in detail, the Association was issued a notice under sec. 68
read with Rule 33 of the Act way back in the year 1990. The objections
were invited and various letters were received from the Association
which     are    produced   collectively at Annexure-III to the affidavit-in-
reply. Thereafter the objections from these very petitioners have been
received and were also replied vide Annexure-IV in the affidavitit-in-
reply which is placed on record.        Thereafter, again, tthe Association
raised the objections in the year 1997 which was also replied vide letter
dated 26.6.1997 produced at Annexure-V.                Thereafter also the
Association        raised   the    objections    and     considering     the
representations/objections the reply was given by the respondent
Corporation on 15.7.1997 which is produced at Annexure-VI.               The
correspondence and Annexure-III attached to the affidavit-in-reply
clearly suggests about the same issues or objections raised by the
petitioners herein and also by the Association of which they claim to be
members and the reply has been given. Another detailed representation
dated 9.6.1997 at Annexure-VI is also addressed to the respondent
Corporation. It is required to be noted at this stage that the petitioners
had also made an attempt to use the good offices of the then Municipal
Councillor Bhadruddin Shaikh who is said to have addressed a
letter/communication to the Municipal Commissioner dated 23.6.1997 at
Annexure-VI.
</p>

<p id="p_16">14.     A useful reference can also be made to the judgment of this High
Court reported in 2005(2) GLR 1649 in the case of <a href="/doc/929250/" id="a_6">Kanjibhai Dahyabhai
Malsattar &amp; ors. v. State of Gujarat &amp; ors.          It</a> has been observed,
negativing the contention of the petitioner that non-service of the special
or individual notice would vitiate the scheme and such contention has
been rejected. It has also been observed referring to sec. 67 &amp; 68 of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  Page 9 of 14</span>
          C/SCA/8479/1997                                      JUDGMENT




Town Planning Act read with the Rules that when the scheme has
become final, the lands covered under the scheme shall vest in the area
development authority free from all encumbrances and the petitioners are
left with no option but to vacate the land.
</p>

<p id="p_17">15.   All this correspondence belies the fact and the allegation that an
opportunity has not been given.                  In fact, according to these
representations which have been made repeatedly, it clearly emerges that
the petitioners as well as the Association for and on behalf of the
members had made repeated requests for modification in the scheme
which has not been acceded to. It is required to be noted that the draft
scheme for which the objections were invited, the Government has
granted its sanction in the year 1983. The objection is filed in the year
1997 challenging these aspects.       Therefore, as rightly contended by
learned Sr. Counsel Shri Desai, such objections are only filed as an abuse
of process and as an after-thought only to obstruct any further progress
of the T.P. Scheme and it is because of such attitude things like the
Development Plan or the projects getting delayed over a period of time
entangled in litigation.
</p>

<p id="p_18">16.   The contention which has been raised with regard to the competent
authority well as the contention that the originally scheme was under the
Bombay Town Planning Act which is subsequently finalised under the
provisions of the Gujarat Town Planing and Urban Development Act,
1976 and therefore it would be void ab-initio is thoroughly misconceived.
</p>

<p id="p_19">17.   A useful reference can also been made to the observations made by
the Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court in a judgment in the case
of Kashiben wd/o Pitamber Devchand &amp; anr. v. State of Gujarat &amp; anr.,
reported in 1989(2) GLR 1176, wherein this issue has been considered
and it has been observed,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 Page 10 of 14</span>
         C/SCA/8479/1997                                            JUDGMENT




      "A draft scheme or any scheme prepared under the Bombay Town Planing Act
      can be processed further and finalised by virtue of Sec. 124 of the Gujarat Act -
      Once a final scheme is prepared it must be deemed to be part of the Act - The
      original owner loses all rights over the land, he is liable to be evicted, and he
      has no locus standi to file a writ petition."
</p>

<p id="p_20">It has also been observed that when there is no substantial variation, there
is no need to have any de novo proceedings. In this very judgment the
same contention that        the municipality or the municipal corporation
cannot reserve the land or cannot implement the scheme is also
negatived.
</p>

<p id="p_21">18.   It is required to be mentioned that observations have been made
referring to the earlier judgment of the Full Bench of this High Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1740513/" id="a_7">Dungarlal v. State</a>, reported in [1976] XVII GLR 1152,



      "So far as the validity of such legislative measure is concerned, the
      validity can be gone into even in writ jurisdiction only to the
      limited extent whether there is any transgression of jurisdiction of
      the authorities concerned and whether the scheme as finally
      emerged is totally inconsistent with the Act. It is only the
      fundamental breaches, that is where minimum statutory essentials
      are not complied with, which result in a total lack of jurisdiction
      and not other procedural errors or defects that would render a
      scheme, which had become a legislative measure and a part of the
      Act, liable to attack or challenge in a Court on the ground that it is
      null and void

             ....It was open to a person affected to waive individual
      special notice specified in sub-rule (3), which was only as an
      additional safeguard for the individual concerned. Therefore, that
      could never constitute the minimum essential of the scheme or
      such a basic requirement that its non-c0mpliance would have any
      nullifying consequence."
</p>

<p id="p_22">The Full Bench further held:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                     Page 11 of 14</span>
<p id="p_23">         C/SCA/8479/1997                                            JUDGMENT




      "The provisions of Rule 21(1) lay down the minimum essentials
      for protecting public interest after the Town Planning Officer
      commences his work. That sub-rule is introduced in accordance
      with principles of 'audi alteram partem'. Special individual notices
      under old sub-rule (3) cannot, therefore, be regarded as an essential
      minimum safeguard as in the case of sub-rule (1) so as to have the
      consequences of nullifying the final scheme."
</p>

<p id="p_24">Thus, the contention about individual notice or violation of the principles
of natural justice are misconceived in light of the aforesaid observation.
Further, as observed in the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_8">Babulal Badriprasad
Varma v. Surat Municipal Corporation &amp; ors</a>. (supra), the contention
about individual notice is misconceived.
</p>

<p id="p_25">19.   In yet another Full Bench decision of our High Court in case of
<a href="/doc/1740759/" id="a_9">Saiyed Mohamad v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation</a>, reported in
(1977) XVIII GLR 549, the Full Bench, dealing with the impugned notice
of eviction observed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "In view of Sec. 53, once property has vested absolutely in the local
             authority and all rights of these persons occupying the same have come
             to an end, the eviction power would be merely an administrative power
             of eviction. Such eviction would be of the same nature as of the persons
             who are evicted under the provisions of the Land Acquisition act after
             the acquired land has vested in the State and the matter is only of taking
             possession."

<p id="p_26">20.   A useful reference can also be made to the judgment reported in
2000(3) GLR 2505 in the case of <a href="/doc/132330/" id="a_10">Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v.
Vijay Owners' Association</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_27">21.   It is also required to be mentioned that in every such measure
regarding implementation of the policy or the proposed development
scheme under the Act, there may be a conflict between the
private/individual right and the collective right of the society. Further, in

the facts of the case, the Association as a representative of the interests
and rights of all the members has been taking interest and still the present
petitioners individually have made representations which have been
considered. The submissions about non-compliance with the procedure
or the rules of natural justice are therefore without substance.

<p id="p_28">22.    Further reference can also be made to the underlying purpose and
the legislative intent of such Act which has been considered by the earlier
Full Bench of this High Court in a judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1740513/" id="a_11">Dungarlal V.
State</a>, reported in [1976] XVII GLR 1152, wherein it has been observed,

       "For proper framing of schemes and implementing them, the individual rights
       are made subordinate to the wider social interests of the society and civil
       amenities. The individual interests are not allowed to outweigh and prevail over
       the wider social interests so as to thwart or torpedo salutary social schemes of
       Town Planning for the benefit of the public as a whole. Schemes such as the
       one with which we are concerned ought not to be allowed to suffer and
       individual interests have to be subordinated so as to subserve public good as
       they are to be expeditiously implemented in accordance with the true legislative
       intention of the Act. An elaborate procedure is prescribed under the Act and the
       Rules to achieve the desired objective."
</p>

<p id="p_29">In this judgment, discussion has been made to various factors including
the development as well as the environment etc. suggesting to strike a
balance between the individual right and the right of the society or social
interest.
</p>

<p id="p_30">23.    It is in this background, though the submissions have been made at
length, without reference to the actual, factual background, it requires
dismissal of the petition.
</p>

<p id="p_31">24.    Accordingly, the present petition stands dismissed. Rule is
discharged. Interim relief stands vacated.

FURTHER ORDER

</pre><p id="p_32">       After the order was pronounced, learned advocate Shri Qureshi has
requested for stay of the operation of the order to enable his clients to
approach the higher forum. As the interim relief has been operating since
1998 as requested it would be in fitness of things if the same is extended
for a further period of four weeks to enable the petitioners to approach the
higher forum. Therefore, the operation of the order is stayed for four
weeks.
