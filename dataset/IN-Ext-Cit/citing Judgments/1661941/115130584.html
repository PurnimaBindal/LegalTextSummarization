                           filed by the petitioner herein whereby the Tribunal has disposed of the OA
                          by stating the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                               &quot;17. That being the case, the OA fails to satisfy the Tribunal
                               regarding the allegations of bias, malafide and vindictiveness.
                               Nevertheless, the applicant has already availed interim relief
                               from this Tribunal in the form of the order which directs the
                               respondents not to enforce the transfer order till further orders.
                               This is now month of March and almost the end of academic
                               session. Hence, the major personal difficulty of the applicant
                               regarding mid-academic session transfer has taken care of. It is
                               further ordered that the applicant shall not be relocated to
                               Chennai till 31.3.2023. This was the request the applicant made
                               to the respondents in his first representation after the issuance of
                               transfer order dated 19.12.2022. As regards, the reallocation of
                               the work responsibilities and splitting of the position of Deputy
                               Director, Trade Mark and GIR to two positions regarding
                               Trademark and GIR , it is my view that it is the prerogative of the
                               administrative Department to do so in best interest of the
                               organization and the public interest. It is up to the Respondent
                               No.1, i.e., Secretary, DIIP to look into the matter and take
                               appropriate action, if any warranted.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">                          2.    The challenge of the petitioner in the OA was to an order dated
                          December 19, 2022 whereby the petitioner was transferred from Delhi to
                          Chennai office with reallocated work responsibilities. In substance, the
                          Tribunal has by upholding the order of the transfer / reallocation of the
                          responsibilities has deferred the joining of the petitioner till March 31, 2023,
                          coinciding with the academic session of his children.

                          joined on May 1, 2018. He was transferred to the Delhi Office on November
                          11, 2020, after nearly two and half years on his own request.
</p><p id="p_6">                          4.    On December 19, 2022 the order regarding transfer-cum-work
                          reallocation was issued by the Office of Controller General of Patents,
                          Designs, Trade Marks and Registry (&#x27;Controller General&#x27;, for short). The
                          said order included four other Officers. Vide said order, the petitioner was
                          transferred in the capacity of Deputy Registrar, GIR, Chennai and was also
                          designated Head of Office, GI at Chennai.
</p><p id="p_7">                          5.    On December 20, 2022, the petitioner made a request through a
                          representation to respondent No.2 to postpone his transfer till March 31,
                          2023 on the ground that he has been transferred prematurely; on health
                          grounds; death of a relative during pandemic, and education of his children
                          who are studying in Schools and for his frequent visits to his home town
                          Bareilly.
</p><p id="p_8">                          6.    It was his case before the Tribunal that he did not get a favourable
                          response on his representation. On January 18, 2023, another representation
                          was made stating that his father has expired on January 09, 2023 and also
                          the fact that his children are in class 10, 7 and 4 and under these
                          circumstances his transfer would create a lot of hardship to the family.
</p><p id="p_9">                          7.    On January 23, 2023, the petitioner was relieved from the Delhi
                          Office for his joining at Chennai Office. Being aggrieved, he filed the OA
                          before the Tribunal.

                           the impugned transfer order. The primary grounds averred by the petitioner
                          challenging the transfer order before the Tribunal were; (i) that the same is
                          biased, malafide and issued as punitive measure and as such bad in law. (ii)
                          that the order dated December 19, 2022 is bad in law as it violated the
                          transfer policy dated January 9, 2020. (iii) In any case, that the transfer order
                          has created discomfort to him and to his family.
</p><p id="p_11">                          9.    The case of the respondents before the Tribunal was that the petitioner
                          has been transferred to Chennai vide order dated December 19, 2022 and has
                          been assigned the charge of Head of Office, Geographical Indications,
                          Registry, Chennai and Opposition Hearing Officer in International
                          Registration Division, Trade Marks Registry, Chennai along with other
                          works as assigned by Controller General.
</p><p id="p_12">                          10.   The representation dated January 18, 2023 was duly considered and
                          rejected, vide note dated January 24, 2023. While considering the
                          representation, the unfortunate demise of the father of the petitioner was
                          duly considered. They have denied any malafide exercise of power while
                          issuing order dated December 19, 2022.
</p><p id="p_13">                          11.   It was their case that the second representation provided new grounds
                          and the same reflected his intention not to abide by the transfer order and
                          bypass the same for one reason or another. The challenge to the transfer
                          order has been made without any sufficient cause and deserved to be
                          dismissed.

                          joining his new position at GIR, Chennai as, by way of the said

                          showed his willingness to join the office at Chennai as per the transfer order
                          with the only request being for extension of time till March 31, 2023. The
                          real opposition to the transfer order was in the representation dated January

                          transfer order effectuating his transfer was issued on December 19, 2022

                           an administrative in-charge of GI and this has been the reason, in the
                          backdrop of the growing importance and growth of GI in the country, for
                          which the petitioner has been transferred to the GIR, Chennai.
</p><p id="p_21">                          19.   The Tribunal while considering the challenge to the transfer order has
                          in paragraphs 15 to 17 held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                  &quot;15. I have gone through the records of case thoroughly and
                                  heard the arguments by the both counsels carefully. The
                                  assertion by the applicant and averment by his counsel
                                  regarding the biasedness, malafide on the part of Respondents
                                  is not borne out from the facts and circumstances of the case.
                                  The transfer order dated 19.12.2022 has not singled out the
                                  applicant. The reallocation -cum- transfer order involves five
                                  more officials. The allegation of nonexistent post of Deputy
                                  Director at Chennai office is not sustainable in view of the
                                  documentary evidence produced by the counsel for the
                                  Respondents (Additional documents-III, IV &amp; V). Because it is
                                  transfer prior to 5 years tenure and because the applicant‟s
                                  children are in Schools and the applicant has health and
                                  family issues, the transfer order cannot be considered as
                                  biased and based on malafide intentions. I agree with the
                                  contention of the counsel for the respondents that the
                                  allegation regarding punitive action based on vendetta
                                  because the applicant did not comply with the alleged illegal
                                  pressure in respect of one quasi-judicial case is not
                                  substantiated by documentary evidence. It is easier to allege
                                  such pressure in organizations dealing with quasi-judicial
                                  matters.</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">                                  16. The argument by the counsel for the applicant that the
                                  present transfer case fails the Doctrine of Reasonable
                                  Expectations by an employee from the model employer i.e. the
                                  Government of India falls flat. On the other hand, the
                                  Government as custodian of Public interest has also
                                  reasonable expectations from its civil servants. A group &quot;A‟
                                  officer is supposed to serve anywhere in the country. That is
                                  the basic service condition for such officers. Moreover, it is
                                  the prerogative of the employer to transfer his employee at

                          administrative exigencies. The transfer policies are framed
                          keeping in view effective deployment of manpower for the
                          purpose of discharging the responsibilities of the organization
                          in service public affairs. It is part of the Human Resources
                          Management policy of the Government to provide better
                          opportunities to officers for excellence and more planned
                          approach to cadre planning. Effective Utilization of service of
                          an employee is in the very core of administrative exigency.
                          The public interest is more or equally important as the
                          reasonable expectations of the employee being treated fairly
                          and impartially in respect of personal hardships and
                          difficulties. Somewhere, public interest weighs above the
                          personal comfort of the employees. Referring to Shilpi Bose
                          case (supra) and <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_2">Gujarat Electricity Board v. Atmaram

                          course permissible, but orders of transfer are interfered

                          new place of posting as a discipline civil servant after being
                          relieved from office at Delhi. He could have joined at the new
                          place of posting and then would have submitted
                          representation regarding his personal difficulties. Instead of
                          joining at the place of posting, i.e., Chennai, he presented one
                          alibi by another to perpetuate his stay at Delhi. When he was
                          transferred after two years from Ahmedabad to Delhi he
                          willingly accepted. When, for administrative exigency, he was
                          prematurely transferred to Chennai, he protests. The system

                                  employee at the detriment of public interest. Reasonable
                                  expectation of the government from government servant
                                  regarding public service to the general public, and
                                  governance efficiency cannot be sacrificed at the altar of
                                  convenience of balance for the employee only.
</p><p id="p_24">                                  17. That being the case, the OA fails to satisfy the Tribunal
                                  regarding the allegations of bias, malafide and vindictiveness.
                                  Nevertheless, the applicant has already availed interim relief
                                  from this Tribunal in the form of the order which directs the
                                  respondents not to enforce the transfer order till further
                                  orders. This is now month of March and almost the end of
                                  academic session. Hence, the major personal difficulty of the
                                  applicant regarding mid-academic session transfer has taken
                                  care of. It is further ordered that the applicant shall not be
                                  relocated to Chennai till 31.3.2023. This was the request the
                                  applicant made to the respondents in his first representation
                                  after the issuance of transfer order dated 19.12.2022. As
                                  regards, the reallocation of the work responsibilities and
                                  splitting of the position of Deputy Director, Trade Mark and
                                  GIR to two positions regarding Trademark and GIR , it is my
                                  view that it is the prerogative of the administrative
                                  Department to do so in best interest of the organization and
                                  the public interest. It is up to the Respondent No.1, i.e.,
                                  Secretary, DIIP to look into the matter and take appropriate
                                  action, if any warranted.&quot;
</p><p id="p_25">                          20.   Even before us, the submissions of Mr. Siddharth Dias, learned
                          counsel for the petitioner are three fold; firstly, the order dated December
                          19, 2022 is actuated by malafide on the part of the Controller General.
                          Secondly, that the same is in violation of the policy dated January 9, 2020.
                          Thirdly, there is no post of Deputy Registrar at Chennai, to which the
                          petitioner has been transferred. In support of his plea of malafide, he states
                          that the order dated December 19, 2022 was motivated in order to unduly
                          favour of Dr. Upesh Kumar, who has filed trademark applications which

                          the said orders and the same would have been heard by the petitioner. Mr.
                          Dias states, the Tribunal failed to appreciate the contention of the petitioner
                          that although he was transferred to Chennai in GI Registry, he being a
                          Group &#x27;A&#x27; Officer working as Deputy Registrar of TM &amp; GI at the Delhi
                          Registry, he could be posted if such a post exist in Chennai. But no post of
                          Deputy Registrar exist in GIR Chennai which is evident from Annual Report
                          2021-22 of the Intellectual Propriety of India published from the office of
                          the respondents. In fact, it is the submission of Mr. Dias that there has never
                          been any post of Deputy Registrar in the GIR Chennai since its
                          establishment in the year 2003.
</p><p id="p_26">                          21.   That apart, it is also his submission that the transfer order was issued
                          without application of mind and reasonable justification in an arbitrary
                          manner.
</p><p id="p_27">                          22.   His plea that the transfer order is in violation of the policy dated
                          January 9, 2020 is concerned, he states that as per the guidelines issued it is
                          mandatory that Placement Committee recommends the transfer to the
                          Approving Authority being the Controller General. No such Placement
                          Committee has recommended the transfer of the petitioner. As per the
                          policy, the minimum tenure of five years which has not been completed in

                          petitioner&#x27;s family consist of three small children studying in class 10, 7 and
                          4 and he being the eldest son and on the demise of his father, has to take

                          respondent Nos.2 and 3 would justify the order of the Tribunal. He, apart
                          from reiterating the stand taken by the respondents in reply before the
                          Tribunal, would submit that the Tribunal has considered the plea of the
                          petitioner that during mid academic session of his children, he could not
                          have been transferred and for that reason, the Tribunal has deferred the

                          transferred to Delhi after two and a half years of tenure in Ahmedabad
                          cannot justify malafide. That apart, while working in Delhi, he has been
                          given responsibility as Registrar of Geographical Indications. He was also
                          discharging the duties as Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks and Geographical

                          plea that the minimum tenure is of five years is totally misplaced argument.

                          period as it does not suit him. It is a fact that the petitioner is holding a post
                          which has an all India transfer liability, and as such no discretion lies with
                          the Officer not to abide by the transfer order which has been issued. He
                          submits that it is not only he, there are other 32 Officers, who have been
                          transferred in the month of February 1, 2023.

                          December 16, 2022. He submits that the petitioner did make a representation
                          to the concerned Minister, which has been answered by the respondents vide
                          communication dated February 15, 2023 wherein proper justification has

</p><p id="p_53">                          32.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, the short issue which
                          arises from consideration is whether the Tribunal is justified in not
                          interfering with the transfer order dated December 19, 2022.
</p><p id="p_54">                          33.   At the outset, we intend to deal with the plea of Mr. Dias that the
                          order dated December 19, 2022 is a malafide exercise of power on the part
                          of the respondent No.2 Controller General. On a specific query from the
                          Court as to whether the respondent No.2 Controller General was made a
                          party in person, the answer is in the negative. It is a settled law, that if
                          allegations of malafide are made qua any person, such a person need to be
                          impleaded as party to enable such a person answer the averments relatable to
                          malafide. In the absence of the Controller General being a party in person,
                          surely allegations of malafide cannot be considered.
</p><p id="p_55">                          34.   Mr. Dias would submit that the respondent No.2 was made a party by
                          designation. Suffice to state, that would not meet the requirement of law
                          when allegations of malafide have been made. Hence, the plea of malafide
                          need to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_56">                          35.   Having said that we find that the Tribunal, de-hors the position of law
                          has not found the case on malafide on behalf of the petitioner sustainable.
                          According to the Tribunal, the transfer order dated December 19, 2022 has
                          not singled out the petitioner, inasmuch as the reallocation-cum-transfer
                          order involved five more Officers.
</p><p id="p_57">                          36.   On the plea of Mr. Dias that there is no post of Deputy Registrar at
                          Chennai office, Mr. Singhdev by drawing our attention to page 293 of the
                          paper book submits that the total sanctioned strength of the post of Deputy
                          Registrar of TM and GI at Chennai is two, against which only one Deputy

                           Registrar is working. In other words, post being available, the petitioner has
                          been rightly transferred. Suffice to state, this plea of the petitioner was
                          rightly rejected by the Tribunal by stating that &quot;the allegation of nonexistent
                          post of Deputy Director at Chennai office is not sustainable in view of the
                          documentary evidence produced by the counsel for the respondents.&quot;
</p><p id="p_58">                          37.   Insofar as the plea of Mr. Dias that the transfer is in violation of the
                          policy is concerned, we have perused the same. Clause 4.2 of the transfer
                          policy states that the minimum tenure for the post shall normally be two
                          years. It also contemplates, transfer on administrative ground and in case of
                          exigency can be considered before completion of minimum tenure. In any
                          case, as the policy contemplates minimum tenure as two years, the petitioner
                          having completed the same in Delhi, there is no violation of policy.
</p><p id="p_59">                          38.   That apart, we note, in administrative exigency, an Officer can be
                          transferred before completion of tenure of two years. In fact, clause 6.3 of
                          the policy contemplates, as far as possible, and within administrative
                          exigencies, transfer and posting will be done in such a way that each officer
                          has an equal opportunity to serve all offices catered to by the organisation.
</p><p id="p_60">                          39.   It is also a settled law that the policy which is not statutory in
                          character is in the nature of guidelines. The fact remains that the petitioner
                          having been appointed on a public post, any posting / transfer pre-supposes
                          the same is in public interest with only exception being, if the same is
                          actuated by malafide then the same is vitiated. It is not such a case here.
</p><p id="p_61">                          40.   Insofar as the plea of Mr. Dias, it is after the recommendation made
                          by the Placement Committee that a transfer can be effected is concerned, the
                          same does not appeal to this Court. There is no denial to the fact that the
                          Competent Authority is the Controller General i.e., the respondent No.2 who

                           effected the transfer being the Competent Authority. The respondents have
                          justified the transfer order by stating that the Director and Senior Joint
                          Registrar, who are part of the Placement Committee, have also dealt with the
                          case of transfer of the petitioner at one stage or the other without any
                          reservation. The plea is appealing as it reflects that two members of the
                          Placement Committee had in a way approved the transfer of the petitioner to
                          Chennai and had not commented otherwise.
</p><p id="p_62">                          41.   The plea of Mr. Dias that premature transfer needs to be made only by
                          recording reasons. On this submission, Mr. Singhdev has relied upon the
                          communication dated February 15, 2023, of the Office of the respondent
                          No.2 addressed to Under Secretary to the Government of India, DPIIT,
