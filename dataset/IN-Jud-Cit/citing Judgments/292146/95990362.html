</p><p id="p_2">2.    Summons in the suit and notice in the application were issued on

      creating any third party interest in the registered trade mark "MENTOS".

       chewing gum, bubble gum, etc., under various world famous trademarks.
      The above goods of the plaintiff, and/or its associate or group companies
      are available in over 130 countries of the world including India, under
      famous and well known trademarks such as MENTOS, ALPENLIEBE,
      COFITOS, CHLO-RMINT, FRUITTELLA, CENTER FRESH, CENTER
      SHOCK, ETC. The plaintiff‟s predecessors-in-title had honestly coined
      and adopted the inherently distinctive trademark MENTOS in the year
      1929.    The candy manufactured and sold by the plaintiff and its
      associate/group companies under the mark MENTOS has a chewy, sugar
      coated hard mint cover and a soft centre. It is submitted that prior to
      1950, MENTOS of the plaintiff‟s were sold in bags and loose, and
      thereafter, in cylindrical paper packs. The product, MENTOS, was first
      introduced in the Netherlands and thereafter in the markets all over the
      world, and the product has become immensely popular. In order to accord
      statutory protection to the expression MENTOS, the plaintiff had applied
      for and/or registered the said trademark in several countries of the world,
      as detailed in the plaint. The registrations of Benelux dates back to 1967,
      1970, 1971 and 1972. The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the
      trademark MENTOS in India under registration no.410587 in Class 30 as
      of 13th September, 1983 under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_1">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,
      1958. The said Indian registration covers "bonbons, chews, peppermint,
      toffees, licorice articles and other articles" all included in class 30.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    That the plaintiff filed application for registration of the trademark
      MENTOS in label format on 8.5.1997 under number 756010 in class 30
      of the Fourth Schedule of the then prevailing Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_2">Merchandise
      Marks Act</a>, 1958. By virtue of international adoption since the year 1929
      and international registrations which dates back to the year 1967, 1970,
      1971 and 1972 in the respective countries and in India since the year

       1983, plaintiff claims itself to be the prior adopter, prior user, and prior
      registered proprietor of the said well known trademark MENTOS
      worldwide and in India in respect of chewing gum etc. Mr.Sushant Singh,
      submits that the said trademark has earned considerable goodwill and
      reputation and sale of the goods under the said trademark runs into multi-
      crores of rupees, as detailed in para 15 of the plaint.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    The cause of action of the plaintiff in the present case emanates from the
      trademark application, which was filed by the Plaintiff in the year 2001.
      At the examination stage, the conflicting mark of the Defendants bearing
      no.331030 for the mark MENTOS was cited which stood already
      registered. The said trademark was applied by the defendant on the basis
      of proposed use. During a market survey, it was revealed that no product
      of the defendants under the trademark MENTOS existed in the market. It
      is submitted that the defendants have obtained registration of the said
      trademark illegitimately without any intention to use the same and the
      said trademark is ex facie illegal and without any intention to use the same
      in India. The plaintiff thereafter filed a cancellation petition. However, in
      the year 2003, the defendants published an advertisement in the
      "Economic Times" newspaper indicating their intention to sell their
      registered trademark MENTOS. Counsel submits that such an act on the
      part of the defendants firmly proves that the defendants had been holding
      on to the trademark with the sole intention of selling it at a profit, and
      made an attempt to do so in the year 2003 when faced with the
      cancellation action filed by the plaintiff. The rectification proceedings are
      still pending before the Trade marks Registry, Mumbai. In this backdrop,
      the plaintiff has filed the present suit restraining defendants from using
      the trademark MENTOS and also causing passing off by selling the said
      trademark to any trader which may be detrimental / prejudicial to the

      the plaintiff, and /or its associate or group companies, are available in
      over 130 countries of the world including India under famous and well
      known trade marks such as detailed in the plaint.
</p><p id="p_9">9.    Mr.Ahuja, PW-1 has also deposed that the plaintiff and /or its
      predecessors have been in the confectionery business for over a hundred
      years.   Izaak Van Melle, in the year 1900, started the confectionery
      business under the family name Van Melle in Breskens, the Netherlands,
      concentrating on sugar confectionery. In the year 1944, the predecessor
      of the plaintiff, moved its factory to Rotterdam as the factory and facilities

</p><p id="p_10">10.   PW-1 has also deposed that the Van Melle Group continued to improve its
      products and expanded its activities through 1960s and 1970s. In the
      process, the Van Melle Group opened several new sales organizations and
      production facilities in Brazil, Belgium, France, Germany and the
      U.S.A. It is also deposed by this witness that some time during the
      1980s, the plaintiff moved its main factory and headquarters to Breda and
      acquired companies such as Verduijn, Loo-O-Look and Peco. In 1989,
      Van Melle started exporting its products to Central and Eastern
      Europe. The Sales companies were set up in this area, as well as a factory
      in Poland and a packing unit in Russia. In 1997, Van Melle expanded its
      operations to China by setting up a new factory in Shenzen.
</p><p id="p_11">11.   Mr.Ahuja, has also deposed that Perfetti S.p.A, a company engaged in
      similar business, after several years of close operations with the Van
      Melle Group, merged with the Van Melle Group through acquisition of all
      the shares of Van Melle by Perfetti S.p.A to form the Perfetti Van Melle
      Group in March 2001. The combined strength of the two entities have
      synergized to form one of the most formidable confectionery majors in
      the world, giving the consumers the benefit of world class quality at
      affordable prices.
</p><p id="p_12">12.   PW-1 has also deposed that the plaintiff and/or its associate and group

      located in Breda and Weert. The plaintiff and /or its associate/group
      companies have a large number of sales and distribution offices
      throughout the world.
</p><p id="p_14">14.   It has also been deposed by this witness that the predecessor-in-title of the
      plaintiff had honestly coined and adopted the expression MENTOS in the
      year 1929 in order to distinguish its goods, being specialized candies, and
      the said mark is inherently distinctive. The candy manufactured and sold
      by the plaintiff and or its associate /group companies under the mark

      mark MENTOS is currently available in mint and fruit flavours.
</p><p id="p_15">15.   PW-1 has further deposed that by virtue of original adoption and
      extensive use worldwide, the expression MENTOS, particularly in
      relation to candies and other related goods has become exclusively
      associated with the plaintiff and/or its associate/subsidiary/group
      companies in the eyes of consumers all over the world, including India.

      collectively marked as Ex. PW-1/2.
</p><p id="p_17">16.   Mr.Ahuja, has also deposed that the plaintiff had applied for and obtained
      registration for the mark MENTOS under Application Number 410587 in
      Class 30 as of 13th September, 1983 under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_3">Merchandise

      application is marked as Ex.PW-1/4
</p><p id="p_19">18.   PW-1 has further deposed that as a result of its extensive international
      use, the trade mark MENTOS has become distinctive in the eyes of
      consumers all over the world, including India.             Even prior to its
      introduction in India, the products originating from the plaintiff had
      acquired significant goodwill and reputation, and consumers in India, at
      all material times, identified the plaintiff, and/or its predecessors in title,
      as the source thereof. Such identification of the plaintiff as the source or
      origin of products bearing the trademark MENTOS has conferred on the
      plaintiff the exclusive right to use the said mark.
</p><p id="p_20">19.   PW-1 has also deposed that on account of their immense popularity, the
      plaintiff decided to launch its products in India. In India, the plaintiff
      carries on its activities through its associate/group company, Van Melle
      Confectionery India Private Limited, a company incorporated under the
      <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and in existence since 1997.                  Van Melle
      Confectionery India Private Limited in effect conducts its business using
      the technology and the Trade Marks of the plaintiff and /or its associate or
      parent company, under an arrangement with the plaintiff and/or its
      associate or parent company, and is rated as one of the best companies in
      India in the business of confectionery, with brands such as MENTOS,
      CENTER SHOCK, CENTER FRESH, ALPENLIEBE, COFITOS,
      CHLORMINT, GOLIA, HAPPYDENT, VIVIDENT, BIG BABOL,
      FRUITELLA etc. The plaintiff through its associate/group company in
      India, has a total turnover of Rs.252.435 crores and Rs.295.48 crores for
      the years ending 31st December 2001 and 31st December 2002

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                       Page 8 of 24</span>
       respectively.
</p><p id="p_21">20.   It has also been deposed by this witness that the plaintiff, through its
      associate/group company in India, has already spent Rupees 9.87 crores
      on advertising and promoting the product since its launch in India in the
      year 1999. The plaintiff, through Van Melle Confectionery India Private
      Limited, has attained a turnover of Rs.8.825 crores and Rs.6.335 crores
      for its products under the trademark MENTOS in the calendar years 2001
      and 2002 respectively.      The above stated revenue and promotional
      expenditure in respect of goods sold under the trade mark MENTOS
      establishes the goodwill and reputation the said product has generated in
      favour of the plaintiff vis-à-vis its products under the trademark
      MENTOS.
</p><p id="p_22">21.   Mr.Ahuja has next deposed that the plaintiff received its examination
      report in respect of the Trade Mark Application No.756010 on 18 th July
      2001. The plaintiff was surprised to learn from the said report that the
      first defendant already had a registration for the Trade mark MENTOS
      under number 331030 covering cakes, candy for food, caramels,
      chocolate, chocolate cream, marzipan (chocolate), chewing gum,
      lozenges, puddings, pastries, sugar, sweets, sweetmeats, wafers (biscuits)
      in class 30. The said registration was cited as a conflicting mark in
      respect of the plaintiff‟s aforesaid application. However, upon hearing the
      Trade Mark Attorney of the plaintiff, at the time of hearing of the First
      Official Report, the Registrar of Trade Marks was pleased to accept the
      said application in Part A of the Register and directed that the said
      application would be advertised in the Trade Marks Journal. Copy of the
      said order of the Asstt. Registrar of Trade Marks dated 26th June, 2003 has
      been placed on record. The plaintiff thereafter conducted an investigation
      into the affairs of the defendants. The investigation revealed that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                    Page 9 of 24</span>
       mark of the defendants was registered as of 28th November 1977, but
      market investigation revealed that there was no use of the said Trade
      Mark. In fact, the defendants in their application for registration had
      claimed that they „proposed to use‟ the mark MENTOS. An extract from
      the Trade Marks Journal No.707 page 687 dated November 16 th 1978
      where the defendants‟ mark was advertised was filed along with the plaint
      and the same is marked as Exhibit PW1/5.
</p><p id="p_23">22.   Deponent further goes on to state that thereafter on 06.03.2003 the
      plaintiff has filed a cancellation petition on various grounds, copy of the
      cancellation petition is marked as Ex.PW-1/6.        This witness has also
      deposed that on or about 6th June 2003 the plaintiff was shocked to see
      that the defendants had placed an advertisement in the Economic Times,
      New Delhi edition dated 6th June 2003 indicating their intention to sell
      their registered mark MENTOS. Copy of the insertion placed by the
      defendants in the Economic Times has been exhibited as Ex.PW-1/7.
</p><p id="p_24">23.   Mr.Ahuja has also deposed that it is evident that the intention of the
      defendants in registering the mark MENTOS in its name is, or must have
      been, mala fide. From the advertisement itself it is apparent that the
      defendants have no intention to use the mark. The sole intention of the
      defendants is to obtain a high price for the said mark by encashing upon
      the goodwill of the plaintiff‟s mark MENTOS and taking undue
      advantage of the huge expenditure incurred by the plaintiff to promote the
      said mark. The witness has also deposed that it appears that to evade
      cancellation proceedings, the defendants made sporadic, negligible use of
      the mark, although their real motive has been to appropriate the goodwill
      accrued in respect of the plaintiff‟s trade mark. The mark MENTOS
      could not have been adopted by the defendants for any other reason but to
      pass off their goods and /or to enable a third party to pass off his goods as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                     Page 10 of 24</span>
       and for those of the plaintiff. The most obvious reason in advertising to
      sell the mark MENTOS appears to be in anticipation of obtaining a high
      price from the plaintiff. The defendants may also make illicit profits by
      selling the mark to some third party, thereby inducing and enabling such
      purchaser of the mark to make false representation to the ultimate
      customer and make illicit profits by doing so. In any event, the fact that
      the defendants have advertised their willingness to sell the mark indicates
      the intention of the defendants to infringe the plaintiff‟s proprietary rights
      over the Trade Mark MENTOS.
</p><p id="p_25">24.   PW-1 has further deposed that the plaintiff on coming to know about the
      said advertisement in the Economic Times, New Delhi edition dated 6th
      June 2003 filed a Suit No.2099/2003 before the Delhi High Court, for
      permanent Injunction, infringement of copyright, passing off and damages
      etc. against the defendants and an accompanying interlocutory application
      (IA No.11486/2003) under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151
      CPC. By order dated 9th December 2003, the Hon‟ble Court was pleased
      to grant ex parte injunction against the defendants, restraining the
      defendants from selling, assigning, or creating any third party interests in
      the registered trade mark MENTOS, till further orders.
</p><p id="p_26">25.   The deponent has next deposed that the plaintiff issued trade mark caution
      notices declaring their ownership and proprietorship of the subject trade

</p><p id="p_28">27.   PW-1 has also deposed that it is evident from the aforesaid, that the
      adoption of the aforesaid mark by the defendants is mala fide, designed to
      encash upon and intended to trade upon the vast goodwill and reputation
      that has come to be vested in the plaintiff internationally. The consumers,
      when exposed to the goods bearing the mark MENTOS are bound to be
      and would be confused about the source and origin, and deceived and /or
      led to believe that the defendants‟ goods are actually the goods of the
      plaintiff. Moreover, the defendants by offering their trade mark for sale
      would be aiding and abetting unscrupulous manufacturers of cheap,
      substandard products in deceiving the public at large and set in motion
      /abet further illegal acts like counterfeiting. Even the most discerning as
      a result of the identity of the competing marks and the goods covered by
      them.

      interest in or justification to use the mark MENTOS corresponding to the
      mark MENTOS of the plaintiff, which is the exclusive property of the
      plaintiff. The adoption of the plaintiff‟s trade mark MENTOS by the
      defendants is in total violation of the plaintiff‟s proprietary rights in and to
      the subject trade mark. The alleged use of the trademark MENTOS by the
      defendants and/or any person on their behalf, in relation to identical goods

       would induce and/ or is likely to induce the customers to associate the
      defendants‟ goods and business with those of the plaintiff. The said acts
      on the part of the defendants would cause irreparable loss and prejudice to
      the plaintiff, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms.
</p><p id="p_30">29.   After service the defendants put in appearance and filed the written
      statement, wherein the following defences have been raised.
</p><p id="p_31">             a)    The defendant is the registered proprietor of the trademark
                   MENTOS bearing no. 331030, as of 28.11.1977 with regard
                   to food products, in class 30.
</p><p id="p_32">            b)     The defendants are continuously using the said trademark
                   since when it was applied and the plaintiff is incorrect in
                   stating that defendants have never used the said trademark.
</p><p id="p_33">            c)     Plaintiff has not used the trademark "MENTOS" prior to
                   1999 in India, whereas defendant began using it 22 years
                   earlier, as a registered proprietor.
</p><p id="p_34">            d)     The suit for infringement is not maintainable as there is no
                   similarity between the labels/artistic work of the plaintiff.
                   The shade used by the defendant on the product is „green‟
                   whereas as the shade used by the plaintiff on their product is
                   „blue‟.
</p><p id="p_35">30.   Although the defendant has raised a plea of continuous user of the
      trademark MENTOS, the following documents have been filed:

<pre id="pre_2">            a)     Photocopy of registration certificate.
            b)     Artificial label created by the Defendants for the
                   trademark MENTOS.
            c)     Packaging of lozenges of the Defendants
            d)     Sales figures

      of the trade-mark MENTOS by the defendants and the defence set up is ex
      facie false and frivolous. The defence set up in the written statement has
      even otherwise not been substantiated, as no evidence has been led in the
      matter, nor the defendant has chosen to appear to defend the present
      proceedings. The defendants were proceeded ex parte on 04.02.2009.
      The plaintiff has led its ex parte evidence by filing a detailed affidavit of
      Mr.Sudhir D. Ahuja, Ex.PW-1/1.        That from the above, the following
      propositions emerge:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          a)   Whether the suit against the registered proprietor is maintainable
               on the basis of common law remedy of passing off?

<p id="p_37">32.   The question as to whether a suit against a registered proprietor is
      maintainable on the basis of Common Law remedy of passing off, is no

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "According to <a href="/doc/518582/" id="a_8">section 28(1)</a> of the Act, registration of a trade mark
            gives to the registered proprietor thereof exclusive right to use the
            same in. relation to the goods in respect of which it has been
            registered. But from the opening words of <a href="/doc/518582/" id="a_9">section 28(1)</a> namely,
            "subject to other provisions" it is clear that the right conferred on a
            trader is not an indefeasible right as the same is expressly made
            subject to other provisions of the Act. This is further, made clear by
            <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_10">section 27(2)</a> of the Act, which' provides that " nothing in this Act
            shall be deemed to affect the right of action against any person for
            passing off the goods as goods of another person or the remedies in
            respect thereof." Thus it is manifest that <a href="/doc/375514/" id="a_11">Section 28</a> of the Act and
            all other provisions come within the '" 'over riding sway of <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_12">section
            27(2)</a> of the Act. Similarly <a href="/doc/187252/" id="a_13">section 33</a> of the Act also saves vested
            rights of a prior user. It lays down that nothing in the Act shall
            entitle a registered proprietor of a trade mark to interfere with the
            use of the trade mark by a prior user of the same. Thus the right
            created by <a href="/doc/518582/" id="a_14">section 28(1)</a> of the Act in favour of a registered
            proprietor of a trade mark is not an absolute right and is subservient
            to other provisions of the Act namely <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_15">sections 27(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/187252/" id="a_16">33</a> etc. Neither
            <a href="/doc/375514/" id="a_17">section 28</a> nor any other provision of the Act bars an action for
            passing off by. an anterior user of a trade mark against a registered
            user of the same.- In other words registration of a trade mark does
            not provide a defence to the proceedings for passing off as under
            <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_18">section 27(2)</a> of the Act a prior user of a trade mark can maintain an
            action for passing off against any subsequent user of an identical
            trade mark including a registered user thereof. Again this right is
            not affected by <a href="/doc/680361/" id="a_19">section 31</a> of the Act, under which the only
            presumption that follows from registration of a mark is its prima
            facie evidentiary value about its validity and nothing more. This
            presumption is not an unrepeatable one &amp; can be displaced. Besides
            <a href="/doc/680361/" id="a_20">section 31</a> is not immune to the over-riding effect of <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_21">section 27(2)</a>.
            Placing reliance on <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_22">section 28(3)</a> of the Act the learned counsel for
            the appellant contended that when two registered proprietors of
            identical or near similar trade marks cannot be deemed to have
            acquired exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks
            against each other, how can an unregistered user of the trade mark
            maintain an action for passing off against a registered user of the
            same mark and seek an injunction restraining him from using it.
            This argument of the learned counsel seems to stem from a
            misconception about the real purpose and intent of <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_23">section 28(3)</a>.
            Actually <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_24">section 28(3)</a> protects registered proprietor of a trade mark
            from an infringement action by another registered proprietor of an

             identical or near similar trade mark. In this regard it will also be
            necessary to extract <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_25">Section 28(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/358923/" id="a_26">section 30(1)(d)</a> which
            carries out the intent of <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_27">section 28(3)</a>. These sections read as

                   right to the use of that trade mark given by registration under

            (32) A reading of <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_28">section 28(3)</a> with <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_29">section 30(l)(d)</a> shows that the
            proprietor of a registered trade mark cannot file an infringement
            action against a proprietor of an identical or a similar trade mark.
            While <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_30">sections 28(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_31">30(l)(d)</a> on the one hand deal with the
            rights of registered proprietors of identical trade marks and bar
            action of infringement against each other. <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_32">Section 27(2)</a> on the
            other hand deals with the passing off action. The rights of action
            under <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_33">section 27(2)</a> are not affected by <a href="/doc/1253988/" id="a_34">section 28(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_35">section
            30(l)(d)</a>. Therefore, registration of a trade mark under the Act
            would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. Registration of a
            trade mark in fact does not confer any new right on the proprietor
            thereof than what already existed at common law without
            registration of the mark. The right of goodwill &amp; reputation in a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                       Page 16 of 24</span>
             trade mark was recognised at common law even before it was
            subject of statutory law. Prior to codification of trade mark law
            there was no provision in India for registration of a trade mark. The
            right in a trade mark was acquired only by use thereof.This right
            has not been affected by the Act and is preserved and recognised by
            <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_36">sections 27(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/187252/" id="a_37">33</a>."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">33.   From a bare reading of the observations made by the Division Bench it
      becomes clear that <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_38">Section 27(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with
      <a href="/doc/1373361/" id="a_39">Section 29</a> gives the <a href="/doc/1365016/" id="a_40">Section 27(2)</a> an overriding effect over and above the
      other provisions of the act due to its opening words "nothing in this
      act....". Therefore, the passing off remedy is a broader remedy and can
      defeat even the rights of a registered trademark and consequently the suit
      against the registered proprietor is maintainable on the ground of prior use
      and trans-boarder reputation. This has also been affirmed by Hon‟ble
      Supreme Court in the said judgment of the Whirlpool (Supra).

<p id="p_40">35.   Aforesaid documents confirm that the adoption and use of the trademark
      by the plaintiff along with goodwill and reputation of the trademark
      MENTOS coupled with Indian registration since 1983 as well as its
      international user. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_41">Milment
      Oftho Industries v. Allergan Inc</a>., 2004 (28) PTC 585 (Supreme Court),
      has extended the proposition in Whirlpool (supra) by stating that the prior
      use in the world will prevail over and above the use of the mark in India
      when it comes to reputation of well known trade marks and the anomalous
      situation that parallel question of identical trademarks in identical goods
      cannot be allowed to run in India vis-à-vis other countries of the world. In
      the present case, not only the plaintiff qualifies the aforesaid propositions
      but the product of the plaintiff is available and is being sold under the
      trademark MENTOS extensively in India as well. The Apex court
      observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">            Thus, if a mark in respect of a drug is associated with the
            Respondents worldwide it would lead to an anomalous situation if
            an identical mark in respect of a similar drug is allowed to be sold
            in India. However one note of caution must be expressed.
            Multinational corporations, who have no intention of coming to
            India or introducing their product in India should not be allowed to
            throttle an Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a product in
            India, if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the mark and
            developed the product and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate
            test should be who is first in the market. In the present case, the
            marks are the same. They are in respect of pharmaceutical products.
            The mere fact that the Respondents have not been using the mark in
            India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world market. The
            Division Bench had relied upon material which prima-facie shows
            that the Respondents product was advertised before the Appellants
            entered the field. On the basis of that material the Division Bench

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                     Page 18 of 24</span>
             has concluded that the Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If
            that be so then no fault can be found with the conclusion drawn by
            the Division Bench. However, it was submitted on behalf of the
            Appellants that the Respondents were not the first to use the mark.
            It was submitted that there was no proof that the Respondents had
            adopted the mark and used the mark before the Appellants started
            using the mark in India. In our view, these are matters which would
            require examination on evidence. Considering the fact that for all
            these years, because of the injunction Order, the Appellants have
            sold their product under some other name, the balance of
            convenience is that the injunction order be continued and the
            hearing of the Suit be expedited. If on evidence it is proved that the
            Respondents had adopted the mark prior to the Appellants doing so,
            on the settled law, then the Respondents would become entitled to
            an injunction. However, if on evidence it is shown that the
            Respondents had not adopted the mark prior to its use in India by
            the Appellants then, undoubtedly, the trial Court would vacate the
            injunction. The trial Court would undoubtedly then assess the
            damage which Appellants have suffered for having wrongly not
            been allowed to use the mark for all these years.

<p id="p_41">36.   Applying the aforesaid observations of the Supreme Court to the facts of
      the present case, it becomes patently clear that the plaintiff is
      internationally a prior user and prior adopted of the trademark MENTOS.
      The plaintiff is using the mark in India as well. A prior use creates/confers
      the rights upon the person who actually uses the trademark in the course
      of trade. There is also no quarrel with the proposition that the rights
      created by virtue of use are conferred upon the person who actually uses
      the trademark in the trade and not the person who is mere adopter of the
      trademark and this proposition has been extensively discussed by the
      Division Bench in <a href="/doc/57269371/" id="a_42">Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd v. M/s Goodwill
      Enterprises</a>, reported at (2009) 41 PTC 362 (Del) (DB) wherein the
      Hon‟ble Court observed that similar kind of situation has arisen wherein
      the plaintiff has been the user of the said trademark MENTOS in India
      extensively since 1983 and internationally on 1929 and more specifically

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                     Page 19 of 24</span>
       its registrations dates back to 1967, 1970, 1971 and 1972 in respective
      countries. The above facts coupled with continuous use reveal that the
      plaintiff is extensively using the trademark MENTOS in respect of
      chewing gums and defendants, although claim themselves to be registered
      proprietor of the trademark since the year 1977, have never used the said
      trademark and the plea of the defendants that it had actually used the mark
      continuously, is false which is also reflected from the inactions of the
      defendants by choosing not to contest the suit. Therefore the plaintiff can
      be said to be prior user and prior adopter of the trademark MENTOS more
      specifically in view of the applicability of observations of Hon‟ble
      Supreme Court in Milment (supra) and Pioneer (supra):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                   B &amp; C)   REGISTRATION DOES NOT AMOUNT TO
                   USE AND DEFENDANTS CANNOT BE SAID TO BE
                   USER OF THE SAID TRADEMARK MENTOS WHEN
                   THERE IS NO COGENT AND CONTINUOUS USE IN
                   THE MARKET.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">37.   This court has time and again in catena of cases observed that the mere
      entry on the Register does not testify the user of the trademark. This
      proposition was laid down way back in 1978 by Division Bench in the
      case of <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_43">Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar Co</a>., on 27 April, 1977
      AIR 1978 Delhi 250, 15 (1979) DLT 269.
</p>
<p id="p_43">            (14) Thus, the law is pretty well-settled that in order to succeed at
            this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark
            prior in point of time than the impugned user by the respondents.
            The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of
            time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action passing off
            and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the
            trade mark registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose
            names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes
            of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence
            had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                    Page 20 of 24</span>
<p id="p_44">             In our opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by the
            learned Single Judge and led him to commit an error.
</p>
<p id="p_45">38.   It is also apparent from the defendants‟ inaction not to contest the present
      proceedings that the defendants have only the trademark registration as
      their defence. However, it is clear that mere registration is no defence in
      the suit of passing off in view of observations of this Court in the case of
      Whirpool (supra) and also does not establish its use in view of Century
      (supra). Accordingly, the defendants cannot rely on a trademark
      registration as a matter of defence to testify its use and no special equities
      can be claimed on the basis of mere factum of registration.
</p><p id="p_46">39.   The present case is also fully covered by the observations made in the
      case of Century Traders (Supra), although the defendants have claimed
      themselves to be the registered proprietor of the trade mark MENTOS, but
      they have failed to place any documents on record, nor any evidence has
      been led to substantiate the said plea raised by them. Even otherwise the
      mere fact that the defendants have placed an advertisement in the
      newspaper in the year 2003 clearly reveals the intention of the defendant
      was never to use the said trade mark, but to sell the same mark to a third
      party competitor to encash upon the goodwill and reputation.
</p><p id="p_47">40.   Having regard to the facts of the present case and the evidence placed on
      record, there is little room for doubt that the plaintiff is entitled to the
      reliefs claimed in the plaint and the action of the defendant is motivated
      with a view to sell the trade mark MENTOS to a third party.
</p><p id="p_48">41.   It is also submitted that a clear cut case of passing off is established in
      view of dictum of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_44">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals
      Ltd</a>. (2001) 5 SCC 73. Relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced

<p id="p_49">42.   I am satisfied that the plaintiff will suffer incalculable harm and injury to
      its goodwill, reputation and business in general if the defendant is allowed
      to carry on their aforesaid illegal activities in complete disregard to the
      statutory and common law rights of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_50">43.   Accordingly, the interim order dated 09.12.2003 is confirmed.            The
      plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the plaintiff is the prior adopter
      and prior user of the trade mark MENTOS. Plaintiff is also declared to be
      the copyright holder of the label comprising of the mark MENTOS and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) 2099/2003                                                      Page 22 of 24</span>
       the defendants have imitated the said label. The plaintiff has been able to
      establish a case of passing off.
</p><p id="p_51">44.   The documents placed on record would show that the plaintiff is the prior
      international as well as the prior adopter of the mark MENTOS in India
      with respect to identical goods. The consumers of the said products are
      children, who are less discerning and moreso in relation to the identical
      trademarks. The likelihood of confusion cannot be doubted and in fact
      there is grave likelihood of confusion and deception, if the defendants are
      allowed to use the said trade-mark or authorize to sell the same to any
      other person, who may launch the product in the market. It is clear that
      the defendants have merely copied the trade-mark deliberately with a
      view to piggy bag and ride over the long standing reputation of the
      plaintiff acquired with the passage of time, internationally and in India.
      The defendants have also chosen not to contest the matter and thus the
      plaintiff is also entitled to the benefit of damages with a view to ensure
      that such litigants desist from indulging into such activities and they are
      not given benefit of the acts, which resulted to the loss to the plaintiff, and
      absenting themselves from appearing in the court. It would be useful to
      refer to the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1152738/" id="a_45">Time Incorporated v. Lokesh
      Srivastava and Anr</a>., reported as 116 (2005) DLT 599 wherein this Court

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">            "This Court has no hesitation on saying that the time has come
            when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trade marks,

            damages but award punitive damages also with a view to
            discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations
            with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case
            they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the
            aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also,
            which may spell financial disaster for them"
