<p id="p_15">    4.        Mr.Dwarkadas, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

    petitioner, has contended that the petitioner acquired the right in the trade




                                                      
    mark by virtue of: (i) its use in relation to vendible goods; (b) its

    registration either for goods or for services; and (c) its acquisition through




                                          
    an assignment from its predecessors. The rights acquired through prior
                           
    use are however superior to rights acquired through registration, as

    registration does not confer any additional right. It is contended that in
                          
    other words, the common law rights are superior to statutory rights. In

    order to substantiate his contention, reliance is placed on the decision of
      


    this Court in <a href="/doc/1405951/" id="a_6">Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon &amp; Co. Pvt</a>.
</p>   



<p id="p_16">    Ltd. (AIR 1965 Bombay 35). It is, therefore, contended that as between

    the two competitors who are desirous of adopting such a mark, it is





    entirely a question of who gets there first. It is the case of the petitioner

    that the petitioner is the prior user of the mark "PROFOL" and, therefore,





    has acquired common law rights to use the mark which is superior to the

    rights acquired by the respondent no.1 by registration of the mark in the

    year 1992. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner,

    therefore, is that the petitioner is the proprietor of the mark "PROFOL".

    gives the registered proprietor of the trade mark exclusive right to use the

    trade mark in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the




                                                     
    trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of

    can be seen from the words of <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_8">section 28(1)</a> of the Act. It is submitted
                           
    that on the other hand, common law right under <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_9">section 27(2)</a> of the Act

    remains wholly unaffected as is evident from the starting words "Nothing

    passing off goods or services as the goods of another person or as services
      


    provided by another person, or the remedies in respect thereof." It is

    honestly from the ingredient molecule Propofol.             Therefore, such




                                                    
    adoption of the trade mark by the petitioner's predecessor was honest,

    trade mark "ROFOL".         It is contended that the petitioner's said
                          
    predecessor used to get its medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations

    manufactured under the trade mark "PROFOL" on a loan license basis
                         
    from its common law licensee, Core Laboratories Ltd. Core Laboratories

    and lawful proprietor of the said trade mark "PROFOL" by virtue of its

    the trade mark "PROFOL" in excess of Rs.325 crores. Such goodwill and

    reputation has been acquired by the petitioner in the said trade mark
      


    "PROFOL" which has become distinctive from the petitioner's goods and
   



    has further come to be identified in the trade and in the minds of the

    28.7.2005 the respondent no.1 was restrained from using the mark

    relying heavily on its registration and pointed out that such registration

    by the respondent no.1 also came to be dismissed by the Gujarat High




                                          
    Court on 19.12.2005.      Thus, it is contended by the counsel for the
                           
    petitioner that the proposition of common law rights acquired through use

    are superior to statutory rights acquired through prior registration. The
                          
    respondent no.1 filed a civil suit for infringement and passing off against

    the petitioner in this Court where no ad-interim or interim orders are
      


    passed in favour of the respondent no.1.         Mr.Dwarkadas, therefore,
   



    contended that in the instant case, it is absolutely clear that from the year

    1998, it is the petitioner's trade mark which is in use and the respondent





    no.1 has been rightfully restrained from using the impugned mark

    "ROFOL". Thus, it is the petitioner who is the true and rightful owner





    and lawful proprietor of the trade mark "PROFOL".

    trade mark by the licensee amounts to and enures to the benefit of the

    licensor. In the present case, the respondent no.1 had not used the trade




                                                    
    mark for 12 long years since its registration. It dishonestly commenced

    use, acquired proprietorship over the mark during the period when the

    on the ground of the alleged non-use of the trade mark "ROFOL" by the

    was limited to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_15">section 47</a> of the Act and, therefore, the

    from the year 1998, this makes no difference as admittedly the respondent

    no.1's registration is of 19.10.1992. On that date, the petitioner's mark

    basically refers to non-use of the trade mark by the respondent no.1 and,

    seek rectification under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_23">section 47</a> of the Act. This is evident from the

    grounds taken in paragraph 12 of the rectification application. There is





    no separate ground taken by the petitioner in the rectification application

    under <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_24">section 57</a> of the Act, but the allegations made regarding `entry

         passed in 1875. Even prior thereto, it was firmly




                                 
         established in England that a trader acquired a right
                  
         of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it

         upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the
                 
         length of such user and the extent of his trade, and

         that he was entitled to protect such right of property
      


         by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a
   



         Court of law. Then came the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_55">English Trade Marks

         country is concerned, Degoumois &amp; Co. have totally
                  
         disclaimed any interest in the proprietorship of that

         mark for watches etc. In India, the mark `Caltex'
                 
         was a totally new mark for watches and allied

         goods. The applicant was the originator of that mark
      


         so far as that class of goods is concerned, and so far
   



         as this country is concerned. He in fact used it in

         respect of watches. There is no evidence that that





         mark was used by anyone else in this country before

         the applicant, in connection with that class of goods.

<p id="p_76">                Monarch" in this country, the opponents had a

                not entitled to claim the mark as a proprietor and

                apply for registration thereof.    In that case the
                         
                opponents had established prior user of the mark

                which was sought to be registered by another and,
      


                therefore, the registration was rightly refused. But
   



                the facts of this case are different. Here the user

                pleaded by the opponents is subsequent to the date





                of application for registration.    The appellants

    based on user of the mark from 1998 and, therefore, the decision of this

    Court in Consolidated Foods Corporation does not further the case of the




                                         
    petitioner. The Madras High Court has also observed in the judgement in

                 establish that he is the proprietor of the trade mark

         the familiar language, entirely a question of who

         mark first should be protected. But that principle
                  
         will not apply to cases of registration of trade

         marks under <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_67">Section 18</a> which permits a person
      


         claiming proprietary interest and proposing to use
   



         the mark, without actually using the same. If the

         principle of "who enters the field first" is adopted





         for purpose of registration, then <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_68">Section 18</a>

         enabling a person proposing to use a trade mark to





         apply for registration will be meaningless, as any

         person using that mark subsequently can easily

         defeat   the     earlier   application          for     such

    that the petitioner started the use of the mark "PROFOL" first with effect





    from April 1998 i.e. prior to the use of the mark "ROFOL" by the

    respondent no.1, since the same is subsequent to the date of registration of

    petitioner and reflected in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 would show that

    the primary ground of the petitioner seeking removal of trade mark of the

    the name of the respondent no.1 in respect of the goods pharmaceutical





    preparation, which is registered on the application by the respondent no.1

               months would complete on 15.12.2006.                The

               since 2004 till the injunction was granted by the

    14.9.2001.    The petitioner submitted application for rectification on

    1.3.2006. It is, therefore, clear that the statutory period of five years and

    years and three months prior to the date of the application would have

    for rectification on 1.3.2006 i.e. nine months before completion of the

    and the application of the petitioner for rectification was submitted on
   



    1.3.2006 which clearly shows that non-use of the trade mark by the

    rectification application by the petitioner. <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_87">Section 57</a> provides the power

    to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register. Sub-section (1)




                                                     
    contemplates that application made in the prescribed manner, Appellate

    Board or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved, the Tribunal may make




                                         
    such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registered trade
                           
    mark on the ground of any contravention, or failure to observe the

    condition entered on the register in relation thereto.          Perusal of the
                          
    rectification application does not show any ground raised by the petitioner

    in order to demonstrate that the respondent no.1 committed contravention
      


    or failed to observe a condition entered in the register in relation thereto.

<p id="p_89">    Similarly, sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_88">section 57</a> contemplates that any person

    aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry made





    in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining

    on the register, or by any error or defect in any entry in the register, may





    apply in the prescribed manner to the Appellate Board or to the Registrar,

    and the tribunal may make such order for making, expunging or varying

    the entry as it may think fit. Perusal of the rectification application would

    therefore, the same is defective as the registered proprietor has not used

    the mark and has no intention to use the mark even after registration for a




                                                      
    sufficiently long period. Similar grounds are raised in paragraphs 15 and

    16 of the application. In the instant case, the respondent no.1 though got




                                          
    the mark "ROFOL" registered on 19.10.1992, the same was re-registered
                           
    on 14.9.2001 and also started use of the said mark with effect from

    16.10.2004 and, therefore, the impugned order passed by the Board is
                          
    sustainable in law. The relevant observations made by the Board in
