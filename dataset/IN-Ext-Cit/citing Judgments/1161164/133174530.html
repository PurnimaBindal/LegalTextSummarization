</pre><p id="p_1">1.     The present petition has been filed challenging the impugned order
dated 6th November, 2019, passed by the Joint Controller of Patents and
Designs (hereinafter, &quot;Controller&quot;), by which the Petitioner‟s/Patentee‟s
(hereinafter, &quot;Patentee&quot;) interlocutory petition, seeking rejection of
Respondent No.3‟s/Opponent‟s (hereinafter, &quot;Opponent&quot;) documents and
evidence, has been dismissed, and the matter has been fixed for final hearing
of the post-grant opposition on 22nd November, 2019.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The brief background is that the Patentee was granted Indian Patent



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 1 of 27</span>
 No.262968. The publication of the grant took place on 3rd October, 2014. On
24th September, 2015, the Opponent - M/s. Laurus Lab Pvt. Ltd. filed a post-
grant opposition under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_1">Section 25(2)</a> of the Patents Act, 1970 (hereinafter,
&quot;Act&quot;), along with the evidence of <a href="/doc/126575628/" id="a_2">Dr. CH. V. Ramana Rao</a>, the Opponent‟s
Head of the Intellectual Property Management Division. The Patentee filed
its response to the said opposition, along with the evidence of an expert Dr.
Alexander James Bridges, on 23rd December, 2015.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The Opposition Board, which was constituted by the Controller,
thereafter, submitted its recommendation. The said recommendation was
forwarded to the parties on 14th September, 2017, and the matter was fixed
for hearing on 16th November, 2017. The Opponent filed a request for
adjournment of the hearing scheduled on 16 November, 2017 on the ground
of personal difficulty.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     Vide notice dated 14th August, 2019, the hearing in the post-grant
opposition was fixed for 25th September, 2019. At that stage, a flurry of
activity took place, wherein the Opponent sought to file additional
documents on 10th September, 2019, and further evidence on 19th
September, 2019. In view of the fresh documents and evidence filed, and
due to difficulty of counsel, the Patentee sought an adjournment of the
hearing scheduled on 25th September, 2019.
</p><p id="p_5">5.     Thereafter, the Patentee took the position that the fresh documents
and evidence filed by the Opponent ought not to be taken on record, as the
same were belatedly filed and contrary to the Patents Rules, 2003
(hereinafter, &quot;Rules&quot;). Miscellaneous petitions praying for the additional
documents/evidence to not be taken on record, were filed by the Patentee.
</p><p id="p_6">6.     The interlocutory petition was heard, and vide order dated 6th

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 2 of 27</span>
 November, 2019, the Controller has come to the conclusion that the
documents and evidence filed by the Opponent would be taken on record,
and would be considered at the time of final adjudication. The Patentee
sought an adjournment on 7th November, 2019, and the matter has remained
pending since then. In the meantime, the Patentee has also filed a response
to the additional documents/evidence filed by the Opponent.
</p><p id="p_7">7.     The grievance of the Patentee is that there is a scheme which is
prescribed under the Rules, read with <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_3">Section 25(2)</a> to (4) of the Act. The
Controller has given this scheme a go-by, and the post-grant opposition,
despite being pending since 2015, has still not been decided by the
Controller. Ld. counsel submits that a perusal of Rules 55A to 62 reveals
that there is a particular procedure that has to be followed, and at every
stage, timelines have been provided in order to ensure that there is no delay
in the decision of the post-grant opposition. It is further submitted that even
though Rules 137 and 138 give leeway for taking evidence on record even at
a later stage, the same ought not to be exercised in a manner detrimental to
the Patentee‟s interest. On behalf of the Patentee, it has been submitted that
the phrase &quot;at the hearing&quot; in Rule 62(4) should be interpreted as the first
hearing and not subsequent hearings, inasmuch as adjournments are being
sought by Opponent before the Patent Office and the period of adjournment
is being used to file fresh documents and evidence. Thus, it is submitted that
evidence and documents should be frozen once the first date of hearing is
fixed. If, for any reason, the hearing is adjourned, further evidence ought not
to be permitted.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     It is further submitted that under Rule 62(4), if any publication is
sought to be relied upon, sufficient cause has to be shown as to why it could

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                   Page 3 of 27</span>
 not be filed earlier, though discretion would still lie with the Controller to
decide whether the publication ought to be taken on record or not. In order
to ensure that publications which are filed at a late stage, i.e., just five days
before the hearing, do not derail the hearing, the relevant portions of these
publications ought to be highlighted at the time when service is made, in
order to ensure that the party served is not put through the rigour of
examining the document end-to-end at such short notice.
</p><p id="p_9">9.     Finally, it is urged that when documents and evidence, especially
under Rule 59, are filed, the same should be confined to the Patentee‟s
evidence and anything beyond the Patentee‟s evidence ought not to be taken
on record.
</p><p id="p_10">10.    On the other hand, ld. counsel for the Opponent submits that a perusal
of Rule 60, as also Rule 62 (4), shows that even 5 days prior to the hearing
date, fresh publications can be relied upon by the Opponent. Ld. counsel
further submits that the Controller can also grant leave for filing of evidence
under Rules 60 and 137. It is further submitted that the scheme governing
post-grant opposition is not strict, as in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015,
and the purpose of the Rules is to enable documents, if relevant for deciding
the validity of the patent, to be taken on record right till the culmination of
the proceedings. Ld. counsel for Opponent, submits that the scheme of the
Act vests enormous discretion in the Controller to decide as to which
documents ought to be taken on record and at what stage. Ld. counsel urges
that the nature of grounds which are raised by the Opponent for opposing the
grant of patents being quite broad in nature, for example, prior public use,
source of original biological material, prior knowledge, etc., collection of
documents and evidence is a continuous process which ought to be flexible

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                     Page 4 of 27</span>
 till the final hearing is concluded before the Controller.
</p><p id="p_11">11.    It is submitted that instead of reducing the discretion of the Controller,
who is hearing the post-grant opposition, as in the EU, an overall time-limit
can be fixed for deciding the post-grant opposition, instead of micro-
managing the same at every stage. Reliance is placed on the guidelines
passed by the European Patent Office, dated 1st July, 2016, according to
which opposition cases should be attempted to be disposed of in around 15
months.
</p><p id="p_12">12.    Ld. counsel further submits that in the European Patent Office, even
at the stage of oral hearing of the opposition, fresh documents are permitted
to be relied upon by the parties. Ld. counsel relies upon the document titled
&quot;Opposition System&quot; published by WIPO, which also permits filing of
documents in an opposition proceeding at a late stage.
</p><p id="p_13">13.    Reliance is also placed on the opposition procedure document
published by WIPO, to submit that even WIPO records the role that an
opposition plays in the patenting system and submits that usually a 6 to 12-
month period is the duration in which the oppositions are to be decided.
</p><p id="p_14">14.    It is further urged that the Controller always has the discretion to
impose costs, even heavy costs, under <a href="/doc/1583608/" id="a_4">Section 77</a>, if a party is unreasonably
delaying the matter by filing documents, or for whatever reason, including
taking of adjournments.
</p><p id="p_15">15.    The ld. ASG, submits that under Rule 129A, the number of
adjournments that can be granted have already been curbed and the said
provision itself takes care of the apprehension of the Patentee that the matter
would be indefinitely adjourned and delayed.
</p><p id="p_16">16.    In rejoinder, it is submitted by ld. counsel for the Petitioner that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                     Page 5 of 27</span>
 application moved in this case for taking on record additional documents
does not give any valid or plausible reasons for not filing the same at the
first stage. He further submits that the Rules ought to be interpreted in a
manner so as to bar filing of documents and evidence once notice of hearing
is issued. Adjournment of hearing cannot re-open the timelines under Rules
60 and 62.

<p id="p_17">Analysis and Conclusions
</p><p id="p_18">17.    Under the existing scheme of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_5">Patents Act</a>, 1970 (hereinafter
referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;, oppositions can be filed at two stages i.e. at the pre-
grant stage - i.e., before the grant of patent and at the post-grant stage - i.e.,
after the grant of patent. The grounds for filing pre-grant oppositions are
stipulated in <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_6">Section 25(1)</a> of the Act. The grounds for filing post-grant
oppositions are stipulated in <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_7">Section 25(2)</a> of the Act. A pre-grant opposition
can be filed by any person whereas a post-grant opposition can be filed by
any &quot;person interested&quot;. <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_8">Sections 25(2)</a> to (6) dealing with post-grant

            time a dichotomy was inserted in the Patent Law by
            providing vide <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_19">Section 25(1)</a> for &quot;opposition to pre-
            grant&quot; and vide <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_20">Section 25(2)</a> for &quot;opposition to post-
            grant&quot; of patent.... Previously, there was no &quot;post-
            grant opposition.... There is, however, a radical shift
            due to incorporation of <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_21">Section 25(2)</a> where an
            interested party is granted the right to challenge the
            patent after its grant....However, <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_22">Section 25(1)</a> is
            wider than <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_23">Section 25(2)</a> as the latter is available only
            to a &quot;person aggrieved&quot;. The main difference between
            <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_24">Section 25(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_25">Section 25(2)</a>, as brought about by
            <a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_26">Patents (Amendment) Act</a>, 2005, is that even after a
            patent is granted, &quot;post-grant opposition&quot; can be filed
            under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_27">Section 25(2)</a> for a period of one year. The
            reason is obvious. In relation to patents that are of
            recent origin, a higher scrutiny is necessary. This is the
            main rationale underlying <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_28">Section 25(2)</a> of the said
            1970 Act. Therefore, the Legislature intended an

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">            &quot;..Distinction between pre-grant and post-grant
            opposition
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">            13. In the first instance a distinction has to be drawn
            between a pre-grant opposition and a post-grant
            opposition. While a pre-grant opposition can be filed
            under <a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_33">Section 25(1)</a> of the Patents Act at any time after
            the publication of the patent application but before the
            grant of a patent, a post-grant opposition under
            <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_34">Section 25(2)</a> of the Patents Act has to be filed before
            the expiry of one year from the date of the publication
            of the grant of patent. A second significant difference,
            after the amendment of 2005, is that a pre-grant
            opposition can be filed by any person. whereas a post-
            grant opposition under <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_35">Section 25(2)</a> can be filed only
            by any person interested.. It may be noticed that the
            application for revocation of a patent in terms of
            <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_36">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act can also to be filed only
            by any person interested.. In other words, the post-
            grant opposition and the application for revocation
            cannot be filed by just about any person who is not
            shown to be a person who is interested. A third
            significant difference is that the representation at the
            stage of pre-grant is considered by the Controller
            himself. Rule 55 of the Patents Rules requires the
            Controller to consider the statement and evidence filed
            by the applicant. and thereafter either refuse to grant
            the patent or require the complete specification to be
            amended to his satisfaction. Of course, in that event
            notice will be given to the applicant for grant of patent
            who can file his reply and evidence. This Court finds
            merit in the contention that the pre-grant opposition is
            in fact in aid of the examination of the patent
            application by the Controller. The procedure is
            however different aspect as far as the post-grant
            opposition is concerned. There in terms of <a href="/doc/1548153/" id="a_37">Section
            25(3)</a>, the Controller has to constitute an Opposition


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                      Page 14 of 27</span>
             Board consisting of such officers as he may determine
            and refer to such Opposition Board the notice of
            opposition along with other documents for its
            examination and recommendations. After receiving the
            recommendations of the Opposition Board, the
            Controller gives the patentee and the opponent an
            opportunity of being heard. The Controller then takes a
            decision to maintain, amend or revoke the patent. The
            fourth major difference between the pre-grant and the
            post-grant opposition is that while in terms of <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_38">Section
            117A</a> an appeal to the IPAB is maintainable against
            the order of the Controller in a post-grant opposition

            not been expressly been made available against an

<p id="p_24">23.     From the settled judicial precedents quoted above and the provisions
of the Act, the difference in the procedures to be followed between pre-grant
and post-grant oppositions is well established. A post-grant is a proceeding
that can be filed within one year after the publication of the grant of the
patent. In a post-grant opposition, upon the filing of the post-grant
opposition and the pleadings/evidence being completed, an Opposition
Board is constituted which submits recommendations to the Controller. The
said recommendations are not binding in nature1. However, upon receipt of
the recommendations of the Board and after giving hearing to the parties, the
Controller may -

<p id="p_25">24.     The Rules however, lay down the detailed procedure to be followed in

 constitution of the Opposition Board under Rule 56, the following steps are
to be followed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">       i) The Opponent has to file the written statement of opposition
       (`Opposition‟) along with his evidence;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">       ii)The Patentee, if it wishes to contest the opposition has to file the
       reply statement (`Patentee‟s Reply‟) along with its evidence within a
       period of two months after receiving the opponent‟s opposition. If the
       patentee does not contest or file a reply/evidence, the patent would be
       deemed to be revoked;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">       iii)     Upon the Patentee filing its reply statement, the opponent has
       the opportunity to file the reply evidence (hereinafter „Opponent‟s
       Rejoinder‟) within one month upon receiving the patentee‟s reply.
       However, the said rejoinder would have to be strictly confined to the
       matters which have been raised in the patentee‟s evidence. Thus, there
       is no permissibility for the opponent to expand the scope of the
       rejoinder beyond the reply filed by the Patentee;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">       iv)      The Opposition Board constituted under Rule 56 would then
       consider all the documents filed by the parties and submit a report
       along with its joint recommendation to the Controller.
</blockquote><p id="p_26">Thus, the scheme of the Rules envisages that the Opposition Board ought to
consider      all    the   pleadings   and   documents   prior   to   giving    its
recommendations. Further, the timelines which have been stipulated in the
Rules also show that the same ought to be followed strictly. From the time
when the patent is granted, therefore, the expectation would be that if a post-
grant opposition is filed, the same would be decided in an expeditious
manner.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                     Page 18 of 27</span>
<p id="p_27"> 25.    Rule 61 requires that all the documents which are filed are done so in
duplicate in order to ensure that the Opposition Board and the Controller
have their respective copies of all the filings. Subsequent to the completion
of presentation of evidence and after receiving the recommendations of the
Opposition Board, a hearing is fixed under Rule 62. The notice of hearing
would be issued and delivered to parties at least ten days prior to the
hearing. At the hearing, the Controller may require Members of the
Opposition Board to be present at the hearing. If either of the parties wishes
to be heard, the fee would be paid to the Controller along with giving a
notice. If no notice is received for a party to attend the hearing, the
Controller can decide the opposition without a hearing but the order shall
however contain the reasons for the decision. However, in oppositions,
owing to the nature of the proceedings being adversarial, hearings ought to
be granted, unless they are follow-on oppositions.
</p><p id="p_28">26.    So far, there appears no ambiguity. However, Rules 60 and 62(4) have
resulted in ambiguities in view of additional evidence which is sought to be
filed by either the Opponent or the Patentee. As per Rule 60, after the
completion of the pleadings and documents under Rule 57 to 59, a party is
permitted to seek leave for filing of further evidence. Rule 60 provides that
such leave can be sought only prior to the hearing being fixed. The language
used in the Proviso reads: &quot;Provided that such leave or direction is prayed
before the Controller has fixed the hearing under Rule 62&quot;
This makes it clear that filing of additional evidence would be permissible in
exceptional cases with the leave or direction of the Controller, but in any
event, the said filing can be done only prior to the hearing being fixed under
Rule 62. Once the hearing is fixed, thus, parties are not permitted to seek

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 19 of 27</span>
 leave to file further evidence.
</p><p id="p_29">27.    The next window for evidence is provided in view of Rule 62(4)
which provides that, five days prior to the hearing, a party can rely upon
„any publication‟ which may have not been filed earlier, provided five days‟
notice is given to the other party together with details of such publication.
</p><p id="p_30">28.    The question that has, therefore, arisen is whether after the
completion of the pleadings i.e. Opposition, Patentee&#x27;s reply and
Opponent&#x27;s rejoinder (Rules 57 to 59) along with the evidence thereof, can
any party file further evidence or rely on further documents.
</p><p id="p_31">29.    On an overall reading of the scheme of Rules 55A to 63, it is clear
that the Rules contemplate a two-stage decision making. Stage one is
reference to the Opposition Board of all the pleadings and the evidence.
Stage two is decision by the Controller which is to be rendered after
receiving the recommendations of the Opposition Board and after affording
a hearing, if sought. Thus, at the stage of the Controller taking a decision,
the Controller is expected to have all the pleadings, documents and evidence
relied upon by the parties and the recommendations made by the Board on
the basis of the said material and oral submissions by the parties.
</p><p id="p_32">30.    Thus, it is clear that under usual circumstances, there should not be
any variation between the material being considered by the Opposition
Board and the Controller. All the material to be relied upon by the parties
ought to be presented to the Opposition Board and thereafter to the
Controller.
</p><p id="p_33">31.     Rule 60 provides some leeway to a party to file further evidence with
the leave of the Controller. However, once the notice of hearing is given, no
further evidence ought to be entertained. This is clear from a reading of Rule

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                    Page 20 of 27</span>
 60 which requires that leave for further evidence can be sought &quot;before the
Controller has fixed the hearing under Rule 62&quot;. As per Rule 60 therefore,
even after the recommendations are given by the Opposition Board, it is
only prior to the date of hearing being fixed that any party can seek
permission to file further evidence. Thus, in the scheme of the Act, it would
be always        advisable for the Controller to, after receiving the
recommendations of the Opposition Board, to fix a hearing expeditiously in
order to ensure that there is no long time gap between the recommendations
of the Opposition Board and the decision making by the Controller. Further,
the filing of further evidence under Rule 60 ought to be permitted only in
exceptional cases wherein a party is able to justify the non-filing of the said
evidence at the prior stage of Rule 57 to 59. The party seeking to file further
evidence would have to give adequate reasons for the non-filing of the same
which reasons would be considered by the Controller for granting or
rejecting the request.
</p><p id="p_34">32.    Rule 62(4) gives a final opportunity for any party to rely upon any
publication five days prior to the hearing. The use of the word &#x27;publication&#x27;
in Rule 62(4) is extremely significant. It relates only to a publicly available
document and not to any private document such as a lab report, an expert
affidavit or any other internal document. A publication would be a document
which would have otherwise being publicly available for either of the parties
to verify the same. The logic behind use of the word publication in Rule
62(4) is obvious. Whenever patents are filed, there is a clear expectation that
patentees would be aware of any publications relating to the said field of
technology. Thus, all publications are deemed to be in the knowledge of the
patentee. If either the Opponent or Patentee wishes to rely on any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 21 of 27</span>
 publications five days before the hearing, the same is permitted inasmuch as
parties are expected to have had knowledge of such publications and hence
there would be no surprise to a party. The reason why reliance on such a
publication is permitted is to ensure that no patent is wrongly granted or
wrongly opposed. Considering that the scheme of the Rules has specific
timelines for all the steps that are to be undertaken in a post-grant
opposition, it is understood that such reliance on publication would be
permissible not in usual but in exceptional cases where a publication was not
placed inadvertently or was not within the party‟s knowledge. In any event,
when such a publication is cited, since it has been cited just five days prior
to the hearing, the exact portion which is relied upon ought to be highlighted
to the other party. The word „details&#x27; in Rule 62(4) would thus mean that the
date and name of publication, exact portion of the publication relied upon
ought to be pointed out to the opposite party who can, at short notice be able
to controvert the same at the hearing.
</p><p id="p_35">33.    The further evidence under Rule 60, thus, has to be prior to the
hearing notice being given. The permission to cite any further documents is
restricted to publication five days before the hearing. These two provisions,
in the overall scheme of the Act and Rules, ought to be treated as exceptions
and not the rule. In respect of any further evidence given by either party
under Rule 62 and publication cited at the hearing, the Opposition Board
would not have had an opportunity to look at the same. Thus, the the
presence of the Members of the Opposition Board at the hearing is permitted
in order to ensure that these documents are also discussed in the presence of
the Opposition Board.
</p><p id="p_36">34.    The powers of the Controller under Rules 137 and 138 for amendment

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 22 of 27</span>
 or extension for a period of one month would have to be viewed in the above
context. The said powers being general in nature, the timelines given in
Rules 55A to 63 would have to be maintained. Under Rule 138, only a
maximum period of one month‟s extension is possible provided a request for
extension is received prior to the expiry of the said period. While there is no
doubt that the said power can be exercised by the Controller, the same ought
not to be detrimental to any party and be used sparingly. This power,
however, would not result in extending the period specified in Rule 62(4) for
example, where publications can be cited five days prior to the hearing. If
the one month period is read into this provision, the entire purpose of the
scheme would be set at nought and thus while under Rule 60 further
evidence can be filed, once the notice of hearing is issued, no extension can
be granted.
</p><p id="p_37">35.    The reliance of Rule 129-A by the ld. ASG is apt and supports the
above interpretation inasmuch as even under Rule 129-A, a party cannot
seek more than two adjournments and the said adjournment cannot be for
more than 30 days. Thus, the Act and the Rules require timelines to be
adhered to as strictly as possible while providing some leeway to
accommodate bona fide requests by any party for either further evidence,
documents or adjournments.
</p><p id="p_38">36.    The reliance by ld. counsel for Opponent, on a practice of the
European Patents Office as published in the Official Journal of 2016 and the
notification dated 13th June, 2016 also show that at the time of oral hearings,
only such documents which are of relevance would be considered. If any
relevant document is cited at the time of oral hearing, there shall be a brief
interruption to enable the other party to study the submission and any further

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 23 of 27</span>
 submissions in respect of the document would be in writing. This procedure
is unique to the European Patents Office.
</p><p id="p_39">37.     However, insofar as post-grant oppositions in India are concerned,
any publication which the parties wish to rely upon prior to the hearing
would have to be served upon the other party, five days before the hearing.
Moreover, a perusal of the notification dated 13th June, 2016 also shows that
an overall time limit of 15 months has been prescribed by the EPO for
decision of oppositions. If the procedure as prescribed in Rules 55 to 62 is
adhered to, even in India, an endeavour could be made to decide post-grant
oppositions within 15 months from the date when they are filed. The
intention while deciding post-grant oppositions ought to be to ensure
expeditious and effective disposal and not shutting out of any relevant
evidence.
</p><p id="p_40">38.    All these provisions clearly go to show that enormous sanctity is
placed on the two-stage decision making process in a post-grant opposition.
Since by the time post-grant oppositions are filed and adjudicated, the patent
application has already gone through rigorous examination along with pre-
grant oppositions, if any, post-grant oppositions are passed through two
stages i.e., the Opposition Board and the Controller. The endeavour of all
parties and the patent office ought to be ensure that all documents and
evidence pass through the two-stage process.
</p><p id="p_41">39.    Therefore, the following general principles ought to be followed while
dealing with a post-grant opposition:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">       i)      The Opponent and the Patentee have adequate freedom to file
       their initial pleadings and evidence by relying upon all the documents
       and expert testimonies that they wish to;
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                  Page 24 of 27</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">        ii)     The Opponent‟s rejoinder in Rule 59 ought to be strictly
       confined to the Patentee‟s evidence;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">       iii)    Once the Opposition Board is constituted and the material is
       transmitted to the Board, further evidence is not permissible;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">       iv)     Under Rule 60, if any further evidence comes to light which
       either party wishes to rely upon, the same can only be done prior to
       the issuance of notice of hearing, with the leave of the Controller;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_64">       v)      Under Rule 62(4), only publicly available documents i.e.
       publications, can be considered provided they are served to the
       opposing party, five days prior to the hearing and the date/time of the
       publications as also the relevant portions are highlighted, so that the
       opposite side can deal with the same at the time of hearing. Any
       document the authenticity of which is in doubt would not be
       entertained;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">       vii)    The hearing, in the opposition would be usually granted upon
       request and Opposition Board Members may also be present in order
       to elicit their views and assist the Controller in deciding the post-grant
       oppositions.
</blockquote><p id="p_42">40.    In this background, the last question that arises is whether, if a hearing
is adjourned, further evidence ought to be permitted or not prior to the next
hearing. Clearly from the scheme of the Act, filing of further evidence
would not be permissible after the first notice of hearing is issued. Thus, in
terms of Rule 60, the hearing as contemplated in the said Rule would be
the first notice of hearing. Such an interpretation would ensure that parties
do not unduly delay the hearing of oppositions by seeking adjournments and
utilising the adjourned period to dig up more evidence, especially as such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                      Page 25 of 27</span>
 evidence would in any case have not been considered by the Opposition
Board.
</p><p id="p_43">41.    The filing of further evidence prior to the hearing or reliance on
publications under Rule 62(4) would not ordinarily permit an adjournment
of the hearing. In the Controller‟s discretion, within a reasonable time,
parties may be permitted to support their oral arguments with written
submissions which would again be transmitted simultaneously and would
not again be treated as documents to which responses can be filed.
</p><p id="p_44">42.    Though the Rule does not stipulate any timelines for fixing the date of
hearing, considering that patent rights have a limited term, the Opposition
Board ought to give its recommendations within three months after the final
Opponent‟s rejoinder is received under Rule 59. After the receipt of the
recommendations of the Opposition Board, a hearing ought to be fixed
within three months thereafter. An endeavour ought to be made by the
Patent Office to ensure that post-grant oppositions are decided expeditiously
as pendency of post-grant oppositions delays adjudication of infringement
suits, if any, in respect of the patent and also keeps the rights of the Patentee
under a cloud or in doubt.
</p><p id="p_45">43.    In the present case, the matter has already been fixed for final hearing
on 22nd November, 2019. The Opponent has filed documents and evidence
prior to the hearing and the Patentee sought an adjournment of the hearing
accordingly. However, now the Patentee has had an opportunity to respond
to all the documents and evidence filed by the Opponent - which the
Opponent has already done. Thus, this Court does not deem it appropriate to
direct non-consideration of the said further evidence filed by the parties. The
decision would now be rendered by the Controller after taking into

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P.(C) 12105/2019                                                    Page 26 of 27</span>
 consideration all the pleadings, documents and evidence including the
additional evidence filed by the parties on record.
</p><p id="p_46">44.    For future, the conduct of post-grant oppositions by the Patent office
shall be in accordance with the procedures laid down herein. Long pendency
of post-grant oppositions can have a cascading effect as it raises a question
mark over the validity of the grant of the patent and could also severely
delay adjudication of suits for infringement of patent, licensing and other
forms of monetization of the patent as the overall term of patent is non-
extendable i.e. 20 years. Following the above stipulated procedure would
obviate delays in the adjudication of the same.
</p><p id="p_47">45.    With these observations, the petition and all pending applications are
disposed of.
