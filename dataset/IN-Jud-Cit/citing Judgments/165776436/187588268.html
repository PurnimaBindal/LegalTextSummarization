DEBANGSU BASAK, J.:-

</pre><p id="p_1">     The petitioners have challenged the decision of strategic sale of

Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Limited (BCPL) taken by the

Central Government.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners has submitted that,

BCPL    was    established     in   1901   by   an   eminent   scientist   and

entrepreneur Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray. The institution was a part

of the freedom struggle. BCPL has factories at Kolkata, Panihati,

Mumbai and Kanpur. The management of BCPL was taken over by the
 Government of India on December 15, 1997. BCPL was nationalized

pursuant to the Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Limited

(Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_1">Transfer of Undertakings) Act</a>, 1980. BCPL is one of

the largest manufacturers of generic drugs in the Country. The Central

Government did not nurture BCPL adequately. Consequently, BCPL

started making losses and was referred to the Board for Industrial and

Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) established under the provisions of the

Seek Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985. In the

proceedings before BIFR a revival package was proposed. During the

pendency of the proceedings before BIFR an attempt was made by the

Central Government to sell the company. Such decision was challenged

before the High Court. The High Court had intervened and passed an

order of stay on the decision to sell BCPL. Subsequently, a revival

scheme was placed before the BIFR in respect of BCPL, which was

accepted. However, the Central Government did not act in terms of the

sanctioned scheme. BCPL was referred to BIFR in the year 2005 again.

The financial performance of BCPL started improving since 2014. BCPL

has started posting cash profits for the year 2014-2015 onwards.

Referring to 32nd Report of the Standing Committee of the 16th Lok

Sabha learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners has submitted
 that, the Report notes the decision of the Central Government to sell

surplus land of BCPL and strategic sale of BCPL. He has referred to the

view expressed therein to the effect that, BCPL should be revived. It

recommends revival of BCPL and seeks a report from Government in

that regard. He has referred to the Katoch Committee Report on Active

Pharmaceuticals Ingredients, a report of the Expert Committee set up

by the Central Government to look into issues in the pharmaceutical

sector. He has submitted that, one of the main recommendations of the

Katoch Committee is that, the Central Government should evolve ways

and means of utilizing the resources available with the public sector

units for setting up of Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients. The Katoch

Committee   is   of   the   view   that,   an   average   cluster   of   Active

Pharmaceuticals Ingredients would require about 1000 to 2,000

hectares of land and would require about 750-1000 Crore investments

of common facilities/services. He has submitted that, BCPL has such

an infrastructure available, therefore, BCPL should be developed in

terms of Katoch Committee Report.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     Referring to the affidavits used by the respondents, he has

submitted that, the Central government has sought to justify the

decision for strategic sale of BCPL on the ground that, BCPL is no
 longer in the priority sector. The Central Government has decided not

to do business in an area which does not fall within the priority sector.

He has submitted that, health is a priority sector for Central

Government. The Central Government is free to decide on economic

policies. However, such freedom is circumscribed by the constitutional

mandate.    Central   Government     cannot   breach   the   constitutional

mandate while formulating any policy even if it was an economic policy.

Heath being a priority sector, Central Government is misplaced while

treating pharmaceutical industry not to be a priority sector. He has

referred to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and has submitted

that, health is included in the right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution of India. Referring to <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_4">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of India

he has submitted that, although, the directive principles of State policy

may not by themselves per se be justiciable, the Courts, however, are

entitled to take the benefit of the directive principles of State policy, in

understanding the contours of the fundamental rights, enshrined in the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Referring to 2013 Volume 6 Supreme Court Cases page 1

(<a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_5">Novartis AG v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.) learned Senior Advocate for

the petitioners has submitted that, where there is a conflict between
 two interests, then, the Court should lean in favour of the one

advancing public interest. In the present case, there may be a conflict

between economic interest of the Central Government with that of

interest of the citizens in relation to health. He has submitted that,

health should take precedence as it involves the entire country. He has

submitted that, the observations made in 2002 Volume 2 Supreme

Court Cases page 333 (<a href="/doc/1737583/" id="a_6">BALCO Employees Union (Regd.) v. Union of

India &amp; Ors</a>.) supports the view that, a policy decision of the Central

Government is justiciable provided that, it is substantiated that such

policy decision is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. A policy

decision is not immune from judicial scrutiny. In appropriate cases the

Courts can strike down a policy of the Central Government. In the facts

of the present case, he has submitted that, the decision of the Central

Government     to   sell   BCPL   strategically   being   violative   of   the

constitutional mandate should be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Central

Government has submitted that, the Central Government has taken a

policy decision in not doing business in sectors which do not come

within the priority sector. Manufacturing of pharmaceutical products,

do not come within the priority sector, in the opinion of the Central
 Government. He has referred to the affidavit-in-opposition filed on

behalf of the Central government. He has referred to the data provided

in such affidavit and has submitted that, although Public Sector

Undertakings in the pharmaceutical sector were doing well at a given

point of time, private operators has caught up with the Public Sector

Undertakings and has replaced the public sector. He has referred to the

productions of the Public Sector Undertakings in the pharmaceutical

sector in the aggregate. There are five Public Sector Undertakings

engaged in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. The entirety

of the production of those five Public Sector Undertakings does not

constitute more than 5% of the total pharmaceutical products of the

country. Therefore, there is no need for the Central Government to

continue with the Public Sector Undertakings in the pharmaceutical

industry. These public sector pharmaceutical companies are making

loss with no prospect of revival. Allowing any of them to continue its

existence in the public sector would be an avoidable economic burden

on the exchequer with no corresponding benefit to offset the trouble

taken. It is, therefore, in the interest of the nation that they are taken

out from the public sector.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned Additional Solicitor General has referred to the affidavit-

in-opposition and the writing dated May 24, 2017 issued by the

Ministry of Commerce and Fertilizers Department of Pharmaceutical.

He has submitted that, the recommendations of the Standing

Parliamentary Committee were considered by the department. The

department is of the view that, the total contributions of the Public

Sector Undertakings in supply of generic medicine is less than 5%.

None of the Public Sector Undertakings is manufacturing any medicine

which is not already manufactured by the private sector. Consequently,

Public Sector Undertakings in the pharmaceutical sector are no longer

of strategic value. Moreover, the Public Sector Undertakings in the

pharmaceutical sector excepting one of them are incurring huge losses

continuously. The net worth of the Public Sector Undertakings is in the

negative. Consequently, the Government has decided to close down two

of the Public Sector Undertakings and strategically sale BCPL along

with another Public Sector Undertaking. With regard to the revival of

BCPL, the department is of the view that, although BCPL has achieved

net profit for few years, its net worth continues to remain negative.

Therefore, the Cabinet had decided not to close down the company but

put it in strategic sale. He has submitted that, the recommendations of
 the Standing Parliamentary Committee were taken into consideration

and that the department has taken a contrary view. The reasons for

taking a contrary view have been stated. Therefore, there is no infirmity

in the decision making process. The decision taken by the Central

Government in this regard, therefore, should not be interfered with by a

Writ Court. The decision relates to an economic field. The Court should

be slow to interfere in such field. A greater latitude is available to the

Government with regard to policies in the economic sphere. He has

referred to 2002 Volume 2 Supreme Court Cases page 333 (<a href="/doc/1737583/" id="a_7">BALCO

Employees Union (Regd.) v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.), 2006 Volume 10

Supreme Court Cases page 66 (<a href="/doc/1932813/" id="a_8">All India ITDC Workers' Union &amp;

Ors. v. ITDC &amp; Ors</a>.) and 2015 Volume 9 page 657 (<a href="/doc/181379587/" id="a_9">Parisons

Agrotech Private Limited &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.) in

support of his contentions. He has submitted that, the employees of

BCPL have no choice of their employer. No right or interest of the

employees of BCPL stands affected by the decision of strategic sale.

BCPL will continue to exist albeit a new management. Change of

management cannot be accepted as a just cause to interfere with a

decision of strategic sale. The writ petition should therefore be

dismissed.
</p><p id="p_7">      The following issues have arisen for consideration in the present

writ petition:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (i)     Is a decision of strategic sale of a Public Sector Undertaking

             justiciable?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii)    If the answer to the first issue is in the affirmative, is the

             impugned decision bad?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (iii)   To what relief or reliefs, if any, are the parties entitled to?</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">     A registered trade union of the employees of BCPL has challenged

the decision of the Central Government to sell BCPL on strategic basis.

BCPL was established on April 12, 1901. It has four factories. Two of

the factories are located in the State of West Bengal while one in

Mumbai and the other in Kanpur. The factories in West Bengal are at

Kolkata and Panihati. BCPL had started incurring losses from 1950.

The management of BCPL was taken over by the Government of India

on December 15, 1997. Thereafter, consequent to the Bengal Chemical

and Pharmaceutical Works Limited (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_10">Transfer of

Undertakings) Act</a>, 1980, BCPL was nationalized. By reason of such

nationalization, the initial company was renamed and continued as

Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited. BCPL is engaged in the

manufacture and sale of generic drugs. Its production is not limited to
 generic drugs alone. It manufactures anti snake venom and cosmetics

amongst other products. BCPL had faced financial troubles prior and

subsequent to its nationalization. It was referred to the BIFR twice.

During the pendency of consideration of the revival package in respect

of BCPL at its first reference proceedings before BIFR, a decision was

taken by the Central Government to sell BCPL. Upon the High Court

being approached, an order of stay of such decision of the Central

government was granted. In the proceeding before BIFR, a revival

package in respect of BCPL was accepted by BIFR. According to the

petitioners, the Central Government did not act in terms of the revival

package as sanctioned by BIFR. BCPL was referred to BIFR again in

2005. BCPL, however, had started posting cash profits from 2014

onwards. The net worth of BCPL, however, remains to be negative.

</p><p id="p_10">     It appears that, the 32nd Standing Parliamentary Committee had

considered the issue of strategic sale of Public Sector Undertakings in

the pharmaceutical sector. There appears to be five Public Sector

Undertakings in the pharmaceutical sector, one of them being BCPL. In

respect of BCPL, in a 32nd Report, the Standing Parliamentary

Committee of the 16th Lok Sabha is of the following view:-
</p><p id="p_11">       "The Committee are deeply pained to note that the
Government has decided to sell surplus land of IDPL, RDPL,
HAL and BCPL that after liabilities have been met, balance
sheet cleansed and VRS/VSS effected IDPL and RDPL be
closed and HAL and BCPL be sold strategically. The
Committee, feel that the main objective of setting up Pharma
PSUs were not to earn profits but to encourage indigenous
production of      bulk drugs and life saving drugs and
formulations and to support various health programmes of the
Government. The Committee observe that Pharma PSUs supply
generic medicines all over the country. It is also observed that
BCPL had made a stellar performance during the last two
years. While in the year 2014-2015 its MOU Assessment was
good and Corporate Governance was fair, it became excellent
both in respect of MOU Assessment and Corporate Governance
during the year 2015-2016. The Committee also observe that
BCPL is planning to start Anti-Snake Venom Project (ASVS)
project as the product is not available in the country at the
moment in required quantity as both Government sector units
namely BCPL and Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli
have stopped production of ASVS for the last 10 years. Due to
non availability of fund and also due to project cost escalation
the project could not be commissioned. The Committee feel that
the Department is not taking the matter seriously in spite of the
fact that 2 lakh people are suffering from snake bite every
year. The Committee, therefore recommend that BCPL may not
be closed by strategically selling and instead be supported in
its special cause especially when it is on the path of regaining
its old glory. The Committee, further observe funds to be
allocated to Pharma PSUs had been consistently delayed due
to the lackadaisical approach of the Department to impress
upon the Ministry of finance of the urgent need for funds to
complete the projects resulting in ultimately closure of IDPL and
RDPL plants and strategic sale of BCPL and HAL. The
Committee therefore recommend that even if there is any little
scope for running the PSUs in PPP mode or other mode the
Department should consider this instead of closing the IDPL
and RDPL and option of strategic sales of BCPL and HAL all
      may be fully revived. The Committee, would like to be informed
     of the action taken in this regard."
</p><p id="p_12">     The recommendations of the Standing Parliamentary Committee

were considered by the Department of Pharmaceutical, Ministry of

Commerce and Fertilizers. The affidavit-in-opposition of the Central

Government discloses a writing dated May 24, 2017 which state the

views of the Department of Pharmaceutical on the recommendations

made by the Standing Parliamentary Committee in respect of BCPL. The

relevant portion of such writing is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "It is submitted that during last three years, the total sale
     of all the five PSUs were around Rs. 500-550 Crore out of total
     turnover of about Rs. 2.00 lakh crore Indian Pharma Industry.
     Indian Private Pharma Industry is well developed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           Total contribution of the PSUs in supply of generic
     medicines under PMBJP is also less than 5%. No PSU is
     manufacturing any medicines which is not already
     manufactures by private sector. PSUs are no longer of strategic
     value.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           The Pharma PSUs except KAPL, are incurring huge losses
     continuously for the past several years. Net worth of the PSUs is
     in negative. As such the Government has decided to close IDPL
     and RDPL and strategically sell BCPL and HAL.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           As regards revival of BCPL, it is submitted that although
     during recent year has achieved net profit but its net worth is in
     negative only. The Cabinet has decided not to close the
     company but put on strategic sale. Thus, the company will
     remain operational, only its management would be changed.
     Anti Snake Venum Serum, can be manufactured by the
     company it but from its own funds. Department had sought Rs.
     28.10 Crore under Budget Estimates (BE) for 2017-18.
     However, Ministry of Finance has not given any amount for the
     project."</blockquote><p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      The Central Government had taken a decision to sell BCPL

strategically. The strategic sale of BCPL is explained by the Central

Government in its affidavit by stating that, the liabilities of BCPL would

be met out by the sale of surplus land of BCPL. Thereafter, there will be

a sale of the shareholding of BCPL with a transfer of management of

BCPL to a strategic buyer. In such process, the Central Government

seeks to achieve the basic objective of not doing business in a non-

priority sector. The affidavit of the Central Government explains that,

the Central Government had constituted a high level committee of NITI

Aayog to identify sick or loss making/ non-performing Public Sector

Undertakings and for recommendations of suitable strategies for action

with regard to those identified. Such committee had decided that,

prioritization of Public Sector Undertakings should be made on the

basis of nature of activity performed by them and not on the basis of

profit. In deciding on the priority, such committee had taken into

consideration four essential factors. Firstly, whether a Public Sector

Undertaking was required for national security. Secondly, whether the

Public Sector Undertaking was performing any sovereign or quasi

sovereign function. Thirdly, whether it involved in any important

development where the private sector has failed to perform. Fourthly,
 whether the presence of Public Sector Undertaking was desirable for

public purpose. Any Public Sector Undertaking which met any of such

criteria was categorized as high priority. Otherwise, the Public Sector

Undertakings were categorized as low priority. Pharmaceutical Public

Sector Undertakings were not performing any of the four identified

functions for them to be considered as a priority sector. Consequently,

the pharmaceutical Public Sector Undertakings including BCPL coming

within the low priority sector, strategies were developed for the purpose

of either closing them down or going in for strategic sale. In the case of

BCPL, the Central Government is going for strategic sale. By reason of

such decision, BCPL will not be closed down. Such of the employees of

BCPL who are not offered early retirement or who do not accept the

same, will continue to remain as employees of BCPL with the only

change being that of the management.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     BALCO Employees Union (Regd.) (supra) has dealt with the

extent of judicial review of policy decisions taken by the Government in

economic    sphere.   It    has   expressed   the    view   that,    process   of

disinvestment is a policy decision involving complex economic factors.

The Courts have consistently refrained from interfering with economic

decisions   unless    the    economic    decision,    based     on    economic
 expediencies, is demonstrated to be so violative of constitutional or legal

limits on power or so abhorrent to reason, that the Courts are required

to interfere. It has recognized the fact that, in matters relating to

economic issues, the Government has a greater latitude, to the extent of

undertaking a trial and error, as long as both the trial and error are

bona fide and within the limits of authority. In the facts of that case,

the Court had refused to interfere in a public interest litigation at the

instance of the workers of Bharat Aluminum Company relating to its

disinvestment.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     BALCO Employees Union (Regd.) (supra) has been considered in

All India ITDC Workers' Union &amp; Ors. (supra). It has considered the

disinvestment policy with regard to Indian Tourism Development

Corporation. It has expressed the view that, a Government employee

has no absolute right under Articles 14, 21 and 311 of the Constitution

of India. Therefore, an employee of an instrumentality of the State

cannot be said to have any vested right to continue to enjoy such

status.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     Bajaj   Hindustan     Limited    (supra)   has   considered   BALCO

Employees Union (Regd.) (supra) and has expressed the view that, in

areas of economic and commerce, a greater latitude is available to the
 executive than in other matters. Courts not being experts in such fields,

cannot interfere with the wisdom of policy framed by legislature or the

executive. However, it has expressed the view that, Courts can interfere

where there is a clear violation of statute or constitutional provision or

where the decision of the policy of the State stands vitiated on the

ground of arbitrariness.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     Parisons    Agrotech    Private   Limited   &amp;   Anr.   (supra)   has

expressed the view that, the Writ Court has adequate power of judicial

review in respect of policy decisions of the Central Government.

However, once it is found that, there is sufficient material for taking a

particular policy decision, bringing it within the four corners of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article

14</a> of the Constitution of India, the Court will not exercise its power of

judicial review to determine the correctness of such a policy decision or

indulge in the exercise of finding out whether there could be more

appropriate or better alternatives.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     Novartis AG (supra) has considered an application for grant of

patent. It has noted that, with the anxiety to safeguard the public heath

objectives. Parliament had brought about the amendments to the

<a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_12">Patent Act</a>, 1970 in 2005.
</p><p id="p_20">      The authorities noted above, support the view that, a policy

decision of the Government is not immune from judicial scrutiny.

Government has a large latitude in making policies. Such latitude is

greater in respect of policies in the economic sphere. Government

enjoys such latitude so long its policies are based on materials

satisfying the contours of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. In such

cases, Courts are not required to determine the correctness or the

wisdom of such a policy or embark upon an exercise of substituting it

with a policy which it perceives to be better. A court can intervene in a

policy matter when such policy is unconstitutional or contrary to the

statutory provisions or vitiated by arbitrariness or unreasonableness or

is unconscionable. Safeguarding public health is one of the objectives of

the State.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     The first issue, therefore, is answered accordingly.

     Apparently, the necessity of the Central Government to do

business through the instrumentality of a Public Sector Undertaking

had engaged the attention of the Government at various levels. The

Parliamentary Standing Committee of 16th Lok Sabha in its 32nd Report

had taken a particular view and had made their recommendations. The

same issue was considered by NITI Aayog. NITI Aayog had categorized
 Public Sector Undertakings into priority and non-priority sectors. It had

laid down four factors, for considering whether an undertaking belong

to the priority sector or not any of which, if satisfied, would lead to a

Public Sector Undertaking being classified under the priority sector.

The yardsticks are enumerated in the affidavit-in-opposition of the

Central Government and have been noted above. On the avail of such

yardsticks BCPL has been categorized as belonging to the non-priority

sector. The Central Government has accepted such classification and is

working thereon. The issue is whether or not pharmaceutical as a

sector can be considered to be non-priority on the yardsticks

formulated by NITI Aayog itself.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India enshrines the fundamental

right of life. It is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "21. Protection of life and personal liberty. - No

     in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity
     and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation
     and against moral and material abandonment."</blockquote><p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">     Articles 39(b), (c) and (e) of the Constitution of India enjoin a duty

upon the State to provide good quality and health facilities to its

citizens. Making available health services facilities to its citizens at

affordable rates is one of the fundamental duties of the State. A policy

decision of the State, which permits it to abdicate its fundamental duty

recognized under the Constitution, cannot be sustained as one being

supported by adequate materials or being reasonable or satisfying the

contours of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. Existence of a

pharmaceutical company in the Public Sector Undertaking will add to
 the availability of medicines at affordable rates to the citizens rather

than subtract from it. Availability of medicines at affordable rates is one

of the pillars on which a robust health care facility is founded. The

citizens must have access to affordable health care. Affordable health

care would necessarily bring within its wake availability of affordable

medicines.   A    Public   Sector   Undertaking   manufacturing    generic

medicine would, therefore, be better placed and equipped to provide

such a service.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     The courter argument would be that, the present economics of

BCPL warrant sale of such Public Sector Undertaking or to do away

with it altogether. With respect, the State being endowed with the

obligation to be a welfare State under the Constitution, it is not open to

the State to contend that, the economics of maintaining a Public Sector

Undertaking outweighs the continuance of the same. It is the stand of

the Central Government that, although BCPL is making profits, its net

worth is negative and is likely to remain so. The private sector is in a

position to produce the same kind of medicines as that of BCPL. It is to

be noted that, private sector is manufacturing the same kind of

medicines profitably. There is no reason as to why a public sector unit

cannot manufacture the same medicine with profits. The financial
 results placed before the Court in respect of BCPL from 2014 onwards

show that BCPL is posting cash profits. Its negative net worth is yet to

be wiped out. However, the same does not necessarily lead one to infer

that BCPL would not be in a position to wipe out its negative net worth

given a chance. The Central Government is not claiming that, the

products manufactured by BCPL is obsolete or does not have market.

BCPL has surplus land. Such land can be put to use in terms of Katoch

Committee Report.

<p id="p_28">     So far BCPL and its survivality is concerned, two views are

possible   as   would   appear   from   the   recommendations      of   the

Parliamentary Standing Committee and the other taken by the Central

Government. Both the views, ultimately arrive at the survival of BCPL.

However, the two views of different routes and methodolity of allowing

BCPL to survive. View of Central Government takes BCPL out of public

sector while the view of Parliamentary Standing Committee allows it to

retain such status. If BCPL continues to remain in the public sector,

Central Government would necessarily remain to be in the control and

management of BCPL. This would facilitate the discharge of the State's

obligations under the Constitution rather than curtail it. As noted

above, it is the obligation of the State to provide health care facility at
 reasonable rate or at least make the same available to its citizens at

affordable rates. Conscious of the proposition that, a Court need not

substitute its wisdom on the economic policy of the State, the

impugned decision is tasted on the anvil of Articles 21 and 39 of the

Constitution. The impugned decision fails such test. The impugned

decision does not facilitate discharge of the State to make avail a robust

heath care system. Rather it impedes the same. Therefore, the decision

of the Central Government based on the recommendations of NITI

Aayog to consider BCPL as falling under the non-priority sector cannot

be sustained. The consequent decision of undertaking a strategic sale of

BCPL which is based upon the classification of BCPL under the non-

priority sector is also vitiated. The initial recommendation of NITI Aayog

coupled with the decision of the Central Government on the basis of

such recommendation of NITI Aayog to classify BCPL in the non-priority

sector not being sustainable, the subsequent decision of strategic sale

cannot be sustained also.    This order, however, will not prevent the

authorities from deciding on the fate of BCPL, in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_29">     The second issue is, therefore, answered by setting aside the

decision of the Central Government to undertake a strategic sale of

BCPL.
</p><p id="p_30">      The third issue is answered by allowing the W.P. No. 15560 (W) of

2017. No order as to costs.

available to the parties upon compliance of the requisite formalities.
