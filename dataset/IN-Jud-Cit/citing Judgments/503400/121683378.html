MR. JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT

*1.    The Plaintiff manufactures and sells detergent products, and claims to have developed
unique and novel detergent products based on its research. It markets and sells such products
under the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ followed by suffixes, such as EL, EL-C, EL-81, HD
ULTRA, etc, which identify specific detergent products. The plaintiff relies on documents
show that it has been using the trade mark from 1990 in respect of detergent chemicals. In
1999 the plaintiff developed two different products and starting marketing them as „SUPER
BRIGHT ULTRA‟ and „SUPER BRIGHT EL-81‟.

2.     In 2001 the plaintiff initiated talks for supply of its „SUPER BRIGHT‟ range of
detergent to various Army hospitals throughout the country. The plaintiff contends to having
developed specific formulations for the Army and that on 12th October 2004 Director General
of Armed Forces (Medical Services) called it for technical discussions regarding the
products. The sample of the plaintiff‟s product was tested and approved by the army
establishments. In June 2004 the plaintiff was awarded ISO 9001: 2000 Quality System by

IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                  Page 1
 International Certifications Limited. On 17th August 2006 the plaintiff applied for registration
of its trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ under Class 3 of the Schedule to the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>,
1999; the application is pending registration. In the plaint the plaintiff has given the sale
figures for the product „SUPER BRIGHT‟ for the last four years are as follows:

                 Year                 Net Sales (Rs.)


               2003-2004                     1,26,44,573.36
               2004-2005                     1,43,75,606.61
               2005-2006                     2,43,36,047.47
               2006-2007                     4,87,17,617.88
3. The plaintiff claims ownership of SUPER BRIGHT on account of brand popularity and use
and says that any use to the contrary to, or without its leave and consent would constitute
passing off.    On 20th December 2004 the Director General of Ordinances Services
(Procurement Division) invited tenders for supply of „SUPER BRIGHT Bleached (not for
coloured cloth).‟ The technical specifications of the product were also indicated. The
requirement as to marking on the packages, as indicated in the terms and conditions attached
to the tender form reads as under:

               "6.      Marking: On initial pack,


               (a) Cat/Part No. NIV, Nomenclature, Name of manufacture, quality contained
                   therein shall be legibly and indelibly marked on each container.
               (b) On final pack. Cat/part No. NIV, Nomenclature, Name of manufacture,
                   quality contained therein shall be legibly and indelibly marked on each
                   container also A/T No. and date, inspection Note No. and date, Name and
                   address of manufacturer, Name and address of the consignee should be
                   clearly visible.
The tenderer has also to fill the questionnaire which is column No. 8 requires to indicate
"whether you are the manufacturer of the stores"
4.     The plaintiff, states that it came to know sometime in June 2007 that the defendant
had bid for the supply of the SUPER BRIGHT range of chemicals to Army Hospitals.
Immediately the plaintiff published a trade mark caution notice in leading newspapers
cautioning the public not to deal in the products under the trade mark SUPER BRIGHT
except those originating from it (the plaintiff). It also wrote to the Government authorities
(Armed Forces) informing that the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ is its property and that the

IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                     Page 2
 defendant had no authority to use that trade mark. A legal notice was issued to the defendant.
The plaintiff contends that there was a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, in
respect of the trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟ since the mark and goods are identical and that
the defendant‟s use of such mark was both „deceptively and confusingly similar‟ and
dishonest and mala fide. The plaintiff therefore, filed this suit on 13th August 2007. The
interim injunction application ( IA No. 9140 of 2007) was also moved. After summons were
issued, the defendant appeared, and caused a statement to be made on its behalf, on 20 th
August 2007 that it "... has been supplying goods to Army and other authorities under the
same trademark since the year 2005." This court then made a conditional order on 20th
August 2007 that no injunction was being issued, and that in case the statement was wrong,
the court would consider making a compensatory order.

5.     The defendant contends that the Army follows two separate processes for inviting
tenders. One is PAC tendering, resorted to when the Army seeks to purchase a proprietary
product of a manufacturing firm. There is also an open tender mode of procurement for
common use items of generic or commercial specifications to ensure adequate competition.
The tender in the instant case was invited following an "Open Tender" procedure whereby
the Army had used the word „SUPER BRIGHT‟ as a descriptive term to describe the product
as per specifications provided in the tender documents, and not as a brand name for the
plaintiff‟s products. Ten parties participated in the tender for supply of the product „SUPER
BRIGHT‟ detergent.

6.     The defendant submits that it was awarded contract by the Army for supply of both
products „SUPER BRIGHT EL and EL-81 on 23rd June 2005. Likewise tenders were invited
by the Army for the supply of „SUPER BRIGHT Bleach" in February 2006 and pursuant to
the bid offered by it; the defendant was awarded that contract on 25th April 2006. Another
tender advertisement was issued on 28th September 2006 for „SUPER BRIGHT Bleach‟ and
the defendant was awarded that contract on 31st May 2007.

This court took up the application IA No. 9140 of 2007 for disposal and formulated the
following question:

               "5. The interesting question of passing off that arises is -
              whether in such circumstances, where a single consumer invites
              tenders for a particular product using the mark „SUPER
              BRIGHT‟ along with its suffixes and several persons submit


IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                   Page 3
                their bids for the same products, do such persons intend to pass
               off their products as those of others?"
7.      The court held that the question was a debatable one, and could not be decided at that
stage "without examining the evidence that may be led by the parties." The court also held
that the plaintiff was aware in December 2004 that "there was (sic were) other parties,
including the defendant, who were submitted their bids and that at times the tenders were not
being awarded in part or in whole to the plaintiff." This, it was held that this would
"disentitle the plaintiff to an interim injunction and the plaintiff would have to wait for a final
decision in the suit."

8.      The plaintiff appealed against the above judgment of this court. The Division Bench,
by its judgment and order, upset the order, and granted temporary injunction. It was, inter
alia, held that:

        "Admittedly, the defendant is supplying the product in question, using the plaintiff‟s
        trade mark „SUPER BRIGHT‟. The only defence of the defendant is that as far as the
        army is concerned there is no deception and since the supplies are being made only to
        the army and in strict consonance with the terms of the tender and therefore there is
        no cause of action in a suit for passing off. The precise averment made by the
        defendant/respondent in para 8 of its reply dated 1st September 2008 in the present</pre>
<p id="p_1">        appeal is: "...the Respondent only supplies its product to the Army and has been
        using the words „Super Bright‟ in relation to its product and in connection with the
        tenders invited by the Army since 2005." It is not possible to accept the submission of
        the defendant that the army is under no deception that the product supplied by the
        defendant is manufactured by the plaintiff and not the defendant. Admittedly, the
        defendant does not manufacture the product in question under the trade mark
        „SUPER BRIGHT‟. It uses this mark for its products only when supplying to the
        Army. This alone should be sufficient to negate the claim of the defendant about there
        being no deception. Further, it is clear from the authorisation letter dated 4th June
        2007 that what was tested by the Army authorities and cleared for supply were only
        the product of the plaintiff and that "no other products were tested/approved." Given
        the open tender process it is possible that the army was under the impression that the
        defendant and other manufacturers had purchased the product of the plaintiff in the
        market and were supplying it to the army. This is very much contemplated from the
        questions asked of each tenderer in the open tendering process, which have been set
        out earlier. The defendant in the instant case does appear to have held out to the
        army that the product supplied by it is „SUPER BRIGHT‟. It is not as if the defendant
        informed the Army that the product supplied by it is not the plaintiff‟s product
        purchased from the market. In the circumstances, it is not possible to accept the
        defendant‟s contention that the Army was not under any confusion that the defendant
        is supplying its own product and not that of the plaintiff‟s. The supply of its product
        by the defendant under the mark SUPER BRIGHT without informing the army that it
        is not manufacturing the said product under the mark SUPER BRIGHT is prima facie
        a dishonest use of the plaintiff‟s mark. This essential feature of the case cannot be
        ignored and belies the claim of the defendant about there being no deception...

<p id="p_2">IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                        Page 4
</p><p id="p_3">        32. Accordingly the impugned order of the learned Single Judge is set aside. There
       will be injunction in favour of the plaintiff appellant restraining the respondent
       defendant from manufacturing or authorising the manufacture, selling or offering for
       sale, marketing, advertising, promoting, displaying or in any other manner
       whatsoever using the trade mark SUPER BRIGHT and/or SUPER BRIGHT EL and/or
       SUPER BRIGHT EL-C and/or SUPER BRIGHT EL 81and/or SUPER BRIGHT HD
       ULTRA and/or SUPER BRIGHT Bleach and/or any other trade mark which is
       deceptively or confusingly similar to the above trademarks. The injunction will
       operate prospectively subject to the condition that the defendant will maintain
       complete accounts of all the sales made by it of the products sold to the army or any
       other persons till the date of the present order. The injunction will continue till the
       disposal of the Suit. We are informed that the Army authorities have since desisted
       from inviting tenders for supply of SUPER BRIGHT products through the open tender
       process. In any event, the law as explained in this judgment will continue to govern
       future similar tenders..."
</p>

<p id="p_4">9.     The defendant carried the matter in appeal by special leave, to the Supreme Court,
which set aside the order of the Division Bench, but desisted from expressing any opinion,
and instead required this court to hear the injunction application afresh and make an order in
accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_5">10.    Learned counsel for the parties reiterated their respective positions. It was urged by
the plaintiff that it developed special formulations for the Army and on 12-10-2004, the
Director General of Armed Forces called it for technical discussion about the chemicals. It is
alleged that the plaintiff‟s products were tested, and that as on date, it is the only concern
whose products are approved, (in the concerned class), for use by the Army. It is alleged that
the cause of action for injunctive relief arose, the moment the plaintiff became aware, in
2007 that the defendant sought to use the mark on the packages for supply to the Army. It is
urged that the submission of bids, and the grant or refusal of tenders to any concern, are not
matters of public exercise since it is not possible for tenderers to know which others
submitted their bids. Reliance is also placed on the tender bid furnished to the Army
authorities, by the defendant, in 2005, which cited the protocol or standard used, to be NP-5,
NP - 4.4 and NP-3; it is submitted that "NP" denotes Navin Polycon, i.e the plaintiff concern.
The plaintiff argues that Ministry of Defence communications of 4th June, 2007 also establish
that its products were tested and found to be most suitable.
</p><p id="p_6">11.    The plaintiff, to establish its claim for prior user and widespread reputation, also relies
upon invoices evidencing supplies of its products, in April 2004 (Hotel Le Meridian); 2005
(Hotel Taj Palace); 21-10-2003 (the Grand Hotel); 28-11-1996 (The Surya Hotel) and


IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                       Page 5
 purchase orders issued by Hotel Surya in March and April, 1990.
</p><p id="p_7">12.    Reliance is placed on the decisions reported as <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_2">Ramdev Food Pvt Products v.
Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel &amp; Ors</a>, 2006 (33) PTC 281 and Globe Super Parts v Blue Super
Flame 1986 PTC 61 to emphasize that the denial of temporary injunction to the plaintiff
would destroy the efficacy of its trademark, which has been in use for over 18 years. It is
argued, on the strength of the decisions reported as <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_3">Baker Hughes Ltd. v. Hiroo Khushalani</a>
1998 (18) PTC 580, and Cadilla Health Care v. Cadilla Pharma 2001 (5) SCC 73, that the
products or goods, as well as the sophistication of the buyer(s) is a very relevant
consideration. In this case, the plaintiff‟s products were not only approved by the army
authorities, but in fact constituted the standard for its decision to procure them from the
market. In these circumstances, the defendant‟s attempt at appropriating the mark, for use in
relation to identical goods, is plainly not bona fide.
</p><p id="p_8">13.    The defendants argue that the claim for injunction cannot be entertained. It is
submitted that the plaintiff has not disclosed that the Army had, during the period 2004 and
2007, issued as many as 11 invitations to tender, seeking quotations from willing suppliers of
detergents. The army followed the "Open Tender" procedure in which procurement of items
of common use of generic or commercial specifications to ensure adequate competition. The
defendants highlight <a href="/doc/340780/" id="a_4">Section 4</a>.4.1 of the Defense Procurement Manual, for 2006 and Para
4.13.3 which read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "....4.4.1        The details of award of tenders/contracts must invariably be placed on

       opened by the tender opening official, preferably a committee of at least two officials,

</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">14.    It is submitted by the defendant that the plaintiff was aware about the award of

IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                     Page 6
 contract to it (the defendant) as of June, 2005, since its complaint, made to the army
authorities, in 2006, led to the award of contract being kept in abeyance. The defendant relies
on the documents supplied by the army authorities, pursuant to the queries under the Right to
<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_5">Information Act</a>, in June, 2006, copies of which have been filed along with IA 13138/2009. It
is therefore argued that the plaintiff‟s claim for injunctive relief cannot be granted, as it is hit
by laches as well as acquiescence. It is submitted that the combination of SUPER and
BRIGHT, in respect of detergent products, are generic and descriptive, as they have distinct
association with the goods and their perceived or claimed attributes. The defendant urges that
having regard to the totality of circumstances, the injunctive relief claimed cannot be acceded
to.
</p><p id="p_10">15.    The question which the court is called to rule upon, in these interlocutory proceeding,
is whether the plaintiff has prima facie established that it is the owner and continuous user of
the trademark SUPERBRIGHT in relation to a specific kind of detergent.
</p><p id="p_11">16.    The plaintiff‟s claim is founded on claimed continuous use of the mark, since 1990; a
few invoices in support of use, are relied upon. The distinctiveness acquired, and the
association of the word mark in relation to detergent, is sought to be reinforced, through
representations in the print media, for which copies of advertisements, are produced. Copies
of such advertisements are at pages 16 to 27 of the plaintiff‟s list of documents. These
include the brochure/ write up of the plaintiff‟s range of products, and write ups/
advertisements in the "Hotel and Food Service Review" for some months in the year 2004; a
couple of advertisements and write ups in the "Hospitality Talk" (magazine?) have been
produced. The plaintiff also relies on its growing sales figures, and advertisement
expenditure, incurred by it, over the years. The defendant, on the other hand, urges that the
plaintiff‟s mark cannot claim distinctiveness, as it is descriptive, and more importantly, that
the present action cannot be pressed into service as a tool to stifle competition. The latter
contention is in the context of the army authorities inviting a tender for supply of superbright
detergents. The defendant also urges that it participated in no less than 11 public tender
processes, issued by the army authorities, and that in fact its bid was accepted in 2005;
consequently, the present suit for injunction based on alleged passing off, is hit by laches and
acquiescence. The defendant claims to be using the SUPERBRIGHT mark in relation only to
detergent supplies made to army authorities.
</p><p id="p_12">17.    In an action for passing off, unlike a trademark infringement suit, the claimant has to
establish three essential elements, i.e. the mark‟s extensive use by the plaintiff, to disclose its
distinctiveness (as a source identifier of its products), the appropriation of the mark by the

IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                         Page 7
 defendant, and the trademark owner‟s injury, or a reasonable likelihood of such injury (Ref.
<a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_6">Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd</a> AIR 2004 SC 3540; <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_7">Cadilla Healthcare
Ltd v. Cadilla Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a> 2001 (5) SCC 73). In Cadilla, in fact, on a detailed
review of the previous judgments, the Supreme Court indicated the guiding principles as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "35. Broadly stated, in an action for passing-off on the basis of unregistered trade
       mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors
       are to be considered:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or
       composite marks i.e. both words and label works.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       (b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence
       similar in idea.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade- marks.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       (d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival
       traders.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       (e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they
       require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to
       exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       (f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       (g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of
       dissimilarity between the competing marks."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">18.    The plaintiff‟s stated claim is that its products and detergents are useful in removing
persistent stains, such as grease and blood and medical stains. Its use has also been in the
hospitality sector, where its customers have ordered the products from 1990. As far as
publicity is concerned, the copies of advertisements placed on record reveal that they too,
were confined to the hospitality sector.
</p><p id="p_14">19.    The defendant has placed on record documents, which prima facie point to the use of
"Super Bright" by the Army for procurement of detergents, since 2004 (Tender documents,
dated 20-12-2004 and February, 2006- Ref to defendant‟s documents at Pages 1-32 and 54-
</p><p id="p_15">70). The defendant bid in some of these tender processes, and succeeded in securing the
tender on 23-6-2005 (Ref Defendants documents at pages 52-53). The Letter of intent
apparently was issued to the defendant on 31-5-2007. The plaintiff‟s answer to these is that
the tendering process is confidential, and each bidder does not know the identity of his
competitor. This is prima facie, not a sustainable argument, in view of Paras 4.1.11 and
4.1.13 of the Tender processing procedures contained in the Manual, which have been
extracted in the preceding portion of this judgment; they disclose that rival bidder‟s


IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                    Page 8
 representatives are present at the bid opening stage. This would mean that the plaintiff had
occasion to be represented when the defendant participated in the bids in 2005. Furthermore,
the answer to the defendant‟s query in the appeal filed under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_8">Information Act</a>, in
the form of list of bidders in the thirteen tender processes between January 2005 and
September, 2007 would reveal that both the plaintiff and the defendant participated in the bid
on 12-1-2005, 13-1-2005, 17-2-2005, 23-1-2007, 24-1-2007 and later on 19-9-2007 (Page
362, Part III of the court file). Further, the copy of the official notings supplied to the
defendant, again under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_9">RTI Act</a>, would reveal that in June, 2006, the army authorities had
to deal with a complaint by the plaintiff. The recommendation sheet, suggesting action, inter
alia, says as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "4. From the above it can be inferred that the complaint is based on rivalry between
       the 2 parties, and no strength is available in the complaint. Hence may be ignored. If
       M/s Navin Polycon is convinced that we have favoured M/s S.B. Equipments they may
       be called for open discussion which we may reply suitably...."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">The noting contained in the said document, reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "Pending resolution of the issue of complaint by M/s Navin Polycon a commn has
       been sent to SQAE (GS) to hold over letter of 29th May 2005 (regarding amendments
       to test protocol of M/s S.B. Equipments in abeyance till further comm. (Flag
       A)..Submitted for orders please..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">20.    The documents (Page 375 of the court file, Part III) also reveals that the
recommendation to withdraw the letter keeping the defendant‟s request in abeyance, was
made on 31 August, 2006. These are not speculations, but prima facie, unassailable matters
of the record, as they are answers under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_10">Information Act</a>. They point to the
plaintiff‟s knowledge, about the defendant‟s use of the SUPERBRIGHT mark, in relation to
detergents, and also its moves, within the army decision making process, to stall issue of
contract, that would have paved the way to the defendants‟ goods being supplied to the
Army. In these circumstances, the court is of the view that the plaintiff did not reveal the
truth, while approaching the court, when it did, and asserting that it became aware "recently"
in June, 2007 that the defendant was using the said mark. Having regard to the fact that the
suit is a passing off claim, and not one founded on a registered trademark, this aspect assumes
considerable significance, as the relief of injunction - even temporary injunction, is equitable,
and pre-supposes that the plaintiff reveals all material facts and does not suppress anything
important. The plaintiff in this case clearly was aware that sometime in 2005-2006, the
defendant was in the same business, and had placed a bid successfully, for supply of the
Superbright class of detergent products; the defendant had apparently bid a lower amount,

IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                      Page 9
 and sought for amendment of testing protocols (as did the plaintiff). The latter sought to
block the request, and succeeded in stalling the process for nearly a year. These are material
circumstances, which weigh against the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_18">21.    The other aspect which the court has to consider is the nature of the plaintiffs use of
the SUPERBRIGHT trademark. Its claim to be first user and reputation is premised on a
"sister" concerns alleged continuous use, since 1978; it also says that the mark has been used
since 1990, when several prominent hotels had placed orders for its products. Similar
purchase orders and invoices, for the years 1994, 1996, etc have been relied on. However, as
far as widespread use, and publication in the publication goes, the plaintiff has relied on
advertisements in 2003 and 2004 in certain hospitality based or related magazines. The
circulation and readership of these magazines is unknown; it is unclear whether they cater to
other segments of the detergent market, like hospitals and public users. Here too, the lack of
any clarity in information is important, because injunctive relief in trademark passing off
claims is primarily founded on acquired distinctiveness. It is not every trader or retailer‟s
name, which is entitled to protection, but the distinctiveness associated with the mark, based
on widespread knowledge among the consumers, as a result of diligent and continuous effort
toward that end, by the trademark user, which is entitled such treatment. As held by this court
in <a href="/doc/1840218/" id="a_11">Rob Mathys v. Synthes</a> 1997 (PTC) 669 (Del) "Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary
rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart from the
business to which it is attached." In Cadilla, the Supreme Court, while emphasizing the
proper approach and indicating the tests, significantly, held that the following two indicators
are relevant:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they
       require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to
       exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">       (f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">In this case, the argument about plaintiff‟s injury to its goodwill and reputation is directly
founded on the defendant‟s entering into contract with the army authorities for supply of
detergents. Both the parties are clearly competitors. The goods - rather the customer is
common, i.e. the Indian Army. This customer, or class of customer is unquestionably
discerning. The plaintiff‟s other customers and clients, are also clearly institutions, which
have placed orders on it, based on the performance of its product. In these circumstances, the
prima facie indications are that there is little or insignificant scope for consumer confusion,
or likelihood of deception.
</p>
<p id="p_20">IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                   Page 10
</p><p id="p_21"> 22.     An important aspect of this case is also that the rival word marks are concededly
SUPERBRIGHT, which is a combination of two common words SUPER and BRIGHT.
There is some association with the product, i.e. detergents, which cleanse articles such as
clothes, and other objects. The descriptive association clearly is a claimed attribute of the
product, i.e. its ability to cleanse the goods thoroughly (and therefore, the "bright"). The
SUPER part of the mark, apparently is reference to the attribute of superlative (SUPER)
performance of the detergent. In such cases, there is a body of authority starting with Office
Cleaning Service v. Westminister Window and General Cleaners 1946 RPC 39 which says
that unless a descriptive mark has acquired a degree of secondary meaning, the use by a
competitor in the trade, with some modification does not constitute passing off. These
judgments include <a href="/doc/1813269/" id="a_12">Victory Transport Co. Pvt. Ltd v. District Judge</a> AIR 1981 All 421;
<a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_13">Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratory</a> AIR 1965 SC 980 -where the
rival marks included "Navratna" in relation to pharmaceuticals and Universal Winding Co v.
George Hattersley &amp; Sons 1915 (32) RPC 479. In a similar vein, in <a href="/doc/1161491/" id="a_14">Sona Spices Pvt. Ltd. v.
Soongachi Tea Industries</a> 2007 (34) PTC 91, the aspect of the plaintiff being required to
establish, even prima facie, reasonable likelihood of confusion, on an overall consideration of
the circumstances, based on the acquired distinctiveness and reputation of the trademark in
question, was underlined.
</p>
<p id="p_22">23.     The judgments relied on by the plaintiff - Globe Super Parts v Blue Super Flame
1986 PTC 61 and Super Seals India Pvt. Ltd v. Mantri Brothers 1986 PTC 341, are
inapplicable. In the latter case (Super Seals) the claimant was proprietor of a registered
trademark, which meant that the action was one for infringement, not passing off. The
principle applicable in such cases is that if resemblance or identity is established, the court
looks no further, and is expected to injunct the defendant (Ref. <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_15">Midas Hygiene Industries (P)
Ltd. v. Sudhir Bhatia</a> 2004 (28) PTC 121). In the other case (Globe Super Parts) though the
action was one for passing off, the judgment was a final one, after a full trial, and after the
court weighed all the evidence led before it. In the present case, the parties have only relied
on documents, and have not tested the strengths of their respective cases in a full blown trial.
The court has to see the broad elements of the two sides, based on a prima facie
consideration. Necessarily, therefore, the standards applicable before and after a trial, are,
therefore, different.
</p><p id="p_23">24.     The court is constrained to attach significance to the defendant‟s contention that the
plaintiff, despite knowledge of the defendant‟s use of the trademark -witness the complaint


IA No. 9140/2007in CS (OS) 1454/2007                                                    Page 11
 preferred by it to the army authorities - chose to remain silent, and approached the court
almost one and a half year after becoming aware of the defendant‟s trademark usage, (of the
SUPERBRIGHT mark). The importance of this element - of acquiescence- was underlined
by the Supreme Court, <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_16">Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines (Pvt.) Ltd</a>., 1994 (2)
SCC 448 as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "Acquiescence is one of the defences available under <a href="/doc/371543/" id="a_17">Section 30</a> (1) (b) of the 1958
       Act. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the rights and spending on
       it. It is a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights in a trade
       mark, trade name, etc. It implies positive acts; not merely silence or inaction such as
       is involved in laches. "It is important to distinguish mere negligence and
       acquiescence." Acquiescence is one facet of delay. If the plaintiff stood by knowingly
       and let the defendants build up an important trade until it had become necessary to
       crush it, then the plaintiffs would be stopped by their acquiescence. If the
       acquiescence in the infringement amounts to consent, it will be a complete defence"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">The materials on record suggest that the plaintiff was aware and was indeed a knowing
competitor of the defendant, in the trade when both of them were submitting rival bids to the
army. Even if the plaintiff‟s knowledge is assumed to be in 2005, besides the fact that it made
a complaint to the Army which successfully stalled grant of contract, no action was taken by
it to assert the right in a court of law. This clearly points to delay, and strongly suggests
acquiescence, disentitling it to temporary injunctive relief.
</p><p id="p_25">25.    In the light of the above prima facie conclusions, the court is of the view that the
plaintiff is not entitled to ad-interim temporary injunction. Consequently, IA 9140/2007 is
dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_3">
