                          consistently ranked Plaintiffs&#x27; mark MIRINDA as a leading brand for

                          with average intelligence and imperfect recollection. Use of impugned
                          marks, which are a transliteration of the MIRINDA marks, is
                          resulting in confusion amongst the purchasers that the products of the

                          consumers that the products offered by them have an association with
                          the Plaintiffs and is causing damage to the goodwill of the MIRINDA

</p><p id="p_14">                          11.   It was explained that adoption of the mark was inspired by the

                          admirable/wonderful and signifies quality of liquor/whisky. The


                          adoption of the mark                  was bonafide and honest, with an
                          intent to signify the quality and taste of liquor.

                          Madira Masala Rajshree Mirinda&#x27; and &#x27;Prince Plain&#x27; in respect of
                          plain country liquor.
</p><p id="p_16">                          13.   It was emphasised that Defendants have been extensively using


                          the mark                since 2007 in relation to liquor i.e for nearly 15
                          years now and there has not been a single instance or complaint by
                          any customer alleging that he was confused into buying Defendants&#x27;
                          product under an impression that it emanated from Plaintiffs&#x27; stable.
                          Besides the fact that the marks are neither identical/similar nor
                          deceptively similar, the consumer base and the trade channels are also
                          different. Defendants sell their liquor only through Government
                          approved liquor vends, located in 7 Districts of Madhya Pradesh.
                          These shops only sell liquor under the name &#x27;Liquor Shop&#x27;,
                          prominently written over the bill boards of the shops, which clearly
                          distinguishes them from any confectionary/grocery shop, where soft
                          drinks/snacks are sold. It needs no gainsaying that confectionary/
                          grocery shop keepers are not permitted to sell liquor and thus the trade
                          channels of the rival products are very different, ruling out any
                          possibility of confusion. Defendants are not allowed to sell liquor to
                          retailers or customers directly and it is only when they receive the
                          demand, they send the goods to the warehouses under control and
                          supervision of excise officers with valid excise papers. The retailers
                          thereafter visit the warehouses along with receipt of duties which they
                          have deposited and the excise officer issues the country liquor to the
                          retailer, who thereafter sells to customers through designated/
                          Government approved liquor shops. Additionally, excise department
                          also deputes a Circle Inspector to monitor the sales and other aspects.
                          As per Government Rules and Regulations, the manufacturer has to
                          prominently display on the product the name of the manufacturer,

                          the consumer between one manufacturer and the other. This apart,
                          every bottle of the Defendants bears a stamp by the Government with
                          Excise Adhesive Label, which is unique and different and helps the
                          customers to relate the product to the specific manufacturer by
                          scanning through the mobile camera.

                          different from other liquor or spirits such as whisky, rum, vodka, etc.

                          without addition of soda/soft drink and therefore, a customer who
                          buys country liquor has no reason to buy any additional/
                          supplementary soft drink. It was also pointed out that as per the
                          Government Rules and Regulations, Defendants cannot advertise
                          liquor and therefore, the customers have no option but to visit the
                          Government vends and buy the country liquor where no other product
                          such as soft drink would be available and thus, no confusion could
                          arise between the rival products or marks. In any case, Defendants
                          have dedicated customers for the last 15 years and there has been no
                          cause of complaint.

                          other. Country liquor is sold by Defendants in a packaging of 180 ml,
                          as per the Regulation of the Excise Department and cannot be varied
                          whereas Plaintiffs&#x27; soft drinks come in different packaging. Moreover,

                          at that time, no one knew Pepsi in India. At the time when the


                          Defendants&#x27; predecessors adopted                   , Plaintiffs had no

                          the claim of the Plaintiffs premised on reputation of the high threshold

                          will lead to imposition of penalties as also blacklisting of the
                          Defendants for a long period. Clause 14.1 mandates that successful
                          tenderer will have to ensure supply of country liquor at his own risk
                          and cost. If the supply of liquor to the retailers is interrupted, then the
                          successful tenderer will be considered as a defaulter and in case of
                          more than one successive default, it would be treated as continuous
                          failure of supply. In the event of such continuous failure, the supply
                          area of the tenderer is liable to be attached and a penalty of
                          Rs.50,000/- per day may be imposed by the Excise Commissioner. It
                          is further provided in Clause 14.2 that if re-tendering arises due to
                          fault of the successful tenderer, fresh tenders may be invited at the risk
                          and cost of the defaulter and the difference in price will be borne by
                          the defaulter bidder.

                          Defendants on the ground of delay and acquiescence. It was argued
                          that Defendants have been using the impugned mark for the last 15
                          years in India and it cannot be believed that Plaintiffs had not come
                          across the mark in so many years. Defendants even applied for


                          registration of their mark               in 2017 in Class 33, before the
                          Trade Marks Registry albeit the same was abandoned inadvertently,
                          however, it cannot be the case of the Plaintiffs that they had no
                          knowledge of the same, as the moment anyone approaches the Trade
                          Marks Registry to register a mark, the proposed mark can be easily
                          searched by the public. Therefore, the only conslusion that can be
                          drawn is that Plaintiffs were in complete know-how of the use of the
                          mark by the Defendants for their liquor products and yet approached
                          the Court after an inordinate delay of approximately 15 years. The fact

                          that the Plaintiffs sat by for years together, permitting the Defendants
                          to expand their business constitutes estoppel against them from

                          that Defendants&#x27; stand that they are bound to supply liquor under the
                          mark/name Rajshree Mirinda Masala, in terms of the tender
                          documents, is devoid of merit. Notice Inviting Tender dated
                          15.03.2022 is brand neutral and the only mandatory requirement is
                          supply of plain and masala country liquor under labels, duly registered
                          with the Excise Department. Letter dated 30.03.2022, whereby tender
                          was awarded to the Defendants shows that the tender is brand neutral
                          and there is no obligation to supply only Mirinda Masala. Defendants
                          have deliberately suppressed that they have a label registration for
                          Masala country liquor i.e. &#x27;Desi Madira Masala Prince Orange&#x27;, which
                          they can use to fulfill the tender requirements. This fact was initially
                          admitted by the Defendants, however, later there was a shift of stand
                          to state that some liquor warehouses were demanding only Mirinda
                          Madira Masala and thus the injunction be vacated and Defendants be


                          permitted to to sell under the mark             .

                          even otherwise on account of their conduct. Local Commissioner&#x27;s
                          Report dated 31.05.2022 reflects that he was obstructed from
                          executing the commission and even the local police acted in
                          connivance with the Defendants. As a result, despite the injunction
                          order, Defendants continued to sell their product under the impugned
                          mark. After the Court passed the injunction order and the same was
                          notified to the Defendants, it was their bounden duty to write to the

                          authorities. Defendants&#x27; stand that the letter was in response to the
                          Excise Officer&#x27;s letter dated 19.05.2022 and is an inter-department
                          communication, is inconsequential as it was incumbent on the

                          Defendants&#x27; product only in December, 2021 when it learnt of the
                          application for registration of the mark &#x27;CONTINENTAL MIRINDA
                          BEER&#x27; in Class 32 and soon thereafter, the suit was filed on
                          28.04.2022. Defendants have themselves stated that their products are
                          available in few Districts of Madhya Pradesh and they cannot
                          advertise. Therefore, it was not easy for the Plaintiffs to have known
                          of their activities under the impugned mark. In any case, it is a settled
                          law that in case of infringement, mere delay by itself will not defeat
                          the statutory right of a registered proprietor. Reliance was placed on

                          dishonestly and with a view to encash on their formidable reputation.
                          Plaintiffs have both device and word mark registrations for MIRINDA

                          said provision, no further questions are to be asked. The argument that
                          pricing in class of customers being different, confusion is impossible,
                          is in teeth of the judgments of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_22">Ruston &amp;
                          Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co</a>., (1969) 2 SCC 727

                          country liquor is sold only through Government vends and therefore,
                          no confusion can arise. This argument cannot be accepted for the
                          simple reason that firstly, no confusion is required to be proved under
                          <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_24">Section 29(4)</a> and, secondly, Government liquor vends are merely a
                          medium of sale and not the end consumers, who are generally poor
                          and illiterate people, considering the price of the product of
                          the    Defendants.   Having   themselves    applied      for   the     mark

                          confusion. Dissimilarity of products is not a ground available to the

                          and investigations revealed that Defendant No.2 is the Director of
                          Defendant No.1 and was using Hindi transliteration of the mark
                          MIRINDA, in relation to country made liquor. Soon thereafter, the
                          suit was filed in April, 2022 and thus, there is no delay. Since
                          Plaintiffs had no knowledge of the infringing activities of the
                          Defendants prior to December, 2021, there was no occasion to sit by
                          and allow Defendants to grow, as alleged and thus, there is no
                          acquiescence. Prima facie, there is substance in this submission. It is
                          the stated case of the Defendants that they sell only in 07 Districts of
                          the State of Madhya Pradesh and cannot and do not advertise and thus
                          at this stage, there is no reason for the Court to disbelieve that
                          Plaintiffs had no knowledge of the sales under the impugned mark, in
                          the absence of any material to the contrary placed on record by the
                          Defendants. As soon as the investigations revealed sales under the
                          impugned mark, action was initiated by the Plaintiffs and suit was
                          filed, without delay. In any event, it is a settled law that in matters
                          relating to infringement of trademarks or copyright, injunction must
                          normally follow and delay should not be an impediment. In Midas
                          Hygiene (supra), Appellants had filed a suit for passing off and
                          infringement of copyright along with an application for interim
                          injunction. Learned Single Judge of this Court granted injunction,
                          which was vacated by the Division Bench, on ground of delay and
                          laches in filing the suit. Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court held
                          that in cases of infringement, either of trademark or of copyright,
                          normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is
                          not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in these cases, particularly,
                          where adoption of the mark is dishonest. In this context, I may also
                          refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in M/s. Hindustan Pencils

                          1989 SCC OnLine Del 34 and of this Court in Victoria Foods
                          (supra). Relevant para of the judgment in M/s. Hindustan Pencils
                          (supra) is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                &quot;29. If an action is taken by the registered owner and no interim
                                injunction is granted, the effect is that goods bearing the
                                infringement mark or spurious goods would continue to be sold in
                                the market. After a number of years when the case is finally disposed
                                of, after trial, and the plaintiff succeeds and gets a permanent
                                injunction then, possibly, the plaintiff may also be compensated by
                                his being awarded damages or an account of profits. In that sense
                                the non-grant of the interim injunction would not, ultimately,
                                prejudice the plaintiff for he may be compensated with payment of
                                money but during this period when the defendant is allowed to
                                continue to infringe the intellectual property it is the consumer or
                                the purchaser who alone suffers and who ultimately cannot be
                                compensated. Therefore, in order to curb the menance of
                                manufacture, production and sale of spurious goods and the blatant
                                violation of intellectual property it will be proper for the court to
                                take into consideration the interest of the general public. In this
                                regard reference may usefully be made to the following observations
                                of McCARTHY at page 346, para 30.21 which deals with the
                                protection of third parties:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                    &quot;Some courts also consider the necessity of protecting third
                                    parties. In trademark infringement cases, &quot;third parties&quot; means
                                    the buying public. If the equities are closely balanced, the right
                                    of the public not to be deceived or confused may turn the scales
                                    in favour of a preliminary injunction.&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                It would appear to be difficult to accept that relief of temporary
                                injunction should not be granted, because of the delay on the part of
                                the plaintiff, even though the court feels, at that point of time, that
                                ultimately permanent injunction will have to be granted.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">                          32.   Law on acquiescence is also no longer res integra. The onus
                          was clearly on the Defendants to show that there was some positive
                          act on part of the Plaintiffs, which led to an impression that Plaintiffs
                          were letting the Defendants sell under the impugned mark and had
                          turned a blind eye so as to be disentitled to trample over the business
                          of the Defendants. This onus the Defendants have failed to discharge
                          even on a prima facie threshold and to the contrary, Plaintiffs have
                          agitated their claims as soon as they gained knowledge in December,

                          2021. The Supreme Court in M/s Power Control Appliances (supra)
                          held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                &quot;26. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the
                                rights and spending money on it. It is a course of conduct
                                inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights in a trade mark, trade
                                name etc. It implies positive acts; not merely silence or inaction such
                                as is involved in laches. In Harcourt v. White [(1860) 28 Beav 303 :
                                54 ER 382] Sr. John Romilly said: &quot;It is important to distinguish
                                mere negligence and acquiescence.&quot; Therefore, acquiescence is one
                                facet of delay. If the plaintiff stood by knowingly and let the
                                defendants build up an important trade until it had become
                                necessary to crush it, then the plaintiffs would be stopped by their
                                acquiescence. If the acquiescence in the infringement amounts to
                                consent, it will be a complete defence as was laid down in Mouson
                                (J.G.) &amp; Co. v. Boehm [(1884) 26 Ch D 406]. The acquiescence
                                must be such as to lead to the inference of a licence sufficient to
                                create a new right in the defendant as was laid down in Rodgers v.
                                Nowill [(1847) 2 De GM&amp;G 614 : 22 LJ KCH 404] .
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                27.    The law of acquiescence is stated by Cotton, L.J. in Proctor
                                v. Bannis [(1887) 36 Ch D 740] as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                    &quot;It is necessary that the person who alleges this lying by should
                                    have been acting in ignorance of the title of the other man, and
                                    that the other man should have known that ignorance and not
                                    mentioned his own title.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                In the same case Bowen, L.J. said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                    &quot;In order to make out such acquiescence it is necessary to
                                    establish that the plaintiff stood by and knowingly allowed the
                                    defendants to proceed and to expend money in ignorance of the
                                    fact that he had rights and means to assert such rights.&quot;

                                ILR 1941 Mad 300] at pages 33 and 34 the law is stated thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                    &quot;To support a plea of acquiescence in a trade mark case it must
                                    be shown that the plaintiff has stood by for a substantial period
                                    and thus encouraged the defendant to expend money in building
                                    up a business associated with the mark. In Rowland v. Michell
                                    [(1896) 13 RPC 464] Romer J. observed:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                       &#x27;If the plaintiff really does stand by and allow a man to carry
                                       on business in the manner complained of to acquire a
                                       reputation and to expend money he cannot then after a long
                                       lapse of time, turn round and say that the business ought to

                                    wrong which has been done to him. Cases may occasionally lay
                                    down principles and so forth which are a guide to the court, but

                          <a href="/doc/137102954/" id="a_34">ITC Limited v. Philip Morris Products SA and Ors</a>., 2010 SCC
                          OnLine Del 27 and I may usefully allude to a few observations in this
                          regard. The Court has held that <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_35">Section 29(1)</a> and (2) of the Act relate
                          to infringement where there is resemblance or deceptive similarity
                          between a registered mark and another, in relation to same or similar
                          goods and in such a case, if requisite degree of resemblance is
                          established, infringement is made out and where the marks and the
                          goods are identical, infringement is presumed under <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_36">Section 29(3)</a>.
                          However, a slightly different standard has been set by the Legislature
                          in a case of infringement, where the goods or products are dissimilar,
                          and there is trademark dilution. The Court relied on the concept of
                          dilution as follows:-

                               goods which bear it; it carries his name for good or ill. If
                               another uses it, he borrows the owner&#x27;s reputation, whose
                               quality no longer lies within his own control. This is an injury,
                               even though the borrower does not tarnish it, or divert any sales
                               by its use; for a reputation, like a face, is the symbol of its
                               possessor and creator, and another can use it only as a mask.

                          Act</a>, 1958, did not provision for trademark dilution, as in the case of
                          <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_38">Section 29(4)</a>. The principle of dilution therefore, was developed by
                          our courts, having regard to internationally recognized standards
                          about the need to protect generally well known trademarks, whose

                          dissimilar products or services could injure and &quot;dilute&quot; its appeal.

</p><p id="p_41">                                    18. In the instant case, &quot;Mercedes&quot; is a name given to a very

                                The observations have been assimilated in case law, by the courts in
                                India, and applied, wherever trademark dilution was alleged (<a href="/doc/193521140/" id="a_40">Ref

</p>
<p id="p_42">                          35.   The Court further observed that the entire structure of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_44">Section
                          29(4)</a> is different from the earlier provisions in <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_45">Section 29</a> and this is
                          because the &#x27;likelihood of confusion&#x27; test, which is the essential basis
                          of trademark law, is not incorporated in relation to infringement of the
                          kind <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_46">Section 29(4)</a> envisions. The emphasis on similar goods is the
                          recurring theme in each of the sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_47">Section
                          29(2)</a> and identity/similarity requirement along with similarity of
                          goods are twin conditions. However, <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_48">Section 29(4)</a> posits identity or
                          similarity of the mark but in relation to dissimilar goods. Importantly,
                          the Court also held that the object of the dilution form of infringement
                          under <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_49">Section 29(4)</a> in effect, is a wider trademark protection without
                          the concomitant likelihood of confusion requirement as the
                          Legislature has not referred to the need for proving confusion under
                          sub-section (4). Thus, what the Plaintiff is required to establish are
                          cumulative conditions of similarity or identity of marks, repute in
                          India, use of mark without cause and intent to take unfair advantage or
                          the use of the impugned mark being detrimental to the distinctive
                          character/repute of the registered mark. Reference was made to the

                          that a Court is required to pose and answer under <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_50">Section 29(4)</a>, while
                          adjudicating a claim for infringement and relevant passage from the
                          judgment in DaimlerChrysler AG v. Alavi, [2001] RPC 42 is as
                          follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                                &quot;88. In my view, the best approach is just to follow the section,
                                remembering Jacobs A.G.&#x27;s warning that it is concerned with actual
                                effects, not risks or likelihoods. The enquiry is as follows. (1) Does
                                the proprietor&#x27;s mark have a reputation? If so, (2) is the defendant&#x27;s
                                sign sufficiently similar to it that the public are either deceived into
                                the belief that the goods are associated with the proprietor so that
                                the use of the sign takes unfair advantage of the mark, or
                                alternatively causes detriment in their minds to either (a) the repute
                                or (b) the distinctive character of the mark, or (3) even if they are
                                not confused, does the use of the sign nonetheless have this effect,
                                and (4) is the use complained of nonetheless with due cause.
                                Detriment can take the form either of making the mark less attractive
                                (tarnishing, to use Neuberger J.&#x27;s word) or less distinctive
                                (blurring). On this analysis, VISA is of course a case of tarnishing.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">                          36.   Insofar as the test of similarity is concerned, the Court relied on
                          the judgment in Sabel BV v. Puma AG, [1998] RPC 199, where it was
                          held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">                                &quot;37. The test of similarity or confusion had been indicated, in
                                Sabel BV v. Puma AG, [1998] RPC 199 as follows:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">                                      &quot;... The likelihood of confusion must therefore be appreciated
                                      globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the
                                      circumstances of the case....That global appreciation of the
                                      visual, aural or conceptual similarity or the marks in question,
                                      must be based on the overall impression given by the marks,
                                      bearing in mind, in particular, their distinctive and dominant
                                      components ... The average consumer normally perceives a
                                      mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyse its various
                                      details.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">                                It was held in Adidas-Salomon AG v. Fitnessworld Trading Ltd.,
                                0041 Ch 120, that it is not necessary to establish confusion or the
                                likelihood of confusion in order to establish infringement under this
                                head. The plaintiff has to show that there is sufficient degree of
                                similarity between the mark with a reputation and the sign (ie. the
                                impugned mark) to have the effect that the relevant section of the
                                public establishes a link between the sign and the mark. The court

                                      in every case that the use of the contested sign is without due
                                      cause; and that it takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to,
                                      the distinctive character or the repute of the mark. These
                                      requirements, properly applied, will ensure that marks with a
                                      reputation, whether or not the reputation is substantial, will not

                          Intel Corp Inc v. CPM United Kingdom Ltd., 2009 ETMR 13, as
                          follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">                                &quot;44. As regards the degree of similarity between the conflicting
                                marks, the more similar they are, the more likely it is that the later
                                mark will bring the earlier mark with a reputation to the mind of the
                                relevant public. That is particularly the case where those marks are
                                identical.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                                45.    However, the fact that the conflicting marks are identical,
                                and even more so if they are merely similar, is not sufficient for it to
                                be concluded that there is a link between those marks.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                                46.     It is possible that the conflicting marks are registered for
                                goods or services in respect of which the relevant sections of the
                                public do not overlap.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                47.     The reputation of a trade mark must be assessed in relation
                                to the relevant section of the public as regards the goods or services
                                for which that mark was registered. That may be either the public at
                                large or a more specialised public (see General Motors, paragraph

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">                                48.     It is therefore conceivable that the relevant section of the
                                public as regards the goods or services for which the earlier mark
                                was registered is completely distinct from the relevant section of the
                                public as regards the goods or services for which the later mark was
                                registered and that the earlier mark, although it has a reputation, is
                                not known to the public targeted by the later, mark. In such a case,
                                the public targeted by each of the two marks may never be
                                confronted with the other mark, so that it will not establish any link
                                between those marks.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">                                49.     Furthermore, even if the relevant section of the public as
                                regards the goods or services for which the conflicting marks are
                                registered is the same or overlaps to some extent, those goods or
                                services may be so dissimilar that the later mark is unlikely to bring
                                the earlier mark to the mind of the relevant public.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">                                50.     Accordingly, the nature of the goods or services for which
                                the conflicting marks are registered must be taken into consideration
                                for the purposes of assessing whether there is a link between those
                                marks.

                                made of it, the more likely it is that, confronted with a later identical

                                mean that the identity or similarity standard is a notch higher -- the
                                claimant has to prove or establish that the two marks are identical
                                with or similar to each other. The question of deception does not
                                arise here. There must be a near identification of the two marks or
                                they must have the closest similarity. The second aspect is that the
                                other elements necessary to establish dilution dissimilarity of goods,
                                the claimant mark having a reputation in India; the use of the mark

                                taking undue advantage, have to be established. These ingredients
                                are all to be established, as the conjunctive &quot;and&quot; is used, in <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_54">Section

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">                                49.     As commented earlier, the analogy of tests evolved in
                                infringement actions where similar goods or services are in question
                                appears to be inapposite, after the enactment of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_55">Section 29(4)</a>. The
                                plaintiff has to fulfill a more stringent test (than the deceptive
                                similarity standard) of proving identity or similarity, where
                                trademark dilution is complained. Applying the reasoning of the
                                decisions cited previously, it is held that a &quot;global&quot; look, rather
                                than a focus only on the common elements of the mark, is to be
                                taken, while considering if the impugned or junior mark infringes, by

                          Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/41901785/" id="a_56">Ford Motor Company &amp; Anr. v. C.R Borman

                                On a reading of paragraph 12 of the impugned Order, it appears to
                                us that one of the reasons which had weighed on the learned Single
                                Judge was that <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_58">Section 29(4)</a> would, inter alia, apply only in cases
                                where the Defendants had taken unfair advantage of the Plaintiffs&#x27;
                                reputation. If a Plaintiff fails to plead that the Defendants have taken
                                unfair advantage of the Plaintiffs&#x27; reputation, the consequence will
                                be that no cause of action would have arisen for the invocation of
                                <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_59">Section 29(4)</a>. In such an event, the Plaint would have to be rejected
                                under Order 7 Rule 11 and not returned to the Plaintiffs under
                                Order 7 Rule 10. However, as already dealt with above, a reading of
                                Paragraphs 32 to 34 of the Plaint leave no possibility for doubting
                                that the Plaintiffs had in terms, inter alia, pleaded that the
                                Defendants had taken unfair advantage of the Plaintiffs&#x27; reputation.</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">                                A holistic reading of the Plaint would show that a case has been
                                stated justifying the invocation of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_60">Section 29(4)</a>. It is quite another
                                matter whether this case would eventually be proved through

                                of the Class under which it has been applied and registered. The
                                view of the learned Single Judge is that the intendment of the Act
                                could not be for a blanket protection to be made available to a
                                trademark in respect of the entire gamut of Classes. What should not
                                be lost sight of is the fact that <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_62">Section 29(4)</a> is palpably an exception
                                to the scheme of the Act and applies only to those trademarks which
                                have earned a reputation in India. If it is, prima facie, clear or it is
                                proved through evidence that the concerned trademark enjoys and
                                commands a reputation in India, the Plaintiffs do not have to prove
                                deception on the part of the Defendants or likelihood of the customer
                                being misled because of the use of the challenged trademark. Once
                                the Plaintiffs have made out a case that the offending trademark is
                                identical with or similar to its registered trademark, relief would be
                                available even if the purveyed goods are not similar and/or fall in
                                the same category or class. On a careful comparison of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_63">Section
                                29(4)</a> with other provisions of that Section as well as the Act, this
                                legal position commends itself to us. It is impermissible to ignore all
                                these features of <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_64">Section 29(4)</a> only because they may be seen as
                                running counter to other provisions of the Act. This is the very
                                purpose of inserting an exception. It would be advantageous to
                                reproduce the sentence from &#x27;Parliamentary Discussion on the

                                trademarks and to do away with the system for registration in Part A
                                and B and to provide for a single computerised register with a

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">                                &quot;33. The protection extended by <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_69">Section 29(4)</a> even to dissimilar

                                Dilution is a type of violation of a trade mark, in which the
                                Defendant&#x27;s use, while not causing a likelihood of confusion, blurs
                                distinctiveness or tarnishes the image of the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark.
                                <a href="/doc/1460548/" id="a_70">In Daimler Benz Aktigesellschaft v. Hybo Hindustan</a>, AIR 1994 Del.

                                adopted the mark for dissimilar products and services. The same

                                reputation of the mark and not on the reputation of its maker, we
                                may have to see how to assess and determine the reputation of a
                                mark. The reputation of a trademark has to be assessed on the basis
                                of several factors, such as the publicity that preceded and succeeded
                                the launch of the product carrying the mark, the volume of turnover
                                and the impact that the mark has created in the minds of the public,
                                enabling them to associate the mark with the product. The reputation
                                of the mark need not always be reflected by the volume of turnover
                                alone. While dealing with the concept of &quot;goodwill&quot;, which is only

                          1010. Referring to English and Australian decisions, the Supreme

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">                               &quot;7. ...The matter has been considered in two cases by the House

                               definitions previously given were considered, and Lord
                               Macnaghten observed that goodwill is &quot;the whole advantage,

                               Ltd., Lord Macnaghten at pp. 223 and 224 made the following
                               observations:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">                                  &quot;What is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to describe, very
                                  difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good-
                                  name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the
                                  attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing
                                  which distinguishes an old-established business from a new
                                  business at its first start.... If there is one attribute common
                                  to all cases of goodwill it is the attribute of locality. For
                                  goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by
                                  itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the business,
                                  and the goodwill perishes with it, though elements remain
                                  which may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again.&quot;

                                  separate value, prima facie at any rate it may be treated as
                                  attached to the premises and whatever its value may be,
                                  should be treated as an enhancement of the value of the

                                       &quot;Hence to determine the nature of the goodwill in any given
                                       case, it is necessary to consider the type of business and the
                                       type of customer which such a business is inherently likely to
                                       attract as well as the surrounding circumstances .... The
                                       goodwill of a business is a composite thing referable in part
                                       to its locality, in part to the way in which it is conducted and
                                       the personality of those who conduct it, and in part to the
                                       likelihood of competition, many customers being no doubt

                                       particular trade mark or trade name.&quot;
</p><p id="p_63">                                    9. It will thus be seen that the goodwill of a business depends
                                    upon a variety of circumstances or a combination of them. The
                                    location, the service, the standing of the business, the honesty of
                                    those who run it, and the lack of competition and many other
                                    factors go individually or together to make up the goodwill,
                                    though locality always plays a considerable part. Shift the
                                    locality, and the goodwill may be lost. At the same time, locality
                                    is not everything. The power to attract customers depends on
                                    one or more of the other factors as well. In the case of a theatre
                                    or restaurant, what is catered, how the service is run and what
                                    the competition is, contribute also to the goodwill.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_64">                          41.   From a reading of the aforesaid judgment, it is clear that
                          goodwill and reputation may not necessarily be directly proportionate
                          to the turnover or the net profits earned in business, albeit turnover is
                          one of the crucial factors that may indicate the existence of reputation.
                          The other thing that needs to be noted are the observations of this
                          Court in para 37 of the judgment in <a href="/doc/115682582/" id="a_79">Bloomberg Finance LP v. Prafull

                                balance out this element, the legislature has mandated the necessity
                                of showing that (a) the mark has a reputation in India (b) that the
                                mark has a distinctive character (c) the use by the infringer is

                          ingredient of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_85">Section 29(4)</a> stands satisfied.
</p><p id="p_67">                          44.    Insofar as the reputation of the mark MIRINDA in India is
                          concerned, the same is vouchsafed by the pleadings in the plaint as
                          well as the documents on record. Plaintiff has pleaded and placed on
                          record documents evidencing both device and word mark registrations
                          for MIRINDA in India in Class 32. The earliest device mark
                          registration dates back to 04.06.1997. Indisputably, MIRINDA was
                          first adopted by Plaintiff No.1 in Spain in 1959 in relation to fruit
                          flavoured non-carbonated beverages and in India in 1996, from which
                          year it has been extensively and continuously used. Articles published
                          in print/online media, highlighting the brand value of the trademark
                          have been filed and to refer a few illustratively: article published in
                          Rediff in 1999; in India Today with celebrities as brand ambassadors
                          in 1999; in Financial Express in 2002; in Economic Times in 2005.
                          Chartered Accountant certificates have been filed pointing to the
                          annual turnover from sale of products under the trademark MIRINDA
                          which reflects that between the years 2013 to 2020, the annual
                          turnover is over Rs. 2500 crores. Invoices in support have also been
                          placed on record. Plaintiffs are also recipient of several awards such as
                          &#x27;Most Trusted Brands of Brand Equity&#x27; in the years 2012, 2013, 2014,
                          2015 and 2016. The promotional and advertising expenditure, as
                          pleaded, are to the tune of over Rs. 157 crores for a period of nearly 7
                          years and it is also shown that several celebrities have endorsed
                          Plaintiffs&#x27;   products   under   the   marks    MIRINDA,      as    brand

                          SCC OnLine Del 484, where the Plaintiff had sought restraint against

                          contended by the Plaintiff that this was a clear case of dilution of
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s well known mark BMW, under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_87">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">                                &quot;22. Hence the court held that where the products are different,
                                prior owner&#x27;s chance of success is a function of many variables; the
                                strength of his mark, the degree of similarities between the two
                                marks, the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior
                                owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion , etc. All variables have
                                to be taken into account. Based on the above the court on the facts of
                                that case concluded that visual appearance of the two marks is
                                different and they relate to different products. Further, the manner in
                                which they are treated by the appellant and the respondent
                                respectively the court concluded that it was difficult to imagine that
                                an average man of ordinary intelligence would associate the goods
                                of the appellant as that of the respondent. Clearly, in the facts of that
                                case the court came to a conclusion that an average man of ordinary
                                intelligence would not associate the goods of the appellant as that of
                                the respondent. In my opinion, the facts of the present case are
                                materially different. The strength of the trademark of the plaintiff
                                cannot be disputed. The plaintiff is manufacturing motorcycles under
                                the mark BMW since 1923 and motor cars since 1928, under the said
                                mark. It has assembly plants in 14 countries and a global sales
                                network in more than 140 countries. The plaintiff and affiliated
                                companies have a work force nearly of 1,25,000. In 2016, it had a
                                revenue of 94.163 million Euros. In 2016, 23,67,600 vehicles were
                                sold worldwide by the plaintiff of which two million vehicles were
                                cars with the brand BMW mark. In these circumstances, the use of
                                the mark DMW by the defendant prima facie appears to be a

                          MIRINDA in the plaint have only been evasively and vaguely denied
                          by the Defendants in the written statement. Stand of the Defendants
                          that they have been using the mark from 2007 is prima facie incorrect
                          since the trademark application bearing No.3471413 for device mark


                                        was abandoned. The application filed on 01.02.2017 was
                          on &#x27;proposed to be used&#x27; basis. In the earlier application No.3465713,
                          user   was     claimed      from     06.07.2015       for    the    word      mark
                          &#x27;CONTINENTAL MIRINDA BEER&#x27;. Insofar as the label registration
                          is concerned, the submission that it is from the year 2007, cannot be
                          countenanced as Defendants have failed to place on record any sales
                          figures/invoices/CA certificates for the said period. Therefore, at this
                          interim stage, pending trial, the claim of use of the impugned mark
                          from 2007 cannot be accepted. [Ref.: FDC Limited (supra)].

                          the scope and ambit of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_89">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act, given the strength and
                          repute of MIRINDA marks, degree of similarity with the impugned
                          mark and the chance of the Plaintiffs bridging the gap between soft
                          drinks and country made liquor. Plaintiffs have made out a case of
                          infringement against the Defendants. Balance of convenience also lies
                          in favour of the Plaintiffs and irreparable harm and injury shall be

                          judgment in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_90">Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai
                          Patel and Others</a>, (2006) 8 SCC 726, to support the plea that there is
                          an inordinate delay of approximately 15 years as the mark MIRINDA
                          has been extensively used by the Defendants since 2007. In the said
                          judgment, the Supreme Court has held that delay in an infringement of
                          trademark may by itself not be a ground for refusing to issue
                          injunction but may cause the Court in a given case to refuse an
                          interlocutory injunction, where the Defendant has built up a trade in
                          which he has notoriously used the mark, relying on Kerr in his
                          Treatise on the Law and Practice of Injunction, 6th Edn., PP. 360-361
                          and also observed that specific knowledge on the part of the Plaintiff
                          and prejudice suffered by the Defendant would also be a relevant
                          factor. However, the said judgment, in my view, does not aid the
                          Defendants. Plaintiffs have explained and pleaded that they learnt only
                          in December, 2021 that Defendant No. 2 had applied for
                          &#x27;CONTINENTAL MIRINDA BEER&#x27; in Class 32, upon which they
                          investigated the matter. The investigations revealed that Defendant
                          No.2 is the Director of Defendant No.1 which is using the Hindi
                          transliteration of the mark MIRINDA in relation to country made
                          liquor and soon thereafter, the present suit was filed in April, 2022. At

                          this stage, therefore, this Court is unable to come to a prima facie
                          conclusion against the Plaintiff that there is delay in approaching the
                          Court and in any event, assuming there is some delay, that is not
                          enough by itself to deter this Court from granting injunction, more so
                          when the adoption is dishonest. For the same reason, the judgment in
                          <a href="/doc/507033/" id="a_91">Khoday Distillers Limited v. Scotch Whisky Association and Others</a>,
                          (2008) 10 SCC 723, relied upon by the Defendants is also
                          distinguishable on facts. Additionally, Plaintiffs have also explained
                          that Defendants were selling their products locally in a few Districts of
                          Madhya Pradesh and since the product could not be advertised, being
                          prohibited by law, there was no way Plaintiffs could have known
                          about usage of the impugned mark earlier.
</p><p id="p_74">                          49.   Reliance was placed by the Defendants on the judgment in
                          <a href="/doc/276675/" id="a_92">Lowenbrau AG &amp; Anr. v. Jagpin Breweries Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., 2009 SCC
                          OnLine Del 45, to set up a case of honest and concurrent user. In the
                          said judgment, this Court held that concurrent and honest use is a valid
                          defence against action for infringement under the Trade and
                          <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_93">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 and even <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_94">Sections 9(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/1863142/" id="a_95">30(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/90290/" id="a_96">30(2)</a>
                          and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_97">35</a> of the Act recognizes honest and concurrent use, and on the
                          conditions mentioned therein being satisfied, valid defence can be
                          raised against infringement. This judgment also does not inure to the
                          advantage of the Defendants since this Court has rendered a prima
                          facie finding that the adoption of the impugned mark is dishonest and
                          the attempt to adopt and use the trademark of the Plaintiffs, which has
                          a repute of the threshold required under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_98">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act, is
                          only to gain advantage and mileage from the said mark. Furthermore,
                          this defence is contradicted by the Defendants by their own argument
                          that the reason for adoption was that Cox Distillery was established by
                          an Englishman and when he came up with the term &#x27;Mirinda&#x27; for

                          this was the reason for adoption, mark could not have been coined by
                          the said entity in 2007.
</p><p id="p_75">                          50.   Defendants have also relied on the judgment in <a href="/doc/21075/" id="a_99">Radico Khaitan
                          Limited v. Carlsberg India Private Limited</a>, 2011 SCC OnLine Del
                          3925, more particularly, para 30 thereof, wherein this Court observed
                          that it is always not necessary to infer that trade practice is honest
                          solely because the manner of use of expression is in descriptive sense
                          and not in a prominent fashion. The converse may be true also in some
                          cases and there are certain industries wherein special emphasis has to
                          be given to the said expression upon the product or an ingredient of
                          the product, so as to catch the customers or attract the consumers,
                          rather than using it as a small word on the label. It was further held
                          that the decisive test for examining the honest practice is not
                          prominence or non-prominence of the expression, which though may
                          be relevant but much will depend upon the manner of use of the
                          expression as warranted in the said industry, which will set out the
                          limit for what can be honest or dishonest. The judgment is wholly
                          inapplicable to the present case since the word &#x27;MIRINDA&#x27; is prima
                          facie far from descriptive and moreover, Defendants cannot be
                          allowed to raise this argument, having themselves applied for claiming
                          exclusive right over the word which is MIRINDA&#x27;s transliteration in
                          Hindi. It needs no emphasis that Plaintiffs&#x27; mark MIRINIDA has
                          acquired huge goodwill and reputation and going by the strength of
                          the mark, Defendants&#x27; use of a mark which is a transliteration with
                          phonetic identity, cannot be counterbalanced by the defence of honest
                          and concurrent user. [Ref. <a href="/doc/34125679/" id="a_100">Sagar Ratna Restaurants Private Limited

                          (supra), the trademark &#x27;NANDINI&#x27; was being used by the Respondent
                          since 1985 in respect of milk and milk products as against the

                          cited the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra). The Court distinguished
                          the judgment on the ground that where products are different, prior
                          owner&#x27;s chance of success is a function of various variables, such as
                          strength of his mark; degree of similarity etc. and in the present case
                          the reputation of MIRINDA marks is an added and crucial factor,
                          which distinguishes it from the facts of the cases in Nandhini Deluxe

                          Defendants in the application seeking vacation of ex parte injunction
                          is totally flawed.
</p><p id="p_78">                          53.   Lot of stress was laid by the learned Senior Counsel for the
                          Defendants to bring home the point that there is no likelihood of
                          confusion only because the Defendants mark is a transliteration of the
                          mark of the Plaintiffs, since the products in question and the class of
                          customers as well as packaging, price and trade channels are different,
                          with special emphasis on the fact that the country made liquor of the
                          Defendants is sold only through Government liquor vends. In my
                          view, this argument only deserves to be rejected, being devoid of
                          merit. Plain reading of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_105">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act coupled with the
                          judgments of this Court where its ambit and scope has been
                          considered at length, in my view, the said defences would not aid the
                          Defendants. As repeatedly held and affirmed in the judgments referred
                          to above, once the Plaintiff is able to show prima facie reputation of
                          the threshold required under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_106">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act, the likelihood of
                          confusion or deception is obliterated and this becomes pronounced
                          when the impugned mark is a transliteration of the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark.
                          Insofar as dissimilarity of goods, trade channels etc. is concerned,
                          once the Plaintiff comes under the umbrella of the provisions of
                          <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_107">Section 29(4)</a>, protection would transcend across goods and the Court
