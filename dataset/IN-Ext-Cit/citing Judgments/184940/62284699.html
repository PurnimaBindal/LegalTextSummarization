                     through the counter affidavit is that, the writ petition first of all is not

                     maintainable, as the petitioners do not have the locus standi to file the writ

                     petition as they have to file appeal against the order passed by the second

                     respondent, CMDA and moreover the appeal filed by the fourth respondent

                     since was allowed by the first respondent State Government, that is the basic

                     order, pursuant to which only now the impugned planning permission was

                     given by the second respondent and therefore the Government decision

                                  4.1. The sixth respondent claims to be one of the trustee of the

                     petitioner trust and she adopts the averments and contention of the writ

                     petitioner trust that, the trust is one of the co-owner of the land sought to be

                     developed by the fourth respondent trust and the planning permission was

                     given to the fourth respondent without the consent and notwithstanding the

                     objection of the writ petitioners as well as the sixth respondent.



</p><p id="p_56">                                  4.2. The sixth respondent also has taken a stand that, since her

                     husband son Muthiah died on 24.01.1970 intestate, his undivided half share

                     in the entire property of 127 grounds had devolved on his legal heirs namely

                     the sixth respondent and her mother-in-law Meyyammai Achi equally, i.e.,

                     1/4 share each by operation of law. She further states that subsequently by a

                     registered Gift Deed, dated 28.03.1970, father Muthiah gifted his undivided

                     half share of 75 grounds out of the total extent of 150 grounds of land

                     comprised in R.S.No.4277, Mylapore village to the fourth respondent Trust.

                     Therefore these documents prove that, the son Muthiah, i.e., husband of the

                     sixth respondent got 75 grounds in R.S.No.4277.

                     her, as the wife of the pre deceased son, i.e., son Muthiah and on his

                     younger          son Dr.M.A.M.Ramaswamy, i.e., 1/16 share each in the total

                     establishing educational institution and imparting education to all, the sixth

                     respondent started a society in the year 1986 and the said society established

                     and running a school, by name, Chettinad Vidhyashram in R.S.No.4277

                     with a consent and encouragement and co-operation of all the co-owners of

                     the property. The school has grown from strength to strength during the last

                     35 years. Substantial buildings had been put up for the school with +2

                     standards. The school is run in consonance with the desire and vision of

                     father Muthiah and son Muthiah in the same property owned and lived by

                     the fourth respondent towards the Corporation of Chennai, the third

                     respondent herein for laying a public road. Now after deducting the 8

                     grounds, the fourth respondent would be entitled for 75-8 only 67 grounds.

                     The road frontage available for S.No.4277 is about 950 feet which should be

                     divided between the fourth respondent, the petitioner and the sixth

                     respondent family in proportion to their holding. Assuming without

                     the one side and the petitioner and the R6 put together on the other side, the

                     R4 would be entitled only to 475 feet of the road frontage, whereas, as per

                     of about 560 feet which is beyond the entitlement of the fourth respondent.

                     the decision taken by the Government through the Appeal Committee twice

                     as referred to above. The decision taken to give direction to the CMDA to

                     pursue the application of the fourth respondent to grant planning permission

                     is pursuant to the MSB meetings recommendation which was accepted by

                     the Government through its Appeal Committee and what has been

                     deliberated and accepted by the Appeal Committee also has been stated in

                     G.O.Ms.No.74 and in letter, dated 16.06.2020. Therefore those decisions

                     taken by the Government is the basis for granting planning permission,

                     however those documents or orders issued by the Government have

                     admittedly not been questioned by the petitioners in this writ petition.

                     Therefore the consequential planning permission granted by the second

                     respondent cannot independently be challenged, she contended. By making

                     these submissions, the learned standing counsel appearing for CMDA seeks

                     dismissal of this writ petition.

                     through the standing counsel, the learned Advocate General has contended

                     that, the Government having placed the issue before the Appeal Committee,

                     had decided to allow the appeal filed by the fourth respondent. He would

                     submit that, on 19.07.2019 there was a Government letter, pursuant to

                     which, the order of planning permission was given by the second respondent

                     on 25.02.2021.

                     respondent under Rule 6 of the Development Control Rules. The Court can

                     the issue raised in this writ petition, for the purpose of arriving at a decision,

                     can be categorised as three parts. Part I is the locus of the petitioner to file

                     the writ petition, Part II is the right and title of the parties over the property

                     in dispute and Part III is the procedure and decision making process

                     undertaken by the CMDA and the State Government in granting planning

                     permission to the fourth respondent, which is impugned herein. Hence I

                     propose to discuss the issue raised in the writ petition only under these three

                     not the document at all in the eye of law in view of the same being an

                     unregistered one. Therefore, if at all anything to be conveyed by a registered

                     account and if that is taken in to account only the father Muthiah has gifted

                     the half share belongs to him in the total property, i.e., only 75 grounds,

                     hence, that 75 grounds alone had been transferred in favour of the fourth

                     wanted to stall the proposed construction to be undertaken by the fourth

                     in this regard and this has been mainly canvassed by the learned counsel

                     the applicant who should be the owner of the land or lease holder or power

                     respondent on behalf of the fourth respondent, who is the power of attorney

                     holder of the fourth respondent. Therefore based on this prima facie view,

                     to be dismissed, it is dismissed accordingly. The interim order of stay

                     granted on 27.08.2021 in W.M.P.No.19289 of 2021 therefore is hereby

                     vacated. The vacate stay petition in W.M.P.No.23161 of 2021 hence is

                     allowed. Consequently, other connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

                     However there shall be no order as to costs.
