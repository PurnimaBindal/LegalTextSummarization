                 PLAINTIFF&#x27;S CASE

</p><p id="p_3">                 2.      It is the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is one of the leading
                         food companies in India, engaged inter alia in manufacturing and
                         marketing a wide variety of dips, spreads, condiments, sauces,
                         noodles, soups, pastes, dressings, ready-to-eat food products and
                         other food preparations, for more than 25 years. The plaintiff
                         employs more than 1200 people, having presence in countries such
                         as U.S.A., Canada, Australia, U.K., Singapore, to name a few.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 3.      The plaintiff asserts that the plaintiff was the first to coin and
                         independently invent a distinctive trade mark &quot;SCHEZWAN
                         CHUTNEY&quot; in relation to dips and spreads, which is prima facie
                         distinctive of the goods of the plaintiff and is exclusively associated
                         with the plaintiff‟s brand. Its mark &quot;SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&quot;
                         has been granted registration for goods covered in Class 30,
                         including sauce, under Registration No. 2431851 on 01.06.2017 as
                         of 22.11.2012. Though Rectification Petitions have been filed
                         against the said registration, the same is still valid and subsisting.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                 4.      The plaintiff has also filed another trade mark application for the
                         mark &quot;SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&quot; under application no. 2431850
                         in Class 29 on 22.11.2012, but the same was refused raising an
                         objection under <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter
                         referred to as „the Act‟). A review has been filed against the said
                         refusal order, which is pending before the Trade Marks Registry.

                         SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY is represented in a unique and
                         distinctive manner in two lines in white lettering on the colour

                         1957. By virtue of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">Copyright Act</a>, the plaintiff is the first owner
                         of the copyright in the above represented artistic work.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                 8.      The plaintiff asserts that while studying consumer tastes and
                         preferences, and in bridging international cuisines with local
                         flavours, the plaintiff created a whole new cuisine in India - „Desi
                         Chinese&#x27;, which is a fusion of Indian and Chinese flavours. The
                         plaintiff submits that it was the first to identify and create the unique
                         cuisine of „Desi Chinese&#x27; that is native to India and universally
                         loved across various countries. The plaintiff further states that,
                         today, the plaintiff‟s products are synonymous with the cuisine
                         „Desi Chinese&#x27; in India and across the globe.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                 9.      The plaintiff further asserts that as part of its product innovation in
                         the Desi Chinese cuisine, in or around the year 2012, the plaintiff
                         had introduced a dip and spread based product under the trade mark
                         &quot;SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&quot;. &quot;SZECHUAN&quot; is a province of
                         South-West China which is known for bold flavours, particularly the
                         pungency and spiciness resulting from the use of garlic and chilli
                         peppers. &quot;CHUTNEY&quot; is a spicy condiment of Indian origin, made
                         of fruits or vegetables with vinegar, spices, and sugar. Accordingly,
                         the unique and arbitrary combination of the „SCHEZWAN‟ and
                         „CHUTNEY‟ makes „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&#x27; a coined and
                         invented trade mark which is inherently distinctive of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                 10. The plaintiff submits that since the adoption of the trade mark
                         &quot;SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&quot;, the plaintiff‟s products have been
                         continuously, extensively, and uninterruptedly sold throughout

                         the effort to produce its own marketing and advertising content and
                         has instead slavishly copied the plaintiff‟s advertising material

                         promotion, the chutney of the defendant under the mark has been

                         wrongfully registered as the proper procedure was not followed or
                         because the mark is otherwise descriptive in nature, the learned
                         senior counsel for the plaintiff submits that the trademark of the
                         plaintiff has been rightly registered. He submits that such
                         registration must be given effect to and it is not sufficient for the
                         defendant to show that it has an arguable case in support of
                         invalidity of the registration; heavy burden is placed on the
                         defendant to question the validity of registration and to rebut the
                         presumption at the interlocutory stage. In support of his submission,

                         plaintiff stands registered, injunction must follow. In support, he
                         places reliance on <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_14">Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. v. Sudhir

                         product, and that the plaintiff itself has used „Schezwan Chutney‟ as
                         a description of flavour for its „Chutney‟. He submits that
                         „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY&#x27; conveys the meaning of &quot;what the
                         product is&quot; whereas „CHING&#x27;S SECRET&#x27; is the brand which
                         conveys &quot;where the product comes from&quot;. He submits that such
                         descriptive use by the plaintiff is incapable of conferring any
                         proprietary right on the plaintiff in law irrespective of whatever has

                         for Schezwan Chutney as a mark in class 29 has been rejected by the
                         Registrar of Trade Marks vide order dated 29.03.2016. Hence, if
                         &quot;Schezwan Chutney&quot; is not registrable for goods under Class 29,
                         then the same is surely not registrable for goods under Class 30, thus
                         making the registration invalid. In support he places reliance on

                         mark &quot;MRS. FOODRITE&quot;, therefore, the present suit filed by the
                         plaintiff is hit by a gross delay.

<p id="p_48">                 36. The learned counsel for the defendant submits that the online
                         records of the Trade Marks Registry pertaining to the plaintiff‟s
                         trade mark registration no. 2341851 in Class 30 reveals that the
                         plaintiff has been wrongly granted the registration of the trademark.
                         He submits that an Examination Report dated 23.06.2014 was issued
                         by the Trade Mark Registry, with the objection of the mark being
                         devoid of any distinctive character. The plaintiff did not file its
                         response to the Examination Report, which resulted in the Trade
                         Mark Registry passing an order dated 29.03.2016, treating the
                         application as abandoned. Pursuant to the order, the plaintiff

                         submitted a letter dated 25.04.2016, requesting the Registry to
                         reinstate the application asserting that the plaintiff had not received
                         the Examination Report. The application, though was restored
                         pursuant to an order passed in a Writ Petition filed by the plaintiff,
                         the objection in the Examination Report was not answered by the
                         plaintiff. Without such response, the trade mark application was
                         wrongfully published in Trade Marks Journal dated 09.01.2017, and
                         was granted registration on 01.06.2017. He submits that the grant of
                         the registration of the mark SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY is invalid,
                         improper, and contrary to the law.

                                             that the SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY is a descriptive
                                             term and the same has been used by the defendant
                                             along with its trademark Mrs.Foodrite whereas
                                             the plaintiff is also using the mark SCHEZWAN
                                             CHUTNEY along with CHING&#x27;S i.e., CHING&#x27;S
                                             SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY. The defendant has
                                             placed on record material to show that even prior
                                             to the plaintiff adopting the descriptive term
                                             SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY, there were others who
                                             had adopted the said mark and is thus not a
                                             coined mark. Defendant has also placed on record
                                             documents to show that number of other entities
                                             are also selling Schezwan Chutney with their
                                             marks. Thus, this Court is of the prima facie
                                             opinion that no case is made out for grant of an

                                             plea of the plaintiff is that there is a similarity of
                                             the trade dress, get up and SCHEZWAN
                                             CHUTNEY has been written in a highlighted

<p id="p_52">                 39. The first question to be determined for the present application is
                         whether the mark „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY‟ is descriptive of the
                         product in question. In this regard, the plaintiff‟s own pleadings

                         may become important. Though the plaintiff states that its mark
                         „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY‟ is a coined and invented trade mark,
                         which is inherently distinctive of the plaintiff and that it has created
                         a whole new cuisine in India of ‗Desi Chinese&#x27;, which is a fusion of
                         Indian and Chinese flavours, the plaintiff also explains the concept
                         behind the adoption of the above mark as a combination of
                         „SZECHUAN‟ and „CHUTNEY‟. The plaintiff states that the
                         „SZECHUAN‟ is a province of South-West China, known for its
                         bold flavours, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from
                         the use of the garlic and chilli peppers; „CHUTNEY‟ is a spicy
                         condiment of Indian origin, made of fruits or vegetables with
                         vinegar, spices and sugar. Paragraph 10 to 12 of the plaint are
                         worthy of a note, and are reproduced hereunder:-

                                             constantly studying consumer tastes and
                                             preferences and has developed several innovative
                                             products. The Plaintiff bridges international
                                             cuisines with local flavours and offers global
                                             foods and food ingredients with local appeal. As a
                                             result of constant innovation, the Plaintiff created
                                             a whole new cuisine in India - &#x27;Desi Chinese
                                             which is a fusion of Indian and Chinese flavours.
                                             The Plaintiff is the first to identify and create the
                                             unique cuisine of Desi Chinese that is native to
                                             India and universally loved across various
                                             countries. Catering to the ever-growing demand
                                             for Desi Chinese, the Plaintiff manufactures and
                                             offers an array of food products created by Master
                                             Chefs with sophisticated manufacturing facility.
                                             Today, the Plaintiff&#x27;s products are synonymous
                                             with the cuisine Desi Chinese in India and across
                                             the globe.

</p><p id="p_54">                                             11. The Plaintiff is recognized as the leading
                                             provider of Desi Chinese cuisine and food
                                             ingredients, and one of the most famous products
                                             offered by the Plaintiff is SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY
                                             which is exclusively and strongly associated with
                                             the Plaintiff and no one else.

<p id="p_55">                                             12. As a part of its product innovation in the
                                             Desi Chinese cuisine, in or around the year 2012,
                                             the Plaintiff introduced a dip and spread based
                                             product under the earlier trade mark SCHEZWAN
                                             CHUTNEY. The Plaintiff submits that the trade
                                             mark SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY is an invented and
                                             coined trade mark which was first conceived and
                                             used by the Plaintiff in July 2012 in relation to
                                             dips and spreads. The earlier trade mark
                                             SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY has been uniquely
                                             conceived from &quot;Szechuan&quot; and &quot;Chutney&quot;.
                                             &quot;SZECHUAN&quot; is a province of southwest China
                                             which is known for bold flavours, particularly the
                                             pungency and spiciness resulting from the use of
                                             garlic and chili peppers. &quot;CHUTNEY&quot; is a spicy
                                             condiment of Indian origin, made of fruits or
                                             vegetables with vinegar, spices, and sugar.
                                             Accordingly,       the    unique     and    arbitrary
                                             combination of the words SCHEZWAN and
                                             CHUTNEY makes SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY a
                                             coined and invented trade mark which is
                                             inherently distinctive of the Plaintiff. Thus, the
                                             Plaintiff is the first and original adopter and user
                                             of the trade mark SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY.‖


</p><p id="p_56">                 40. In McCarthy on Trademarks, the learned author explains the

                         „non-inherently distinctive‟; and marks with „no distinctiveness‟.
                         The learned author places the „suggestive‟ marks in the category of
                         „inherently distinctive marks‟; while descriptive marks in „non-

                         spectrum of distinctiveness does not end the inquiry as to the
                         strength of a mark: it is only the first step; the second step is to
                         determine the strength of this mark in the market place. The
                         categorization of a term on the spectrum of distinctiveness is a
                         factual issue. The learned author further states that the most popular
                         test with the Court is the „Imagination Test‟. The more imagination
                         that is required on the customer‟s part to get some direct description
                         of the product from the term, the more likely the term is
                         „suggestive‟, not „descriptive‟.        A descriptive term directly and
                         clearly conveys information about the ingredients, qualities or
                         characteristics of the product or service, whereas the „suggestive‟
                         term only indirectly suggests these things. Thus, if one must
                         exercise a reasoning process to determine attributes of the product or
                         service, the term is suggestive not descriptive. If the mental link
                         between the word and the product‟s attributes is not almost
                         instantaneous, this strongly indicates suggestive and not direct
                         descriptiveness. The second test suggested by the learned author is
                         &quot;The Competitors‟ Need Test&quot;, that is, is the word or words likely to
                         be needed by the competitive sellers to describe their goods? If the
                         answer is in the positive, then the word/words are descriptive,
                         otherwise they may just be suggestive.
</p><p id="p_57">                 41.     The learned author further states that the name of a thing cannot
                         identify a source and is, therefore, the very antithesis of a mark.
                         There is usually no one, single and exclusive generic name for a
                         product. The existence of synonyms for a term does not mean the

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                             ―12.01(1): The name of the product or service
                                             itself - what it is - is the very antithesis of a mark.
                                             In short, a generic name of a product can never
                                             function as a trademark to indicate origin. The
                                             terms ―generic‖ and ―trademark‖ are mutually
                                             exclusive. As noted previously, the function of a
                                             mark is to identify and distinguish the goods or
                                             services of one seller from those sold by all others.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                                    A mark answers the buyer&#x27;s questions
                                             ―Who are you? Where do you come from?‖
                                             ―Who vouches for you?‖ But the name of the
                                             product answers the question ―What are you?‖
                                             Many competitive products will give the same
                                             answer, regardless of source of origin - e.g., a
                                             computer, a box of cigars, a bar of soap. Such
                                             generic designations tell the buyer what the
                                             product is, not where it came from. If the public
                                             chooses to call a product ―Thermos‖ bottle rather
                                             than a ―THERMOS brand vacuum insulated
                                             bottle‖ then ―Thermos‖ is not serving as a mark -
                                             it is used as a generic name, regardless of the
                                             producer&#x27;s intentions.</blockquote>
<p id="p_58">                                                                     xxxxx
                                                    The concepts of ―generic name‖ and
                                             ―trademark‖ are mutually exclusive. Thus, if, in
                                             fact, a given term is ―generic‖, it can never
                                             function as a mark to identify and distinguish the
                                             products of only one seller. As the Seventh Circuit
                                             observed: ―A generic term is one that is
                                             commonly used as the name of a kind of
                                             goods....Unlike a trademark, which identifies the
                                             source of a product, a generic term merely
                                             identifies the genus of which the particular
                                             product is a species.‖

</p><p id="p_59">                 42. In Marico Ltd. (supra), the Division Bench of this Court held that
                         the mark „LOW ABSORB‟ is not a coined word and at best is a
                         combination of two popular English words, which are descriptive of
                         the nature of the product. Such adoption naturally entails the risk
                         that others in the field would also be entitled to use such phrase.
                         Persons who are first of the blocks in using a trade mark which is a
                         purely descriptive expression pertaining to the subject product ought
                         to be discouraged from appropriating a descriptive expression or an
                         expression which is more or less a descriptive expression as found
                         in the English language for claiming the same to be an exclusive
                         trade mark. A descriptive word mark bears an indication to the
                         product‟s kind, quality, use or characteristics, etc. When rights are
                         claimed over a word mark as a trade mark and which word mark is,
                         in fact, a mere tweak of a descriptive word indicative of the kind,
                         quality, intended purpose or other characteristics of the goods, it is
                         not open to urge that although the respondent is using the
                         descriptive word mark, in fact, only as a part of sentence as a
                         description even in itself along with another independent trade mark,
                         yet the use of descriptive words are to be injuncted against.
</p><p id="p_60">                 43. I need not multiply the authorities on the above proposition of law.

                         „Chutney‟ (sauce) which has a „SCHEZWAN‟ flavour. There is not
                         much imagination required to get to the description of the product
                         itself, that is, a sauce with Schezwan flavour. As rightly contended
                         by the learned counsel for the defendant, if protection is to be

                         granted to such a mark then there is no reason why such protection
                         be also not granted to „Tamarind Chutney‟ or „Tomato Chutney‟, as
                         they are also combinations of words in English and Hindi. The
                         words- „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY‟ also satisfies the second test
                         suggested by McCarthy, which is &quot;The Competitors‟ Need Test&quot;.
                         The competitors are likely to use these two words to describe their
                         product, and, in fact, as suggested by the learned counsel for the
                         defendant, do indeed describe their product using the said words.

                         my attention to the advertisements of the plaintiff itself to submit
                         that the plaintiff also uses the mark more in a descriptive sense.

                         therefore, found that the products marketed by the plaintiff cannot
                         be said to be descriptive of the meaning of English words „Whole
                         Foods‟.

                         plaintiff has sought to urge that by its long usage, the mark
                         „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY‟ has acquired a secondary meaning and
                         distinctiveness, in my opinion, the same would require to be

                         SCC OnLine Bom 7351, the High Court of Bombay, in relation to a
                         claim of a mark having acquired a secondary meaning, has held as
                         under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                              ―15. That takes us directly to the question of
                                             ‗secondary meaning&#x27; or ‗secondary significance&#x27;.
                                             When does an expression acquire a ‗secondary
                                             meaning&#x27; and how does it acquire it? Again, this
                                             is a phrase much bandied about, and I do believe
                                             we need to pause to consider what is meant by all
                                             this. What do we mean when we say that an
                                             expression has ‗acquired a secondary meaning&#x27;?
                                             This must necessarily mean that the primary
                                             meaning of the expression, the one with which it
                                             began, has been lost. It is left behind. The
                                             expression no longer means what it once did. It
                                             has assumed a new avatar. It has transcended its
                                             original connotation and now references
                                             exclusively in the public mind the claimant&#x27;s
                                             products, goods or services, i.e., that there is an
                                             identification of the mark with the claimant rather
                                             than with the goods or services in and of
                                             themselves. The claim of a ‗secondary meaning&#x27;
                                             posits a priori that the expression once had a
                                             more commonplace, ordinary meaning -- this is
                                             the meaning that is now lost. In its first iteration,
                                             the expression found place lower on the
                                             Indchemie/Miller Brewing scale. It has since
                                             moved upward by acquiring a secondary meaning.
                                             That is the claim.</blockquote>

                                             no presumption of secondary meaning acquisition.
                                             That needs proof; and the proof must be of
                                             uninterrupted use of considerable longevity
                                             without a competitor attempting to use it. When a
                                             person uses a common phrase, he runs the risk
                                             that others might also use the same expression or
                                             another very like it. In British Vacuum Cleaner
                                             Company Limited v. New Vacuum Cleaner
                                             Company Limited, on which Dr. Tulzapurkar
                                             relies, Parker J held that there is a distinction
                                             between ordinary descriptive words and a ‗fancy
                                             word&#x27;, one that does not primarily relate to the
                                             article, but perhaps to the person manufacturing
                                             it. There can be no restraint against the use of
                                             general words. The decision in Office Cleaning
                                             Services Ltd. v. Westminster Window and General
                                             Cleaners Ltd., too, supports Dr. Tulzapurkar&#x27;s
                                             contention. The expression in dispute was ‗office
                                             cleaning&#x27;. The appellants claimed the expression
                                             was identified with their business to such an extent
                                             that any other traders who wished to use the
                                             expression as part of their trade name would have
                                             to differentiate it. Simons J held that where a
                                             trader adopts words in common use for his trade
                                             name, some risk of confusion is inevitable. But
                                             that risk must be run, or else the first user would
                                             be allowed to unfairly monopolise the words. In
                                             matters of this nature, courts accept even the
                                             smallest differences sufficient to avert confusion.

<p id="p_73">                                             17. As to this question of risk of similar use by
                                             others, the material on record is, in my view,
                                             against the Plaintiff. Annexed to the Affidavit in

                                             marks, at various stages. All use the word shaadi
                                             in some form or the other. Many are opposed by
                                             the Plaintiff. Several use the name of a community
                                             before the word shaadi (agarwalshaadi,
                                             konkanishaadi, patelshaadi and so on). I do not
                                             think Mr. Khandekar&#x27;s response is of much use; he
                                             says that the Plaintiff has obtained domain name
                                             registrations for a very large number of variants.
                                             This is hardly evidence of exclusivity. In fact, it
                                             points to the contrary, viz., that others have, and

                                             The fact is that there are many ventures, including
                                             online ones, that use the word ‗shaadi&#x27; as part of
                                             their corporate or trading name or as their
                                             domain names. Paragraph 12 of the Affidavit in
                                             Rejoinder tabulates companies that use the word
                                             ‗shaadi&#x27; in their names. I do not think it is at all
                                             possible for a claimant to say that there are no
                                             competitors or rival users because the claimant
                                             has moved against or restricted virtually every
                                             rival user. The test in such cases must be whether
                                             rivals have attempted to use the same commonly
                                             descriptive or generic (class 1) expression. If it is
                                             shown that they have, then the claims to
                                             exclusivity and to a secondary meaning must both
                                             fail. This is axiomatic: these rival uses show non-
                                             exclusivity, and establish that there are indeed
                                             many who use the word. This is precisely the risk
                                             the law says an adopter of a generic or commonly
                                             descriptive expression must expect to suffer. The
                                             test of exclusivity, an essential ingredient of the
                                             claim based on a ‗secondary meaning&#x27; can hardly
                                             be said to be satisfied.

                                             mark -- not as a mere description, but a pointed
                                             reference to the origin, viz., the claimant. Use

                         similar to the plaintiff‟s mark. It further held that merely because
                         the word „nature‟ is descriptive, it cannot be said that its
                         combination with other words like „Inc.‟ or „Essence‟ would not
                         make the mark distinctive. In the present case, in my prima facie
                         opinion, the combination of the two words does not take away the
                         descriptive nature of the words as they still continue to describe the
                         nature and quality of the product in question. In fact, it is together
                         that they become descriptive.

                         description of the product, and had even applied for seeking
                         registration of the said mark. The Court held that such conduct
                         itself estopped the defendants from claiming the mark to be
                         descriptive of the product. The same cannot, however, be said for
                         the defendant herein.

                         and was used in aid of distinguishing the goods in question. It was
                         in that light that the High Court of Bombay further held that merely
                         because the defendant no.2 therein was using „Rampur‟ along with
                         the mark in question, it could not be said that they constitute one
                         mark. The said judgment would, therefore, have no application to

                                             descriptive word indicative of the kind, quality,
                                             intended purpose or other characteristics of the
                                             goods, it is not open to urge that although the
                                             respondent is using the descriptive word mark in
                                             fact only as a part of sentence as a description
                                             (and even assuming for the sake of argument only
                                             the descriptive word mark in itself) alongwith
                                             another independent trademark, yet the use of
                                             descriptive words are to be injuncted against.</blockquote>
<p id="p_89">                                             How can it at all be argued that though the
                                             respondent is in fact shown to be using the
                                             disputed word(s) only with a descriptive
                                             intendment, yet, such use should be taken not in a
                                             descriptive manner but as a trademark. If we
                                             permit such an argument to prevail then what will
                                             happen is that what cannot be directly done will
                                             be indirectly done i.e., whereas the appellant is

                                             because the use by the respondent is in
                                             furtherance of its statutory rights of the user of the

                                             respondent is using the same as a trademark, the
                                             same should be taken as infringement of the
                                             trademark of the appellant. Not only the plaintiff
                                             has no exclusive rights whatsoever to the
                                             trademarks because they are such which fall

                                             and entitled to use the descriptive words in any

                                             to do. If there are no rights of the plaintiff to
                                             exclusive user of the trademark then where does
                                             arise the question of disentitlement of a defendant
                                             to use the trademark of the appellant inasmuch as
                                             any person who adopts a descriptive word mark
                                             does so at its own peril in that any other person
                                             will also be fully entitled to use the same in view

                                             in a way be said to be very much included

                                             characteristics etc. of the goods, is clearly only a

                                             proved. In fact, there is ordinarily not only no lack
                                             of bonafides in using the normal descriptive word,
                                             and on the contrary there is in fact malafides of a

                                             mark and for which adaption there is ordinarily
                                             an absolute ground for refusal of registration of

                                             the respondent is using the expression &quot;LOW

                                             using its own trademark &quot;Sundrop&quot;, an aspect we
                                             have repeatedly referred to otherwise in this
                                             judgment. Merely because the respondent used
                                             &quot;TM&quot; earlier after the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB

                         „SCHEZWAN CHUTNEY‟ by the defendant is dishonest, thereby
                         disentitling the defendant from the protection against a claim of
                         infringement. The judgment of this Court in B.K. Engineering Co.
                         (supra) and of the Supreme Court in Midas Hygiene Industries (P)
                         Ltd. (supra) would therefore, not be applicable to the facts of the
