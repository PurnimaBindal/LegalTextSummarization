<p id="p_350">                    In view of this judgment, in case the information furnished
         to the police, does not disclose a cognizable offence only then the
         preliminary inquiry is required to be conducted, but in case the
         information disclose commission of cognizable offence then the
         police officer has no other option except to register the FIR. It has
         been further held that in case police officer does not register the
         FIR on receipt of information of cognizable offence, then action
         must be taken against him.

<p id="p_352">                    Reverting to the present matter, at this juncture, the Court is
         required to see if in this matter, credible information available with
         the CBI disclosing the commission of cognizable offence, or not.
         For this purpose the contents of FIR Ex. PW104/A scrutinized
         carefully which reflects that at the time of registration of FIR, the
         CBI had the information that the accused had acquired assets to the
         tune of Rs.70.0 lac which were observed to be disproportionate to
         his known source of income of Rs.20.0 lac.

         inquiry and the act of registration of FIR has been performed as per
         CBI crime manual Chapter IX, para no.9.1. I have carefully gone
         through the judgments in cases Vinit Narain and Shashi Kant
         (Supra). and it is found that findings of the said judgments are not
         applicable to the facts of the instant case.
</p><p id="p_354">                    In the light of above discussion, the contention of ld.
         Counsel for accused that in the absence of preliminary inquiry, the
         whole proceedings stand vitiate, are found to be without any merits
         and stands discarded accordingly.
</p>

<p id="p_355">    8.              The next contention of ld. counsel for accused is that as per
         <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_26">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of PC Act, it is imperative that the accused must
         be given opportunity to offer his explanation before filing of the
         chargsheet. In this matter the accused has requested IO to supply
         relevant documents to enable him to explain his point of view.
         Even the accused has written two letters one in January, 2006 and
         another in the month of August, 2006 i.e. Ex.DW1/E and
         Ex.DW1/F. But the said letters were neither replied nor the
         documents were supplied. Hence, the accused could not explain his
         defence to IO for which accused is entitled for benefit. The reliance
         has been made in case <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_27">K.Veeraswami vs UOI</a>, 1991 (3) SCC 655.
</p><p id="p_356">                    On the other hand, Ld. Sr.PP for CBI has submitted that
         proper opportunity was given to accused persons to explain the
         source of income during the investigation and this fact has come in
         the evidence of PW-106, IO SI Satinder Bisht.

                 that he will explain the alleged disproportionate
                 amount before the Court. No satisfactory
                 explanation was offered to me by the accused for

                   opportunity to the accused to explain his assets

                   our office, after search, he was allowed to inspect
                   all the documents to enable him to explain his
                   assets, expenditure, income and liability (Vol.But

                   documents seized during search at that time but he
                   has inspected the documents)........ It is correct
                   that the accused and his wife joined the

         substantiate his contentions in this regard. On this score it is found

         to obtain the copies of documents collected by IO for investigation
         to enable the accused to explain his view to the IO. As per the

                   the excess of the assets over the known sources of
                   income and then decide whether the accounting is
                   satisfactory or not, would be elevating him to the
                   position of an enquiry officer or a judge. He is not

                   regarding the disproportionality between the
                   assets and the income of the accused. He just
                   collects material from all sides and prepares a

                   The investigating officer is only required to collect
                   material to find out whether the offence alleged
                   appears to have been committed. In the course of
                   the investigation, he may examine the accused.
                   Indeed, fair investigation requires that the accused
                   should not be kept in darkness. He should be taken

<p id="p_364">                    In the light of aforesaid judgments it is found that the stage

<p id="p_370">                    Ld. Counsel for accused has further submitted that the CBI

         submissions it has been submitted that it is a grave irregularity on
         the part of the CBI, therefore, the sanction to prosecute the accused
         accorded in this matter cannot be termed as valid sanction. The
         reliance has also been made in cases Vinit Narain &amp; ors. Vs UOI,

         the concerned Ministry /department, but it is nowhere mentioned
         therein that the concerned ministry or department is bound to
         follow the advice of CVC. It has been further contended that as per
         deposition of PW-106 IO Satinder Bisht, copy of file was sent to
         CVC and further argued that once the copy of case file was sent to
         CVC, the CBI has no role as to what advice was tendered by the
         CVC to the concerned department because at that point of time the
         matter was between the CVC and concerned department. It has
         been further submitted that there is no irregularity or illegality in
         the sanction order Ex.PW66/A brought on record by PW-66 Sh.
         K.K.Sharma.
</p><p id="p_372">                    Heard. Material perused.
</p><p id="p_373">                    As pointed out by Ld. Sr.PP for CBI, PW-106 IO DSP
         Satender Bisht during cross-examination on calling explanation,
         has deposed to the effect that copy of file was sent to CVC. The
         testimony of this witness in this respect, remained un-controverted
         and un-impeached because no further explanation of the witness
         was called. Even no suggestion was put to the witness that he has
         not sent the copy of the file to CVC. On this account, I find
         substance in the contention of Ld. Sr.PP for CBI that once the copy
         of file was sent to CVC, the CBI has no role to play in the process
         of granting sanction by the authority. Under these circumstances it
         is found that CBI has not violated the Rule 22.15.1 of CBI (Crime)
         Manual because the copy of the file was sent to CVC.

         Narain v UOI, 1988 Cr.L.J. SC.
</p><p id="p_375">                On this aspect, in case <a href="/doc/7210086/" id="a_39">UOI vs Prakash P. Hinduja and
         another</a>, (2003) 6 SCC 195, Hon'ble Supreme Court has discussed
         judgment in case Vineet Narain (Supra) and, inter alia, held as
         under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                In view of the contentions raised it becomes
             necessary to examine the judgment in Vineet Narain
             in the little detail so as to understand its real
             content and import. ...... A duty has been cast on
             CVC to review the progress of all cases moved by
             CBI for sanction of prosecution, especially those in
             which sanction has been delayed or refused. The
             judgment nowhere says that CBI will have to take
             concurrence or sanction from CVC before filing a
             charge-sheet in court. No right of any kind has
             been conferred upon the alleged offender or the
             accused to approach CVC or to challenge the
             action of CBI in submission of a charge-sheet in
             court on the ground of some purported irregularity
             in making a report to CVC regarding the progress
             of investigation. .......... The direction issued was
             never meant to create or confer some kind of
             additional rights in favour of the accuse as was held
             by the High Court. The accused has absolutely no
             right to approach CVC for taking any steps to stop
             CBI from either proceeding against him or from
             launching prosecution against him by filing a
             charge-sheet. Further, the directions issued do not
             confer any kind of a right upon the accused to assail
             the charge-sheet on the ground that CBI had not
             reported the progress of investigation to CVC or
             had not taken some kind of approval or concurrence
             from it before submission of the charge-sheet in
             court.</blockquote>

<p id="p_376">                    In the light of this judgment, CBI is not required to take
         sanction from CVC before filing charge-sheet. Reverting to the
         present matter, for the sake of arguments, if it is presumed that


CC No.17/13                                                                           (Bhupesh Kumar)

         there was any lapses on the part of IO regarding sending the file to
         CVC, it does not effect the case of the prosecution in the light of
         this judgment. Hence, the contention of ld. Counsel for accused in
         this respect is without any merits. I have carefully gone through
         the judgments in cases <a href="/doc/190260/" id="a_40">Inspector of Police, Visakhapatnam vs
         Suryasankaram Karri</a>, , State of Karnatakar through <a href="/doc/320053/" id="a_41">CBI vs
         C.Rangarajaswamy</a>, <a href="/doc/142693585/" id="a_42">Ashok Kumar Agarwal vs CBI &amp; State of
         Goa</a> vs Babu Thomas, and found that findings of said judgments
         are not applicable to the facts of the instant case.
</p>

<p id="p_377">                    The next contention of ld. Counsel for accused is that the
         letters Ex. DW1/E and Ex. DW1/F written by accused to IO for
         supply of documents were not sent alongwith other record to
         competent authority which reflects that the complete record was
         not sent to the competent authority which invalidates the sanction
         order.
</p><p id="p_378">                    On this score, as already discussed, the accused has no right
         to obtain the copies of documents during investigation. Under these
         circumstances, in case the said two letters have not been sent
         alongwith other record to the competent authority for obtaining the
         sanction to prosecute the accused, it does not effect the case of
         prosecution or invalidates the sanction order.
</p><p id="p_379">                    It has been further contended that details of the income and
         assets/expenditure of wife of accused has not been mentioned in the
         charge-sheet and without any such details, the sanction authority
         could not have applied its mind and this fact becomes more
         important when the accused was given benefit of a sum of

CC No.17/13                                                                            (Bhupesh Kumar)

         Rs.5,29,066.62 from the saving of wife of accused. On the basis of
         these submissions it has been submitted that complete record was
         not placed before sanctioning authority and sanction was accorded
         without application of mind, merely in mechanical manner.
</p><p id="p_380">                    On this score, Ld. Sr.PP for CBI has submitted that CBI has
         given benefit of certain amount to the accused by considering the
         same to be savings of his wife. In case, the income of wife of
         accused was not the same as mentioned in the charge-sheet, he was
         having opportunity to explain her proper income and savings
         during his defence evidence.
</p><p id="p_381">                    Heard. Material perused.
</p><p id="p_382">                    In this matter, the prosecution has shown the assets of wife
         of the accused as Rs.43,33,460.12 during check period. But as
         matter of record there is no break-up of assets/income/expenditure
         of Smt.Savita Jakhmola. It is great lapses on the part of IO.
         However, when the IO appeared in witness box as PW-106, during
         evidence he has explained in this regard. Before proceeding ahead,
         here it is necessary to reproduce the relevant portion of
         examination-in-chief and cross-examination of the IO, which is as
         under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                   For calculating the saving amount of Smt.Savita
                 Jakhmola, I had examined Smt.Savita Jakhmola
                 during the course of my investigation and also
                 examined other witnesses who proved her
                 assets/income/expenditure. In respect of the items
                 taken as asset/income/expenditure of Smt.Savita

                 09.02.2007, Smt.Savita Jakhmola specifically stated
                 that she does not dispute the various asset acquired
                 by her during the check period/various income
                 earned by her during the check period and various
                 expenditure incurred by her during the check
                 period.

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                    Cross-examination of PW-106 on this aspect :-
                    I have calculated the income, assets and
                 expenditure of Smt.Savita Jakhmola, w/o of the
                 accused. In the same manner I examined the
                 accused also and recorded his statement, but I have
                 not filed the said statement alongwith the charge-
                 sheet. I can produce the same, if required. ...... I
                 have placed on record the investigation qua income,
                 assets and expenditure of wife of th accused. ...... It
                 is also wrong to suggest that I at own recorded the
                 false statement of Smt.Savita Jakhmola u/S 161
                 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_44">Cr.P.C</a>. in which I mentioned wrong facts and due to
                 this reason she was not examined.</blockquote>



<p id="p_383">                    From the said portion of evidence of IO, one fact remained
         on record that the existence of statements of Smt.Savita Jakhmola
         u/<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_45">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. recorded by the IO on different dates as
         referred in the evidence of IO, was in the knowledge of the
         accused. Existence of said statements further strengthen from the
         fact that a suggestion was put to the IO that he has recorded false
         statements of Smt.Savita Jakhmola and has mentioned wrong facts.
         Further the accused at no stretch of time has taken the plea that he
         was not supplied with the copies of statements. All the aforesaid
         statements are on record and the existence of the statements has
         been proved by the IO. Under these eventualities it is observed that
         since the statements are already on record and the accused knew

CC No.17/13                                                                           (Bhupesh Kumar)

         the existence of these statements, hence, in order to bring true facts
         on record for the just decision of the case, no prejudice would be
         caused to the accused, if the statements are considered for assessing
         the income and expenditure of Smt.Savita Jakhmola, during check
         period. The statements of this witness recorded on 09.02.2007 has
         been perused and, inter alia, it contains tables showing the details
         of her income, expenditure and assets during check period.
         Therefore, the information qua break-up of income, assets,
         expenditure and savings can be gathered from the statements of
         Smt.Savita Jakhmola. This fact nullify the claim of accused that
         there is no break-up of income and assets of Smt.Savita Jakhmola.
         Whether the prosecution has succeeded in proving these facts
         would be considered later on during appreciation of evidence.

         on record by PW-66 Sh.K.K.Sharma, who deposed that at relevant
         time he was posted as Desk Officer in the department of Personnel
         and Training, Govt. of India and was authorized to authenticate the

         doubt and per contra, the accused is required to show
         preponderance of probabilities of existence of any fact. However, it
         is also well settled law of land that the defence of the accused

         28 quarterly payments of a sum of Rs.2,869/-. It was money back
         policy for 12 years. As per terms of policy, on the completion of

         entitled for a sum of Rs.30,000/- as money back of the total sum
         assured of Rs.1.0 lac. In this matter, the policy commenced on

         after adjusting the unpaid premium of Rs.22,952/- with interest on

         Rs.4,807/- was paid to the accused and the policy was continued.

         September 2000 (i.e. 28.09.96 to 30.09.2000, total 16 quarters
         (16x2869 = 45,904/-)). There is no other material on record which

         record which suggest that the accused has controverted the

         worth Rs.8000/-, whereas as per memorandum Ex. PW106/D, the
         same were worth around Rs.18,000/-. Hence, the Court has no
         option except to consider the value of the said articles as
         Rs.18,000/-. Before parting away, here it is necessary to discuss
         that since the copies of memorandum etc. were already supplied to
         accused, therefore, its contents were in the knowledge of the
         accused, hence, he cannot claim that the exaggerated value of the

          Hence, it cannot be ruled out that the amount might have belong to
          the society for which the accused is entitled for benefit.

          the house of accused, the accused has not brought on record any
          documentary proof that he had kept the society amount in his
          house. In the absence of any such material, the Court is of
          considered view that the same belongs to the accused only and not
          to the society. Hence, it is found that the said cash amount of
          Rs.50,000/- was the assets of the accused.

         evidence of PW-27 Mr.S.L.Sagar reflects that this witness is the
         person who was associated with accused in different societies in
         capacity of Secretary etc. During his cross-examination, the witness
         has submitted to the effect that he was associated with Swarna Jyoti
         Society and from Swarna Jyoti Society a payment of Rs.1.0 lac was
         made to the accused, which was returned by the accused in the year
         2007. But this witness has not deposed the exact period when the

</p><p id="p_484">                    PW-76 Mr.Vijay Sachar is the person who was looking after
         account job of the societies and submitted that the accused has
         received a cheque of Rs.1.0 lac for purchase of marble from his
         friend Sagar who had a housing society in Gurgaon. The receipt of
         cheque deposit is on record which is part of Ex. PW56/A. The same
         perused which reflects that one cheque of a sum of Rs.1.0 lac
         drawn on Indian Overseas Bank, Punjabi Bagh branch was
         deposited by the accused in his account no. 18416 on 18.08.2004.
         But it is not clear that from which account the cheque was issued.
         However, one unexplained fact remained on record that why the
         cheque was issued in the individual name of the accused and not in
         the name of the society.
</p><p id="p_485">                    PW-96 is Mr.Anand Kumar Jain, Chartered Accountant who

</p><p id="p_486">                    Further, as per accused, the said amount was given to him as
         loan, but as per evidence of PW-76 and PW-96 the amount was
         given to accused for purchase of marble for society. On this aspect,
         the accused has failed to explain on record that if the said amount
         was given for purchase of marble, then how the accused has treated
         the same as loan. Further, there is no evidence on record which
         suggest that accused has purchased any marble against the said
         amount, if not, then why. One thing also remained unexplained that
         why the amount of Rs.1.0 lac was given from the individual
         account of Mr.Sagar that too in the individual name of the accused
         and why the amount was not given from the account of society.
</p><p id="p_487">                    Under these eventualities it is found that the evidence on
         which accused has relied upon is not clear and consistent and
         accordingly it is hold that the accused has failed to prove that the
         said amount came into his account from the known source of
         income. Hence, it cannot be termed as additional income of
         accused.

<p id="p_488">         12.3       It has been further argued that the accused has obtained

         this account and PW-75 has also brought on record the voucher Ex.

         accused had deposed during cross-examination that his father has
         given loan of Rs.2.65 lac to accused in the year 2000, whereas the
         accused who appeared in witness box as DW-1 has also deposed
         that in the year 1998-2000 while he was seriously sick, his in-laws
         helped him with a sum of Rs.2.65 lac. Hence, from evidence of
         both these witnesses it is not clear if it was loan or otherwise a
         financial help given to the accused on account of his illness.
</p><p id="p_491">                    As matter of record the accused was in job in the year 2000
         and if he happened to be sick during said period, then he could
         have easily reimburse the amount from his department being
         Government servant as per CCS Rules. But there is no material on
         record which suggest that the accused has reimbursed any amount,
         he incurred on the medical expenses and if not, then why. The
         accused has also not brought on record any material to show that he
         has disclosed the receipt of said amount to his department. Further
         the accused in order to justify this amount, has not brought on
         record any material to show the income of his father-in-law and his
         capacity to pay the said amount to the accused.
</p><p id="p_492">                    Under these circumstances, the said amount, if the accused
         has received from Mr.S.P.Nathani cannot be termed to be income

         additional income.

         his father-in-law for a sum of Rs.12.0 lac approximate and PW-68
         Dr.Ashish Nathani has substantiate the version of the accused in
         this respect. On the other hand, Ld. Sr.PP for CBI has submitted
         that in case the property was sold by father-in-law of the accused
         then only wife of the accused was entitled for her share and same
         cannot be termed as income of the accused.

         was actually sold that too for a sum of Rs.12.0 lac. The exact date
         on which any such sale transaction has not been disclosed. Further,
         the substance has been found in the contention of Ld. Sr.PP for CBI
         that in case the property was sold by father-in-law of the accused,
         then only wife of the accused was entitled for the share and not the
         accused. Under these circumstances, the plea of the accused that he
         has received Rs.2.0 lac from his father-in-law does not inspire the

         other witnesses has not disputed any article that the same belongs
         to     his      brother-in-law   Dr.Ashish       Nathani.          Further,         during
         examination-in-chief, Dr.Ashish Nathani has submitted that he has
         applied for telephone vide application form Ex.PW68/A and the
         telephone connection was given to him in his professional capacity
         as Doctor. Under these circumstances, it can not be ruled out that
         telephone connection might have been obtained in the name of
         Dr.Ashish Nathani being Doctor on priority basis. As discussed
         above in the absence of any documentary proof, it cannot be
         presumed that PW-68 Dr.Ashish Nathani ever resided with accused
         at said flat. Once it is hold that Dr.Ashish Nathani never resided
         permanently with the accused, there is no question of sharing of
         rent amount or water/electricity bills/charges.                          Under these
         circumstances, it is hold that aforesaid amounts, certainly belongs
         to accused only. But accused is not entitled for any benefit because
         the rent, electricity and water charges have already been calculated
         and added by the CBI as expenditure of accused.

         Nathani never resided with accused at the said address, therefore, it
         is found that telephone bills of Rs.52,450/- and the advance of
         Rs.3000/- for installation of telephone, paid by Dr.Ashish Nathani
         belongs to the accused. However, as discussed earlier the accused

         calculated by the CBI as expenditure of the accused.

         received amount in her account were maintained by Sh.S.P.Nathani,
         father-in-law of the accused Under these circumstances, it cannot
         be presumed that Smt.Savita Jakhmola has received aforesaid
         amounts in her account from the accounts maintained by her father
         only. Hence, due to lack of evidence it is hold that the accused has
         failed to bring on record any cogent material to prove that the said
         amount was received by Smt.Savita Jakhmola from her father.

                         Government servant at minimum price. Initially
                         there were 24-25 members. Subsequently the

              Awas Society there was loan of Rs.4.0 lac against the accused.
              But during his cross-examination, he was not asked to bring on
              record any document viz. statement of account of society or his
              own account etc. But when accused appeared in witness box as

              Niketan Housing Society and payment has been made by
              society. Thus the payment of same to the tune of Rs.24,483/-
              cannot be attributed to the accused.
</p><p id="p_534">                    PW-78 Mr.Pawan Singh has brought on record the details of
              mobile no. 9891050505 as Ex.PW78/A1 to A8. The witness has

              has not denied this fact. Further the accused has not denied the

              whether who has paid the mobile bills. The accused claim that
              the bills were either paid by the societies or the same were
              reimbursed to accused after he paid the bills amount from his
              own pocket. But to substantiate his contentions, the accused has
              not brought on record; any documentary proof viz. statement of
              accounts of societies that bills for usage of mobile phones were
              ever paid by societies; no material which suggest that the
              society has ever reimbursed any bill amount to the accused, if

              taken in the name of society, if so, in cash or by way of cheque;
              more over, the accused has not claimed that which of the mobile
              phone was used for which society. In the absence of any such
              documentary proof, the plea of the accused that the societies
              used to pay the said mobile phone bills is found to be vague and
              baseless. Technically the prosecution was required to file the
              affidavit of witness who has prepared the bill as per provision of
              Section 65 (B) of Indian Evidence Act. But making of payments
              of aforesaid bills has not been disputed by the accused, under
              these eventualities, non-filing of said affidavit does not effect
              the case of prosecution.
</p><p id="p_536">                    The aforesaid discussion reveals that the proseuction has
              succeeded in proving the fact that the accused has made the
              payments of said telephone bills, which shows that the
              prosecution has released the initial burden to prove. Hence, the
              burden shifts to the accused to satisfy the Court that he has
              made payments of telephone bills from known sources of
              income. The plea of the accused that the mobile bills were paid
              by the societies has already been discarded as discussed earlier.
              Hence, the payments of mobile bills paid by the accused, in no
              manner can be termed as income of the accused and are
              definitely expenditures of the accused.

              12.16      Ld. counsel for accused further submitted that accused

              Mr.G.L.Sagar in the year 2004 when he was hospitalized in

              been perused. Admittedly this witness during cross-examination
              has submitted that wife of accused has taken Rs.40,000/- from
              him to meet out medical expenses of accused.
</p><p id="p_541">                    It is admitted fact that wife of accused during the relevant
              period was a Government Teacher and was having independent
              source of income. On the other hand, the accused was also a
              Government employee during the said period i.e. in the year
              2004.      Now the question arises what compelled Smt.Savita
              Jakhmola, wife of the accused to take Rs.40,000/- from this
              witness for the medical treatment of the accused. As discussed
              earlier, the accused was Central Government employee he was
              entitled for reimbursement of medical bills as per CCS Rules.
              There is no material which shows that the accused applied for
              any reimbursement. As per deposition of PW-91 Mr.G.L.Sagar,
              he had been friend of the accused for about 15 years. Under
              these circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that this witness
              might have been won over by the accused to depose in his favor
              in the Court. Considering the entire facts and circumstances, no
              reliance can be made on the evidence of PW-91 Mr.G.L.Sagar
              and consequently the amount of Rs.40,000/- cannot be
              considered additional income of the accused.

              of Rs.16.0 lac have stated that a loan of Rs 16.0 lac of Kendriya
              Niketan Welfare Society was outstanding against the accused.
              But from the material on record, it is found that there is no
              document on record which shows that the society could advance
              any loan to its office bearer or its members. Further, if the
              society was happened to be registered, certain bye-laws of the
              society must be in existence that the society could advance any
              loan to anybody. Further, there is; no resolution of office bearers
              nor the books of account of society that any loan has been
              advanced to accused; no application of the accused to obtain the
              loan from society; no material which shows that any agreement

              documentary proof, the plea of the accused that he has taken
              loan of a sum of Rs.16.0 lac is found to be without any basis and

              Hence, it is hold that the flat was sold for a sum of Rs.2.80 lac

               has sold any gold to the tune of Rs.9,69,600/- at Dariba Kalan,

               similar. Hence, in the absence of any such documentary proof
               the claim of the accused is found to be vague that his mother has

 Smt.Savita Jakhmola was not accused in this matter. Hence, it was

 examined number of witnesses and brought on record bulky material to

 the Court failed to understand that when she was having her independent
 source of income, separate expenditures and assets, then why the benefit
 of Rs.5,29,066.62 was given to the accused. At this juncture, it is found
 that by bringing unwarranted material on record qua the assets, income

</pre><p id="p_838">         Hence, the total savings of Smt.Savita Jakhmola comes to
Rs.87,503.00. As per charge-sheet, the total savings attributed to
Smt.Savita Jakhmola has been calculated to the tune of Rs.5,29,066/- and
the benefit of said amount was given to the accused. Here the question
arises whether the accused is entitled for benefit of Rs.87,503/- calculated
on the basis of the evidence adduced by the prosecution or to the tune of
Rs.5,29,066/- as mentioned in the charge-sheet.
</p><p id="p_839">         On this aspect it is found that the burden to prove the exact income,
assets and expenditure of Smt.Savita Jakhmola as mentioned in charge-
sheet. As stated earlier, since Smt.Savita Jakhmola was not prosecuted in
this matter, hence, she was not required to explain about her income etc.
On the other hand, the prosecution has failed to bring on record sufficient
evidence to prove the entire income etc. of Smt.Savita Jakhmola on
record, as mentioned in the charge-sheet. Under these eventualities, in
case the complete evidence not came on record, or withheld by the
prosecution then the fault cannot be attributed to accused because he was
required to explain his point of view only specifically in his knowledge.
But since the benefit of Rs.5,29,066.00 has already been given to the
accused as per charge-sheet, the Court is of the considered view that the
benefit of said amount should be given to the accused, though on record
the savings of Smt.Savita Jakhmola are of less amount. Hence, it is found
that the accused is entitled for the benefit of amount of Rs.5,29,066/- as
mentioned in the charge-sheet. Accordingly, the said benefit is given to
the accused.
