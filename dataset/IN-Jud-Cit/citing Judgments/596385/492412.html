<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

S.K. Agarwal. J.
</p>
 

<p id="p_2">1. Plaintiffs instituted the suit for permanent
injunction restraining the defendants from operating any
business, making, selling/transferring, offering for
sale, advertising and in any other manner dealing with
the goods or services using domain name
"www.kabaribazaar.com" or any other combination thereof,
as a website on the internet, identical with or
descriptively similar to plaintiffs' trade name/domain
name "www.kabadibazaar.com" as is likely to lead to
passing off the business of the defendants as those of
plaintiffs. On 24th April, 2000, plaintiffs were
granted ex parte injunction on an application under
Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short "CPC") which is
sought to be confirmed and the defendants moved an
application, under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC for revocation of
the interim injunction, pleading that the same was
obtained by misrepresentation and false statements.
This order will dispose of both these applications.
</p>
 

<p id="p_3">2. Briefly stated, plaintiffs' case is that they
are proprietors of the domain name
"www.kabadibazaar.com" and trade-mark, in relation to
the information website, dealing with second hand goods
on the internet. They are involved in the business of
e-commerce since April, 1999. They realised the vast
potential of second hand goods market, which in the
Indian context are not readily consigned to destruction
but are usually recycled. Every household deals with
the person called "Kabadiwala", who periodically takes
away unwanted goods from the house which may be of some
use in other context, like old newspapers, used bottles
and broken electronic goods. These goods after
necessary repairs are either sold in the market known
for second hand goods or are used for manufacturing
other items like paper bags etc. Formal markets for
second hand goods are largely periodical and very
limited in application and usually beyond the knowledge
of vast majority of people. It is pleaded that taking
into account that "kabadi" is a person who buys second
hand products, and 'bazaar' denotes the place where
trading takes place, plaintiffs, adopted this unique
combination. They are proprietors of the said website
and are entitled to use the same with all its variations
to the exclusion of others.
</p>
 

<p id="p_4">3. The plaintiffs have pleaded about the concept
of domain names, their registration etc. They have also
explained the working of their website. It is stated
that their website provides a meeting ground for the
interested buyers and sellers through e-mail, thereby
facilitating negotiations between the parties. They
booked the domain name "www.kabadibazaar.com" on
5.5.1999 for launching the website. It was launched on
30.9.1999. It attained instant publicity as Star News
discussed launch of the website on 1.10.1999 and the
programme was relayed eight times in Hindi and English;
this website is accessible through some of the well
known engines; and it had approximately 4000 members in
the limited span of six months and various range of
products. The use of a similar domain name is bound to
cause confusion amongst the internet users. It is
pleaded that before launching of the website by
plaintiffs the said domain name was earlier booked by
one Mr. Amar Nath, who agreed not to launch the website
using this domain name. It is also pleaded that
defendants have booked various other domain names like
"rajourigardenmarket.com", "karolbaghmarket.com" with
the intention of making illegal profits.
</p>
 

<p id="p_5">4. Defendants in their written statement have
denied the averments made in the plaint, and have, inter
alia, pleaded that plaintiffs obtained ex parte
injunction by misrepresentation, mis-statement and
concealment of material facts, that defendants have live
website working under the domain name
"www.kabaribazaar.com" since November, 1999 attracting
much more traffic than plaintiffs' website. The
plaintiffs made an effort to purchase website of
defendants but they were not willing to sell, and
details of various meetings between them have been
given. It is pleaded that defendants spent large sum of
money in promoting their website through media print,
glow signs and banners etc. and that their website was
registered with all leading Search Engines. It is also
pleaded that word "kabadibazaar" on "kabaribazaar" is a
known word in Hindi language. These words have specific
connotation; namely, the market where second hand goods
are bought and sold. It is used in common parlance by
Hindi speaking population of the country. It being
descriptive word is not capable of becoming distinctive
of one sole trader.
</p>
 

<p id="p_6">5. It is further pleaded that the domain name
"kabaaribazaar.com" was earlier registered in the name
of the defendant and not in the name of Mr. Amar Nath as
claimed in the plaint. The Plaintiffs have made a
completely false and misleading statement of their
having contacted Amar Nath, who agreed not to launch a
website using the domain name "kabaaribazaar.com". The
plaintiffs have copied the entire concept from the
website "eby.com", which has been in operation since
August, 1995 and is the most popular site for second
hand sales. It is pleaded that defendant No. 3 came into
existence in 1998 and has been offering unique services
to its clients through registration of various domain
names which is not prohibited in law. The allegations
of bad faith and cybersquatting are also denied. It is
further pleaded that on 3.7.2000, plaintiffs had also
obtained registration of the domain name "ekbari.com"
and this domain co-exists with "kabadi.com". Plaintiffs
have not filed any replication to the written statement
despite opportunity.
</p>
 

<p id="p_7">6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties
and have been taken through the record. They firstly
argued at length about the concept of internet, domain
names, their registration and cybersquatting etc. There
can be no dispute about these concepts.
</p>
 

<p id="p_8">7. The internet is a vast expanding network of
computers and other devices linked together by various
telecommunications media, enabling them to exchange and
share the data. It can be described as "World Wide Web"
of computers each connected to one and another, hosting
information or facilitating commerce through website.
To facilitate communication between them every computer
connected to the internet (Host) is assigned "numerical
IP (Internet Protocol) address" which comprises of four
groups of numbers separated by decimals. As these are
difficult to remember, Internet authorities also assign
alphanumeric addresses called "domain names". The user
may only need to know the name of the company of which
he wishes to get information. A website can be reached
by typing the "domain name" which usually gives fair
indication of the content of the website. All websites
on the internet have meta tags in the source of Web
document. A meta tag is a HTML (Hyper Text Mark UP
Language) intended to describe the contents of the
website and also referred to as software source code of
the website. Search for information on the Web is
usually through Internet directories and search engines,
such as Alta vista, Lycos, Yahoo, etc.

 

</p><p id="p_9">8. Every "domain name" is divided into levels.
The "top level" domain name is a suffix which serves to
place the within one of the broad category such as
.com (for commercial), .edu (for educational) , .gov (for
government) .org (for organization), .net (network) etc.
The "second level" domain name appears before the top
level and serves as a trademark or trade name function.
The prefix www. is a standard for all World Wide Web
addresses. For example, user of the internet wishing to
get information from Economic Times newspaper, has a
reasonable expectation of reaching the Economic Times
website by merely typing the address
www.economictimes.com, into software programs that are
used to navigate the World Wide Web, without actually
knowing internet address of the newspaper. Thus, domain
name indicates to a user information as to the content
of a website. It shares many of the attributes of
trademarks or trade names. Each domain name is unique.
The "domain name" cannot be same irrespective of
geographical distance, which may not so in case of
trademarks or trade-names. Once registered the "domain
name" may be used from anywhere in the world.
</p>
 

<p id="p_10">9. The registration of domain names was taken up
initially by the Internet Network Information Centre
(InterNIC) in United States which is till date
responsible for handling the day to day administration
of the domain name system. The entity now responsible
for assigning domain names is Network Solutions Inc.
(NSI) acting on behalf of the Inter NIC. Now, the task
of registering domain names world-wide has been divided
geographically. The system of assigning the domain name
was on first-come-first-registered basis. It lead to
the reserving of many well known trade names, brand
names, company names, etc. by individuals/corporations
other than the ones with a genuine interest in the
domain name, with a view to trafficking/doing business
on the said domain name or offering the domain name to
the genuine buyer. Obtaining fraudulent registration
with an intent to sell the domain name to the lawful
owner of the name at premium is called "cyber
squatting". The Cyber squatters quickly sell the domain
names to other non-related entities, thereby enabling
passing off and diluting of famous trademark or trade
names.
</p>
 

<p id="p_11">10. Further there can be no dispute that with the
advancement of technology and communication through
internet, domain names have attained as much legal
sanctity, as the trade names. The services rendered at
the internet are equally important for any business.
The domain name is a valuable corporates asset entitled
to protection like trade-names and trade-marks. The
basic principles of the trade-mark law apply to the
disputes in respect to internet domain names. This view
finds support from the observations made in  <a href="/doc/1741869/" id="a_1">Yahoo Inc.
v. Akash Arora</a> (1999 PTC 201);  Rediff. <a href="/doc/806788/" id="a_2">Communication
Limited v. Cyberbooth</a>, AIR 2000, Bom. 27. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_12">11. To re-call, it is not the case of the
plaintiffs that domain name "www.kabadibazaar.com" is their registered trade-mark or trade name. The suit is
not for an infringement action. It is for a "passing
off action". The action for passing off lies when a
trade-mark identified with an individual, is used by
another, thereby trading on the goodwill acquired by the
proprietor of the trade-mark, goods/services of the
dishonest trader are mistaken for that of the lawful
proprietor resulting in confusion. In an action for
passing off the court in firstly required to consider
whether the plaintiff is the proprietor of the
trade-mark and then whether the defendants are passing
off the trade-mark.
</p> 
 

<p id="p_13">12. <a href="/doc/346109/" id="a_3">Sh. V.P. Singh</a>, learned senior advocate for
the plaintiff argued that the plaintiffs are proprietor
of domain name www.kabadibazaar and related trade-mark
in relation to an information website dealing with
second hand goods on the internet; the word
"kabadibazaar" is unique and newly coined by the
plaintiffs and it does not appear in the dictionary,
therefore, they are entitled to its use to the exclusion
of all others. Sh. C.M. Lal learned counsel for the
defendants argued to the contrary. In order to
appreciate this contention, it would be useful to refer
to the case set up by the plaintiffs, in para 6 of the
plaint. It reads:-
</p>
<p id="p_14"> ".....The partners decided on the
website  www.kabadibazaar.com taking into
account a kabadi being a person who takes
in second hand products and  bazaar
reflects that there is some trading
happening on the site. The plaintiffs,
having adopted this unique combination,
are the proprietors of the same and the
unauthorised use or license by any other
would amount to a violation of the right
vested with the plaintiff. The present
dispute relates to a domain name which
serves as an address on the internet."
</p> 
 

<p id="p_15">13. Bare reading of the above would show that the
plaintiffs' own case is that word "Kabadi" is a person
who takes away un-wanted goods from the house which may
be of some use in other context. "Bazaar" is a place
where the trading takes place. The periodical existence
of markets for second hand goods, is in fact conceded in
the plaint. Thus, the word "kabadibazaar" cannot be
said to be a newly coined word. The word "kabadibazaar"
also finds reference in Hindi dictionary "Rajpal Hindi
Shabdkosh". Therefore, I am unable to accept the
contention, that the word "kabadibazaar" is unique or
was newly coined by plaintiffs and the same is rejected.
</p>
 

<p id="p_16">14. Learned counsel for the plaintiff next argued
that the expression "kabadibazaar" is not descriptive
but suggestive and the word "kabadi" and "bazaar" have
been used as unique combination. The business of the 
plaintiffs differs from Kabadi (the buyer and seller of
second hand goods), since the plaintiffs are not
involved in buying and selling of goods. The
plaintiffs' target audience is English speaking, since
93% of the Internet community are English speaking and
that almost 45% of the visitors on the plaintiffs'
website are from overseas, to them, the word
"kabadibazaar" simply implies plaintiffs' and the term
kabadibazaar has no other meaning for such users.
Plaintiffs have no other trade-mark for their website.
therefore, consumers and users recognise plaintiffs by
the word "kabadibazaar" as their trade name. Plaintiffs
have used the words "kabadibazaar' as a trade-mark and
not descriptively. He further argued that trade-mark
kabadibazaar.com is not descriptive is evident from the
fact that other websites which deal in second hand goods
use expressions such as "khuljasimsim", "bazee", 
"bidrobuyindia" and no one uses "kabadibazaar". Had the
word "kabadibazaar" been descriptive, someone else would
have also used it.
</p>
 

<p id="p_17">15. At this stage, it would be useful to refer to
some decided cases.
</p>
 

<p id="p_18">16. <a href="/doc/2044127/" id="a_4">In  J.P. Kapoor v. Micronix India</a> 1994
Supp. (3) SCC 215 the Supreme Court observed that the
word, "micro" being descriptive of micro technology used
for production of many electronic goods which daily come
to the market, no one could claim its exclusive user.
It was held:
</p>
<p id="p_19"> "the word "micro" being  descriptive of
the micro technology used for production
of many electronic goods which daily come
to the market, no one can claim monopoly
over the use of the said word. Anyone
producing any product with the use of
micro-chip technology would be justified
in using the said  word as a prefix to his
trade name. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_20">(emphasis supplied) 
 

</p><p id="p_21">17. <a href="/doc/692608/" id="a_5">In  Online India Capital Co. P. Ltd. v.
Dimensions Corporate IA</a>. 3708/00 in Suit 772/00 (2000 PTC
</p><p id="p_22">396), learned Judge of this Court, declined the
injunction requiring the defendants not to use website
"www.mutualfundsindia.com" or other identical name
similar to the domain name of the plaintiffs'
www.mutualfundindia.com (without alphabet 's') holding
that the word "mutualfund" is descriptive of the
character of the services offered. It was held that the
material placed on record falls short of indicating that
the said word had acquired a secondary meaning, which is
a precondition for granting protection to a descriptive
name. The Court cited with approval the observations
made in  Office Cleaning Services v. Westminster Window
and General Cleaners Ltd. Wherein it was held:-
</p>
  

<p id="p_23">"the use of  descriptive words is
jealously safeguarded, so in the case of
trade names the Courts will not readily
assume that the use by a trader as part
of his trade name of descriptive words
already used by another trader as part of
his trade name is likely to cause
confusion and will easily accept small
difference as adequate to avoid it .....
where a trader adopts words in common use
for his trade name, some risk of
for his trade name, some risk of
confusion is inevitable. But that risk
must be run unless the first monopolises
the words. The court will accept
comparatively small differences as
sufficient to avert confusion."
</p>
 

<p id="p_24">(emphasis supplied) 
 

</p><p id="p_25">18. The trade-mark is descriptive if it imparts
information directly. If it stands for some idea which
requires some imagination to connect it with the goods
it is "sugeestive". The information may concern some
characteristic or quality or ingredient of the product.
Applying these principles here, as noticed above, the
word "kabadi" means, a person, who buys unwanted goods
and sometimes even unwanted goods are called "kabaad"
"Bazaar" is a place where goods are sold or bought.
Thus, the word "kabadibazaar" id descriptive word as it
imparts information directly. It requires no
imagination to connect it with second hand goods. It
cannot be said to be suggestive. I also find no force
in the argument that the word "kabadibazaar" is unique
merely because others have so far not used it.
</p>
 

<p id="p_26">19. It was next argued that the said domain name
"kabadibazaar" has achieved great reputation on account
of numerous articles written about the plaintiffs'
venture in newspapers and magazine including interviews
on the Star News and Good Morning India. These articles
clearly refer to the plaintiffs' website by the name of
"kabadibazaar" and in the letters the plaintiff has been
identified and recognised by the term "kabadibazaar".
It was thus argued that the word "kabadibazaar" has acquired a secondary meaning. Reliance was placed on
observations made on  Globe Super Parts v. Blue Super
Flame Industries, AIR 1986 Delhi 245;  <a href="/doc/596385/" id="a_6">Time Warner
Entertainment Company, L.P. v. A.K. Das</a> 1997 PTC(17)
453,  Charan Dass &amp; M/s. Veer Industries (India) v.
M/s. Bombay Crockery House 1984 PTC 102.
</p> 
 

<p id="p_27">20. It is true that at times descriptive words or
other devices used as trade-marks, may acquire
distinctiveness over a period of time when such a mark
has come to signify that particular goods are
manufactured or services are rendered by a particular
person it may be said that the mark has acquired
secondary meaning. It could be demonstrated by proving
advertisements, promotions and sales. But there it is
not so. The material placed on record is not enough to
prima facie, show that the domain name has acquired
secondary meaning. In this case, as noticed above, the
domain name was initially registered by one Mr. Amar
Nath. The plaintiffs and defendants had launched their
respective websites within a gap of about one month.
Admittedly, the defendants' website has been functioning
since November, 1999. Several other websites under the
domain name kabadibazaar have also been in existence in
Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore as well as in USA. It was
pleaded that as on 3.8.2000, website of the plaintiffs
consisted of total six pages. These pages consisted of
an introduction page, a page for searching for seconds
and a page showing search results for seconds. A search
of all categories, all sub categories, cities, listing
all seconds on sale displayed only 21 items. Of these,
12 sellers were from New Delhi, 4 from Mumbai, 2 from
Nasik, and one each from Rajkot and Calcutta and one was
listed as "Non Indian". Nothing has been placed on
record to show the actual business carried out by the
plaintiffs during this period. Even balance sheet or
statement of account has not been filed. In these
circumstances it is not possible to hold that the domain
name of the plaintiffs "www.kabadibazaar.com" had
acquired a secondary meaning.
</p>
 

<p id="p_28">21. The ratio of decisions cited by the learned
counsel for the plaintiffs is not applicable to the
facts of this case. In  Globe Super Parts (Supra), the
case of the plaintiffs was that they were manufacturing
gas appliances since 1976 and marketing them under the
trade-mark Super-Flame. The suit was instituted in
1985. The learned Judge came to the conclusion that
Super Flame was a coined or a fancy word and that the
word is made meaningful only when applied to the product
for which it was created. Findings on prior user of the
word Super Flame for several years was recorded in
favor of the plaintiff. In  Time Warner Entertainment
Company, L.P. (supra) it was found that the plaintiff
has largest cable channel television under the
trade-mark HBO/HOME BOX OFFICE in use since 1972 and it
operated in 96 countries and the said trade mark was
registered over 140 countries. The plaintiff applied
for registration in India in 1994 for its motion
pictures. There was Memorandum of Understanding signed
between the plaintiffs and defendants. In 1996 the
plaintiffs came to learn that defendant No. 2 proposed to
launch a cable television service using CBO/CABLE BOX 
OFFICE in relation to proposed programme service. It
was in that context that the interim injunction was
confirmed pending final disposed of the suit. And in
 Charan Dass  &amp; M/s. Veer Industries (India) the
plaintiffs were registered proprietor of the trade-mark
"PERFECT" and "SWASTIK PERFECT" and also owner of the
copyright registered design in respect of the stoves
since 1964. The defendants started using the trade-mark
"TRISHUL PERFECT" and "VIJAY PERFECT". The defendants
were stockists and sellers of the products of the
plaintiffs. In this fact of situation it was held that
defendants could easily pass off his own goods as those
of the plaintiffs and the injunction was confirmed on
25th January, 1984. These cases are thus not applicable
to the facts of the case at hand.
</p>
 

<p id="p_29">22. Lastly learned counsel for plaintiffs
referring to WIPO Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy,
1999 (for short, 'the Policy'), adopted by the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
incorporated into the Registration Agreements, setting
forth terms and conditions, for resolving disputes
between the Registrations over the registration and use of
Internet names, argued that the registration of the
domain name "www.kabaribazaar.com" by the defendants was
abusive and in bad faith. He argued that this is clear
from the facts: (a) that the defendants got registered
various other combinations with different spellings of
the said domain name; (b) that on receipt of the
complaint, when the plaintiff No. 1 met the defendants in
the first week of December, 1999, they asked for huge
amount of money and were not willing to transfer for
less; and (c) that the defendants had also booked
several other domain names like
"rajourigardenmarket.com", "karolbagmarket.com", with
which they have no connection and none of these websites
are operational, and these sites consist of
advertisements of defendants. These were booked with
the intention of making illegal profits. Learned
counsel for defendants argued to the contrary,
submitting that booking and selling of domain names is
not prohibited under the Internet Law; that the
defendants have hosted sites for traders belonging to
various markets in Delhi and the features and rates
offered at the said sites are exceptional and rarely
available on the internet. The defendants had live
website "www.kabaribazaar.com" since November, 1999
which attracted more traffic than that of the
plaintiffs' website. In support of his submission
reliance was placed on WIPO Arbitration and Mediation
Centre, Panel decisions, upholding registration and
co-existence of domain names such as Sampatti.com v.
Sampati.com, gateway.com v. gate-way.com, CITY
UTILITIES v. citiutilities.com and PET WAREHOUSE v.
petwarehouse.com.
</p>
 

<p id="p_30">23. In order to appreciate the rival contentions
it is necessary to refer to para 4 (a) of the above said
Policy which sets-forth the conditions to be proved for
showing abusive registration. It reads as under:
</p>
  

<p id="p_31">(i) the domain name is identical or
misleadingly similar to a trade or
service mark in which the complainant has
rights, and 

 

</p><p id="p_32">(ii) the holder of the domain name has no
rights or legitimate interests in respect
of the domain name; and 
 

</p><p id="p_33">(iii) the domain name has been registered
and is used in  bad faith. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_34">24. The registration of a domain name is
considered to be abusive only when all above conditions
are met and not otherwise. Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy
states the requirement of Evidence of Registration and
Use in Bad Faith for the purpose of paragraph 4(a)
</p><p id="p_35">(iii). In law, the term "bad faith" does not simply
mean bad judgment, but it implies the conscious doing of
a wrong with a dishonest purpose. It contemplates a
dishonest state of mind.
</p>
 

<p id="p_36">25. In this case the defendants and the plaintiffs
had adopted the said descriptive domain names within a
month. Nothing  has been placed on record to show the
quantum of business carried out by the plaintiffs during
the said period. The defendants' website was admittedly
operational since November, 1999. Therefore, it cannot
be said that defendants did not have any right or
legitimate interest in the domain name which is
essential requirement before it can be termed as
abusive. In fact, as per the plaintiffs' case they had
approached the defendants for buying their website but
the defendants were not willing to sell. The defendants
in their written statement have taken a specific stand
that they had several operational websites. This
statement has not been denied by the plaintiffs either
in the replication or rejoinder. Moreover, functioning
of various sites having similar domain names with
different spellings, like 'Mutualfundindia.com'
"Mutualfundsindia.com", "Networksolution.com", "Network-solutions.com", 'India.com' "Indiya.com", 'Indya.com' 
"Indiya.com", 'Naukari.com' "Noukri.com" etc. has also
not been denied. Nothing has been brought to my notice
to show that the booking and selling of domain name is
prohibited under the Internet Law. On the basis of
material placed on record, prima facie, it is not
possible to conclude that the registration by the
defendants was abusive or was in bad faith.
</p>
 

<p id="p_37">26. To conclude, the word "Kabadibazaar" is a word
commonly used in Hindi parlour having a dicitionary
meaning. It is a descriptive word which cannot serve as
a trade-mark or trade-name unless it is established that
it has attained a secondary meaning. Cases cited by the
plaintiffs in the plaint, refer to well known trade
names and the observations made therein are not
applicable to the facts at hand. The material placed on
record prima facie is not enough to show that the
plaintiffs' domain name had acquired the secondary
meaning. The allegations of abusive registration/cyber
squatting are also not substantiated. In the result, on
relative strength, the case appears to be in favor of
the defendants. It may be clarified here that the ex
parte ad interim injunction was granted to the
plaintiffs on 24th April, 2000, till the next date of
hearing, but the same was not extended on account of the
oral undertaking given by the counsel for defendants,
which continued thereafter.
</p>
 

<p id="p_38">27. For the foregoing reasons application of the
defendants under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC is allowed, and
order dated 24th April, 2000 granting interim injunction
in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants
is hereby vacated. Consequently application
(I.A. No. 3064/2000) of the plaintiffs under Order 39 Rule
1 &amp; 2 CPC stands dismissed.
</p>
 

<p id="p_39">28. No order as to costs. Any observations made
herein shall not affect the merits of the case.
</p>
