</pre>
<p id="p_1">HON'BLE Dr.K.B.S.RAJAN, JUDICIAL MEMBER

      The applicant is aggrieved by the order of rejection of his request for

withdrawal of his application for voluntary retirement. Annexure A 7 order

dated 03-12-2010 impugned herein refers.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                      .2.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The bare minimum facts of the case required to decide the issue

involved in this case are as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.    The applicant while working as Scientist/Engineer SG under

the   fourth   respondent   submitted     an  application   to    go  on  for

voluntary retirement, vide Annexure A-1 letter dated 22-07-2010 . He had

requested for relieving him w.e.f. 15-11-2010. However, by        11-11-2010,

the applicant sent another communication stating that he proposed to

withdraw his application opting for VRS submitted on      22-07-2010. It was

on this very same day, i.e. 11-11-2010 that     the Administrative Officer, P

&amp; G Administration, Thiruvananthapuram informed the applicant that his

notice dated 22-07-2010 for voluntary retirement under Rule 48 A of the

CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 has been accepted by the Department and that

he would be relieved of his duties with effect from the forenoon of 15-11-

2010.   Annexure A-3 refers.       The applicant renewed his request for

withdrawal of his earlier application for voluntary retirement, vide Annexure

A-4 letter dated 15-11-2010. A like communication was also addressed to

the third respondent, vide Annexure A-5. Meanwhile the applicant was

relieved of his duties, vide order dated 15-11-2010 at Annexure A-6.        It

was, however, through Annexure A-7 order dated 03-12-2010 that the

applicant was informed that his request for voluntary retirement was duly

considered in the Department of Space, Bangalore and the Department

has conveyed that his withdrawal notice for Voluntary Retirement has not

been accepted by the competent authority.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.    The applicant has filed this OA on the following amongst other

                                     .3.
</p>
<p id="p_8">grounds :-
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">(a)   Withdrawal before the voluntary retirement becomes effective could

be made.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">(b)   The Decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/882187/" id="a_1">J.N. Srivastava vs

Union of India</a> (1998) 5 SCC 461 supports the case of the applicant. So is

the decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/81701/" id="a_2">Power Finance Corporation

Ltd vs Pramod Kumar Bhatia</a> (1997) 4 SCC 280.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">5.        Respondents have contested the OA. According to them, on

receipt of the request for voluntary retirement by the applicant, the second

and fourth respondents had duly considered and recommended the case of

the applicant for consideration by the Competent Authority, i.e. the

Secretary, Department of Space and the latter, vide Annexure R-1 order

dated 09-11-2010 conveyed his acceptance of the request of the applicant

for voluntary retirement and asked the 2nd respondent to relieve the

applicant on 15-11-2010. This was duly communicated to the applicant

vide A-3 Memorandum dated 11-11-2010. According to the respondents,

thereafter, the applicant on the same day, i.e. 11-11-2010 sent a

communication to the 2nd respondent in a very casual manner and merely

mentioning therein "I propose to withdraw my application opting for VRS

submitted earlier dated 22nd July, 2010." without specifying any reason for

his withdrawal of request for Voluntary Retirement.          The Competent

Authority, on careful consideration of all aspects, decided not to accept the

applicant's request for withdrawal of Voluntary Retirement.         Once the

application for Voluntary Retirement is accepted, it is a settled law that any

                                      .4.
</p>
<p id="p_15">request for withdrawal of notice for Voluntary Retirement shall also require

acceptance by the Competent Authority. The Authority considered the

withdrawal request but did not accept the same. Submission of request for

Voluntary Retirement without indicating any reason for withdrawal of Notice

for Voluntary Retirement does not confer any legitimate right to the

applicant to be allowed to continue in service. No rule specifies that it is

obligatory on the part of the Competent Authority to accept the withdrawal

notice for Voluntary Retirement submitted by an employee.           As such,

Annexure A-7 issued by the respondents is well within the rule provisions

and it cannot be termed as illegal or arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">6.     The applicant has filed his rejoinder reiterating the contentions as

contained in the OA and adding a copy of his representation dated

11-11-2010 wherein the endorsement of the respondents reflected, "Since

relieving order already issued by DOS, it is not possible to consider this

now."    He has also filed copy of his further representation dated

05-02-2011. He has also stated that the respondents never sought for any

reasons in both instances and had not taken their decisions based on 'lack

of reasons'.   Again, the statement in para 8 of the reply is not in

consonance with contents in Annexure A-8 and A-10.



</p><p id="p_18">7.     Additional reply, rebutting the contentions in the rejoinder had been

filed by the respondents, against which the applicant has filed additional

rejoinder.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">8.     Counsel for the applicant submitted that the question is whether at

                                      .5.
</p>
<p id="p_21">the time of making request for withdrawal of the application for voluntary

retirement, the jural relationship (Employer - Employee) subsists and so

long as it subsists, the withdrawal request could be given. The applicant

being a scientist thought that brevity would suffice and no elaborate reason

could be given. He had heavily relied upon the decision in the case of

<a href="/doc/1962388/" id="a_3">Balram Gupta vs Union of India</a> 1987 (Supp) SCC 228.



</p><p id="p_22">9.    Counsel for the respondents submitted that Rule 48 A of the Pension

Rules require that such withdrawal needs acceptance of the competent

authority and after duly considering the case, the competent authority

declined to permit the applicant to withdraw his request for voluntary

retirement.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">10.   Arguments were heard and documents perused.           Admittedly,  it is

Rule 48 A of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 that applies to this case and

the same reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "48-A.Retirement on completion of 20 years' qualifying
      service.-- (1) At any time after a government servant has
      completed twenty years' qualifying service, he may, by giving
      notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing
      authority, retire from service.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (2)    The notice of voluntary retirement given under sub-rule
      (1) shall require acceptance by the appointing authority:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      Provided that where the appointing authority does not refuse
      to grant the permission for retirement before the expiry of the
      period specified in the said notice, the retirement shall become
      effective from the date of expiry of the said period."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      x x x x

      (4)    A government servant, who has elected to retire under
      this rule and has given the necessary notice to that effect to

                                      .6.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       the appointing authority, shall be precluded from withdrawing
       his notice except with the specific approval of such authority.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_26">11.    One of the main contentions of the respondents is "Once the

application for Voluntary Retirement is accepted, it is a settled law that any

request for withdrawal of notice for Voluntary Retirement shall also require

acceptance by the Competent Authority." The relevant part of the rules

specifies that a government servant, who has elected to retire under this

rule and has given the necessary notice to that effect to the appointing

authority, shall be precluded from withdrawing his notice except with the

specific approval of such authority. Thus, permission for withdrawal of

letter of voluntary retirement is a pre-requisite, and it is rather, irrespective

of whether the earlier request for retirement has been accepted or is under

consideration. In other words, once an individual has opted to retire and

has made a request accordingly, then, for withdrawal not only that he

should address the competent authority for such withdrawal but also that

he is precluded from withdrawing his notice except with the specific

approval of such authority.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">12.    Thus, the competent authority shall have to accord his approval for

such withdrawal.     The question is whether the authority has power to

decline such approval. The rule does not specifically indicate such a power

but it must be implied that such a power to refuse is implied in the rule.

For, in the case of <a href="/doc/1011232/" id="a_4">Achutananda Purohit vs State of Orissa</a>, (1976) 3

SCC 183, in respect of according approval for assessment, the Apex Court

has held :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                     .7.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     "      The power to approve implies the power to disapprove
     or modify..."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_29">13.  In the case of State of H.P. Vs Ganesh Wood Products (1995) 6

SCC 363, the Apex Court has stated as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             Now, it cannot be denied that the power to approve
      includes the power to decline approval and the power to
      disapprove.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">14.  Thus, the competent authority does enjoy power to disapprove also.



</p><p id="p_32">15.  The next question to be considered is under what circumstances,

could such a power to decline approval be invoked? Certainly the same

cannot be arbitrary or whimsical. The Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/120538540/" id="a_5">Rash Lal

Yadav (Dr) vs State of Bihar</a> (1994) 5 SCC 267 has observed :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "where a statute confers wide powers on an administrative
     authority coupled with wide discretion, the possibility of its
     arbitrary use can be controlled or checked by insisting on their
     being exercised in a manner which can be said to be
     procedurally fair."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_33">16.  In Balram Gupta, the Apex Court inter alia held as under :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "      In the modern and uncertain age it is very difficult to
     arrange one's future with any amount of certainty; a certain
     amount of flexibility is required, and if such flexibility does not
     jeopardize the Government or administration, administration
     should be graceful enough to respond and acknowledge the
     flexibility of human mind and attitude and allow the appellant to
     withdraw his letter of retirement in the facts and circumstances
     of this case. Much complications which had arisen could have
     been thus avoided by such graceful attitude. The court cannot
     but condemn circuitous ways "to ease out" uncomfortable
     employees. As a model employer the Government must
     conduct itself with high probity and candour with its
     employees."
</blockquote>
                                     .8.<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">17.   The reason for refusal as could be seen in Annexure A-8

Endorsement is that since the request for retirement has been accepted,

request for withdrawal cannot be approved.            This reason is not

contemplated in the rules. As such this reason cannot be accepted.



</p><p id="p_36">18.   It has been stated in the reply that reason for refusal to accept

request for withdrawal is that no reason has been spelt out in the

application for such withdrawal.       True, no reason has been given.

Nevertheless, change in the mind of the applicant could be read through in

his request. This change in the mind could have been by way of advice

from friends and relatives (as in Balram Gupta) or by a wisdom dawn on

the applicant himself. If spelling out such a reason for withdrawal is an

inevitable requirement, nothing prevented the respondents to seek the

same immediately after the filing of the application for such withdrawal.

There was no communication in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">19.   Thus, the fact that the letter of withdrawal only succeeded the letter

of acceptance as contended by the respondents does not hamper the right

of the applicant to apply for approval for withdrawal of the application for

retirement. Again, non furnishing of the reason also cannot be a ground for

denying the approval.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">20.   Certain earlier decisions, in addition to Balram Gupta (supra) relied

upon by the counsel for the applicant goes in support of the applicant. The

same are as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                               .9.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_2">(a)    <a href="/doc/1872028/" id="a_6">In   Shambhu       Murari    Sinha    v.  Project    and
Development India</a>        (2000) 5 SCC 621 (Shambhu Murari
</pre><p id="p_41">Sinha I) an application for voluntary retirement of an employee
dated 18-10-1995 was accepted by the employer vide letter
dated 30-7-1997 with further intimation that "release memo
along with detailed particulars will follow". The workman was
actually relieved on 26-9-1997. In the meanwhile, however, by
a letter dated 7-8-1997, he withdrew the application dated
18-10-1995, by which he sought voluntary retirement. It was
held that the effective date of voluntary retirement was
26-9-1997 and before that date it was permissible for the
workman to withdraw his retirement. The appellant was,
therefore, held entitled to remain in service.
</p>
<p id="p_42">(b)    <a href="/doc/1872028/" id="a_7">In   Shambhu       Murari    Sinha    v.  Project    and
Development India Ltd</a>.(2002) 3 SCC 437 (Shambhu Murari
Sinha II), the view taken in Shambhu Murari Sinha I was
reiterated. It was held that when voluntary retirement was
withdrawn by an employee, he continued to remain in service.
The relationship of employer and employee did not come to an
end and the employee had locus penitentiae to withdraw his
proposal for voluntary retirement. He was, therefore, entitled to
rejoin duty and the Corporation was bound to allow him to
work.
</p>
<p id="p_43">(c)    <a href="/doc/882187/" id="a_8">In J.N. Srivastava v. Union of India</a> (1998) 9 SCC 559
a notice of voluntary retirement was given by an employee on
3-10-1989 which was to come into effect from 31-1-1990. The
notice was accepted by the Government on 2-11-1989 but the
employee withdrew the notice vide his letter dated 11-12-1989.
It was held that withdrawal was permissible though it was
accepted by the Government, since it was to be made effective
from 31-1-1990 and before that date it was withdrawn.

</p><p id="p_44">(d)    In the case of <a href="/doc/1341859/" id="a_9">Union of India v. Wing Commander T.
Parthasarathy</a>,(2001) 1 SCC 158, the Apex Court has held as
under :-
</p>
<p id="p_45">       "9.   The reliance placed upon the so-called policy
decision which obligated the respondent to furnish a certificate
to the extent that he was fully aware of the fact that he cannot
later seek for cancellation of the application once made for
premature retirement cannot, in our view, be destructive of the
right of the respondent, in law, to withdraw his request for
premature retirement before it ever became operative and
effective and effected termination of his status and relation
with the Department."
</p>
<p id="p_46">                                     .10.
</p>
<p id="p_47">21.   From the above decisions, it is evident, that a liberal view has to be

taken in so far acceptance of the request for withdrawal of application for

retirement by the government servant. This does not, however, mean that

under no circumstances should approval for withdrawal be withheld.

Power to withhold approval could certainly be exercised, for justifiable

reasons as for example :-
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (a)    in anticipation of the retirement of the applicant, if
      alternate arrangement has already been made in the place of
      the applicant, resumption of duties by the applicant would
      result in administrative inconvenience and would cause
      prejudice to all concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      (b)    if a cadre is declared as a dying cadre and the
      incumbent to the post applies for voluntary retirement from a
      prospective date and if arrangement for abolition of the said
      post has been made in advance from the intended date of
      retirement, request for withdrawal of application for retirement
      would lead to complexities in getting the abolished post
      resurrected.    Under such circumstances, refusal to accord
      approval for withdrawal is fully justified.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      (c)    If a person first applies for retirement and then
      withdraws the same and again for the second time he repeats
      the same, it is a kind of harassment to the administration and
      in such case too, refusal is fully justified.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_49">22.   The case of the applicant is pure and simple. He had applied for

retirement and before the intended date of retirement, he chose to

withdraw the same. In between, no alternative arrangement has been

made, nor is the post likely to be abolished.        In fact services of an

experienced scientist may only be useful to the organization. Thus, the

decision of the respondents to refuse approval for withdrawal of the letter of

retirement has to be held as bad in law. It is so declared. Annexure A-7 is,

therefore, quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                                      .11.
</p>
<p id="p_51">23.    The result of the above quashing of the order would mean that the

applicant is entitled to be reinstated in service.



</p><p id="p_52">24.    Coming to the next question of consequential benefits claimed, the

impugned order had been passed in December, 2010 and the applicant

filed this OA in February, 2011. Minimum time has been consumed by the

applicant in approaching the Tribunal.       Reply to the OA was filed by the

respondents on 27-05-2011 and the applicant filed his rejoinder in

September, 2011.        Additional reply was filed by the respondents in

December, 2011. Thus, there is no unreasonable delay in completion of

pleadings and the hearing also has taken place immediately. The period of

one year plus i.e. from the date of relieving on 15-11-2010 till the date of

reinstatement in the near future, should be treated only as duty with pay

and allowances, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant could not

perform any duty during this period.
</p>
<p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">25.    The applicant is stated to have been paid a part of his terminal

benefits and it has also been stated that such payment has been

entertained by the applicant under protest. The extent of payment so far

made and the amount payable to the applicant by way of pay and

allowances for the period of absence from 15-11-2010 till the date of

reinstatement should be compared and any amount paid to the applicant in

excess of the pay and allowances shall be got refunded in one lump sum to

the respondents. If any amount is due to the applicant, the same should be

paid by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_55">                                     .12.
</p>
<p id="p_56">26.   The OA is thus, allowed. Respondents are directed to pass suitable

orders for reinstatement of the applicant within a period of two months from

the date of communication of this order. The period of absence has to be

treated as on duty with pay and allowances. The period shall also count for

working out increment admissible to the applicant. Amount payable by or

to the applicant be worked out and the same settled expeditiously. OA is

thus allowed.
