<p id="p_1">SANJEEV NARULA, J


</p><p id="p_2">1. The present petition under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation
Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the „Act‟) challenges the award dated 1st
October 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the „impugned order‟) passed by the
learned Sole Arbitrator.
</p>

<p id="p_3">Facts
</p><p id="p_4">2. The brief facts as stated in the petition are that, Petitioner/Delhi
Development Authority (DDA) held a national competition for registered
architects inviting layout plans for development of a tract of land measuring




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                               Page 1 of 29</span>
 25.16 hectares in Vasant Kunj. Respondent participated in the aforesaid
competition and submitted the basic presentation and drawing plans for
overall development of the said land. After selection, on 5th October 1999,
Petitioner issued an offer letter defining the scope of work. This was
followed by execution of the agreement dated 10th November 2000, which
prescribed a period of six years from the date of signing of the agreement for
completion of the contract. The fee of the Respondent was fixed at 2 percent
of the total cost of construction i.e Rs. 2,70,67,86/- which was to be paid as
per Clause 13 of the agreement.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3. Later, the total site area was reduced from 25.16 Ha to 23.65 Ha. This
resulted in change in the site area and configuration of the site perimeters.
For the above reason and due to the upcoming Common Wealth Games,
Petitioner vide letter dated 15th January 2008, extended the time for
completion of the work upto November 2010. Subsequently, the completion
date was extended till October 2012 and further till December 2014.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4. Respondent vide letter dated 23rd July 2014, raised certain claims
pertaining to non payment of professional fees. Disputes arose between the
parties. Petitioner vide letter dated 8th October 2014 invoked arbitration and
proposed the name of the learned Arbitrator. Respondent consented to the
same and the arbitration proceedings commenced. Respondent filed its
Statement of Claim inter alia raising 7 claims and the Petitioner contested
the same by raising counter claims.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                             Page 2 of 29</span>
<p id="p_7"> 5. Learned Arbitrator passed the impugned award allowing certain claims of
the Respondent. Petitioner assails the award in respect of claim Nos. 1, 2
and 6. The objections raised are dealt separately as under:
</p>

<p id="p_8">Claim No. 1 for Rs. 76,94,639/- in respect of 12th and final bill dated 23rd
July 2014

</p><p id="p_9">6. The learned Arbitrator has partly allowed the claim for Rs. 41,92,530/-
and by way of declaratory award it has been held that the service tax shall
also be paid by the Petitioner to the Respondent at the prevailing rate when
the aforenoted payment is made to the Respondent. The awarded amount has
two components:
</p><p id="p_10">  a. Balance fee awarded applying the factor of 95 % being Rs. 32,91,587/-
  b. Rs. 9,00,943/- awarded towards service tax reimbursement


A. Whether the Respondent is entitled to the balance fees at the factor
of 95 %.
</p><p id="p_11">7. The objection of DDA is that the learned Arbitrator has wrongly held that
the Respondent had completed the work as stipulated under Clause 13.7 of
the agreement. It is urged that the learned Arbitrator should have awarded
only 90% of the balance fees as the Respondent had failed to carry out all its
obligations under the agreement and had not reached the stage as
contemplated under Clauses 13.7 and 13.8 of the agreement.
</p>

<p id="p_12">8. Learned counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that by end of the
year 2002, the Respondent had completed only 55% of the total work
whereas as per the agreement, 70% of the total work was required to be




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                             Page 3 of 29</span>
 completed by 20th August 2001. Thus, there was an obvious delay in
execution and submissions of drawings and designs. Despite repeated
reminders, Respondent failed to submit the drawings and seek Petitioner's
approval. Respondent also failed to complete the project and obtain the
completion certificate. Due to incomplete and wrong drawings provided by
the Respondent, Petitioner incurred a substantial loss.
</p>

<p id="p_13">9. The counsel for the Petitioner also urged that as per the agreement, the
Respondent was required to ensure that all the designs and plans are
approved from the civic and government authorities and that the same are in
conformity with the latest Indian or British/American Standard Codes and
sound engineering practice. The Arbitrator failed to take into consideration
delay caused by the Respondent and that it had defaulted in the execution of
the work by not adhering to the height restrictions as per the norms of
Airport Authority of India and submitting faulty design of basement due to
which the Petitioner was burdened with costs. The Respondent was required
to make necessary modifications in the plans and designs to bring the same
in conformity with the updated and latest rules and laws. It was required to
provide the revised drawings after making all necessary modifications
without any extra costs. Learned Arbitrator has also failed to consider the
letters wherein Petitioner had categorically requested the Respondent to
provide the specific drawings. The award against Claim No. 1 be set aside as
the Respondent had completed only 90 % of the work as per the agreement
and is entitled to payment only to that extent of the total fees [Rs.
18,25,195/-] and not 95 %, as awarded by the learned arbitrator.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                              Page 4 of 29</span>
<p id="p_14"> 10. Learned counsel for the Respondent on the other hand argued that as per
Clause 12.3 of the agreement, the fee should have been paid at the stages as
laid down in Clause 13.1 to 13.8 of which the last stage is provided for
under clause 13.8. Respondent had completed the work as per the scope of
the agreement. Petitioner has failed to bring on record any document to
show that it had incurred expenses for any of the services that were not
provided by the Respondent despite being contractually bound to do so.
Petitioner has also not shown that it had to engage another agency/third
party to provide the services that were not provided by the Respondent. The
objections are misconceived. The learned Arbitrator has correctly held that
the Respondent is entitled to payment of 95 % of the total fee payable.
</p>

<p id="p_15">B. Whether the Respondent is entitled to reimbursement of service tax.
</p>

<p id="p_16">11. The second component of claim No.1 relates to service tax. The learned
Arbitrator has held that though the agreement is silent on liability to pay
service tax, however it cannot be ignored that the condition of service tax
was stipulated by the Respondent in its letter dated 20th February 2008
which was duly accepted by the Petitioner in its letter of extension.
</p>

<p id="p_17">12. Learned counsel for the Petitioner argued that the learned Arbitrator
could not have passed an order in variance of the terms of the agreement
between the parties. The agreement did not envisage reimbursement of
service tax and the Petitioner was to pay only the stipulated fee as provided
in the agreement. Learned Arbitrator erroneously relied on the letter dated
20th February 2008 as the same was not an acceptance of the condition put




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                              Page 5 of 29</span>
 forth in the said letter with regard to the levy of service tax. Petitioner‟s
letter of extension dated 30th April 2008 did not refer to the Respondents‟
letter dated 20th February 2008 and merely observed that as per Clause 17 of
the agreement, the Vice Chairman has approved the extension of the
agreement up to November 2010.            There could not be any deemed
acceptance of new term in the absence of any specific communication or
overt positive act of the Petitioner. In this regard the learned counsel for the
Petitioner placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_3">Bharat
Petroleum Cooperation Ltd. v. Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd</a>.
reported in (2008) 1 SCC 503.
</p>

<p id="p_18">13. Respondent‟s counsel , on the other hand, argued that the Petitioner vide
its letter dated 15th January 2008 communicated the extension of the original
agreement up to November 2010 and desired the Respondent to convey its
acceptance. The Respondent did so vide letter dated 20th February 2008
wherein it was categorically stated that the service tax shall be paid as per
the prevailing norms as stipulated by the government. There was no denial
by the Petitioner for payment of service tax in it‟s letter dated 30th April
2008. Learned Arbitrator has allowed the payment of Service Tax only post
20th February 2008 i.e only for the extended period for which the
Respondent had produced the challans evidencing the deposit of service tax
with the tax authorities .

<p id="p_19">Analysis
</p><p id="p_20">14. The scope of interference of the Court under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the Act is
limited. The Court does not sit in appeal over the adjudication made by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                              Page 6 of 29</span>
 Arbitrator. The findings challenged by the Petitioner are purely within the
domain of adjudication by the Arbitrator. The legal position in this behalf
has been summarized in paragraph 26 of the judgment of the Supreme Court
in <a href="/doc/455122/" id="a_5">Steel Authority of India Ltd vs. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd [JT</a> 2009
(12) SC 135] as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "26. It is not necessary to multiply the references. Suffice it to
       say that the legal position that emerges from the decisions of
       this Court can be summarised thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (i) In a case where an arbitrator travels beyond the contract, the
       award would be without jurisdiction and would amount to legal
       misconduct and because of which the award would become
       amenable for being set aside by a Court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (ii) An error relatable to interpretation of the contract by an
       arbitrator is an error within his jurisdiction and such error is not
       amenable to correction by Courts as such error is not an error
       on the face of the award.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (iii) If a specific question of law is submitted to the arbitrator
       and he answers it, the fact that the answer involves an erroneous
       decision in point of law does not make the award bad on its
       face.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (iv) An award contrary to substantive provision of law or
       against the terms of contract would be patently illegal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (v) Where the parties have deliberately specified the amount of
       compensation in express terms, the party who has suffered by
       such breach can only claim the sum specified in the contract
       and not in excess thereof. In other words, no award of
       compensation in case of breach of contract, if named or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                                Page 7 of 29</span>
          specified in the contract, could be awarded in excess thereof.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         (vi) If the conclusion of the arbitrator is based on a possible
         view of the matter, the court should not interfere with the
         award.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         (vii) It is not permissible to a court to examine the correctness
         of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal
         over his findings"

<p id="p_21">15. Similar view has been taken later in <a href="/doc/1092394/" id="a_6">Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v.
Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India</a>(2010) 11 SCC 296. The
observations in paragraph 36 thereof are instructive in this behalf and read as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "..... The umpire has considered the fact situation and placed a
         construction on the clauses of the agreement which according to
         him was the correct one. One may at the highest say that one
         would have preferred another construction of Clause 17.3 but
         that cannot make the award in any way perverse. Nor can one
         substitute one's own view in such a situation, in place of the one
         taken by the umpire, which would amount to sitting in appeal.
         As held by this Court in Kwality Manufacturing Corporation v.

         MANU/SC/0435/2009 : (2009) 5 SCC 142 the court while
         considering challenge to arbitral award does not sit in appeal
         over the findings and decision of the arbitrator, which is what
         the High Court has practically done in this matter. The umpire
         is legitimately entitled to take the view which he holds to be the
         correct one after considering the material before him and after
         interpreting the provisions of the agreement. If he does so, the
         decision of the umpire has to be accepted as final and binding."

<p id="p_22"> 16. Taking note of the aforementioned principles, I now proceed to examine
whether Petitioner‟s challenge with respect to the findings qua Claim No. 1
is sustainable or not. The payment of fee is interdependent with the progress
of work. The agreement stipulates the stages of completion to determine the
payment due to the Respondent as per the following tabulation:
</p>



<pre id="pre_2">Stage Work                                Fees to be Paid

</p>
<p id="p_26">17. Petitioner contends that Respondent should be paid 90% of the total fees.
As can be seen from the above clause, there is no stage prescribed for
payment of 90% of the total fee. The Petitioner has arbitrarily concluded the
entitlement to be 90% and there is no basis or rationale in this contention.
The stage envisaged under Clause 13.6 entitles the Respondent to only 70%
of the total fees. There is no intermediate stage of 90%. The Arbitrator has
concluded that there is no material placed on record which could show
failure on the part of the Respondent in completing the work so as to be
disentitled to 95% of the fee. Petitioner's contention that Respondent had
failed to fulfil its obligations up to the stage prescribed in Clause 13.7 has
been discredited. Petitioner's contention that Respondent‟s designs were
faulty and certain portion had to be dismantled, has not been accepted. The
specific finding on the issue is as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     15.1 As per clause 12.3 of the agreement, the fee shall be paid to
     the claimant at the stages as laid down in para 13.1 to 13.8 of
     which the last stage is 13.8 "on completion of work and
     submission of as-built drawings dispatching completion
     certificate as per clause 6.8 (obtaining completion certificate
     from statutory bodies and submission of in-built drawings)".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     15.2 The claimant has contended that but for obtaining the
     completion certificate which is the last stage of payment and for
     which fee payable is-5% of the total fee, it has completed all the
     works as per the scope of agreement and even beyond on which
     account claim No.2 and additional claim No. 1 have been raised.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">     15.3 It is also the contention of the claimant that the construction
     work had been long completed and commissioned and the flats
     have been allotted and occupied too, but the respondent has
     failed to establish if it spent any amount on any of the services
     which were to be provided by the claimant upto stage 13.7 but
     due to the alleged failure of the claimant, the respondent had to
     engage any other agency to provide the same. The respondent has
     also not placed on record the drawings or the design it prepared
     in-house due to the alleged failure of the claimant to provide the
     same as vaguely mentioned in para 78 of its reply.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     15.4 The claimant has also contended that prior to obtaining the
     completion certificate, the respondent was/is required to confirm
     that the work has been completed as per QFC drawings and
     approved service drawings which the respondent despite repeated
     requests failed to confirm even till date.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     15.5 The respondent has contended that apart from not obtaining
     the completion certificate, the claimant failed to fulfill all its
     obligations upto the stage 13.7. It is also the contention of the
     respondent that because of failure of the claimant to fulfill all its
     obligations, the respondent had to spend extra which is subject
     matter of counter-claim.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      15.6 I find that contrary to the contentions of the respondent, it is
     not on record that the respondent ever issued any notice to the

     at claimant's risk and cost. Even otherwise, there is no letter on
     record demanding payment from the claimant for the alleged
     expenses incurred by the respondent for getting the services
     provided by any other agency or in-house. No amount was ever

     But the respondent has failed to establish if it spent any amount
     on any of the services which were to be provided by the claimant
     upto stage 13.7 but due to the alleged failure of the claimant, the
     respondent had to engage any other agency to provide the same.
     The respondent has also not placed on record the drawing? Or the

     discussed in para 14 above, I have no hesitation to come to a
     conclusion that the claimant completed all its job upto the stage
     13.7 and the only stage which it could not complete was the last
     stage (13.8), i.e. obtaining completion certificate for which the
     fee payable is 5% of total fees.

     payment of only 95% of the total fee payable."

<p id="p_27">18. Further, Petitioner's contention that certain letters and Minutes of
Meeting have been overlooked is also unmerited, as can be seen from the
discussion in Para 12.36 of the award.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                                Page 12 of 29</span>
<p id="p_28"> 19. The Arbitrator has applied the factor of 95% on the balance fee payable.
The reasoning and conclusion of the Arbitrator is based on facts. Petitioner
failed to corroborate the plea of sustaining loss and it cannot be said that the
finding is perverse or illegal to warrant interference by this Court. There is
thus no merit in the contention raised by the Petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_29">20. With respect to the finding of the Arbitrator regarding the reimbursement
of service tax, it is to be noted that the Arbitrator has taken into
consideration several factors relating to this issue and in particular, the letter
dated 20th February 2008, which reads as under:-

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_24">21. In the aforesaid letter, there is a categorical mention regarding service
tax. The said letter was accepted by the Petitioner vide letter dated 30th
April 2008 whereby it agreed to grant extension of time for completion of
the work. Though, the Petitioner has denied the receipt of the letter dated
20th February 2008, however, such denial is inconsequential as in the
subsequent communication dated 30th April 2008 Petitioner has not denied
the same. The Arbitrator has also relied upon the conditions stipulated in the
letter dated 20th February 2008 wherein it has been categorically mentioned
that the service tax shall be as per the prevailing norms. This letter was
issued in the context of extension of the time for fulfilling the work under
the Agreement. While granting the extension and accepting the proposal,
the Petitioner did not refute the liability to pay the service tax. The
Respondent has shown proof of depositing service tax and is only seeking
reimbursement thereof. The claim of reimbursement of service tax is from
the stage when the extension of time was granted by the Petitioner. The
Respondent was the service provider and the Petitioner was the recipient.
</blockquote><p id="p_30">The Respondent is thus entitled to recover the amount of service tax, even
though the contract between the parties was held to be silent with respect to
the entity that was to ultimately meet this statutory liability. The Division
Bench of this Court in a similar situation in the case of <a href="/doc/130701365/" id="a_7">Satya Developers

     Tax. As noted above, <a href="/doc/93141689/" id="a_11">Section 12B</a> of the Central Excise Act
     which applies to the Service Tax raises a presumption that the
     incidence of duty has been passed to the buyer unless the
     contrary is proved. Thus in the absence of a contract for the
     liability of a service tax, it will be presumed that the same has
     been passed over to the service recipient.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     27. From the legal position as noted it is evident whether the
     service tax liability has been agreed not to be passed on to the
     recipient of the service would depend on the interpretation of
     clauses entered into between the parties....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">     31. Thus a contract has to be construed by looking at the
     document as a whole and the meaning of the document has to be
     what the parties intended to give to the document keeping the
     background in mind and conclusion that flouts business
     commonsense must yield unless expressly stated. In the present
     case it will also have to borne in mind whether the parties intend
     to include taxes which were not contemplated at the time of the
     agreement as indubitably the agreements between the parties in

 Petitioner filed a petition under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_16">Section 34</a> of the Act, challenging the
finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that held that the Petitioner is liable to
reimburse the component of service tax levied on the first Respondent. The
Court upheld the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal and said that the
Petitioner would have to bear the burden of service tax. The relevant
paragraphs of the judgement read as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       "31. Continuing with my discussion, the facts, which have
       emerged in the present case, clearly show that, when, the Jade
       Charter was executed on 26.07.2007, the service tax on the kind
       of services rendered by the first respondent, had not kicked-in.
       Service tax was imposed, on the kind of services rendered by
       the first respondent, only on, 16.05.2008. Therefore, quite
       clearly, the service tax was not a "tax", which was in
       contemplation of the parties on the date of execution of the
       contract. This was, therefore, not a tax, qua which the first
       respondent was assessed or, could have been assessed on the
       date when the Jade Charter was executed.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       31.1 Therefore, on a plain reading of the language of Clause
       34.1, it cannot be held that qua service tax, the first respondent
       was required to hold the petitioner, safe and harmless and/or
       even indemnify the petitioner. At best, what could be said in
       favour of the petitioner is that the contract was silent on who
       would bear the burden of service tax. Since, service tax is an
       indirect tax, quite clearly, the ultimate burden qua such tax, like
       other indirect taxes, i.e., excise duty and sales tax, would have
       to be borne by the party using the services, as in the case of
       service tax and similarly, by the consumer of goods, as in the
       case of excise duty and sales tax.

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">        31.2 One could also take a clue from the provisions of <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_17">Section
       64A</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 to gain statutory wisdom,
       so to say, to deal with a situation of the kind, one is confronted
       with, in the instant case. <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_18">Section 64A</a> of the Sale of Goods Act,
       if paraphrased, broadly, provides, that if, during the course of
       the execution of the contract, a new tax is imposed or, rates of
       tax are increased, the buyer; will bear the burden, and if, per
       chance the tax is abolished or the rate is reduced, the buyer
       would get the benefit. The Section, though, gives a leeway to
       the parties to provide otherwise.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">       31.3 Therefore, usually, unless, parties clearly provide in the
       contract as to who is to bear the burden if such a situation
       arises, as is the circumstance, in the instant case, the ultimate
       burden will have to be borne by the consumer, i.e., the

amply clear that the said case is distinguishable on facts and is not
applicable to the facts of the present case. Moreover, in para 19, the Court in
the following words has held that offeree‟s silence coupled with his conduct,

    mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words.
    Under certain circumstances, offeree's silence, coupled with his
    conduct, which takes the form of a positive act, may constitute an
    acceptance - an agreement sub silentio. Therefore, the terms of a

was leviable. It also does not deny that the amount sought to be reimbursed
was paid by the Respondent to the tax department. Moreover, the letter dated
20th February 2008 is also not denied by the Petitioner and constitutes
acceptance by conduct. There is no error in the findings given by the
Arbitrator and the challenge of the Petitioner on this ground cannot sustain.

<p id="p_32">Claim No. 2: Towards Rs. 1,65,94,445/- on the 13th Bill dated 23rd July

</p>
<p id="p_33">26. The learned Arbitrator has partly allowed Claim No. 2 and has awarded
a sum of Rs. 1,06,26,347/-, for the reason that due to the revision of the
earthquake code in late 2002 , Respondent had to revise the drawings
already issued. The awarded said sum has four components:-

        Petitioner to the Respondent at the prevailing rate when payment of
       Rs. 1,06,26,347/- is made to the Respondent.
</p>

<p id="p_38">27. So far as Sub head (a) is concerned, the same is impugned only to the
extent that the learned Arbitrator had calculated the said fee applying the
factor of 95% instead of 90%. Sub head (b) relates to extra payment for
reworking of drawings. Petitioner argues that firstly no extra payment is
payable in view of Clause 3.1 and 3.2 of the Agreement which stipulates
modification and revision of drawings without any extra cost. Secondly, the
learned Arbitrator has arrived at the figure of 15% without any justification
and has wrongly placed reliance on the letter dated 15th January 2008. Extra
fee of 10% was proposed on account of reworking/revision of designs and
drawings and the same was duly accepted by the Respondent in its letter
dated 20th February 2008. Therefore, the learned Arbitrator ought to have
awarded the said fee at the rate of 10% and not 15%. The Counsel for the
Petitioner further submitted that the award under Sub Claim (c) of Claim 2 is
on account of enhancement /escalation in the form of cost index. In this
regard, he relied on Clause 17 of the agreement and urged that a perusal of
the Clause makes it evident that in case of preparations and designs and
drawings after five years from date of start of work, the fees shall be
calculated on the basis of revised average rates as may be mutually decided
between the parties on the basis of rise of building cost index approved by
CPWD during these five years. The cost index must be taken for these five
years only as specifically contemplated in the said Clause. Relying upon the
same, she also referred to Respondent‟s letter dated 15th January 2018,
where while proposing extension of time it was specifically stipulated as




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                            Page 20 of 29</span>
 under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     "In reference to the above-mentioned subject and the various
     meetings held with your goodself, for extension of the original
     agreement to Nov 2010 (which was signed on 10.11.2000) for
     next five years so that the works in question are got completed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">28. She argued that the aforesaid offer was accepted by the Respondent vide
it's letter dated 20th February 2008 and thus the Respondent is entitled to
payment at the cost index of 20.82 % and not 78.14 %. It was also argued
that the learned Arbitrator failed to appreciate that the project was delayed
on account of Respondent's own deliberate default in suspending the
issuance of any drawing during the pendency of the writ petition bearing No.
4978/2002. There was no stay on issuance of any drawing by the Court and
there was also no order or direction issued by the Petitioner suspending
issuance of drawings. Furthermore, if the above factor has to be taken into
account then it should be construed to be beyond the control of both the
parties and the Petitioner cannot be held liable to pay enhanced rates. The
structural drawings were not as per the BIS norms and no construction could
be carried out on the basis thereof. Delay was occasioned purely on account
of the Respondent's failure to maintain the height of the buildings and poor
design of basements and it cannot take advantage of its own delay and raise
a false claim. The alleged cost index claimed in bill No. 13 dated 23rd July
2014 on account of increased cost for increased area and revision was raised
belatedly. If the Respondent had raised the bill for increase in area in 7th bill
itself, no cost index would have been payable on the amount. Respondent
cannot claim cost index placing a premium on his own inaction.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                               Page 21 of 29</span>
<p id="p_40"> 29. With regard to the above noted objections, the contention of the learned
counsel for the Respondent is as follows:
</p><p id="p_41">a. As per earthquake code IS: 1893 in 2002, Respondent submitted the
structural, architectural and service drawings in accordance with the
communication dated 21st June 2013. However, since the earthquake code
was revised due to the Common Wealth Games, Respondent was directed to
revise the designs and drawing, which is evident from Petitioner's letter
dated 15th January 2008. The revision in the earthquake code resulted in
considerable increase in the area and also involved extensive re-working.
b. Based on the modified project, the cost calculation due to the increased
area and reworking of the drawing and designs is Rs. 75,04,576. On the said
amount, CPWD cost index has been added @ 96.8 % and on the total
amount, service tax has been claimed @ 12.36 %. Accordingly the net
amount payable is Rs. 1,65,94,455/- as claimed in the 13th bill.
c. In order to compute the percentage increase in CPWD building cost index
from 2006 to 2014 as 96.65 %, reliance has been placed on Clause 17 of the
agreement.
</p>

<p id="p_42">30. It was urged that the Petitioner has wrongly placed reliance on the letter
dated 15th January 2008 as the said letter was not binding on the parties and
also the increase of 10% as stated in the said letter was not final since the
said extra fees on the enhanced cost index was provided in the agreement.
The aforesaid 10% of the extra fees was in respect of the extended period
and not in respect of the extra work executed by the Respondent during the
extra period.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                              Page 22 of 29</span>
<p id="p_43"> 31. With regard to the finding of the learned Arbitrator to arrive at the price
index of 78.4%, the learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that since
the price indices as mentioned in the letter dated 15th January 2008 were for
past five years it could not have been taken into account for extra work and
the learned Arbitrator has rightly arrived at the figure of 78.4%.
</p>

<p id="p_44">Analysis
</p><p id="p_45">32. In so far as the challenge to the findings qua Claim No. 2 under the head
</p><p id="p_46">(a) enumerated above is concerned, the reasoning given in this order while
rejecting the objections with respect to Claim No. 1 would apply. Therefore,
the contest to sub-head (a) is rejected for the same reasons. The opposition
to award under sub-head (b) and (c) is on account of extra payment for
reworking of drawings. The findings of the Arbitrator on this point are as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">     "17. Whether the claimant is entitled to extra payment on account
     of revision of the designs and drawings already issued to
     conform to revised earthquake (seismic) IS Code which was
     revised in late 2002.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">     17.1 Claimant's contention is that as per clause 8 of the
     agreement it prepared designs and drawing in conformity with
     the latest earthquake code (IS:1893) as was in force at the time.
     But subsequently this code was revised in late 2002 with the
     result, the claimant had to revise these designs and drawing to
     conform to the revised code (IS: 1893-2002). The claimant is
     therefore entitled to extra payment on this account. Claimant
     relies on para 1 of its letter dated 21.06.2013 (C-96/Page-
     118/CD-2) which gives an account of the designs and drawings
     originally issued on 10.07.2001 to 01.11.2002 which were
     revised as per revised IS code.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">     17.2 Respondent's contention is that clause 3 of the agreement is
     very clear that the claimant was obligated to prepare design and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">O.M.P. (COMM) 98/2019                                                Page 23 of 29</span>
      drawings in conformity with the latest seismic code (earthquake
     code) and hence it is not entitled to extra payment on account of
     having to revise the design and drawings subsequently per
     revised IS code which was revised in late 2002.
     17.3 I have perused the relevant submissions of the parties and
     material on record. It is a matter of record that as per clause 8 of
     the agreement (page 121) the claimant was mandated to ensure
     that all the designs and drawings are made in conformity with the
     latest IS code, the relevant code here being IS:1893 which lays
     down the requirements to be fulfilled from earthquake
     consideration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">     17.4 In my view, the term 'latest', in the given context only
     means the latest IS code in force at the time the designs and
     drawings are prepared. It cannot be attributed an extended
     meaning to cover revision of the designs and drawings as per
     subsequent revision of code within the same fees. The contention
     of the respondent can therefore be accepted only to the extent
     that if the claimant had not prepared any designs and drawings
     upto the date of revision of code it was mandated to prepare the
     same as per the latest/revised IS code at no extra cost. But here
     the case is different.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">     17.5 Admittedly the claimant first prepared designs and drawing
     from 10.07.2001 upto 01.11.2002 (C-96) in conformity with the
     latest IS code in force during this period, thus fully satisfying the
     condition as per clause 8 of the agreement. But it had to revise
     the same when the said code was revised in late 2002.
     17.6 I am therefore of the view that the claimant is entitled to
     extra payment for reworking/revision of designs and drawings
     already issued to bring the same in conformity with the IS: 1893
     which was revised in late 2002."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">33. The aforesaid reasoning shows that the Arbitrator took into consideration
facts and the evidence brought on record by the parties and arrived at a
finding of fact that the completion of the work under the Contract was
delayed due to fault / breaches attributable to the Petitioner . This finding of
fact cannot be assailed or scrutinized under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_19">Section 34</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_48"> Respondent's claim for extra payment for revision of the designs and
drawings arose due to change in the requirements and circumstances in the
wake of Commonwealth Games.             The Arbitrator has held that the
Respondent had to revise drawings due to revision in earthquake code in
2002. It has also been held that there is no documentary evidence produced
by the Petitioner to show that Common Wealth Games Committee had
issued such directions or regulations prior to the execution of the
Agreement. Respondent had to assimilate the revised code and carry out the
necessary modifications as required by the Petitioner. In the letter dated 25th
March 2009, Petitioner agreed to pay extra amount for the change in the
drawings. Upto that stage, Respondent had already issued drawings and
thus had to rework the same. Respondent also had to suspend issuance of the
drawings on account of an ongoing litigation which had directed the stay of
construction activities which continued upto 2007. Vide letter dated 15th
March 2008, Petitioner proposed to extend the agreement for five years and
pay extra amount at the rate of 10% together with enhancement in the cost
index, as the Respondent had to revise its drawings due to change in
earthquake code. Thus, Respondent is entitled to payment on account of
reworking of drawings and enhancement/escalation in the form of cost
index. The Petitioner‟s contention that the price indices mentioned in the
letter dated 15th January 2008 as 20.8 % should prevail and the Arbitrator
was not justified in awarding the same at the rate of 78.4% is misconceived.
The letter dated 15th January 2008 is reproduced herein below:

<p id="p_49">34. A perusal of the letter dated 15th January 2008 makes it clear that the
price indices mentioned in the aforesaid letter was for the past 5 years and
the same could not have been considered for the extra work.
</p>

<p id="p_50">35. During the Arbitration proceedings, the Respondent filed computation
for percentage increase in CPWD Building Cost Index from 2006 to 2014
which reflected a factor of 96.6%. On the strength of the above, Respondent
claimed enhancement in the form of cost index, relying on Clause 17 of the
Agreement, which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">     "The agreement will be in force for a period of 6 years from the
     date of signing. In case, the implementation of the project
     extends beyond 5 years from the date of agreement and the
     consultant is called upon to carry out any additional work of
     planning, designing and preparation of drawings of any portions
     of the portions of the work, and for which the consultant has not
     been responsible for delay, and such designs and drawings are
     actually prepared after five years, the fees payable shall be

      five years. Regarding the quantum of planning and designing
     work actually carried out after the expiry of five years, the
     decision of the chief Architect shall be final and binding in all
     respect."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">36. The Petitioner did not file a response to the said calculations. The
Arbitrator averaged the figures and awarded a factor 78.4%. Since the delay
in completion of the work has been held to be attributable to the Petitioner,
the escalation awarded by the Arbitrator is reasonable. The price indices
mentioned in the letter, could not have been considered by the Arbitrator, for
the extra work done by the Respondent. Petitioner's contention that the price
indices mentioned in the letter dated 15th January 2008 should have
prevailed is without any merit and the same is rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_52">37. The findings of the Tribunal for sub head (d)-regarding the
reimbursement of service tax are upheld for the reasons and analysis given
qua Claim No. 1.
</p>

<p id="p_53">38. The learned Arbitrator has awarded pendente lite interest at the rate of
9% and future interest at the rate of 12%. The legal position regarding
award of interest is well settled. Interest is granted by way of compensation
to a party as a consequence of default or a breach by the other. The contract
was delayed due to breaches on the part of the Petitioner and therefore the
Arbitrator has rightly awarded the reasonable interest on the amounts held to
be due and payable to the Respondent. The sum awarded by the learned
Arbitrator has been upheld and thus there is no justification to deny the
Respondent the interest thereon which is reasonable and does not call for

costs and the pending application is disposed of.
