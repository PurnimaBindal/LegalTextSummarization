Judgement on                        : 16th July, 2015.

Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, J. :-


</pre><p id="p_1">       This first miscellaneous appeal is directed against an order passed by the Learned

Additional District Judge, 13th Court at Alipore on 28th May, 2015 in Title Suit No.1 of 2015 at

the instance of the defendant No. 1/appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       In fact, by the impugned order, two applications were disposed of by the Learned Trial

Judge. One of such applications was filed by the defendant No.1/appellant for rejection of the

plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned Trial Judge held that
 the defendant's said application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is

misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        Hence, the said application was rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        However, the other application filed by the plaintiff for injunction under Order 39 Rule 1

and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure was allowed by the learned Trial Judge. By the said order

temporary injunction was passed restraining the defendant No.1 from displaying and/or playing

and/or telecasting and/or airing the impugned advertisement for "MOOV" with the frames

showing the product of the plaintiff ( ZANDU BALM) in its unique shape, colour and design

alongwith "MOOV" and the words "Jisme hai promukh balm ke mukable do guna jaida active

ingredients", till the disposal of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        In the present appeal, the legality and/or propriety of the order of injunction which was

passed by the learned Trial Judge as mentioned above is under challenge before us.               The

appellant has also filed a revisional application challenging the other part of the impugned order

by which the application filed by the defendant No.1/appellant for rejection of the plaint under

Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure was rejected. The said revisional application is

not before us. However, since the defendant/appellant contested the plaintiff's application for

temporary injunction by filing affidavit, raising a question regarding maintainability of the suit on

identical grounds made out by it in its application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil

Procedure and further since fate of the injunction proceeding, to some extent, is dependent upon

the defendant's said application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, this Court

thought that both the appeals and the revisional application should be heard by a common

Bench so that possibility of conflict of decision may be avoided. Accordingly a suggestion was

given to the learned Counsel appearing for the parties for approaching the Hon'ble Chief Justice

for getting all these matters assigned to a common Bench so that both the appeal and the

revisional application can be decided by a common Bench. Finally Mr. Lall, learned Counsel,

appearing for the appellant refused to accept such suggestion of the Court as according to him

the process for assignment of these two matters to a common Court may cause some delay in

deciding the present appeal and as such he invited this Court to dispose of the present appeal by
 concentrating on the legality of the order passed on the injunction application filed by the

plaintiff without entering into the objection raised by the defendant/appellant regarding

maintainability of the said suit, which his client intends to thrash out exhaustively       in the

revisional application pending before the other Bench separately. Under such circumstances we

felt that presently we need not discuss the maintainability of the present suit though such an

objection is raised by the defendant/appellant in its affidavit filed in connection with the

injunction proceeding. We thus, concentrate on the legality of the injunction order passed by the

learned Trial Judge which is impugned in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         Before entering into the merit of this injunction order we like to mention here that it is

rightly pointed out by Mr. Lall, Learned Advocate for the appellant, that the learned Trial Judge,

while passing the impugned order of temporary injunction, did not at all consider the contention

of the defendant/appellant made out in its affidavit filed against the plaintiff's application for

injunction before the learned Trial Court. On perusal of the impugned order we find that the

learned Trial Judge in fact, was considering as to whether in the absence of the

defendant/appellant, any ad interim order of injunction could be passed in the said suit or not.

That may be the reason for which the learned Trial Judge         did not consider the defendant's

objection filed against the plaintiff's application for injunction. Though the learned Trial Judge

came to a conclusion that this was a fit case where some ad interim order of injunction was

required to be passed but in fact, the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction was

disposed of by the learned Trial Judge by granting temporary injunction which is impugned in

this appeal. This in our view is not a mere irregularity but a patent illegality in the impugned

order.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         Mr. Chatterjee, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the plaintiff/respondent informs us

that, as a matter of fact, both the said applications i.e., application filed by the defendant for

rejection of the plaint and the application for injunction filed by the plaintiff were fixed for

hearing on 28th May, 2015. Affidavits were exchanged between the parties in connection with

both the proceedings. But since the learned lawyer representing the defendant No.1 refused to

participate in the injunction proceeding though he participated in the hearing of the dependant's
 application for rejection of plaint, the learned Trial Judge while, disposing of the plaintiff's

application for temporary injunction, probably did not consider the affidavit-in-opposition filed by

the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction.

</p><p id="p_8">         It is no doubt true that the Court was not required to consider the affidavit filed by the

defendant No.1 in connection with the plaintiff's application for injunction and the written

submission submitted by the defendant's lawyers, as the defendant did not participate in the

hearing of the injunction proceeding. As such the learned Trial Judge probably cannot be

accused for not dealing with the contention raised by the defendant/appellant in its affidavits

filed in connection with the injunction proceeding and/or the        written submission which was

submitted before the Trial Court by the learned lawyer of the defendant dealing with the merit of

the plaintiff's application for injunction. However, we have no hesitation to hold that under such

circumstances the learned Trial Court, instead of disposing of the plaintiff's application for

temporary injunction as a whole, could have passed an ad interim order of injunction by

deferring the hearing of the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction, as the learned

advocate appearing for the defendant expressed his inability to conduct hearing of the plaintiff's

application for temporary injunction in the absence of the Senior Advocate.

</p><p id="p_9">         Be that as it may since affidavits have already been exchanged between the parties, we

were invited by the learned Counsel appearing for the parties to consider the pleadings of the

respective parties filed in connection with the temporary injunction proceeding and dispose of the

plaintiff's application for temporary injunction on its merit. Accordingly, instead of remanding

the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction back to the learned Trial Judge for

reconsideration, we have considered the merit of the plaintiff's application for temporary

injunction in the light of the pleadings of the respective parties filed before the learned Trial

Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         Let us now consider the merit of the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction in the

facts of the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         Prior to the filing of the present suit, the plaintiff filed another suit in the Court of the

learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), 4th Court being Suit No.23783 of 2014 under the common
 law of tort for disparagement.   By an ad interim order passed in the said suit, telecasting of

television commercial of "MOOV" was suspended and a receiver was also appointed by an ad

interim order for taking custody of the device used for the disputed advertisement and publicity

of '"MOOV". When those two applications were posted for final hearing, the defendant/appellant

filed two applications; one under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the other

under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. According to the defendant since the suit

was framed under the scheme of <a href="/doc/571997/" id="a_1">Section 29(8)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, such a suit is not

maintainable before the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division) in view of the provision

contained in <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_2">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 which provides that such a suit for

infringement of trade mark is not entertainable by any other Court inferior to a District Court

having jurisdiction to try such suit.   Without disposing of those two applications filed by the

defendant, the learned Trial Judge, extended the interim order passed earlier and thus, the ad

interim injunction and/or order of appointment of ad interim receiver were extended.

</p><p id="p_12">       Feeling aggrieved by the said order passed by the learned Trial Judge, a Miscellaneous

Appeal was filed before this Hon'ble Court. While disposing of the said Miscellaneous Appeal, this

Hon'ble Court after considering the pleadings of the plaintiff formed a prima facie opinion that

the said suit as it was framed indicates that the plaintiff in fact, sued the defendant for

infringement of trademark under the scheme of <a href="/doc/571997/" id="a_3">Section 29(8)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and

thus, the said Bench after expressing its prima facie doubt about the maintainability of such a

suit before the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division),     vacated the order of ad interim

injunction and the order of ad interim receiver passed by the learned Trial Judge and directed

the learned Trial Court to decide the defendant's application under Order 7 Rule 10 and Order 7

Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure finally. Before the defendant's those two applications were

finally disposed of, the plaintiff herein filed an application before the learned Trial Judge for

permitting the plaintiff to withdraw the said suit for suing afresh before the competent Court and

such leave having been granted by the learned Trial Judge on 26th February, 2015, the instant

suit was filed for infringement of trademark and disparagement under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_4">Section 29</a> read with

<a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_5">Section 134</a> and <a href="/doc/114856/" id="a_6">135</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 and for infringement of Copyright under
 <a href="/doc/1520267/" id="a_8">Section 55</a> and <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_9">62</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, before the Court of the learned District Judge at

Alipore which was subsequently transferred to the Court of 13th Additional District Judge at

Alipore.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">        In this background, let us now narrate briefly the cause of action pleaded

by the plaintiff in the plaint of the present suit. The plaintiff and the defendant

No.1 are business competitors. Both of them produce and sell ayurvedic remedy

for headache, backache and cold. The plaintiff's product is manufactured and

marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU".                        The defendant's

product is manufactured and marketed under the trade name "MOOV".                         The

plaintiff started manufacturing its product for providing relief for headache,

backache and cold in the year 1935 after making extensive research and

development work and since then it has been marketing its product not only in

India but also in several other countries. The product of the plaintiff i.e., "ZANDU

BALM"/ "ZANDU" is sold in a distinctive packaging being predominantly green in

colour with combination of white.            The green and white colour scheme is

identified with the plaintiff's product manufactured and marketed under the

trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU". The package, colour combination of the

container of the plaintiff's product is registered under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_10">Trade Marks Act</a>,

1999.      The package and the original artistic work of the plaintiff's product

marketed under the name "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" is also registered under the

<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_11">Copyright Act</a>, 1957. Any adaptation and/or slavish imitation of the plaintiff's

Copyright and/or trademark under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_12">Copyright Act</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_13">Trade Marks Act</a> is

prohibited. The bottle shape and the configuration of the bottle of the plaintiff's
 product is also registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_14">Designs Act</a>, 2000. The plaintiff, thus, has

taken all possible measures so that the goodwill of its Trademark and/or

Copyright is not infringed by any of its competitors in the same business field.

As per the report of A C Nielsen, the products sold under the trade mark

"ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" contributes 44.3% of balm sub-segment (by Value

Market Share) of rubefacient category for the period October 2013 to September,

2014 (All India Urban &amp; Rural). Thus, the plaintiff is accepted as the leading

producer of balm and its product is bought by the majority of the consumers of

the balm sub-segment.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       On or about 11th November, 2014, the plaintiff came to know from its various marketing

agents, customers and trade associates that the defendant No.1 had launched a new TV

commercial for promotion and sale of its product "MOOV". Such TV Commercial is being aired

in the channel "Colors" owned by the defendant No.2. The frame of the TV Commercial is as

follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">       "The TV commercial opens with a lady entering into the lawn of her neighbour. The lady

is seen holding a ball while playing with her husband and kid and in the voiceover it is being said

that "parivar ki ek hi reed ki haddi hoti hain". In the next frame it is shown that the lady while

playing with her kid is holding her back and the voiceover says "Kitna bhi sata lo". Then it is

shown that the husband while coming down the stairs loses his balance and is about to fall and

the lady rescues him and the voiceover says "hasi khusi jhel hi leti hai". Then the lady is shown

arranging all her luggage and while doing so she feels an intense pain in the back and screams

with backache and the voiceover says "par yeh pahaad nahi pith hain ...... Aaah .... Dukh bhi

jati". In the next shot it is shown that the husband is holding a Moov pack and a balm and asks

her for her choice and the lady points at Moov for her backache and the voiceover says "Isliye

peeth dard ke liye ...... yeh bharosa karti hain Moov pe". Thereafter it is being shown that the
 husband is applying "MOOV" on the lady and massages her back and "2X" on the screen appears

prominently and the voiceover says "Jismein hai pramukh balm ke mukable do guna Zyada

active ingredients". As a result she is relieved of pain and the family goes for a drive at the end

with the jingle of "MOOV" playing. The storyboard of the "MOOV" TV Commercial shown in the

advertisement is impugned in the said suit. According to the plaintiff, by airing the impugned

advertisement, the defendant purported to intentionally cast an aspersion on the plaintiff's

product, manufactured and marketed under the trade name "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" and/or

its merchandise, and thereby severely affecting the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff's

product manufactured and marketed under the Trade Mark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU".                  The

plaintiff further alleges that while airing the impugned advertisement, the husband holds a

"MOOV" pack and a bottle having the shape and configuration of the plaintiff's bottle having a

direct association and/or connection with the plaintiff's registered Trade Mark "ZANDU BALM"/

"ZANDU" and asks his wife for her choice. The lady points towards "MOOV" for her backache.

Then the husband massages        "MOOV" gel on her back and the voiceover says "Jismein hai

pramukh balm ke mukable do guna Zyada active ingredients". Immediate after rubbing and/or

massaging "MOOV" on the back of the lady, she got relief and then the family goes for a drive

happily. At the end, the voiceover says that " Moov Aaaha se Aahatak"

</p><p id="p_18">       According to the plaintiff, by airing the said advertisement the following message was

sent to the public:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (a) The product manufactured and marketed by the plaintiff under the

           trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" is less effective in providing effective

           relief from backache than the defendant's product "MOOV" and has been

           shown in bad light.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (b) The defendant No.1's product is twice as effective as that of the plaintiff's

           product manufactured and marketed under the trade mark "ZANDU

           BALM"/ "ZANDU" because it contains double the amount of active

           ingredients than that of the plaintiff's;
</blockquote><p id="p_19"> (c) In a given situation the product of the plaintiff manufactured and

   marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" is unable to give

   relief from pain to a person while on the other hand "MOOV" does the same

   easily and effectively. Such purported claim of the defendant is actuated

   by malice.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(d) The plaintiff's products manufactured and marketed under the trademark

   "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" is bad and is inferior in quality as compared to

   "MOOV" and as such is not a proper choice for countering backache.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(e) The product manufactured and marketed under the trademark "ZANDU

   BALM"/ "ZANDU" by the plaintiff is neither effective nor efficient and does

   not provide useful solution which is easily provided by "MOOV".
</p>
<p id="p_22">(f) The product manufactured and marketed under the trademark "ZANDU

   BALM"/ "ZANDU" is not a proper solution for countering backache and the

   same has been proved by comparing the effectiveness of the plaintiff's

   products with the defendants' product "MOOV".
</p>
<p id="p_23">(g) No useful purpose would be served by application of the product of the

   plaintiff under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" during backache

   and other pain and the same can only be cured by use and application of

   "MOOV"
</p>
<p id="p_24">(h) The bottle bearing green and white get up is shown in the advertisement

   which is intended and meant to be identified as the plaintiff's product,

   manufactured and marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/

   "ZANDU" and by portraying such image in the advertisement of the

   defendant and by demonstrating that the product is not useful in curing of

   back pain and other diseases, the plaintiff's product under the trademark

   "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" has been shown in bad light and the said

   predict has been ridiculed, defamed and disparaged and such act on the
             part of the defendants amounts to slander of the goods of the plaintiff,

            which is not permissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

        The plaintiff thus claims that the act of airing the impugned advertisement by the

defendant has been actuated by malice           and and/or malicious falsehood and/or injurious

falsehood. The false and misleading statement in the voiceover causes loss and damage to the

plaintiff and its goods marketed under the trade mark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU".                          The

impugned advertisement is being telecast all over India regularly and continuously and thus, the

defendant No.1 has been wrongfully            denigrating the product of the plaintiff by way of

continuously airing of the said advertisement in TV. Accordingly the instant suit was filed on the

basis of the resumption of the impugned advertisement by the defendant after withdrawal of the

earlier suit which according to the plaintiff gave fresh right to the plaintiff for filing a fresh suit on

the renewed cause of action. Accordingly, this suit for infringement as well as disparagement of

the plaintiff's product was filed against the defendant praying for perpetual injunction for

restraining the defendant and/or their men and agents from causing infringement of the

registered trade mark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" of the plaintiff by displaying and/or playing

and/or distributing and/or telecasting and/or displaying the impugned advertisement developed

by the defendant for "Moov", in any manner whatsoever and other advertisement which purports

to disparage and/or defame the plaintiff and/or its product manufactured and marketed under

the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" and/or otherwise in any manner whatsoever. Other

incidental reliefs by way of prohibitory injunction in different forms have also been prayed for in

the said suit. Mandatory order of injunction has also been sought for against the defendant for

destruction of all electronic media CDs, DVDs, templates, posters, articles, device containing the

impugned advertisement developed by the defendant for "MOOV", as shown in the storyboard

annexed to the plaint. An enquiry into the loss and damages including special damages suffered

by the plaintiff for the act of disparagement and/or defamation and/or slander and/or libel

committed by the defendant in airing the impugned advertisement was also sought for with a
 prayer for passing a decree for such sum as may be found to be payable to the plaintiff upon such

enquiry been made.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       In such a suit the plaintiff filed an application for temporary injunction claiming identical

interim injunction so that the defendant cannot air the impugned advertisement during the

pendency of the suit. Ad interim relief in similar form was also prayed by the plaintiff in the said

suit. The defendant No.1 filed affidavit-in-opposition in connection with the plaintiff's application

for injunction denying the material allegations made out by the plaintiff in its said application.

Though an impression was sought to be given by the said defendant in the said affidavit that the

defendant No.1 has not disparaged and/or denigrated the plaintiff's product manufactured and

marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" and/or the defendant's copyright over

its packaging and/or artistic work as the defendant has not displayed either the packaging

and/or artistic work which were registered by the plaintiff under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_15">Trade Marks Act</a> and/or

<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_16">Copyright Act</a> in course of airing the said advertisement, but if the entire affidavit of the

defendant is read particularly with reference to the averment made by it in paragraph 22 (XL),

then it goes without saying that while airing the impugned advertisement the defendant has

shown the design of the bottle which is exactly identical to the shape and colour of the bottle of

the plaintiff which is registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_17">Designs Act</a>, 2000. If the sub-paragraphs of the said

paragraph are read minutely then it will appear that in fact, both the container "MOOV" and the

plaintiff's registered designed bottle were shown in the advertisement for the purpose of making a

comparison of the product     of the defendant No.1 with the plaintiff's product for conveying a

message to the public that the "MOOV" being the product of the defendant No.1 is much more

effective than the plaintiff's product as it contains double the active ingredients than that of the

plaintiff's product, which according to the said defendant was done without disparaging and/or

denigrating    the plaintiff's product.   A comparative chart     about the ingredients     used for

production of the plaintiff's product and that of the defendant's product has also been mentioned

in paragraph 16 of the said affidavit wherein it is mentioned that the plaintiff's product contains

only two ingredients, namely, MenthaSsp-Satva and Gaultheria Fragrantissima OL while in the
 defendants product four ingredients, namely, Mentha Virdis, Gaultheria Gragrantissima OL,

Pinus Roxburghiand and Eucalyptus Globulus are used.
</p>
<p id="p_27">        The said defendant thus claimed that since number of active ingredients which are used

in the its product are double the number of ingredients used in the plaintiff's product, the

defendant's product is much more effective in relieving pain quickly.     Thus, according to the

defendant, the impugned advertisement is not disparaging at all as the claims made in the said

advertisement are truthful and permissible under law. The defendant, thus, claims that such

truthful comparison is protected under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_18">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution as well as <a href="/doc/571997/" id="a_19">Section

29(8)</a> and <a href="/doc/1863142/" id="a_20">Section 30(1)</a> of the Trade Marks Act 1999. The defendant categorically denied that the

impugned advertisement developed by the defendant No.1 shows that the intent of the

commercial, the manner of the commercial and the story of the commercial, the message sought

to be conveyed by the commercial speech at all aimed at disparaging, ridiculing and/or defaming

the product of the plaintiff manufactured and/or marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/

"ZANDU". The defendant also denied that by airing such advertisement, the plaintiff's goodwill

and/or reputation has been injured in any manner whatsoever and as such it claims the plaintiff

is not entitled to any damages and /or special damages and/or other reliefs which the plaintiff

has claimed by way of injunction in the said suit. The dependant thus, prayed for dismissal of the

plaintiff's application for temporary injunction.

<p id="p_28">        Mr. Lall, learned counsel appearing for the dependant No.1 /appellant relied upon the

following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as well as of different High Courts to support

his submission that the comparison of two products which is done               in the impugned

advertisement does not cross the permissible boundary of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_21">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of

India and <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_22">Section 30</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.

        Besides citing the aforesaid decisions, Mr. Lall, has also drawn our attention to the

provision contained in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_27">Article 19(1)    (a)</a> and <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_28">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India and the

provision contained in <a href="/doc/571997/" id="a_29">Section 29(8)</a> and Section 30 of the Trademark Act, 1990 to support his

submission that honest comparison of truthful facts for promotion of one's products through

advertisement is permissible inasmuch as such comparison is beneficial for the public at large as

it helps them to select which one out of those products is more acceptable by the public. He

contended that since the freedom of commercial speech is a fundamental right guaranteed under

<a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_30">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India, exercise of such right cannot be prevented by way of

injunction so long as it does not transgress its permissible limit as provided under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_31">Article 19 (1)(a)</a>

of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        He further contended that though the shape of the plaintiff's goods could have been

registered under Trade Mark Act and/or the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_32">Copyright Act</a> but the plaintiff instead of registering

the shape of its product under any one of those two Acts, registered the packaging, colour

combination and the artistic mark under these two Acts. According to him, since the shape of the

plaintiff's product is not registered under any of the said Acts, the plaintiff cannot complain of

infringement of the plaintiff's trademark and copyright ownership for using a bottle of like design

of the plaintiff.   By referring to the pleadings of the plaintiff as well as the certificates of

registration which are annexed to the plaint, Mr. Lall pointed out that only the packaging and or

the colour combination and/or the artistic mark of "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" were registered

under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_33">Trade Marks Act</a>, and/or the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_34">Copyright Act</a>.          According to him, since     neither the

packaging of the plaintiff's product which was registered under the Trademarks Act nor the

artistic mark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" over which the plaintiff is claiming its ownership under

the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_35">Copyright Act</a>, has been shown in the advertisement which was aired by the defendant No. 1,

the plaintiff cannot complain of infringement of its Trademark and/or Copyright as such
 advertisement was aired for promoting its product "MOOV" by making honest and truthful

comparison of its product with the product of the other leading company without disparaging

and/or denigrating that product. He thus, argued that when the plaintiff has failed to prove that

airing of such advertisement by the defendant No. 1 was actuated by malice to denigrate and/or

disparage plaintiff's product and/or the plaintiff's trademark, according to him, in the present set

of facts no relief can be granted to the plaintiff even by interim measure during the pendency of

the suit. He thus invited this Court to vacate the interim order passed by the learned Trial Judge.

</p><p id="p_34">       Mr. Chatterjee, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the plaintiff/respondent No. 1

refuted such submission of Mr. Lall by submitting that undisputedly the defendant No. 1, while

airing the impugned advertisement made a comparison of its product "MOOV" with the product of

plaintiff "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" for sending a message to the public at large that the product

of the defendant No. 1 "MOOV" is much more effective than the plaintiff's product as it contains

twice the number of active ingredients than that of the plaintiff's product. Mr. Chatterjee, without

disputing the proposition of law that under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_36">Article 19 (1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India, freedom

of commercial speech is guaranteed as a Fundamental Right of the citizen, contended that <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_37">Article

19(1)</a> does not confer unfettered freedom of commercial speech, as exercise of such Fundamental

Right is controlled by <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_38">Article 19 (2)</a> of the Constitution of India. He further submits that fair and

truthful comparison between two products is permissible under <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_39">Section 30</a> of the Trade Marks

Act but such comparison should not be actuated by malice for conveying the message to the

public that the product of the other company is not at all effective and should be discarded. He

contended that if it is found that the comparison between two products is unfair and not truthful

then such comparison should be stopped by way of injunction to prevent conveying a wrong

message to the public and unless it is so done the public will be in a dilemma to select the best

amongst those two comparable units shown in the advertisement. By showing the photographs

and/or the video of the TV commercial, Mr. Chatterjee tried to impress upon us that the bottle

which was displayed by the husband in his left hand is exactly identical with the bottle design of

the product of the plaintiff, registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_40">Design Act</a>, 2000. He thus argued by referring

to the pleadings of the defendant that in view of the stand taken by the defendant in its said
 affidavit, the defendant most probably can not deny that while airing the said advertisement the

plaintiff's product was compared with the product of the defendant No. 1 in order to promote the

sale of the defendant's product by conveying a message to the public that the defendant's

product is much more effective than the plaintiff's product, as the defendant's product contains

double the number of ingredients than that of the plaintiff's product.

</p><p id="p_35">       Mr. Chatterjee further submits that though while airing this advertisement it is mentioned

in the script that "do guna number of active ingredients" are used in the defendant's product than

that of the plaintiff's product but in the voiceover "double the number of active ingredients" was

not mentioned. Mr. Chatterjee further submitted that for establishing that the defendant made

fair comparison on truthful basis, the defendant must prove that in fact, the additional

ingredients which are used for production of the defendant's product, are really active ingredients

which are more effective for reducing headache, backache or cold rapidly than that of the

plaintiff's product or alternatively for not using those two additional ingredients in the plaintiff's

product, the plaintiff's product became ineffective in reducing headache, backache and cold.

</p><p id="p_36">       He thus contended that unless the defendant succeeds in proving that these two

additional ingredients which are used in the defendant's product are really active ingredients for

giving quick relief of pain, the comparison which the defendant made in the said advertisement

cannot be accepted as a fair and truthful comparison. He thus, concluded by submitting that if a

comparison is not fair and truthful and is found to have been actuated by malice to denigrate and

disparage the product of the plaintiff then certainly injunction should be passed. Mr. Chatterjee

ultimately supports the order of injunction, passed by the learned Trial Judge by relying upon the

decision of this Hon'ble Court in the case of Hindusthan Unilever Ltd. Reckitt Benckiser (India)

Ltd. reported in 2014(2) CHN (CAL) 1 which was also affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench of

this Hon'ble Court in the case of <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_41">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Hindusthan Unilever          Ltd</a>.

reported in 2014 CHN (CAL) 5277. He has also relied upon a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_42">Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. &amp; Anr. V. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors</a>. reported

in (2004)3 SCC 90 wherein it was held that in case of infringement, either of trademark or of
 copyright, normally an injunction must follow, as grant of injunction becomes necessary when it

prima facie appears that the adaptation of the mark was itself dishonest.

</p><p id="p_37">       Relying upon the said decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court Mr. Chatterjee invited us not

to interfere with the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_38">       Let us now consider the submissions of the learned Counsel of the respective parties in

the facts of the instant case. Reading the pleadings of the respective parties, particularly the

averments made by the defendant No.1 in its affidavit in paragraph 22(XL), we have no hesitation

to hold that the plaintiff's product was shown while airing the said advertisement by the

defendant No.1 for comparing its product with the plaintiff's product to send a message to the

public that its product is much more effective than the plaintiff's product as the defendant's

product contains twice the number of active ingredients than that of the plaintiff's product and as

such the plaintiff's product is acceptable as a quick pain reliever.

</p><p id="p_39">       Undisputedly the plaintiff's product is manufactured and marketed under Trademark

"ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" its packaging colour combination and its artistic work "ZANDU

BALM"/ "ZANDU" are also registered under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_43">Copyright Act</a>. The design of the bottle shape

and the colour combination i.e., predominantly green with a white border with green cap has also

been registered under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_44">Designs Act</a>. It clearly appears from the affidavit filed by the defendant

that the defendant No.1 by airing the said advertisement was seeking to promote its product

admittedly by making a comparison of its own product "MOOV" with the plaintiff's product which

is manufactured and marketed under the trademark "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU", for conveying a

message to the public that its product is much more effective than the product of the plaintiff as

it contains twice more active ingredients than that of the plaintiff's product.

</p><p id="p_40">       Let us now examine as to whether exercise of such freedom of "commercial speech" has

transgressed the border line of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_45">Article 19(1) (a</a>), of the Constitution in the light of the provision

contained in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_46">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_47">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution of India no doubt guarantees the freedom of commercial

speech but exercise of such Fundamental Right              guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_48">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the

Constitution of India is subject to the limitation prescribed under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_49">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution
 of India.   While considering the case of Tata Press Television Nigam Ltd. &amp; Ors. (supra), the

Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the aforesaid provisions of the Constitution of Indian and held

as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_42">Paragraph 22

        "Advertising as a "commercial speech" has two facets. Advertising which is no

        more than a commercial transaction      nonetheless dissemination of information

        regarding the product advertised. Public at large is benefited by the information

        made available through the advertisement in a democratic economy tree. How of

        commercial information      is indispensable.     There cannot be honest and

        economical marketing by the public at large without being educated by the

        information disseminated through advertisement.      The economic system      in a

        democracy would be handicapped without there being freedom of "commercial

        speech" in rotation to the publication and circulation of newspapers, this Court in

        Indian Express Newspaper's Case MANU/SC/0340/1984: [1986) 159 ITR

        856(SC)   Sakal Paper's case MANU/SC/0090/1961: [ 1962] 3 SCR 842 and

        Bennet Coleman's Case MANU/SC/0038/1972: [1973] 2 SCR 757 has

        authoritatively held that any restraint of curtailment of advertisement would

        affect the Fundamental Right under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_50">Article 19(1) (a)</a> on the aspects of

        propagation, publication and circulation".
</p>
<p id="p_43">

Paragraph 23

        Examined from another angle, the public at large has a right to receive the

        "commercial speech". <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_51">Article 19(1) (a)</a> not only guarantees freedom of speech and

        expression, it also protects the rights of an individual to listen, read and receive

        the said speech. So far as the economic needs of a citizen are concerned, their

        fulfilment as to be guided by the 'information disseminated through the

        advertisements. The protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_52">Article 19(1) (a)</a> is available to the speaker as
         well as the recipient of the speech. The recipient of "commercial speech" may be

        having much deeper interest in the advertisement that the businessman who is

        behind the publication. An advertisement giving information regarding a life

        saving drug may be of much more importance to general public to the advertiser

        who may be having purely a trade consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_44">Paragraph 24.
</p>
<p id="p_45">            We therefore, hold that "commercial speech" is a part of the freedom of speech

        and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_53">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution.



Paragraph 27.

<p id="p_46">            Right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_54">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of

</p><p id="p_47">        -In paragraph 17 of the said judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated as

<p id="p_48">Paragraph 17

        "Unlike the First Amendment under the United States Constitution, our constitution

        itself    lays down in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_56">Article 19(2)</a> the restrictions which can be       imposed on

Ltd. v. Jyothi Laboratories Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. (supra) held by referring to the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Tata Press Ltd. V. Manager Television Nigam Ltd reported in AIR 1995 SC

2438 that Constitution Guarantees the Fundamental Right to freedom of "commercial speech"

but the Right to Freedom of Speech is not an unrestricted one as it is controlled by <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_60">Article 19(2)</a>
 of the Constitution. It was held therein that using words with the knowledge that the words are

false or inaccurate is evidence of malice. While interpreting the provision contained in <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_61">Section

30</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 a learned Single Judge of this Hon'ble Court in his judgment

delivered in the Hindusthan Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. reported in 2014(2) CHN (CAL)1 held

as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_50">Paragraph 58

        "A trader is permitted to compare his goods with those of another trader. He can

       make this comparison by highlighting the qualities and efficaciousness of his goods

       without stating or    commenting on the qualities and efficaciousness of his rival's

       goods. Take the example of Reckitt lauding its product, Dettol and at the same time

       showing the mark of the product VIM in the advertisement without making any

       comment on it. They are permitted to do so (See Timothy White vs. Gustav Mellin

       and <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_62">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. vs. M.P. Ramchandran &amp; Anr</a>. reported in 1999

       (19) PTC 741. See also the case of <a href="/doc/83844391/" id="a_63">Heinz India vs. Glaxo Smithkline</a> reported in

       2009 (2) CHN 179)".
</p>
<p id="p_51">Paragraph 59

       "This is a kind of comparative advertisement conceptualised in <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_64">section 30</a> of the

       Trade Marks Act, 1999. But the provision warns that such depiction shall not, inter

       alia, be unfair or detrimental to the "repute" of the trademark. (See Lorreal SA vs.

       Belhre NV [2010] RPC 23) in other words the reputation of the goods cannot be

       lowered. Moreover the use of the mark has to be honest. (See 307 Barclays Bank

       Pic vs. RBS Advanta reported in [1996] R.P.C 307)".
</p>
<p id="p_52">Paragraph 63

       Hence, a trader should not be permitted to advertise facts, data, figures, deficiencies

       etc.    of the products of another, especially a rival, directly or indirectly by an

       innuendo. This is so, because, one must presume a constant bias in the mind of such

       a trader towards his rival. When one presumes this constant bias, one would expect
        that the representations that are made, seriously about a rival's product are bound to

       be false, misleading, unfair or deceptive. This is more so because one is not in a

       proper position to make an impartial appraisal of a rival's product.




Paragraph 64

        Madan B. Lokur, J in <a href="/doc/1357815/" id="a_65">Dabur India Ltd. vs. Wipro Limited</a> reported in 2006(32) PTC

       677 (Del) accepted the proposition that if a trader claimed his product to be superior

       directly or indirectly he had to claim his rival's product to be inferior. But it is the

       degree of defamation which mattered.       The person    aggrieved should not be too

       sensitive in these matters. This decision is about puff tolerance levels being within

       reasonable limits.
</p>
<p id="p_53">

   The Division Bench of our High Court in the case of Hindusthan Unilever Ltd. Vs. Procter &amp;

Gamble home products Ltd. reported in 2010 (43) PTC 460 held that mere puffing of one's

product is not expected to be taken seriously by the public watching the advertisement but the

advertisement ceases to be a mere puff when the advertisement claims that what is stated in the

advertisement is correct.      It was further held therein that in such circumstances the

advertisement makes an assertion on behalf of the advertiser and does not remain mere puff.

</p><p id="p_54">       Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as well

as various High Courts including our High Court we will have to examine as to whether the

comparison which was made by the defendant No.1 between its own product "Moov" and the

plaintiff's product which is manufactured and marketed under the trademark under the

trademark of "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU"              is a fair and truthful comparison or not.         The

defendant in its affidavit in paragraph 16 thereof depicted a comparative chart regarding the

ingredients used in the defendant's product and the ingredients used in the plaintiff's product to

justify that such comparison was fair as it was made on truthful basis. Paragraph 16 of the said

affidavit is thus, set out hereunder.
</p><p id="p_55"> Paragraph 16

           "Furthermore the advertisement of the defendant contains truthful

           representation of facts. It is a fact that the defendants "MOOV" has twice

           the number of active ingredients when compare to other balms in particular

           the plaintiff's balm. The comparison of the active ingredients in to products

           is shown hereinbelow.

</pre><p id="p_57">On account of the above, the defendant claimed that the impugned advertisement is truthful and

this is protected by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_66">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_58">       We have mentioned above that though in the advertisement it is mentioned that the

defendant's product contains two times more the number of active ingredients versus leading

balm as per Nielsen o2, 2014 and a symbol is shown onscreen with "2X" in the middle and

"more active" on top and "ingredients" in the bottom, but in the voiceover the number of active

ingredients was not uttered while airing the said advertisement.          From the Video of the

commercial display we find that the husband arrived at the conclusion that "MOOV" is better

than the plaintiff's product "ZANDU BALM"/ "ZANDU" as it contains two times more active

ingredients than the plaintiff's product. It is thus clear that the said conclusion was drawn by

the husband as more active ingredients were used in the product of the defendant No.1 than that

of product of the plaintiff. It is not a case of the defendant that simply because some additional

ingredients are used in the defendant's product, the product of the defendant No.1 is more
 effective and active than the plaintiff's product in giving quick relief to pain. On the contrary, it

is the definite case of the defendant that the additional ingredients which are used in the

defendant's product are "active". We use the expression "active" in bold letter to lay emphasise

on it. The expression "active" carries some meaning which we cannot overlook. In our

understanding, "active" means effective ingredients which contribute largely in reducing pain

i.e., backache, quickly. Since the defendant claims that the additional ingredients are effective, it

is for the defendant to establish that those additional ingredients are really effective enough to

reduce pain quickly or alternatively         since those ingredients are not used in the plaintiff's

product, the plaintiff's product is comparatively less effective than the defendants product. No

expert opinion has been submitted by the defendant to substantiate its claim that the two

additional ingredients which are used in the product of the defendant No.1 are active ingredients

which really contribute in reducing the pain faster than the plaintiff's product. In the absence of

the expert opinion, it is not possible for the Court to come to the ultimate conclusion as to the

effectiveness of those two additional ingredients which are used in the product of the defendant

No.1. But considering the nature of those two additional ingredients which are tarpene oil and

eucalyptus oil we are of the prima facie view that those are not active ingredients which may

contribute to reducing pain and backache quickly. When the defendant No.1 states that

comparison which is made while airing the advertisement with the plaintiff's product is fair and

truthful, it was the duty of the defendant No.1 to substantiate such contention by submission of

expert's opinion, which the defendant has failed do.
</p>
<p id="p_59">       Since no prima facie proof regarding the truthfulness in such comparison is forthcoming

from the side of the defendant No. 1, we have no hesitation to hold that such comparison was in

effect, actuated by malice to disparage and/or denigrate the product of the plaintiff by conveying

a wrong and deceptible message to the public about the effectiveness of the plaintiff's product for

which the plaintiff's product should be discarded and the product of the defendant No.1 should

be preferred over the plaintiff's product.
</p>
<p id="p_60">       We have seen the storyboard and observed the video of such advertisement repeatedly.

We find that the comparison made between these two products is not fair and healthy, because
 correct information about those two products are not conveyed to the public by the impugned

advertisement. We may say that by making such comparison, a wrong information about the

usefulness of the ingredients of those two products in reducing pain, is sent to the public.


</p><p id="p_61">       In this context we are required to consider as to whether such comparison amounts to

disparaging the plaintiff's product and /or affects the reputation of its trademark and/or

copyright.      The   New   International    Webster's     Comprehensive      Dictionary       defines

"disparaging/disparagement" to mean "to speak of slightingly under value, to bring discredit or

dishonor upon, to act of depreciating, derogation, a condition of low estimation or valuation, a

reproach, disgrace, an unjust classing or comparison with that which is less worth and

degradation."

Ltd</a>. reported in 2014 (3) CHN (CAL) 527 held that certain factors have to be kept in mind while

deciding the question of disparagement. These factors are : (1) intent of the commercial (2)

manner of the commercial and (3) storyline of the commercial and the message sought to be

conveyed.
</p>
<p id="p_64">

</p><p id="p_65">       By applying these three tests, let us consider as to whether the plaintiff's trademark and/

or its product was disparaged by the impugned advertisement or not.


</p><p id="p_66">       We have already held that the comparison was               not fair and truthful, as the

advertisement sent a message to the public that the products of the defendant No.1 contains

twice the more number of active ingredients than the plaintiff's product without explaining even

in the voiceover as to whether those two additional ingredients are at all active in reducing pain

rapidly or not. The expression "active" used in the said advertisement cannot be lightly accepted.

Active has a meaning. It means effective. Does any one of these two additional ingredients play

any role in reducing pain effectively and rapidly. Excepting the mere assertion made in the

affidavit-in-opposition that these additional ingredients are active ingredients, which is denied by
 the plaintiff in its reply, the defendant has not produced any authentic opinion of any expert to

support such assertion in its pleadings. Simultaneously we find that an impression is sent to the

public that since these ingredients are absent in the plaintiff's product, it is less worthy than the

defendants' product and by showing that the woman in the commercial chooses the defendant's

product amounts to bringing discredit on the plaintiff's product.



</p><p id="p_67">        This unhealthy comparison, in our prima facie view, amounts to disparagement of the

plaintiff's product and its trademark and copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_68">

</p><p id="p_69">        Since a vast majority of the viewers of commercial advertisements aired very frequently

through electronic media, are influenced by visual advertisement, we feel that the learned Trial

Judge rightly passed the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_70">

</p><p id="p_71">        In our considered view, this type of comparison is not protected under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_68">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of

the Constitution of India as it surpasses the permissible limit. Here such advertisement is hit by

the restrictive clause under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_69">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. Similarly, we also cannot hold that

such comparison of the plaintiff's product with the product of the defendant's No.1 is fair and/or

is based on truth and thus, protected under <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_70">Section 30</a> of the Copyright Act. In the facts of the

circumstances as stated above we do not find any justifiable reason to interfere with the

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_72">

</p><p id="p_73">        We thus, confirm that the impugned order which was passed by the learned Trial Judge

will continue till the disposal of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_74">

</p><p id="p_75">        The appeal thus, stand dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_76">

        It is thus, made clear that while disposing of this appeal we have not entered into the

merit of the revisional application filed by the appellant for challenging the legality of the first
 part of the impugned order by which the plaintiff's application under order 7 Rule 11 of the code

of Civil Procedure was rejected.       The said revisional application thus, will be disposed of

independently without being influenced by the order passed hereinabove.

</p><p id="p_77">          The appeal is thus, disposed of.

expeditiously as possible

I agree

later

          After delivery of the judgment, the learned advocate appearing for the appellant prays for

stay of operation of the order passed by this Court today. Such prayer for stay is opposed by the

learned advocate appearing for the plaintiff/respondent. Since the injunction order is operating

against the defendant No.1/appellant since 28th May, 2015 uninterruptedly, this Court refuses

to allow the appellant's prayer for stay as grant of such stay will make the injunction order

ineffective and thereby the appellant will be permitted to resume telecasting of the impugned

advertisement which will cause injustice to the respondent.

<p id="p_79">          Since the appeal is disposed of in the manner as aforesaid, no further order need be

passed on the application being CAN 5406 of 2015.
