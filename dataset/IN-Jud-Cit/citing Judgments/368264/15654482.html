<p id="p_1">1.     By this order I shall dispose of this application being IA

No.5495/2008 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151

CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The facts of the case are that the plaintiff has filed a suit for

permanent injunction restraining passing of, damages and delivery up

etc.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Plaintiff's case

</p><p id="p_4">3.     The plaintiff is manufacturing and selling pharmaceutical



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                            Page 1 of 21</span>
 specialities and is in the business for the past 100 years. The plaintiff is

the proprietor of the trademark „SECEF‟, a medicinal formulation

containing cefisime which is sold by the plaintiff in capsule and

suspension form.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    The trade mark SECEF, as per the plaintiff, was adopted in the

year 1998 and is a coined word and is a distinctive trade mark. The said

trade mark, according to the plaintiff, was available in many countries

since late 1980s and early 1990s and in India since May 2002. There

was also a discussion in various pharmaceutical well known trade

journals in the year 1988.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    The plaintiff‟s application for registration of the said trade mark is

pending in India under No. 1494475 in class 5 dated 9th October, 2002.

The plaintiff‟s earlier application bearing No. 814621 in class 5 was

abandoned by it otherwise the trade mark was registered in 53 countries

of the world.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    As per the plaintiff, the trade mark SECEF has been continuously

and extensively used in India since May 2002 and has registered total

sale of 20.7 crores till date. The plaintiff has alleged in the plaint that

the trademark SECEF has earned substantial reputation and goodwill and

is associated with the goods of the plaintiff and has acquired valuable

common law rights.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    In February, 2007 through its representative the plaintiff came

across the product bearing the mark CECEF which is also a cefixime

preparation meant for same indication as that of the plaintiff.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                               Page 2 of 21</span>
</p><p id="p_9"> 8.    On enquiry, the plaintiff came to know that defendant No.1 is

using the said trade mark. The products packaging revealed that it was

being manufactured by defendant No.2. The search report also revealed

that defendant No.1 had applied for registration of the trade mark under

No. 1452902 in class 5.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    The plaintiff thereafter sent seize and desist letter dated 25 th April,

2007. However, due to oversight, the plaintiff dispatched the said letter

only on 18th August, 2007. The said letter was returned undelivered with

the postal remark "left returned to sender". On further investigation, the

address of defendant No.1 and 2 was found and notices were reissued to

three addresses on 22nd September, 2007. However, no response was

received from any of the addresses.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   The plaintiff thereafter issued the reminder on 8th November, 2007

offering an amicable resolution of the matter and in exchange the

defendant No.1 would withdraw his trade mark application bearing No.

1452902 in class 5.       The plaintiff thereafter received a reply in

November, 2007 whereby the defendant No.1 informed the plaintiff that

they have taken steps to withdraw their trade mark application and

attached the letter addressed to the trade mark office for withdrawing the

said application.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   The plaintiff dispatched the said letter to the trade mark registry in

the hope that it would conclude the matter and enable an amicable

settlement and the defendants would cease to use the trade mark CECEF.

</p><p id="p_13">12.   The plaintiff for the purpose of his satisfaction sent another letter



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                                Page 3 of 21</span>
 dated 4th December, 2007 for the said clarification coupled with the final

notice to the defendants on 12th February, 2008 for confirmation

regarding the cease of the goods under the trademark CECEF altogether.

In spite of the various letters the defendants did not give any reply and,

therefore, the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_14">13.    The contention of the plaintiff is that the two trade marks SECEF

and CECEF are visually, structurally and phenotically similar and are

also prescribed for the identical indications and the use of the said trade

mark CECEF by the plaintiff is unauthorized and unlicensed, therefore,

the consumers, chemists and doctors are bound to be misled or deceived

in believing these two products originating or approved by or connected

with the plaintiff in some way even though the medicine in question is a

Schedule H drug.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.    Lastly, it is alleged by the plaintiff that the defendants‟ adoption

of the trademark CECEF is deliberate with a view to rake the business

and earn illegal profits from the reputation and goodwill which is created

by the plaintiff in respect of its trade mark SECEF and it is a classic case

of passing off where the defendants are passing of their goods as that of

the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.    The suit along with the interim application was listed on 6 th May,

2008 when this court issued summons in the suit and notices in the

interim application. An ex parte ad interim injunction was also issued in

favour of the plaintiff restraining the defendants from manufacturing,

selling or dealing with the product under the trade mark CECEF or any



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                               Page 4 of 21</span>
 other trade mark which is deceptively similar with the trade mark of the

plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.    The defendants filed the written statement as well as the reply to

the interim application.
</p>
<p id="p_18">Defendants' case

</p><p id="p_19">17.    The defendants have, interalia, raised the following defences and

prayed for vacation of the ex parte ad interim injunction:-

                   trade marks of the parties i.e. SECEF and CECEF. The

                   trade mark of the defendant CECEF is visually,

                   structurally and phonetically different.

                   operation basis. The ingredients of both the products are

                   also different.   The plaintiff‟s product is available in

                   tablet and oral suspension whereas the defendants‟

                   product is available in injection form.

                   being schedule "H" drug can only be sold in retail on

                   prescription by Registered Medical Practitioner.       The

                   medical practitioner or the doctor being educated will

                   never get confused as to the source of the two products as

                   their use and structure is totally different.

              registration of the trade mark by the plaintiff.

                 goods of the defendants in February, 2007 itself but the

</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">20.    One important factor in the present case is that the said marks

used by the parties have been shown in English language and the

defendant has used the first letter "C" in place of "S" of the plaintiff.

The rest of the mark is the same as that of the plaintiff. It cannot be

denied that if both the marks are written and read in other languages,

then both the marks are identical. Therefore, the contention of the

defendant cannot be accepted that the two trade marks are dissimilar.

</p><p id="p_23">21.    The second contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff‟s drug

is prescribed for urinary respiratory track infection and acute otitis media

whereas the defendant‟s product being an antibiotic is prescribed mostly

for post operative cases and the ingredients of the two products are also

different and used for different purposes of disease. The defendant has

also contended that the plaintiff‟s product is used in tablet and oral

suspension form whereas the defendant‟s product is only available in

injection form, therefore, there is no confusion and deception between

the two products in question.
</p>
<p id="p_24">22.    I do not accept the submission of the learned counsel for the

defendant as I feel that it is more dangerous if the pharmaceuticals

products bearing the same mark is used for different purposes for the

same ailment or even otherwise. I also do not accept the contention of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                               Page 9 of 21</span>
 the defendant‟s counsel that there would be no confusion if the product

contain different ingredients/different salt. In my opinion, it is more

dangerous and harmful in the trade if the same trade mark is used for

different ailments.    The Apex court has already dealt with this

proposition of law in the case of Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Vs. Cadila

Pharmaceuticals, (2001) 5 SCC 73 and held as under :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">          "25. The drugs have a marked difference in the compositions
          with completely different side effects, the test should be
          applied strictly as the possibility of harm resulting from any
          kind of confusion by the consumer can have unpleasant if not
          disastrous results. The courts need to be particularly vigilant
          where the defendant's drug, of which passing off is alleged, is
          meant for curing the same ailment as the plaintiff's medicine
          but the compositions are different. The confusion is more
          likely in such cases and the incorrect intake of medicine may
          even result in loss of life or other serious health problems. In
          this regard, reference may usefully be made to the case of
          Glenwood Laboratories, Inc. Vs. American Home Products
          Corp. 173 USPQ 19(1972) 455 F.Reports 2d, 1384(1972),
          where it was held as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">          "The products of the parties are medicinal and applicant's
          product is contraindicated for the disease for which opposer's
          product is indicated. It is apparent that confusion or mistake in
          filling a prescription for either product could produce harmful
          effects. Under such circumstances, it is necessary for obvious
          reasons, to avoid confusion or mistake in the dispensing of the
          pharmaceuticals."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">23.   The other argument of the counsel for the defendant that the

plaintiff‟s product is available in tablets and oral suspension form and

the defendant‟s product is available in injection form has also no force as

it has been seen from experience of the pharmaceuticals products

available in all over the world that most of the companies are making

pharmaceuticals products in both the forms i.e. tablets as well as in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                             Page 10 of 21</span>
 injection form under the same trade mark. As per well settled law, the

actual confusion and deception is not required in order to prove the case

of passing off even if the defendant has adopted the mark innocently and

the court comes to the conclusion that the two trade marks are

deceptively similar, injunction under the said circumstances has to be

granted. Actual deception is not required in an action of passing off.

<a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_8">Century Traders vs. Roshan Lal Duggar &amp; Co</a>., AIR 1978 (Del) 250.

Therefore there is no chance of confusion and deception.

</p><p id="p_26">24.   In the case of <a href="/doc/1299452/" id="a_9">Laxmikant V. Patel Vs. Chetanbhat Shah &amp;

Anr</a>., (2002)3SCC65 the Apex court has dealt with this question at great

length in paras 8 and 9 which reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">          "13. In an action for passing off it is usual, rather essential, to
          seek an injunction temporary or ad-interim. The principles for
          the grant of such injunction are the same as in the case of any
          other action against injury complained of. The plaintiff must
          prove a prima facie case, availability of balance of
          convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable
          injury in the absence of grant of injunction. According to
          Kerly (ibid, para 16.16) passing off cases are often cases of
          deliberate and intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-
          settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of
          action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a
          defence though proof of fraudulent intention may materially
          assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception.
          Christopher Wad low in Law of Passing Off (1995 Edition, at
          p.3.06) states that the plaintiff does not have to prove actual
          damage in order to succeed in an action for passing off.
          Likelihood of damage is sufficient. The same learned author
          states that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to
          the existence of the cause of action for passing off (ibid, paras
          4.20 and 7.15). As to how the injunction granted by the Court
          would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of each
          case. Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiff's
          distinctive trade mark or business name, the order may be an
          absolute injunction that he would not use or carry on business
          under that name, (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97)"

<p id="p_28"> 25.   The third contention of the learned counsel for the defendant is

that the product of the parties in question is Schedule "H" drug and the

same has to be purchased by the customers only on the prescription of

medical practitioner. The argument of the defence of Schedule "H" drug

has already been dealt with in various cases decided by the High Courts

as well as the Apex court wherein the court has rejected the said

submission many times. In the case of Cadila Pharmaceuticals (supra)

in para 22 and 28 it was held as under :
</p>
<p id="p_29">

          apt, that

          "Physicians are not immune from confusion or mistake.
          Further more it is common knowledge that many prescriptions
          are telephoned to the pharmacists and others are handwritten,
          and frequently handwriting is not unmistakably legible. These
          facts enhance the chances of confusion or mistake by the

          much alike when handwritten or sound too much alike when

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">          The defendant concedes that physicians and pharmacists are
          not infallible but urges that the members of these professions
          are carefully trained to detect differences in the characteristics
          of pharmaceutical products. While this is doubtless true to dos
          not open the door to the adoption by manufacturers of
          medicines of trade marks or names which would be
          confusingly similar to anyone not exercising such great care.
          For physicians and pharmacists are human and in common

          field of medicinal remedies the courts may not speculate as to
          whether there is a probability of confusion between similar
          names. If there is any possibility of such confusion in the case
          of medicines public policy requires that the use of the

          supposed to be sold on doctor's prescription, but it is not
          unknown that the same are also available across the counters

          not the knowledge of the doctor, who is giving the

          customer, who goes to purchase the medicine can make a

</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">27.   The next contention of the learned counsel for the defendant is

that suffix of the mark „CEF" is suggestive of the ingredient and there is

nothing novel or distinctive about the mark of the plaintiff. The suffix

"CEF" has been derived by the parties from the ingredient containing

Cefixime, therefore, the mark of the plaintiff itself is a distinctive trade

mark as claimed by the plaintiff and there is no visual similarity under

the said circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_33">28.   This proposition has already been discussed in various decisions

passed by Apex Court for the last more than four decades in which have

clearly laid down that the rival marks of the parties have to be compared

as a whole. Therefore, it is not a valid defence by the defendant to first

split the mark in question portion-wise and then give its justification for

adoption and use of similar mark of the other party.

</p><p id="p_34">29.   In the case of Corn Products (Supra) it was held that in deciding a

question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be

considered as a whole. Similarly, in the case of Amritdhara (supra) it

was observed that the trade mark is the whole thing. The whole word has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                              Page 14 of 21</span>
 to be considered. Also in the case of Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt

Sharma Vs. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC

</p><p id="p_35">980) the Apex Court held that where common marks are included in the

trade marks to be compared, or in one of them, the proper course is to

look at the marks as whole and not to disregard the parts which are

common.
</p>
<p id="p_36">30.     In the case of Rapidex Pharmaceuticals (supra), the mark of the

plaintiff and defendant was Zavit and Evit and the objection was raised

by the defendant that the suffix of the mark VIT is adopted from the

generic name vitamin and is common in use by other manufacturer and

traders, therefore, the mark was not a distinctive.          However, the

injunction    was granted. In another case reported in Sun Pharma

Industries Ltd (supra) where the mark of the parties were Parkitane and

Pacitane, the parties were using the mark in respect of the disease like

Parkinson. While comparing the mark as a whole, the court granted the

injunction. In the case reported of Smithkline Pharma‟s case (supra)

where the marks in question were Alben and Aben, the mark Alben, was

derived by the plaintiff from the generic name, the court granted the

injunction against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_37">31.     The learned counsel for the plaintiff says that the plaintiff has no

objection if the defendants may use the generic name cefixime as a trade

mark.
</p>
<p id="p_38">32. The next contention of the defendant is that there are number of

other companies who are using the similar trade mark as that of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                              Page 15 of 21</span>
 plaintiff, those are CEFF, SIMCEF, CEF, BECEF, SYCEF, CEACEF,

SYCEF, SICEF and C-CEF. The contention of the defendant has no

force as the defendants have failed to produce any evidence of the actual

user of the said marks referred by the defendants. In order to take the

said defence, the party has to give cogent evidence before this court as to

since when these trade marks are being used and what is the goodwill

and reputation of the said trade marks. The defendant in the present case

has not produced the samples of the third parties in order to show as to

whether the said marks are being used and goods are available in the

market or not. The similar defence raised in various cases has been dealt

by the courts from time to time in the cases of Century Traders (supra),

Corn Products refining Co. Vs. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., AIR

1960 SUPREME COURT 142 and <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_10">Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>.,

2008(38) PTC 49 (Del). Relevant part of the decision of Corn

product(supra) is reproduced hereinbelow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "17. The series of marks containing the common element or
      elements therefore only assist the applicant when those marks are in
      extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such user is of
      course on the applicant, who wants to rely on those marks. Now in
      the present case the applicant, the respondent before us, led no
      evidence as to the user of marks with the common element. What
      had happened was that Deputy Registrar looked into his register
      and found there a large number of marks which had either 'Gluco'
      or 'Vita' as prefix or suffix in it. Now of course the presence of a
      mark in the register does not prove its user all. It is possible that the
      mark may have been registered but not used. It is not permissible to
      draw any inference as to their user from the presence of the marks
      on the register.

<p id="p_39">33.    A mere filing of the search report from the trademarks office does

not prove as to whether the marks mentioned in search report was

 actually been used or not. It is imperative on the part of the party who

relies upon the marks of third party to produce cogent and clear evidence

of user in order to prove the defence of common marks to the trademark

on the basis of the third party user. Hence, in the absence of valid and

cogent evidence, the submission of the defendant cannot be accepted.

</p><p id="p_40">34.     The next submission of the learned counsel for the defendant is

that this court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to try and

entertain the present suit. The plaintiff in the present case has invoked

the jurisdiction as per Para 21 of the plaint which reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">           "This Hon‟ble court has necessary jurisdiction as the sales of
           the plaintiff‟s products are available in New Delhi through its
           agents as is the defendant‟s product. The plaintiff‟s sales are
           also affected causing losses and harm to the plaintiff in Delhi
           which the sale made by the defendant cuts into the plaintiff‟s
           business and reduces its sales, interalia, at Delhi. The harm
           caused to the plaintiff is due to a direct correlation between the
           defendant‟s infringing activities and the plaintiff‟s business
           and, therefore a part of the cause of action has arisen in Delhi,
           therefore, this Hon‟ble court has the jurisdiction to entertain
           the present suit under Section 20 of CPC."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">35.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the plaintiff has

invoked the jurisdiction of this court on the basis of fact that the

defendant‟s product is available in New Delhi and that the plaintiff‟s

sales are also effected within the territory of this court.

</p><p id="p_42">36.     At the instance of the defendant, the statement of investigator of

the plaintiff under Order X CPC has also been recorded on 21st January,

2009.     In the said statement recorded under Order X CPC, the

investigator has made the statement that the defendant has created

confusion in the market by using of the trade mark CECEF. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                              Page 17 of 21</span>
 plaintiff‟s and defendants products are available in Delhi through their

agents. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further argued that the mere

averment in the plaint is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_43">37.   In view of the settled law, it is clear that part of cause of action

has arisen at Delhi and at this stage the court has to see only the

averments made in the plaint.        (Ref. LG Corporation &amp; Anr. Vs

Intermarket Electroplasters(P) Ltd. and Anr.; 2006 (32) PTC 429,

<a href="/doc/904832/" id="a_11">Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. V. Mahavir Steels &amp; Ors</a>.;                 47(1992)

DLT 412).
</p>
<p id="p_44">38.   Further since the point of territorial jurisdiction of this court is a

mixed question of facts and law, therefore, prima facie, on the basis of

averments in plaint, this Court has the territorial jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_45">39.   The next contention of the learned counsel for the defendant is

that the defendant‟s application is prior in time, therefore, the plaintiff is

not entitled for injunction in the matter. It is a matter of fact that the

plaintiff is the earlier user of the trade mark in question. The plaintiff

has produced the evidence of prior user          on record, therefore, the

contention of the defendant has no force.          The mere filing of the

application prior in time of the plaintiff‟s application does not confer

any right in favour of the defendant when the plaintiff is the actual prior

user of the mark in question. Further in reply to notice issued by the

plaintiff, the defendant had agreed to withdraw the same very application

as alleged. In the case of Century Traders (supra), it was observed that

in order to succeed in an application for temporary injunction the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS (OS) No.851/2008                                                 Page 18 of 21</span>
 appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of

time than the impugned user by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_46">40.    The other contention of the defendant is that there is delay on the

part of the plaintiff to file the present suit. The said contention is also

totally merit-less because it is the defendant who himself has given the

reply to the notice issued by the plaintiff to withdraw the application for

registration of the trade mark and also issued a letter in favour of the

Registrar of the Trade Marks. As a matter of fact after issuing the notice

by the plaintiff, it was the defendant who at that point of time made up

its mind to withdraw the mark. However, it appears that the defendant

later on changed its mind as per the pleadings of the defendant. It is well

settled law that if the defendant had knowledge about the plaintiff‟s

trademark then the subsequent user of the defendant, if any, is at its own

peril and it should not be construed as bonafide user on the part of the

defendant. Therefore, the said contention has also no force in the eyes of

law.

          wait for the outcome of various proceedings pending before
          different courts. The respondents having themselves taking

           on the part of the appellant. Indisputably, in Page 3760 a case
          of infringement of trade mark, injunction would ordinarily
          follow where it is established that the defendant had infringed

<p id="p_50">42.   In the case of Colgate Palmolive Company and Anr. Vs.

Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. 2003 (27) PTC 478 (Del)

in paras 65 and 66 it was held as under :
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">          "65. As regards the plea of the defendant that plaintiff are not
          entitled to interim injunction because of delay, laches and
          acquiescence inasmuch as notice was issued in July, 1998 and
          action was brought in 2003, such a defense is not available as
          it is well settled principle of law that if use is found to be
          dishonest, delay or acquiescence has no relevance. The very
          fact that notice was served upon the defendant, the bringing of
          the action after two or three years becomes insignificant and
          irrelevant.

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">          66. Further, though notice was given to the defendant on
          13/7/98 against the old product but when the defendant
          discontinued with the old product and brought out a new
          product in 2002 the instant action was taken within three
          months and thereforee the question of delay does not arise.
          The notice was given against the use of red and white colour
          combination with blue line in between. Admittedly the
          plaintiff did not take any action as the sales were insignificant
          but when they modified the product with red and white colour
          combination alone in October, 2002 and the sales of the
          defendants goods have suddenly went up the instant action
          was taken."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">43.   The last contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff has not

approached this court with clean hands as the plaintiff has knowingly

made false and misleading statements. It is not in dispute that the two

products are pharmaceutical products, the submission of the defendant

that the two products are used with different ingredients does not amount

to concealment of material fact. The said contention has no force and

the same is rejected in view of my discussion in para 21 of my order.

 After considering the overall circumstances of the matter, I am of the

view that prima facie it appeared that the defendants have infringed the

legal rights of the plaintiff and therefore, they have no justification to

use the impugned trade mark. I am of the considered view that an ex

parte ad interim injunction granted by this court on 6 th May, 2008 is to

be confirmed and ordered accordingly. The application stands disposed

of.
