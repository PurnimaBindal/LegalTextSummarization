    the Constitution. It is contended that <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_3">Article 15(4)</a> permits discrimination only
      


    in favour of socially and educationally backward classes, Scheduled Castes
   



    and Scheduled Tribes; that a religious community cannot be a "class" under
    <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_4">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution and that all members belonging to a particular





    religion per se cannot be termed as "a socially and educationally backward
    class". The gravamen of the challenge as formulated by the petitioners is that
    the sole basis being religion, the classification is violative of fundamental
    rights of students belonging to the majority community.

          Minorities was announced in June, 2006. It provides that a pre-matric
                          
          scholarship scheme for meritorious students from minority communities
          would be implemented.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          2.    OBJECTIVE

                 The scholarship at pre-matric level will encourage parents from
      

          minority communities to send their school going children to school,
          lighten their financial burden on school education and sustain their
   



          efforts to support their children to complete school education. The
          scheme will form the foundation for their educational attainment and
          provide a level playing field in the competitive employment arena.
          Empowerment through education, which is one of the objectives of this





          scheme, has the potential to lead to upliftment of the socio economic
          conditions of the minority communities.

          residential Government institutes and eligible private institutes selected

                 ghettos across the country, especially in the communally sensitive
                 towns and cities. By living together in concentrated pockets,
   



                 Muslims have been neglected by municipal authorities and facilities

                 effect on their psyche. This identity crisis combined with the

                 As mentioned earlier, education is an area of grave concern for the
                 Muslim Community. The popular perception that religious
   



                 conservatism among Muslims is a major factor for not accessing
                 education is incorrect. The recognition of their educational
                 backwardness is quite acute amongst a large section of Indian





                 Muslims and they wish to rectify it urgently. There is a
                 significant internal debate about how this should be done.
                 Private minority institutions and Madarsas are seen as the
                 only option available to the community for improving the
                 educational status of the Muslim community. However, others





                 find these to be questionable alternatives pursued by the State
                 neglecting its own responsibility. Relying predominantly on
                 Madarsa and denominational institutions for improving the
                 educational status of Muslims was also seen by some as violating
                 the spirit of the Constitution.

            backwardness of Muslims is abject poverty due to which children
            are forced to drop out after the first few classes. This is
            particularly true for Muslim girls. Little children are expected to
            provide for their families by working in karkhanas (small
            workshops), as domestic help or by looking after their siblings




                                    
            while their mothers go to work. It was felt that the incidence of
            child labour was much higher among Muslims as compared to
                     
            other SRCs. Poor and illiterate parents cannot afford tuition for
            their children; nor can they provide the necessary support system
            at home which has become so essential a part of today's
                    
            educational system. The opportunity costs involved in sending
            children to school is also too high, making it difficult for parents
            to do so.
</blockquote>      


<blockquote id="blockquote_75">            Low Perceived Returns from Education
   



            Moreover, a community-specific factor for low educational
            achievement is that Muslims do not see education as
            necessarily translating into formal employment. The low





            representation of Muslims in public or private sector employment
            and the perception of discrimination in securing salaried jobs
            make them attach less importance to formal `secular' education in
            comparison to other SRCs. At the same time the Community,
            especially the educated Muslim middle class, finds itself frustrated





            and alienated because of the lack of presence and opportunities in
            administrative, policy and political spaces.

            children to go to private schools, if they can afford to, or else to

            localities. Exclusive girls' schools are fewer, and are usually at
            a distance from Muslim localities. This has its repercussions

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">            School-based Factors
      


            Government schools that do exist in Muslim neighbourhoods are
   



            merely centres of low quality education for the poor and
            marginalized. The poor quality of teaching, learning, absentee
            teachers, in turn, necessitate high cost inputs like private tuitions,





            particularly in the case of first generation learners from the
            Muslim community. This has a negative impact on retention and
            school completion. Thus, poverty again has a causal link with
            access to education among Muslims."

<p id="p_122">    37.     A bare perusal of the Report of the High Level Committee headed by
    Justice Sachar clearly indicates that low level of social and educational
    backwardness of the Muslim community is not attributable only to poverty or




                                                     
    only to religion. Ghettoisation, identity related concerns, security concerns etc.
    are social barriers peculiar to the Muslim community and not to the other poor
    strata of the society belonging to the majority community. Hence, when a




                                          
    meritorious but poor Muslim student is given a pre-matric scholarship for
                           
    school education and a post matric scholarship for a professional or technical
    course, he does not get it merely because he is a Muslim, but because he has to
                          
    face the social barriers indicated above, which the majority community
    students belonging to poor strata do not have to face. The very fact that out of
    every 25 students in under-graduate courses, only one is a Muslim, that out of
      


    every 50 students in post-graduate courses, only one is a Muslim and that out
   



    of every 100 students in IIMs, only one is a Muslim, substantiates in ample

    schemes for the underprivileged have not reached the disadvantaged sections

            amendment to a law is a slow process and the legislature attempts to
                            
            remedy where the need is felt most acute. It would, therefore, be
            inexpedient and incorrect to think that all laws have to be made
