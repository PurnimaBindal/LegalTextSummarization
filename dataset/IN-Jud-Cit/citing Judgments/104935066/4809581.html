                      Finance Corporation of India/ fifth defendant. In September 1996 there was

                      were involved in the project estimated the total cost at Rs.192 crores. The

                      could not bring in its own capital. It is claimed that the first defendant was

                      required to disclose the existence of the three agreements, viz. the Technical

                      Services Agreement, the Project Consultancy Agreement and the Royalty

                      accommodation to the first defendant for the Hotel project. This financial

                      assistance rendered for the purpose of construction of the Hotel was

                      recorded by way of an agreement dated 12.01.2000. There was a

                      supplemental agreement dated 10.06.2000 which provided for repayment of

                      the amounts advanced together with interest. The period that was fixed at six

                      months under the agreement dated 12.01.2000 was extended to 24 months

                      from 12.01.2000, the date of the first agreement. These two agreements were

                      Institutions were pressing for repayment of the loan, the plaintiffs and the

                      irrevocable and continuing guarantee in favour of the plaintiff No.1,

                      guaranteeing payment of a sum of Rs.15.12 crores with interest. The second

                      would further plead that the first defendant has acknowledged the liability to

                      the assignees of the Hotel property. The defendants 3 and 7 were also

                      cautioned to inform the intending purchasers about the existence of the

                      aforesaid agreements, since those agreements would be binding on the

                      purchasers also. In the response to the said letter, the third defendant

                      reiterated it contentions in its earlier reply dated 28.12.2004. The plaintiff

                      would therefore claim that it is entitled to the legal character and right to

                      operate the Hotel under the Technical Services Agreement and the Project

                      Consultancy Agreement dated 26.10.1988 and the second plaintiff would be

                      entitled to have its name for the Hotel pursuant to the Royalty agreement

                      transfer, sell and/or dispose of the Mount Road Hotel Unit belonging to the

                      first defendant in order to realise their security. While the third defendant

                      has obtained an assignment of the right from the fourth defendant, the

                      defendant Nos.5 and 6 had in fact financed the Hotel business. The seventh

                      defendant is only a consultant. Therefore, the plaintiff sought for the relief of

                      declaration that the above said three agreements dated 26.10.1988 and the

                      Finance Agreements dated 12.01.2000, 10.06.2000 and 04.02.2002 are

                      valid, subsisting, binding and enforceable on defendants 3 to 7 along with a

                      relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants 3 to 7 from

                              2.15. Since the property was sold to the eighth defendant of which the

                      defendants 9 to 11 are the Directors pending the suit on 05.07.2007, the

                      plaintiff took steps to implead the purchasers viz. the 8th defendant and its

                      Directors/defendants 9 to 11 and also got the plaint amended incorporating

                      certain averments to the effect that the Directors of the eighth defendant

                      were aware of the existing agreements between the plaintiff and the first

                      defendant. It was also contended that the eighth defendant had entered into

                      an agreement with the 12th defendant/Hyatt Hotel Corporation for running

                      the Hotel in their name. According to the plaintiff, in view of the subsisting

                      agreements between the plaintiff and the first defendant neither the eighth

                      defendant nor the twelfth defendant can run the Hotel at Mount Road in

                      their name. Therefore, a further relief was sought for in the form of a

                      permanent injunction restraining the defendants 8 to 12 or any person

                      claiming under then from taking any steps or acting in a manner inimical to

                      and/or in derogation of the rights of the plaintiff as embodied in the

                      Technical Services Agreement dated 26.10.1988, Project Consultancy

                      Agreement and Royalty Agreement dated 26.10.1988. These amendments

                      injunctive reliefs on the premise that the three agreements dated 26.10.1988,

                      viz., the Technical Services Agreement, the Project Consultancy Agreement

                      and the Royalty Agreement entered into between the plaintiffs 1 and 2 and

                      the first defendant continued to be valid and would be binding on the

                      purchaser viz., the eighth defendant. Though, the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 are

                      impleaded in the suit since the security interest of the fourth defendant only

                      relates to the commercial complex part of the Hotel building, the purchasers

                      of the Commercial Complex were not impleaded in the suit and no prayer

                      only purchased the security interest of ICICI Bank, which was covered by a

                      mortgage of the Commercial Complex property. It was further contended by

                      the third defendant that there was a clear demarcation between the Hotel

                      property and the commercial complex property. While the Hotel Unit was

                      mortgaged to defendants 5 and 6 viz., the Industrial Finance Corporation of

                      India and the Tourism Finance Corporation of India, the commercial

                      complex portion alone was mortgaged to ICICI Bank.

                      third defendant by the plaintiffs to the effect that the plaintiffs have no

                      interest, if the third defendant’s venture is restricted to the financial asset

                      viz., the commercial complex at Mount Road, belonging to the first

                      defendant. The sum and substance of the pleading of the third defendant is

                      that the agreements entered into between the first defendant and the

                      plaintiffs do not pertain to the commercial complex and therefore the

                      plaintiffs would not acquire any right over the Commercial Complex which

                      was the part of the security interest created in favour of ICICI Bank which

                      was assigned to the third defendant.

                      was not aware of the existence of the agreements between the plaintiffs and

                      agreements dated 26.10.1988 viz., the Technical Services Agreement, the

                      Project Consultancy Agreement and the Royalty Agreement. According to

                      the eighth defendant, on the execution of the Agreement dated 04.02.2002,

                      the plaintiff had lost its rights to enforce the other three agreements,

                      inasmuch as, the plaintiffs have agreed to give up their rights under the said

                      and the negative injunction reliefs that are sought for by them against the

                      eighth defendant or its Directors or the twelfth defendant. It is also the

                      the eighth defendant to contend that the declaratory relief sought for by the

                      plaintiffs cannot be granted, since it would be a declaration without any

                      further relief where the plaintiff is in a position to seek a further relief. The

                      eighth defendant would further add that the reliefs of injunction being

                      negative in nature cannot be granted unless the Court finds that grant of

                      such negative injunction is absolutely necessary. The eighth defendant would

                      contend that there is an apparent collusion between the plaintiffs and the

                      eighth defendant would contend that the plaintiffs having categorically stated

                      a whole would only signify that the plaintiffs’ intention was to walk out of

                      an obligation to disclose the existence of the agreements on the date when

                      the sale was effected and therefore any sale in breach of the obligation is

                      invalid. On the strength of the above pleadings the plaintiff would seek a

                      no semblance of right over the immovable property. The legal effect of the

                      05.07.2007 and the claim of the plaintiffs did not form part of the said

                      cannot impugn the sale or seek an injunction being a simple money creditor.

                      It is also contended that the suit itself is a camouflaged attempt by the

                      into. All these agreements are to provide services both Technical and

                      hospitality industry. Under the Technical Services agreement, the first

                      plaintiff has agreed to provide its technical knowledge, skill and technical

                      services for the operation of the Hotel upon payment of fee subject to other

                      terms and conditions provided. The said agreement also provides that the

                      performance or an injunction will not prevent the Court from granting an

                      injunction to perform the negative covenant. According to the learned

                      counsel, the defendants 1 and 2 had agreed not to avail the services of any

                      other person than the plaintiffs 1 and 2 for performance of the duties under

                      the Technical Services Agreement, the Project Consultancy Agreement and

                      the Royalty Agreement. Therefore such a negative covenant contained in

                      those agreements could be enforced by the plaintiff by way of an injunction,

                      in view of <a href="/doc/1626651/" id="a_31">Section 42</a> of the Specific Relief Act.

                      relief and even grant a money decree against the defendants, if the Court

                      the suit. According to the learned counsel, the fact that the plaintiffs have

                      advanced a sum of Rs.15.12 crores to the first defendant is beyond any pale

                      of doubt. The Agreement dated 04.02.2002 makes it obligatory on the part

                      is bound by the said agreements and hence the agreements are enforceable

                      money decree for the sum of Rs.15.12 crores with appropriate interest. The

                      fact that the Hotel has been sold by the Financial Creditors is pointed out as

                      a factor which will render the three agreements dated 26.10.1988 incapable

                      of performance. Therefore, according to Mr.Rahul Balaji, the plaintiffs can

                      Rs.15.12 crores was recognised by the agreement dated 04.02.2002. My

                      attention is also drawn to the evidence of P.W.1 in cross-examination to the

                      effect that the plaintiffs have no contract with defendants 3 to 12 in Tr.CS

                      No.108 of 2017, except the three agreements between the plaintiffs and

                      defendants 1 and 2. He would also point out that the witness viz. P.W.1 has

                      conceded that the plaintiffs have not taken any steps for enforcement of the

                      guarantee executed by the second defendant regarding performance of the

                      agreement dated 04.02.2002.

                      dated 26.10.1988. I am afraid that such an argument cannot be

                      countenanced. Admittedly, the order passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court

                      is only in Interlocutory proceedings and the Court had not pronounced on

                      the merits of the matter. The Hon’ble Supreme Court as well as the Division

                      Benches of this Court which had considered the Interlocutory proceedings

                      were only concerned with prima facie case and balance of convenience. Now

                      that the entire maze of evidence is before this Court, the actual purport of the

                      agreement dated 04.02.2002 will have to be considered. A reading of the

                      agreement dated 04.02.2002, particularly Clauses D, E, F and Clause 4

                      would lead to the irresistible conclusion that the plaintiffs gave up their

                      rights under the agreements dated 26.10.1988 and agreed to receive a sum

                      of Rs.15.12 crores with subsequent interest. The consequence is also spelt

                      out in Clause 4 of the said agreement which very clearly states that in the

                      event of default beyond 31.12.2002, the first plaintiff will be free to invoke

                      the guarantee as stated in Clause 3.

                      beyond 25.10.2013. No doubt the rights of the parties will have to be

                      decided on the basis of the prevailing situation on the date of the institution

                      of the suit. But the subsequent events should also be taken into account by

                      the Court and even as argued by Mr.Siddhartha Mitra, learned Senior

                      Counsel the Rule that the Court can mould the relief based on subsequent

                      events is one of ancient vintage. When the Court takes note of the

                      subsequent events that had happened in the case on hand, it is clear that

                      much water has flown under the bridge from the date of institution of Tr.CS

                      The effect of grant of Prayer (bb) would be to prevent the eighth defendant

                      from running the Hotel. The learned counsel for the plaintiff would also

                      concede that he cannot seek specific performance of the agreements dated

                      to force the defendants to close the Hotel and remain idle. Even while

                      employee either to idleness or to serve the empower. Therefore, grant of a

                      negative injunction is not automatic but the plaintiffs should go one step

                      further and prove that it had performed its part of the contract. All the

                      performance of the contracts is not possible. In such a backdrop, the Court

                      would not grant an injunction to enforce a negative covenant invoking

                      defendant is described as follows in the plaint:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                              Hyatt Hotels Corporation, a Company incorporated
                              under the appropriate laws of USA
                              and having its office at 71S Wacker Dr.Chicago,
                              IL 60606-4637, United States.
</blockquote><p id="p_123">                      In the written statement filed by the twelfth defendant, the twelfth defendant

                      had set out the contracts that have been entered into by the eighth defendant

                      with other Companies. The claim of the twelfth defendant is that it is not a

                      party to any of those agreements and it is an unnecessary party to the suit.

                      But, the twelfth defendant has not let in any evidence in support of its above

                      claim. It is also seen that the plaintiffs have also not taken any steps to

                      implead the entities which are mentioned in the written statement of the

                      twelfth defendant. In any event in view of the conclusions reached on Issue

                      Nos. 1, 2, 7 and 8, I do not think, I should go into the question as to whether

                      the suit is maintainable as against the twelfth defendant.

                      advanced any arguments on the question of limitation. In any event, the right

                      of the plaintiffs to seek a declaration as its legal status would commence only

                      when such legal status is denied. Therefore, I conclude that the suit is not

                      barred by limitation. Issue No.6 is answered in favour of the plaintiffs.

                      appearing for the plaintiffs that the Court can always mould the relief and

                      grant a relief of repayment of money as pointed out by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                      Court in <a href="/doc/1447725/" id="a_68">Ramesh Kumar v. Kesho Ram</a>, reported in AIR 1992 Supp(2)

                      SCC 623, and <a href="/doc/1512249/" id="a_69">Pratha Rai Tanwani v. Uttam Chand</a>, reported in 2004 (8)

                      SCC 490, I must point out that the plaintiffs by their own conduct had made

                      it impossible for the Court to grant relief of payment of money, as per the

                      agreement dated 04.02.2002. No doubt the agreement dated 04.02.2002

                      contains an unequivocal acknowledgement of the fact that defendants 1 and

                      2 have borrowed a sum of Rs.15.12 crores from the first plaintiff. But the

                      plaintiffs had the right to seek enforcement of the guarantee executed by the

                      second defendant, if the monies are not paid by 31.12.2002. The plaintiffs

                      never chose to enforce the said guarantee against the second defendant. The

                      explanation given by the plaintiffs for not choosing to sue upon the

                      guarantee is least convincing. The plaintiffs would claim that they were

                      aware of the financial position of defendants 1 and 2 and therefore, they did

                      not choose to enforce the money claim against the second defendant. This

                      explanation is hardly convincing.

                      alternative relief against defendants 1 and 2. After the sale of the property in

                      favour of the eighth defendant, the plaint was extensively amended and the

                      prayer (bb) was incorporated, even then the plaintiffs did not choose to seek

                      a prayer for repayment of the money. Though several decisions were relied

                      upon by the learned Senior counsel for the plaintiffs to contend that the

                      Court can mould the relief and grant a decree for payment of money, I do not

                      think those decisions would help the plaintiffs in the case on hand, inasmuch

                      as, the plaintiffs have not chosen to seek any relief against D1 &amp; D2 at any

                      point of time even though the plaintiffs had the cause of action for claiming

                      such reliefs. The power of the Court to mould the relief is beyond doubt, but

                      at the same time the same can be exercised only if the circumstances

                      warrant. I do not see any special circumstances that would warrant the

                      of this Court. Heavy reliance is placed on by the learned Senior counsel on

                      the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/191215727/" id="a_81">Anita International v.

                      Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, was neither addressed nor gone

                      into. The Appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court was against the order

                      of the High Court made under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_89">Companies Act</a>, nullifying a sale that had

                      taken place in violation of the orders of the Company Court, which granted

                      leave to the applicant Bank to proceed and prosecute Original Application

                      No.1300 of 1997 filed by it against the respondent Company before the Debt

                      Recovery Tribunal at Bangalore. This Court had on 10.03.2000 granted

                      leave subject to the condition that the Official Liquidator is impleaded and

                      no coercive steps are taken against the assets of the Company during or after

                      the conclusion of the proceedings before the Tribunal. However, the Debt

                      Recovery Tribunal issued a Recovery Certificate and the property of the

                      Company was sold in execution of the said Recovery Certificate. Upon

                      application made to the Company Court, the Company Court set aside the

                      sale as the same was in violation of the orders of the Company Court

                      prohibit a sale. It only appended a condition that the purchasers must be

                      2005 dated 18.03.2005, the cause of action for the suit itself is that there is a

                      violation of the order. I do not see any prohibition for the plaintiffs to have

                      moved a similar action before the Debt Recovery Tribunal complaining that

                      the sale is in violation of the order of the High Court is that and therefore it

                      has to be declared as a nullity.

                              17.12. A bar created by a statute over the jurisdiction of a particular

                      Court which is dependent on the availability of a remedy, before an

                      alternative forum cannot be whittled down by considering the ground of

                      challenge. I am therefore of the considered opinion that dehors the ground of

                      challenge what is sought to be achieved is to nullify the action of an

                      Authorised Officer of a secured creditor taken under Sub Section 4 of

                      Section 13 of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_112">SARFAESI Act</a>, over which the Debt Recovery Tribunal

                      has been conferred the exclusive jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_113">Section 17</a> of the Act.



</p><p id="p_153">                              17.13. In the light of the above, I find that <a href="/doc/6431889/" id="a_114">Section 34</a> of the

                      SARFAESI Act in effect bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, more so,

                      when the actions of the Authorised Officer of a Secured Creditor are

                      questioned dehors the grounds of challenge. Therefore Issue No.5 in CS

                      No.164 of 2011 is answered in favour of the defendants and against the

                      plaintiff. Once I find that this Court has no jurisdiction, I do not think I will

                      be justified in going into the other issues raised in the suit. In fine, the suit

                      in CS No.164 of 2011 will have to be dismissed on the ground that the
