</p><p id="p_2">1. The Petitioner, M/s Khushi Ram Behari Lal („KRBL‟), challenges an order dated
3rd December 2004 of the Intellectual Property Appellate Board („IPAB‟), whereby
the Petitioner‟s applications TRA Nos. 128/2004/TM/DEL and 129/2004/TM/DEL

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                      Page 1 of 11</span>
 under Sections 46 and 56 read with <a href="/doc/1289320/" id="a_1">Section 107</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_2">Merchandise
Marks Act</a>, 1958 („TM Act‟) for rectification of registered trade mark "TAJ
MAHAL" label under No. 387177 and trade mark "TAJ MAHAL" (the word, per
se) under No. 338004, both under Class 30 in favour of Respondent No. 1 M/s New
Bharat Rice Mills („NBRM‟) was dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2. The case of the Petitioner is that it was established in the year 1978 and was
engaged in the business of processing, manufacturing and trade of basmati rice,
including its export from India. The Petitioner claims that it adopted and has been
bona fide and continuously using the trade mark consisting of the device of TAJ
MAHAL in the course of its trade and that it has built up globally valuable trade
and goodwill. The Petitioner claims to have established a branch in the name and
style of KRBL (export division). It is claimed that the trade mark (TAJ MAHAL)
has already become distinctive and associated with the Petitioner and has acquired
secondary significance denoting the said goods and business of the Petitioner and is
recognized with the Petitioner alone.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3. NBRM on 30th June 1978 applied for registration of TAJ MAHAL (word per se)
under No. 338004 in Class 30. In the advertisement published in the Trade Mark
Journal No. 729 dated 6th October 1979, it was stated by NBRM that the said mark
was "proposed to be used" and further that it was in relation to "Basmati Rice". On
3rd March 1982, NBRM filed another application under No. 387177 for registration
of trade mark TAJ MAHAL (device) under Class 30. This was advertised in the
Trade Mark Journal No. 884, dated 1st April 1987, at page 42 (claiming user since
1st July 1978). It was indicated that this application had to be "associated with
Trade Mark No. 338004". Further, it was in respect of "rice of all kinds".
Admittedly, KRBL did not oppose either application at that stage.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4. On 19th September 1987, NBRM filed an application for registration of the
copyright in TAJ MAHAL label wherein the name of KRBL was mentioned as the
sole distributor of Khosla Bros., a sister concern of NBRM.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5. On 27th February 1989, KRBL applied for registration of the device of TAJ
MAHAL as trade mark vide application No. 506080 in respect of rice for export
only claiming user since 1st January 1978. On 7th July 1989, NBRM filed a criminal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                      Page 2 of 11</span>
 complaint in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate („CJM‟), Batala, alleging that
KRBL, by seeking to export rice using the label TAJ MAHAL, had committed an
offence under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_3">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 („CR Act‟). Meanwhile, caution notices
were inserted by NBRM in the newspapers alleging that KRBL was fraudulently
exporting goods with NBRM‟s trade mark. Pursuant to the warrant issued by the
learned CJM, Batala on 22nd August 1989, there was a seizure of quantities of rice
meant for export belonging to KRBL at the Kandla port on 25th August 1989.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6. On 28th August 1989, KRBL filed two rectification applications in this Court,
C.O. Nos. 20 and 21 1989, seeking rectification of both the aforementioned
registered marks in favour of the NBRM under No. 338004 in Class 30 (TAJ
MAHAL word, per se), and No. 387177 in Class 30 (TAJ MAHAL device) in
favour of NBRM. The rectification applications were transferred from this Court to
the IPAB upon the enactment of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_4">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 (TM Act 1999) and re-
numbered as TRA Nos. 128 and 129/ 2004/TM/DEL, respectively.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7. Meanwhile on 27th June 1994 NBRM filed Notice of Opposition (numbered later
as DEL-8779) against KRBL‟s trade mark application No. 506080 in Class 30. On
25th March 1997, KRBL secured an order for abandonment of NBRM‟s opposition
under Rule 53 (2) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules 1959 (TM Rules).
On a challenge by NBRM, this Court by an order dated 13th February 1998 set aside
the said order of abandonment and directed the Registrar to decide NBRM‟s
opposition, DEL 8779, in accordance with law. An SLP filed by KRBL against the
said order was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 28th August 1998.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8. On 6th January 2000, the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks („AR‟), Mr. U.S.
Sharma, disallowed opposition DEL 8779 filed by NBRM and ordered the
application No. 506080 filed by KRBL to proceed for registration. Against the said
order NBRM filed CM (Main) 199 of 2000 in this Court. By an order dated 4 th May
2000 this Court stayed the issuance of the certificate of registration of trade mark in
favour of KRBL in application No. 506080.
</p>

<p id="p_10">9. On 19th June 1989, NBRM filed application No. 512119 for registration of the
trade mark consisting of the TAJ MAHAL word per se and the device of TAJ
MAHAL in respect of rice of all kinds for export included in Class 30 (claiming

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                        Page 3 of 11</span>
 user since 1st April 1978). NBRM stated in its application that the mark applied for
was associated with its already registered trade mark Nos. 338004 and 387177. The
application was accepted for registration and advertised in the Trade Marks Journal
No. 1088, dated 8th October 1994, at page 46. On 2nd January 1995 KRBL filed a
notice of opposition (later numbered as DEL 9220). By an order dated 4th April
2000, the AR Mr. U. S. Sharma rejected KRBL‟s opposition and ordered NBRM‟s
application No. 512119 to proceed for registration. Against the said order KRBL
filed CM (Main) No. 403 of 2000 in this Court. By an interim order dated 24th July
2000 this Court stayed the order dated 4th April 2000 of the AR till further orders.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10. Both CM (Main) No.199 of 2000 and CM (Main) No. 403 of 2000 have since
been transferred to the IPAB and renumbered as C.O. Nos. 199 and 403 of 2000.
They are stated to be pending. There were certain criminal proceedings to which a
reference was made by counsel for both parties. However, they are not germane for
the purposes of the present petitions.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11. The above narration shows that the IPAB had before it all four cases involving
KRBL and NBRM. There were TRA Nos. 128 and 129 of 2004 which were the
renumbered rectification applications filed by KRBL that were transferred to the
IPAB from this Court. These were in respect of registrations in favour of NRBM for
TAJ MAHAL (device) label under No. 387177 and TAJ MAHAL (word, per se)
under No. 338004. The IPAB also had before it the transferred C.M. (Main) No.
199 of 2000 [against the order dated 6th January 2000 of the AR dismissing
NBRM‟s opposition No. DEL-8779 and ordering KRBL‟s application No. 506080
in respect of the device TAJ MAHAL for rice for export in Class 30 to proceed for
registration] and CM (Main) No. 403 of 2000 [against the order dated 4th April
2000 of the AR rejecting KRBL‟s opposition No. DEL-9220 and allowing NRBM‟s
application No. 512119 in respect of the trade mark consisting of the TAJ MAHAL
word per se and device of TAJ MAHAL for rice of all kinds for export in Class 30].
To recall, there were interim orders passed by this Court in the aforementioned CM.
(Main) Nos. 199 and 403 of 2000 on 4th May 2000 and 24th July 2000 respectively.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12. Counsel for KRBL sought hearing of the four cases together by the IPAB.
However, on 24th September 2004, the Deputy Registrar of the IPAB wrote to him
stating that the files of C.O. Nos. 199 and 403 of 2000 [corresponding to CM

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                        Page 4 of 11</span>
 (Main) Nos.199 and 403 of 2000] were yet to be transferred from the High Court of
Delhi. The IPAB proceeded to hear, and by the impugned order dated 3rd December
2004, dismiss TRA Nos. 128 and 129 of 2004 being KRBL‟s applications seeking
rectification of the trade mark registrations granted to NBRM for TAJ MAHAL
label under No. 387177 and TAJ MAHAL device under No. 338004. The summary
of the findings of the IPAB in the impugned order dated 3rd December 2004 are as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         (i)     The trade marks were registered on 30th June 1978 and 3rd March
                 1982, respectively, in favour of NBRM. As on the date of filing of
                 the rectification petitions i.e., 28th August 1989, a period of seven
                 years had already elapsed. Consequently, Section 32 of the TM Act,
                 1958 stood attracted and the trade marks could not be challenged
                 except on the grounds mentioned in <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_5">Sections 32</a> (a), (b) or (c).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (ii)    There was nothing in the pleadings to substantiate KRBL‟s
                 allegation of fraud in the grant of registrations in favour of NBRM,
                 or contravention of Section 11 TM Act 1958 and non distinctiveness
                 of the mark.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         (iii)   KRBL had already acknowledged that NBRM was using the mark in
                 relation to the trade within India. There was no proof submitted by
                 KRBL to show that it was using the mark since 1st January 1978.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         (iv)    In application No. 506080, KRBL had claimed that it had adopted
                 the mark with effect from 1st January 1978. It failed to produce proof
                 of claim of user of the mark prior to 1st January 1978.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">13. Aggrieved by the aforementioned order dated 3rd December 2004 of the IPAB,
the present two writ petitions have been filed by KRBL. Writ Petition (Civil) No.
4956-57 of 2005 is in respect of the registration in favour of NBRM in application
No. 387177 and, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 4971-72 of 2005 is in respect of the
registration granted in favour of NBRM in application No. 338004.
</p>

<p id="p_15">14. Mr. S. K. Bansal, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner KRBL submitted
that the IPAB erred in observing that there was nothing in the pleadings and
arguments advanced by the counsel for KRBL before the IPAB to substantiate the
allegation of fraud, contravention of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_6">Section 11</a> and non distinctiveness of the mark.
He referred to the rectification petitions in which such pleas were raised. He next

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                         Page 5 of 11</span>
 submitted that the IPAB failed to appreciate that the grounds in <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_7">Section 32</a> (a), (b)
and (c) were distinct. It was submitted that NBRM, in its application No. 338004,
filed on 30th June 1978, stated that the mark was only "proposed to be used". In
application No. 387177, filed on 3rd March 1982 NBRM claimed user since 1st July
1978 although it had not been using the mark since that date. This was clearly a
false claim and, therefore, the registration was obtained by fraud. He submitted that
the registration was, in any event, of a non-distinctive mark. He stressed the fact
that KRBL was seeking registration only for the purpose of export of rice. It was
not interested in seeking registration of the mark for trade in India. Since NBRM
was a firm dealing in domestic trade in rice, it could easily agree to the use by
KRBL of the mark for export purposes.
</p>

<p id="p_16">15. Mr. Bansal submitted that Section 33 TM Act 1958 did not apply to rectification
proceedings. In any event, as long as KRBL was able to establish continuous use of
the trade mark from a date prior to "use of the registered trade mark in relation to
those goods" by NBRM or use from a date prior to the date of registration of the
trade mark in favour of NBRM, the AR could not refuse registration of the mark in
favour of KRBL. He relied on the decisions in <a href="/doc/524113/" id="a_8">L. D. Malhotra Industries v. Ropi
Industries PTC (Suppl</a>) (2) 564 (<a href="/doc/1245631/" id="a_9">Del), Pritam Das v. Anil Food Industries</a> 1995
PTR 233, <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_10">Milment Oftho Industries v. Allergan Inc</a>. 2004 (28) PTC 58 and
<a href="/doc/1208848/" id="a_11">Swaran Singh v. Usha Industries</a> 1980 PTC 287. It is submitted the order dated 4th
April 2000 of the AR Mr. U. S. Sharma noted that KRBL had produced invoices to
show use by it of the mark for export of rice in 1980, which was prior to date of
grant of registration in favour of NBRM. Mr. Bansal submitted that on the date of
the commencement of the rectification proceedings, the trade mark in question was
not distinctive of the goods of NBRM. Lastly, it was submitted that the IPAB erred
in observing that no evidence had been led by KRBL. The documents filed by both
parties in the rectification applications in this Court stood transferred to the IPAB.
The IPAB ought to have, after receipt of the papers, directed the parties to file their
respective affidavits by way of evidence. He referred to an order to that effect
passed by the IPAB in another case (TRA No. 11/2005) on 7th November 2007.
Mr. Bansal relied on the decisions in <a href="/doc/92943839/" id="a_12">Liberty Footwear Company v. Force
Footwear Company</a> 2009 (41) PTC 474 (<a href="/doc/52270/" id="a_13">Del), State of Haryana v. Ram Chander</a>

1080, and <a href="/doc/1169062/" id="a_15">Arumugham v. Sundarambal</a> AIR 1999 SC 2210.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                        Page 6 of 11</span>
<p id="p_17"> 16. Mr. Amarjit Singh, learned counsel appearing for NBRM, submitted that
although both the parties had filed their respective documents, no evidence was led
by KRBL in support of its rectification applications. He submitted that mere filing
of the documents was hardly sufficient. It was incumbent for the party to prove its
case by adducing evidence under the TM Act 1958. Unless affidavits by way of
evidence were filed, the IPAB was not required to look into those documents. In
support of his submission that the IPAB had to proceed on some minimum rules of
evidence he relied on the observations in <a href="/doc/244446/" id="a_16">Bareilly Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. v.
The Workmen &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 1972 SC 330. He also took exception to KRBL not
placing on record in this writ petitions all the documents filed by NBRM, some of
which it had filed along with its counter affidavit in the present petitions. The
averments in the petitions were a mere reproduction of the wordings of Section 32
TM Act 1958 and were therefore insufficient. Fraud, in terms of <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_17">Section 32</a> (a) and
</p><p id="p_18">(b), had not only to be pleaded in its material particulars, but also proved. KRBL
had failed to discharge this burden. Reliance was placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1963785/" id="a_18">Eagle
Potteries Pvt. Ltd. v. Eagle Flasks Industries Ltd</a>. AIR 1993 Bom 185, <a href="/doc/1874558/" id="a_19">Hardie
Trading v. Addison Paint</a> AIR 2003 SC 3377 and <a href="/doc/103561/" id="a_20">American Home Products
Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd</a>. AIR 1986 SC 137.
</p>

<p id="p_19">17. Mr. Singh next submitted that the burden was on the party seeking rectification
to show that its use of the mark was prior to the use by the registered holder of the
same mark or prior to the registration in its favour. In the instant case KRBL had
failed to discharge that burden. KRBL could not rely upon the AR‟s order dated 6th
January 2000 rejecting the NBRM‟s opposition to the registration in favour of
KRBL of the trade mark TAJ MAHAL (word and device) in respect of rice for
export purposes. KRBL had to lead evidence in these proceedings to show that it
was a prior user. In any event, in the writ petition filed by the NBRM challenging
the said order, this Court had directed a certificate of registration not be issued by
order dated 4th May 2000. The matter was still pending before the IPAB.
</p>

<p id="p_20">18. Mr. Singh submitted that the statutory records of the copyright office showed
that KRBL was acting as a distributor of NBRM at least from 1980 and was
exporting the goods of NBRM. However, in 1989 when KRBL sought to export rice
without disclosure of NBRM‟s mark, the latter issued a cease and desist notice. It
was only then that KRBL applied for the registration of the device of TAJ MAHAL

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                       Page 7 of 11</span>
 for export of rice. The cancellation/rectification proceedings were instituted by
KRBL to create a false defence in anticipation of criminal proceedings. As regards
NBRM‟s use prior to 1st June 1978, it had come on record that on account of the
floods in Punjab several important documents were lost. Therefore this did not
mean that NBRM had obtained registration by fraud. Relying on the judgment in
<a href="/doc/1938862/" id="a_21">National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods</a> AIR 1971 SC 878, it was submitted that it was
incumbent on KRBL, in order to bring this case under <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_22">Section 32</a> (c) of the TM Act,
1958, to prove that the mark used by it had become distinctive in relation to the
goods of KRBL as of the date of the commencement of the rectification
proceedings. Mr. Singh finally submitted, relying on <a href="/doc/945911/" id="a_23">P. Purushottam Reddy v.
Pratap Steels</a> AIR 2002 SC 771, that it was too late to seek a remand of the cases to
the IPAB for recording of evidence and a fresh decision.
</p>

<p id="p_21">19. As already noticed hereinbefore, there are four strands of litigation between the
parties concerning the registration of the trade mark TAJ MAHAL (device) as well
as the trade mark TAJ MAHAL (word, per se). The two registrations in favour of
NBRM were been challenged by KRBL, albeit unsuccessfully, in rectification
petitions. Even while the rectification petitions were pending, there were other cases
between the parties. KRBL applied for registration of the very same mark for the
purposes of export of rice. NBRM too applied for registration of the same mark for
the purposes of export of rice. By two separate orders, the AR allowed both
applications and those orders have been challenged by NBRM and KRBL by
separate petitions which are pending even as of now before the IPAB. In the
circumstances, the IPAB could have heard the four cases together. Two of the cases
were effectively appeals against the orders dated 6th January 2000 and 4th April
2000 respectively of the AR. They concerned the grant of registration in favour of
NBRM and KRBL in respect of identical device marks of TAJ MAHAL for rice for
export purposes. One of the issues involved in those matters was prior user. The
orders of the AR show that evidence had been led before the AR by both parties in
the form of affidavits and documents. Had the four cases been heard together, the
parties could have relied upon the same evidence for the purpose of their respective
claims of prior user. Alternatively, the IPAB could have, in the rectification
petitions of KRBL, given a time bound direction to the parties to file their affidavits
of evidence and then proceeded to hear all the four cases together. The IPAB would
then have had a holistic view of the issue and could have avoided the possibility of

 inconsistent orders.
</p>

<p id="p_22">20. After the rectification petitions filed by KRBL in this Court were transferred to the
IPAB, there was apparently no direction issued by the IPAB requiring the parties to file
their respective affidavits by way of evidence. A similar situation arose in <a href="/doc/92943839/" id="a_24">Liberty
Footwear Co. v. Force Footwear Co</a>., with this Court granting the parties in that case a
further opportunity to lead evidence before the IPAB. Thereafter the IPAB, by an order
dated 7th November 2007, directed the parties in that case to file their affidavits by way of
evidence. Although the IPAB is not strictly bound by the technical rules of evidence, it has
to ensure that parties before it prove their claims in a manner that is acceptable to law. The
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1935036/" id="a_25">State of Mysore v. S. S. Makapur</a> AIR 1963 SC 375 held that
while Tribunals "were not bound to follow the procedure prescribed for trial of
actions in courts nor are they bound by strict rules of evidence", "the only
obligation which the law casts on them is that they should not act on any
information which they may receive unless they put it to the party against whom it
is to be used and give him a fair opportunity to explain it." <a href="/doc/244446/" id="a_26">In Bareilly Electricity
Supply Co. Ltd. v. The Workmen &amp; Ors</a>., the issue was whether a domestic
Tribunal was obliged in law to call for documents of which the employees were
given inspection. The Court explained that while the application of the principles of
natural justice did not imply that what was not evidence cannot be acted upon (AIR
@ 339):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "If a letter or other document is produced to establish some fact which is
        relevant to the enquiry the writer must be produced or his affidavit in respect
        thereof be filed and opportunity afforded to the opposite party who
        challenges this fact. This is both in accord with principles of natural justice
        as also according to the procedure under Order XIX Civil Procedure Code
        and the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27">Evidence Act</a> both of which incorporate these general principles.
        Even if all technicalities of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28">Evidence Act</a> are not strictly applicable
        except in so far as <a href="/doc/31217/" id="a_29">Section 11</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 and the
        rules prescribed therein permit it, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal can
        act on what is not evidence such as hearsay, nor can it justify the
        Tribunal in basing its award on copies of documents when the originals
        which are in existence are not produced and proved by one of the
        methods either by affidavit or by witnesses who have executed them, if
        they are alive and can be produced. Again if a party wants an inspection,
        it is incumbent on the Tribunal to give inspection in so far as that is relevant
        to the enquiry. The applicability of these principles are well recognised and
        admit of no doubt." (emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_23">21. There can be no doubt that the above principles would apply to the IPAB as
well. Once, in terms of <a href="/doc/1942836/" id="a_30">Section 100</a>, TM Act 1999 a case is transferred to the IPAB,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P. (C) No.4956-57 &amp; 4971-72/2005                                              Page 9 of 11</span>
 then obviously it has to commence from the stage at which it was in the High Court.
If the rectification proceedings in the present case remained in this Court, the next
stage would have been to require the parties to lead their respective evidence, by
filing affidavits by way of examination in chief. Although the procedure to be
adopted by the IPAB need not be as rigid as demanded by the CPC, the documents
filed by the parties will have to be „proved‟ in some manner known to law. In fact,
by way of practice, the IPAB does give an opportunity to the parties to file
affidavits of evidence. In the present case too no exception could have been made.
The IPAB ought to have logically proceeded to that step after the matters were
received by it on transfer from this Court. It was submitted by learned counsel for
NBRM that no such request was made by KRBL before the IPAB and therefore,
such a plea ought not to be entertained at this stage. This Court is unable to agree.
The fact remains that there were documents on record relied upon by the parties in
support of their respective pleas. It was necessary for the IPAB to require those
documents to be proved in accordance with law by giving an opportunity to the
parties by filing their respective affidavits of evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_24">22. Considering that there are two other matters involving the parties pending
before the IPAB, no prejudice or inconvenience would be caused if these petitions
are remanded to the IPAB to enable parties to file their affidavits of evidence for a
fresh order on merits to be passed by the IPAB. These two rectification applications
should be heard along with other petitions between the parties involving the same
mark which are pending before the IPAB. In view of this conclusion, this Court
does not consider it necessary to deal with any of the other contentions of the
parties. It is for the IPAB to decide those issues afresh uninfluenced by its
impugned order dated 3rd December 2004.
</p>

<p id="p_25">23. Consequently, the following directions are issued:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (i)     The impugned order dated 3rd December 2004 of the IPAB is set
               aside.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       (ii)    The two rectification applications TRA Nos. 128/2004/TM/DEL and
               129/2004/TM/DEL are restored to the file of the IPAB and will be
               listed for directions before it in its first sitting in July 2011.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          (iii)   The IPAB will, immediately upon receipt of a certified copy of this
                 order, send notices requiring both parties to file their respective
                 affidavits by way of evidence within a fixed time period which in
                 any event will not exceed two months from the date of such notice.
                 Neither party will be permitted to file any fresh document. They will
                 rely only on the documents already filed and forming part of the
                 record of the two rectification petitions and the other petitions to
                 which they are parties and which are pending before the IPAB.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         (iv)    The IPAB will thereafter hear the two rectification applications
                 along with other pending petitions (including C.O. Nos. 199 and 403
                 of 2000) involving KRBL and NBRM and endeavour to pass a fresh
                 order on merits disposing of the petitions within a period of six
                 months from today.
