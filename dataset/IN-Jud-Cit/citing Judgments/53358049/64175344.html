                          Facts

                          2.      The plaintiff alleges infringement, by the defendants, of the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s   registered   trademarks    &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot;       &quot;NATURE

                          identical or deceptively similar to the aforesaid registered trademarks
                          of the plaintiff.


                          3.       I may observe, even at this point, that in the list of registered
                          trademarks of the plaintiff, provided in para 7 of the plaint, there is no
                          registration of the word or mark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot;. The mark
                          &quot;NATURE&#x27;S INC.&quot; and &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot; are, however,
                          registered in favour of the plaintiff, and the logos of the plaintiff,
                          relating to the said marks, appear thus:




                          4.       The trademark of the defendants, with which the plaintiff is
                          essentially aggrieved, appears thus:




                          5.       The case set up by the plaintiff in the plaint may be explained as
                          under:


                                   (i)   Since 1998, the plaintiff has been carrying out its
                                   business under the aforesaid trademarks, in respect of goods and
                                   services included in Classes 03, 05 and 35 of the Schedule to
                                   the Trade Marks Rules, 2002. These trademarks stand renewed

                                 from time to time and are presently valid, subsisting and in
                                existence.


                                (ii)    The trademarks being registered in the plaintiff&#x27;s favour,
                                exclusive right to use the trademarks vests in the plaintiff. The
                                registrations also constitute prima facie evidence of the validity
                                of the marks, in view of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
                                1999 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;). By dint of long user,
                                valuable goodwill has been created in the aforesaid marks of the
                                plaintiff. The plaintiff&#x27;s products have attained national
                                recognition, being widely advertised in the print as well as
                                online portals, and publicised through the websites of the
                                plaintiff. As a result, it is asserted that the aforesaid trademarks
                                have, by long, open, extensive, continuous and exclusive use,
                                coupled with large scale publicity, acquired secondary meaning
                                and distinctiveness, and have become identified and recognised
                                with the products of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also provided
                                details of its turnover, from 2007-2008, till the date of filing of
                                the plaint. The turnover has increased from ₹ 12,94,349/- in
                                2007-08 to ₹ 122,97,32,824/- in 2019-2020.


                                (iii)   As against this, it is alleged that the defendant adopted
                                the trademark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S TATTVA&quot;, in respect of essential
                                oils and cosmetics, in respect of which the defendants have
                                applied for registration in Class 3. Defendant No. 1 has applied
                                for registration of the said trademark in respect of goods which
                                are manufactured by Defendant No. 3 and marketed by

                                 Defendant No. 2. The plaint alleges that the trademark
                                &quot;NATURE&#x27;S TATTVA&quot;, of the defendants, is closely identical
                                and    deceptively    similar    to      the   registered   trademark
                                &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot; of the plaintiff, and is inevitably
                                likely to convey an impression, in the minds of the purchasing
                                public, that the products of the defendants emanate from the
                                plaintiff. This, it is alleged, would result in tarnishing of the
                                reputation and goodwill amassed by the plaintiff over the years.
                                Resultantly, it is alleged that the defendants have infringed the
                                registered trademark of the plaintiff, and are also passing off
                                their goods as those of the plaintiff.


                                (iv)   The plaint also contains a tabular depiction, intended at
                                comparing the product of the plaintiff with that of the
                                defendants, thus:

                          Case of the defendant

                          7.    The defendants have filed a written statement, in response to the

                          plaint, in which the defendants assert that their trademark            is
                          completely distinctive and different from the plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks,
                          with no phonetic or visual similarity between them, as is likely to
                          create confusion or deception in a customer of average intelligence
                          and imperfect recollection. A Google search of the expression
                          &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;, it is pointed out, does not throw up any site
                          reflecting the defendants&#x27; products. The defendants points out that
                          their products are DIY (Do It Yourself) cosmetics,        in which the
                          product to be applied has to be prepared by the customer using the
                          ingredients provided by the defendants. Though the products of the
                          plaintiff and defendants are acknoweldged as belonging to the same
                          Class in the Schedule to the Trademarks Rules, it is submitted by the
                          defendants that they are different and dissimilar in nature and cater to
                          distinct categories of consumers, between which there is no overlap.

                           Being in the nature of DIY products, which have to be prepared by the
                          customers, the defendants state that the shelf life of their products is
                          also considerably lesser than that of the plaintiff&#x27;s products, especially
                          after the products are prepared by the customer(s). The defendant has
                          provided screenshots to highlight the difference in the categories of
                          products manufactured by them vis-a-vis those manufactured by the
                          plaintiff.

                          8.     Additionally, the defendants submit that there is no likelihood
                          of any confusion or deception between the defendants&#x27; products and
                          those of the plaintiff, as their packaging and presentation are totally
                          dissimilar.


                          9.     Mr. Sumit R. Sharma, learned counsel for the defendants,
                          submitted that, of all the products of the defendants, the only products
                          which were also being made by the plaintiff were Hand Sanitizer and
                          Active Charcoal Face Pack. A tabular comparison of the said products
                          has been provided, thus, to indicate that, as presented to the customer,
                          they are entirely different and dissimilar in appearance:

                           mark since 2015. Annual sales figures of the defendant business have
                          also been provided. It is asserted that the defendants&#x27; products
                          constitute the only DIY cosmetic segment in India and have, over the
                          years, gained immense popularity, goodwill and reputation amongst
                          their customers. The defendants have referred to encomiums paid to
                          their products in articles in the print media as well as on YouTube.


                          11.   The plaintiff cannot, assert the defendants, claim any exclusive
                          proprietary rights over the word &quot;NATURE&quot;, whether in the form of a
                          word mark or a trademark, as the word is purely generic and
                          descriptive, with no secondary meaning. Used in the context of beauty
                          and cosmetics products, it is asserted that the expression &quot;NATURE&quot;
                          is publici juris, as is apparent from a search of the database of the
                          Registrar of Trademarks, which reveals more than 1100 trademarks in
                          Class 03 which commence with the word &quot;NATURE&quot;. In the context
                          of cosmetics and beauty products, it is submitted by the defendants
                          that the word &quot;NATURE&quot; describes the character and quality of the
                          goods, indicating that they are prepared out of natural/organic
                          substances, providing natural glow to skin.

                          12.   The defendants placed reliance on <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_2">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act

                          supportive evidence. It is also pointed out, in the written statement,
                          that the Registry of Trademarks has, in respect of some applications
                          for registration filed by the plaintiff, specifically clarified that
                          registration of the mark would not confer a right on the plaintiff to
                          exclusive use in respect of the descriptive words contained in the
                          mark. All assertions, in the plaint, regarding the purported goodwill
                          accumulated by the plaintiff and its products over time, have been
                          flatly denied in the written statement. It is also denied that the words
                          &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;, have, by use thereof, by the plaintiff,
                          acquired any secondary meaning, identifying them as relating to the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s products.
</p>

<p id="p_9">                          16.   The written statement reiterates the contention that there is no
                          visual or phonetic similarity between the marks of the plaintiff and the
                          defendants or any likelihood of confusion or deception amongst
                          prospective customers, seeking to purchase their products. It is pointed
                          out that the defendants&#x27; mark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S TATTVA&quot; is a coined and
                          unique mark, combining an English word &quot;Nature&quot; with the Sanskrit
                          word &quot;Tattva&quot;, meaning &quot;elements&quot;. The defendant has asserted the

                          that the plaint be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_12">                          18.   The plaintiff has filed a replication, in response to the written
                          statement of the defendants. In the replication, the plaintiff has
                          contended that, in law, priority in adoption and use is pre-eminent in
                          trademark jurisprudence, and takes precedence even over registration.
                          In other words, submits the plaintiff, the rights of the prior user of an
                          unregistered trademark are superior to the rights of a subsequent user
                          of the same trademark, even if registered in favour of the subsequent
                          user. The claim, of the defendants, of use of its trademark since 2015,
                          has been categorically denied by the plaintiff in its replication. It is
                          submitted that Defendant No. 2 was incorporated only in 2018, so that
                          there could be no question of use of the impugned marks of the
                          defendants from 2015. The sales figures of the defendants, as provided
                          in the written statement, too, it is pointed out, are with respect to the
                          Defendants&#x27; &quot;business&quot;, with no sub-division of the figures relating to
                          Defendant No. 1 and Defendant No. 2, or any indication that these
                          figures relate to the mark in controversy in the present case. The
                          plaintiff has relied on the following documentary material, to bear out
                          its allegation that the claim of user, by the defendants, from 2015, is

<p id="p_18">                                (viii) The plaintiff has also contested the defendants&#x27; claim of
                                hundreds of registrations being present under the database of the
                                Registrar of trademarks in which the word, &quot;NATURE&quot; or
                                &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot; is used. No evidence, to the effect that this data
                                pertains to actual user of products bearing the said marks has, it
                                is pointed out, been placed on record by the defendants. Even
                                otherwise, the mere presence of third party products in the
                                market can be no defence to adoption, by the defendants of a
                                mark which is deceptively and confusingly similar to that of the
                                plaintiff.

<p id="p_19">                          19.   The goodwill and reach of the plaintiff&#x27;s products, it is
                          submitted, is apparent if a Google search of the words &quot;NATURE&#x27;S
                          COSMETICS&quot;, were to be conducted, which leads directly to the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s mark and the plaintiff&#x27;s company, and not to the
                          defendants&#x27; mark or any other third party marks. It is submitted that

                          the mark           is a slavish imitation of the mark    .

                          dissimilar.
</p>

<p id="p_21">                          21.   The contention, of the defendants that the plaintiff cannot claim
                          any exclusive monopoly over the word &quot;NATURE&quot; or &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot;
                          is contested on the ground that the word &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot; in the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s mark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot; has acquired a secondary
                          meaning and distinctiveness, owing to interrupted use since 1998.
                          Any goods or products, in the market, sold using brands containing the
                          word &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot; and &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;, asserts the
                          plaintiff, are necessarily associated with the plaintiff alone and not
                          with anyone else. In view thereof, the plaintiff disputes the
                          defendants&#x27; contention that the word &quot;NATURE&quot; being publici juris,
                          the plaintiff has no exclusive right over the said expression can be
                          claimed by the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_22">                          22.   In fact, submits the plaintiff, the defendants have deceptively
                          coined their trademark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S TATTVA&quot;, by borrowing the
                          word &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot;, from the plaintiff&#x27;s mark &quot;NATURE&#x27;S
                          ESSENCE&quot;, and the word &quot;TATTVA&quot; from the plaintiff&#x27;s mark,
                          &quot;NATURE&#x27;S PANCHTATTVA&quot;, (which is still unregistered). The
                          invocation, by the defendants, of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_4">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_5">11</a> of the Act is,
                          therefore, alleged by the plaintiff, to be misguided. Having entered the
                          market barely two years ago, it is contended that the defendants are
                          seeking to encash on the reputation of the plaintiff developed over 22
                          years as on date.

                          Submissions of Mr. Chander Lall, learned Senior counsel for the
                          plaintiff


</p><p id="p_26">                          24.       Arguing for the plaintiff, Mr. Lall submits that the &quot;triple test&quot;,
                          applicable in infringement claims, stands satisfied in the present case,
                          as the impugned trademark of the defendants is deceptively similar to
                          that of the plaintiff, the products are identical, and they are available
                          through identical trade channels. He also submits that, having itself
                          applied for registration of the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot;, it was not open to the
                          defendant to urge that the word &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; was descriptive in
                          character.

<p id="p_27">                          25.       Adverting to the evidence produced by the defendants regarding
                          usage, Mr. Lall submits that, of the invoices produced by the
                          defendant, the only invoice, prior to 2018, which contained the words
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; was the invoice dated 3rd December, 2015, of which
                          the defendant had produced all copies, including the copies for the
                          buyer and the transporter. This, submits Mr. Lall, itself throws into
                          doubt the veracity of the invoice. Other pre-2018 invoices filed by the
                          defendants, he submits, do not make any reference to &quot;Nature&#x27;s

                          their &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; products since 2015. In the same context, he
                          refers to a statement of Mr. Karnesh, Director of EcoTokri, thus
                          reproduced in an article in The Economic Times titled &quot;Green Diwali

                          that, in fact, EcoTokri was the defendant&#x27;s flagship brand, and
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; was a mere disingenuous attempt to capitalise on
                          his client&#x27;s goodwill.
</p>

<p id="p_31">                          27.    Mr. Lall also refers, in the same context, to the application,

                          dated 26th April, 2018, filed by the defendant to register its
                          mark, and the affidavit, filed by the Director of the defendant, before
                          the Registry of Trade Marks, to the effect that the total sales of the
                          defendant, till 2018, was only ₹ 40 lakhs. This, he submits, was not
                          believable, if the defendant had, in fact, been in the market, with its
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; mark since 2015. Mr. Lall also points out, in this
                          context, that the registration of the word Mark &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot;, as
                          granted by the Registry of Trade Marks to his client on 12th March,
                          2020, did not make any reference to the existence of the Mark
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot;.       There was, therefore, submits Mr. Lall, no
                          marketed &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; product till 2018 and, during the period
                          2015 to 2018, the defendant was marketing its products only under the
                          brand &quot;EcoTokri&quot;. In fact, points out Mr. Lall, the invoice dated 3rd
                          December, 2015, filed by the defendant, was never filed with the
                          Trade Marks Registry, at the time of applying for registration of the
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s     Tattva&quot; mark, indicating that the invoice had been
                          manufactured only for contesting the present suit. Mr. Lall has also
                          referred, in this context, to the publicity literature of the defendant,
                          titled &quot;About Us - Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot;, particularly to the following

                          place several additional documents on record, along with IA
                          2748/2021, under Order XI Rule 1(10) of the CPC, including invoices
                          and other documents which, according to learned Counsel for the
                          defendant Mr. Sumit Sharma, indicate priority of user of the &quot;Nature&#x27;s
                          Tattva&quot; brand by the defendants. While I have issued notice on the

                          the invoices filed by it with its written statement, chose to execute a
                          volte face and introduce over 100 pages of additional documents,

<p id="p_37">                          Submissions           of Mr Sumit R. Sharma, learned Counsel for the
                          defendants


</p><p id="p_38">                          29.       Addressing, first, the objection, of Mr. Lall, to the additional
                          documents, filed by the defendants with IA 2748/2021 being taken
                          into account while adjudicating on the present application under Order
                          XXXIX of the CPC, Mr. Sharma draws attention to the fact that the
                          necessity of filing such additional documents arose because of the
                          emphatic discrediting, by the plaintiff, in its replication, of the
                          invoices filed by the defendants with the written statement as
                          &quot;fabricated and concocted to mislead the Hon&#x27;ble Court&quot;. In such
                          circumstances, Mr. Sharma submits that he was well within his right
                          in placing additional documents on record, which this Court ought to
                          take into consideration while adjudicating on the plaintiffs
                          interlocutory injunction application. He relies, for the said purpose,
                          on the judgement of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/90423/" id="a_6">Sambhaji v. Gangabai1</a>

                          attention to the prayer clause therein, which merely seeks to protect
                          the &quot;NATURE&#x27;S&quot;, &quot;NATURE ESSENCE&quot; and &quot;NATURE&#x27;S
                          ESSENCE&quot; marks, with no reference to &quot;Panchtattva&quot;. The pleas
                          regarding goodwill, in the plaint, are also confined to the &quot;Nature&#x27;s
                          Essence&quot; mark of the plaintiff. Sales figures, in the plaint, are also
                          with respect to the said mark. Moreover, though the plaintiff pleads
                          user, of the Panchtattva Mark, since 12th November, 2009, sales
                          figures are provided only from 2014. Invoices, too, reflecting the
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot; products, are also w.e.f. 2014.

<p id="p_41">                          31.   Apropos the application filed by his clients before the Trade
                          Marks Registry for registration of the &quot;Natures Tattva&quot; mark, Mr.
                          Sharma refers to the &quot;Statement as to Use of Mark&quot;, as submitted by
                          his client, in which it was clearly stated &quot;The mark is used by the
                          applicant or its predecessor in title since 10/05/2015 in respect of the
                          goods and services mentioned in the application&quot;. Insofar as the
                          invoices, filed by the defendants with the written statement, were
                          concerned, Mr. Sharma points out that no credible challenge had been
                          raised, by the plaintiffs, regarding the invoice dated 3rd December,
                          2015 which, at any rate, referred to &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva Pure Natural
                          Beeswax Shreddings&quot; and which, according to him, was sufficient to
                          evidence the usage, by the defendants, of their &quot;Natures Tattva&quot; Mark,
                          commercially, at least since December 2015.          Mr. Sharma also
                          referred to invoices issued by Amazon.in on their website, for the

<p id="p_42">                          Mr. Sharma also relied on the registration details of the domain name
                          naturestattva.com, as available on the Internet, which indicated that
                          the domain name was registered on 22nd February, 2017. As against
                          this, he points out that, even as per the case of the plaintiff, it is using
                          its &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot; mark only since 2018.

                          and the defendants are totally dissimilar, with no scope of deception
                          or confusion. The product range of the plaintiffs and defendants, too,
                          he would submit, are different. The only two products which are
                          common are the hand sanitiser and charcoal facemask, which are
                          easily distinguishable from each other.     He has also invited my
                          attention, in this context, to the websites of the plaintiff and the
                          defendants, which set out their products thus, and which underscore
                          the difference in the product range:

                           The defendant&#x27;s products, submits Mr. Sharma, are DIY (Do It
                          Yourself) products, unlike the plaintiffs, which are ready to use. As
                          such, the shelf life of the defendant&#x27;s products is also less than that of
                          the plaintiffs. Moreover, submits Mr. Sharma, the customers of the
                          plaintiff and the defendants are niche clientele, who would be aware
                          of the difference between DIY kits and ready to use products.
</p>

<p id="p_46">                          33.        Mr. Sharma has further submitted that there can be no
                          monopolistic right over the use of the word &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot;, as it is
                          descriptive and is, therefore, publici juris.      Over 100 marks, he
                          submits, are registered in the Trade Marks Registry, starting with the
                          word &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot;, with a list of actual products having been filed with
                          the written statement.
</p>

<p id="p_47">                          34.        Finally, Mr. Sharma has sought to highlight the reputation and
                          length of usage of the defendant&#x27;s trademarks. He submits that, at the
                          stage of argument of the interim injunction application of the plaintiff,
                          under Order XXXIX of the CPC, the evidence of usage, since 2015,
                          as produced by the plaintiff, could not be disputed, for which purpose
                          he places reliance on the judgements of Division Benches of this
                          Court in <a href="/doc/39264970/" id="a_8">Marico Ltd v. Agro Tech Foods Ltd3</a> and <a href="/doc/14908792/" id="a_9">Rhizome

</p><p id="p_49">                          35.   Responding to the submissions of Mr. Sharma, Mr. Lall, in
                          rejoinder, once again invited attention to the website article, titled
                          &quot;Beauty start-up Natures Tattva raises $ 150 K from singer Sukhbir
                          Singh, others&quot;, with the note, below the photograph on the said page,
                          &quot;Founded in October 2018, beauty start-up Natures Tattva will use
                          the new funds to scale operations, acquire talent, and for brand
                          building activities&quot;. Similarly, on the very next page in the said
                          article, Mr. Lall invites attention to the recital that, &quot;in the first full
                          year of operations, the start-up has clocked sales of ₹ 1.6 crore and is
                          looking to grow at 20% month on month in the second year of
                          operations&quot;. Mr. Lall further points out that there is contradiction
                          between the sales figures, as provided in the affidavit filed with the
                          application for registering the trademark, in which the sales figures
                          have been shown as ₹ 40 lakhs whereas, in the written statement, it is
                          averred that, during the year 2017-2018, the defendants had sales of ₹
                          59 lakhs.    He submits that, prior to 2018 , the DIY kits of the
                          defendant were obviously being sold under the brand &quot;EcoTokri&quot;. He
                          has invited attention, in this context, to the following recital, in the

                                 is clear from the fact that it has been extensively covered and

                          defendants under cover of IA 2748/2021, Mr. Lall submits that, apart
                          from the fact that the said documents cannot be taken into account, the
                          invoices filed therein are all photo copies, and bear the &quot;EcoTokri&quot;
                          logo at the head. He has also sought to point out other infirmities in
                          the said documents. However, as I am not inclined to take the said
                          documents into account, in order to decide the present application
                          under Order XXXIX, it is not necessary to refer to the other
                          submissions of Mr. Lall, questioning the documents.

<p id="p_53">                          37.    Mr. Lall further submitted that the defendant had applied for

                          registration, with the Trade Mark Registry, of its           mark, only on
                          26th April, 2018, even though it was claiming user since 2015. This,
                          he submits, further discredits the defendants claim of prior user, vis-à-
                          vis the plaintiff.

                          <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_11">Section 29(2)</a>, as the defendants&#x27; mark is being used on the same, or
                          similar, goods.   In such circumstances, Mr. Lall submits that the
                          burden would be on the defendants to show that the marks of the
                          plaintiff and the defendant are so dissimilar that there is no likelihood
                          of confusion or deception. Mr. Lall also relies on <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_12">Section 29(4)</a>,
                          which includes, within the ambit of &quot;infringement&quot;, usage by a person

                          or similar to, the registered trade mark, and is used in relation to
                          goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade

                          reputation in India, and the use, by the defendant, without due cause,
                          takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character

                           even in the case of dissimilar goods, infringement can take place. The
                          test, in such cases, he submits, is only whether an unwary customer
                          would wonder at the association between the item before him, and that
                          manufactured by the proprietor of the registered trade mark.

<p id="p_57">                          39.     Mr. Lall further asserts that the defence, regarding &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot;
                          being a descriptive word, and commonly used, is not available to the
                          defendants, in view of the assertion, in the written statement, that &quot;the
                          defendants mark &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&#x27; is a coined and unique mark
                          combining the word Nature with a Sanskrit word &#x27;Tattva&#x27; which
                          means &#x27;Elements&#x27;, thus showing its honest and bona fide adoption.
                          To support his submission that the defendant cannot plead that the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s mark is not unique, Mr. Lall relies on <a href="/doc/14542478/" id="a_13">Procter &amp; Gamble

                          for the proposition that the defendants cannot be permitted to
                          approbate and reprobate, and are estopped from pleading lack of
                          distinctiveness, in view of the averments contained in the written
                          statement. Mr. Lall further places reliance, on the aspect of deceptive

                           The prima facie case, submits Mr. Lall, is always in favour of the

                          three factors coalesce; a prima facie case in favour of the applicant
                          seeking injunction, the balance of convenience being in favour of
                          grant of injunction, as opposed to the refusal thereof and the
                          likelihood of irreparable loss or prejudice being suffered by the
                          applicant, were injunction not to be granted. The existence of one, or
                          more, of these three factors, would by itself be insufficient to justify
                          grant of injunction; all three must coalesce. Howsoever cast iron the
                          case for the plaintiff may appear to be, a court would not grant an
                          injunction unless it is manifest that such grant is necessary to avoid
                          irreparable loss or prejudice to the plaintiff, and the balance of
                          convenience warrants grant of injunction. To these, the Supreme
                          Court has, in <a href="/doc/355919/" id="a_17">Mahadeo Savlaram Shelke v. Pune Municipal
                          Corporation</a> 9, added the consideration of public interest; however, in
                          private intellectual property disputes, this factor may not be of much

                           allegedly infringing trademark or other intellectual property.10 The
                          right to carry on legitimate and lawful trade and business is a
                          fundamental right under the Constitution, and, while interdicting, by
                          grant of injunctive relief, the business of the defendant, the Court has
                          to be acutely conscious of the time from which the defendant has been
                          carrying on such business.                        Evaluation of the competing
                          considerations of the alleged infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          intellectual right, and the prejudice that would result to the defendant
                          if its business is brought to a halt at an interlocutory stage of the
                          proceedings, is an exercise in tightrope walking, and it is for the Court
                          to undertake the exercise with the requisite skill and experience. A
                          mere prima facie view that the trademark used by the defendant
                          appears to be infringing in nature, is not sufficient, by itself, to grant
                          an injunction as sought, though it is an overwhelming consideration.
                          The Court, while granting injunction, has to bear in mind the serious
                          prejudice that may result to the defendant&#x27;s business, as well as all
                          others who may be dependent on that business , such as its employees,
                          if the business is brought to a halt. That the defendant may continue
                          to carry on his business under a non-infringing trade mark, is not a
                          complete answer. Oftentimes, considerable goodwill may have been
                          generated, over the course of time, even by the usage of an infringing
                          trade mark. It is for this reason that the Court also examines the
                          promptitude with which the plaintiff has approached the Court. If the
                          allegedly infringing trademark has been in use for a number of years,

                           for example, the Court would be more circumspect in granting
                          interlocutory injunction against the defendant. At such times, the
                          Court may balance the equities by requiring the defendant to furnish
                          accounts of the earnings made by using the allegedly infringing trade
                          mark so that the plaintiff could, if it succeeds in the suit, be
                          monetarily recompensed. Whether such monetary recompense would
                          be sufficient to offset the prejudice caused to the plaintiff as a result of
                          continuous usage of infringing trademark is, however, also a
                          competing consideration, given the fact that intellectual property is a
                          sanctified Constitutional asset of the citizen, and infringement thereof
                          ordinarily is not to be tolerated. At the end of the day, the Court has
                          to make a conscious and judicious determination to examine exactly
                          which pan of the equitable scale is heavier, and decide accordingly.
                          By its very nature, this exercise cannot be circumscribed by any strict
                          or definitive guidelines.
</p>

<p id="p_62">                          42.   The onus, to prove the existence of a prima facie case, balance
                          of convenience, and irreparable loss, as would justify grant of
                          injunction, is always on the plaintiff, and never shifts even if, on the
                          aspect of consideration of the material on record, the onus may shift

                          in futility, and the litigation getting reduced to a claim for damages.
                          Applications for interlocutory injunction in intellectual property
                          disputes have, therefore, to be treated with, and accorded, greater
                          respect; the consequence of grant, or refusal, of injunction being, in
                          almost all cases, irreversible at any later point of time.
</p>

<p id="p_64">                          44.   The injunction Court is required to be suitably sensitised of
                          these aspects, before embarking on the exercise of examination of the
                          merits of the plea for injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_65">                          45.   In the present case, there are, quite obviously, only two issues
                          which arise for consideration. The first is whether the defendants
                          have, prima facie, infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark, or not. The
                          second is whether, if they have, grant of injunction, against their
                          continuing to infringe the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark, would be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_66">                          46.   Is there a prima facie case of infringement?
</p>

<p id="p_67">                          46.1. Two factors are required to be borne in mind, at the very outset.
                          First, that the prayer in the plaint is restricted to the marks

                           &quot;NATURE&quot;, &quot;NATURE ESSENCE&quot; and &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;.
                          There is no prayer relating to any mark of the plaintiff which uses, as
                          a whole or part thereof, the word &quot;Tattva&quot;. Though the plaintiff avers
                          that it had started using the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Panchtattva&quot; mark in 2018,
                          there is no relief sought, with respect to the said mark. The allegation
                          of infringement is, therefore, required to be examined, in respect of
                          the defendants trademarks, vis-à-vis the marks &quot;NATURE&quot;,
                          &quot;NATURE ESSENCE&quot; and &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;, of the
                          plaintiff. The second aspect, to be borne in mind, is that there is no
                          prayer, in the plaint, against alleged passing off, by the defendant, of
                          its products, as those of the plaintiff. The prayer relates only to
                          infringement. Mr. Lall, with the candour expected of Senior Counsel,
                          acknowledged that this appears to have been a lapse. Be that as it
                          may, I do not propose, in this order, to examine whether the
                          defendants are, or are not, passing off their products as those of the
                          plaintiff, in the absence of any prayer predicated on such a plea.
</p>

<p id="p_68">                          46.2 In order to establish a case of infringement, the plaintiff has to
                          make out a clear case of deceptive and confusing similarity, between
                          the marks of the defendant, and its own registered trade marks, as
                          there can be no infringement with respect to an unregistered
                          trademark11.

                          issued by the Trade Marks Registry, with respect to its various marks.
                          They pertained to the word Mark &quot;NATURE ESSENCE&quot; and

                          other trademark has been registered in favour of the plaintiff. I am
                          required, therefore, to examine the allegation of infringement, with

                                      syllable, is to be avoided. The possibility of careless
                                      pronunciation and speech, both on the part of the buyer walking

                                phonetic similarity of the marks at the nature of the goods
                                previously purchased, or of which he has been told and which
                                he wants to purchase. It has to be examined whether the totality
                                of the trade mark of the defendant is likely to cause
                                deception/confusion or mistake in the minds of the persons

                                phonetic similarity or even identity. The matter, apparently, is
                                always one of fact. The Court would have to decide, on a
                                comparison of the two marks, and the parts thereof which are
                                phonetically similar, as to whether such phonetic similarity is
                                likely, considering all other circumstances, to confuse or
                                deceive a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
                                recollection, always bearing in mind the nature of the goods,
                                and the degree of circumspection which would be expected of
                                the purchasers who would purchase such goods.

                                defendant. Identification of the essential features is a question

<p id="p_94">                          46.6 Applying the above tests, the conclusion that the marks

                          and        are deceptively similar is, in my view,             prima   facie
                          undisputable. The marks are in identical colours with the placement
                          of words being also similar. Both contain the word &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; in a
                          larger font, above the word &quot;Tattva&quot; in the case of the defendant&#x27;s
                          mark, and &quot;Inc.&quot;, in the case of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, below it in
                          smaller letters. Both marks are green in colour, and use the word
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; with an apostrophe. In both cases, there is the insignia of a
                          leaf over the word &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; which, even by itself, prima facie
                          indicates imitation, by the defendants, of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, this
                          being a clearly distinctive feature of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark.

<p id="p_95">                          46.7 Vis-à-vis the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot; mark of the plaintiff, the
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; mark of the defendants also appears to be a case of
                          &quot;idea infringement&quot;, as one of the principal meanings of the Hindi (or,
                          rather, Sanskrit) word &quot;tattva&quot; is &quot;essence&quot;. (The suggestion, by the
                          defendants, that &quot;tattva&quot; means &quot;elements&quot;, though etymologically
                          also correct, is an apparent attempt to obfuscate this issue.) This
                          appears, prima facie, to be an attempt to confuse the customer of
                          &quot;average intelligence and imperfect recollection&quot;.

                           46.8 The contention, of Mr. Sharma, that the plaintiff cannot claim
                          any trademark rights over the word &quot;Nature&quot;, as it is descriptive in
                          nature, is neither here nor there. In the first place, the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          trademark, of which it alleges infringement, is not &quot;NATURE&quot; per se,
                          but &quot;NATURE&#x27;S INC.&quot; or &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;.                   As I have
                          already held hereinbefore, the defendant&#x27;s mark is, visually and
                          phonetically, deceptively similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s &quot;NATURE&#x27;S INC.&quot;
                          mark, and conveys a deceptively similar idea to that conveyed by
                          &quot;NATURE&#x27;S ESSENCE&quot;, as has the potential of confusing a
                          customer of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. Whether
                          an intellectual property monopoly can be claimed in respect of the
                          word &quot;NATURE&quot; is, therefore, really off the mark.          It would be
                          totally antithetical to all canons of trademark jurisprudence to

                          question the validity of the           or        marks because &quot;Nature&quot;
                          is a descriptive word. Once &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; is used in conjunction with
                          &quot;Inc.&quot;, or &quot;Essence&quot;, it assumes a definite and distinct - as well as
                          distinctive - connotation and meaning, which is totally different from
                          &quot;Nature&quot; per se. Even if &quot;Inc.&quot; were to be treated as an acronym for

                          &quot;Incorporated&quot;, the         mark has a distinctive identity all its own,
                          immediately apparent to the naked eye. Once, therefore, deceptive
                          similarity is established, violation of the proprietorial right, of the

                          plaintiff, over the            or           trademark, stands made out.
                          Infringement being in the nature of a violation of the proprietorial
                          right of the owner of a registered trade mark, a case of infringement
                          stands, thereby, prima facie established.

                           46.9 In Kaviraj Pt. Durga Dutt Sharma6, the Supreme Court held
                          that the &quot;resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea
                          represented by the plaintiff&#x27;s mark&quot;. Any one of these similarities
                          would, therefore, be sufficient to make out a case of infringement. In
                          the present case, the defendants&#x27; mark is, at least visually as well as
                          qua the basic idea thereof, starkly similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s marks.
                          Even phonetically, it cannot be said that &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot; and
                          &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; are wholly dissimilar, especially given the fact that
                          the opening word of both expressions is the same.

<p id="p_98">                          46.10 Mr Sharma, on behalf of the defendant, sought to contend that
                          there was no overlap in the goods on which the defendant used its
                          mark and those on which the plaintiff did so, as the products of the
                          defendant, except for Hand Sanitizer and Charcoal Face Pack, were
                          DIY items, whereas the plaintiff&#x27;s products were ready to use. To my
                          mind, this makes little, if any, difference. Both make cosmetics and
                          toilet preparations. The &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; aspect of the defendant&#x27;s
                          products pertains to the mode of use of the product, and not to the
                          nature of the product itself. In any event, both the products being
                          cosmetics, and the marks being similar visually as well as by idea
                          association, the existence of infringement cannot be gainsaid merely
                          because the defendants&#x27; products are DIY and the plaintiff&#x27;s ready to
                          use. With the expansion of product portfolios in nearly every stream
                          of business, such diversity is often encountered in different products
                          of the same manufacturer. For example, it is a matter of common
                          knowledge that the same pharma company may be manufacturing
                          syrups both as ready solutions or emulsions, or as suspensions which

                          facie case of infringement. Viewed from the perspective of a person
                          of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the marks, in my

                          deliberate, injunction must follow suit. This position of law is thus
                          pithily, and unequivocally, stated, by the Supreme Court, in <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_32">Midas
                          Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd v. Sudhir Bhatia26</a>:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                                     &quot;The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of
                                     infringement either of trademark or copyright, normally an
                                     injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is not
                                     sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The
                                     grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie
                                     appears that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest.&quot;

                          There are decisions, of this Court as well as of other High Courts, on
                          similar lines; however, given the categorical exposition of the legal
                          position by the Supreme Court, in the afore-extracted passage, it is not
                          necessary to advert thereto.

<p id="p_103">                          47.2 The similarity in design and idea identity between the
                          expressions &quot;Nature&#x27;s Essence&quot; and &quot;Natures Tattva&quot;, and usage of
                          the &quot;leaf insignia&quot;, prima facie lead me to believe that the
                          infringement, by the defendants, of the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark, was not
                          innocent or coincidental.         A deliberate attempt to encash on the
                          goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff appears to have been made by
                          the defendants. Though, as already noticed at the commencement of
                          this judgement, no relief, qua passing off, has been sought in the
                          plaint, this factor becomes relevant when one assesses whether the
                          imitation, by the defendants, of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, was unintentional

                          produced only one solitary invoice, dated 3rd December, 2015,
                          referring to any &quot;Nature&#x27;s Tattva&quot; product, with their written
                          statement, to claim user since 2015, with no explanation as to how all
                          three copies of the invoices were in the possession of the defendants,
                          also merits consideration.    In any event, the plaintiff has a valid

                          registration, of the        mark since 24th November, 2009, and of the

                                 mark at least since 27th October, 2016, being the dates of the
                          Certificates of Registration issued by the Trade Marks Registry in
                          respect of the said marks. As against this, the defendant had applied

                          for registration of their        mark only on 26th April, 2018. Till
                          date, the mark remains unregistered. No credible evidence of prior

                          user, by the defendants, of their          mark is forthcoming on the
                          record, as all invoices, save and except for the single invoice dated 3rd
                          December, 2015, which make reference to any &quot;Natures Tattva&quot;
                          product, are of 2018, 2019 and 2020. I may note, in this context, that,
