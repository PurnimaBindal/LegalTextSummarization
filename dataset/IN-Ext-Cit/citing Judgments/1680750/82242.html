<p id="p_1">      The issue that crops up for consideration in these two writ

petitions is as to whether the Mayyannur Central Mopla Upper

Primary School is a minority institution so that      its manager can

appoint a Headmaster of his choice for the school, overlooking

seniority of the petitioners in the two writ petitions. The facts from

which the above issue arises may be summarised as follows:

</p><p id="p_2">      2. Sri. O. Balan, the petitioner in W.P(C) No. 9662/2008, was

working in the school with effect from 6-8-1973.             Sri. K.P.

Raveendran, the 5th respondent in that writ petition entered service

of the school on 1-6-1982. Therefore, Sri. Raveendran was junior to

Sri. Balan. The post of Headmaster of the school fell vacant on 1-6-

2004. Apprehending that overlooking his seniority, the manager is

likely to appoint the junior teacher as Headmaster, Sri. Balan

submitted Ext. P1 representation dated 7-6-2004 before the Assistant

Educational officer. By Ext. P2 communication dated 31-7-2007, Sri.

Balan was informed by the AEO that the manager had appointed Sri.

Raveendran as Headmaster from 1-6-2004 and approval for the same

was declined by order dated 11-6-2004, in which order it was also

stated that Sri. Balan is the person entitled to be appointed as the

Headmaster of the school. Challenging the order of the AEO, declining

approval for the appointment of Sri. Raveendran as Headmaster of the

school, the manager filed an appeal before the DEO claiming that the

school is a minority institution and therefore the manager is entitled

to appoint a qualified teacher of his choice as the Headmaster of the

school. By Ext. P3 order dated 6-10-2004, the DEO rejected the

appeal stating that the jurisdiction to decide whether the school is a

minority school vests with the Government and since presently the

school is under a management whose minority status has not been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08       -: 2 :-</span>

recognised,    the   appointment of Sri. Raveendran as Headmaster

cannot be approved. Since the manager did not appoint Sri. Balan as

Headmaster, despite direction by the AEO, Sri. Balan filed W.P(C)

No. 31075/2004 for a direction to the manager to comply with the

order of the AEO. In that writ petition the manager submitted that he

has challenged the order of the DEO in a revision petition and the

Government had, by Ext. P5 order dated         10-12-2004, stayed the

orders of the AEO and the DEO. The manager also filed Ext. P4

petition before the Government seeking a declaration of the minority

status of the school. Sri. Balan again filed W.P(C) No. 36837/2004

and against the judgment in that writ petition, W.A.No. 587/2005. By

Ext. P6 judgment, this Court disposed of that writ appeal, directing

the Government to decide the status of the school. In that judgment,

it was held that if the Government decides that the school is not a

minority school, Sri. Balan would be entitled to get all service benefits

including pay and allowances from 1-6-2004 as Headmaster, which is

to be borne by the institution. Before the Government, both sides

adduced evidence and Sri. Mathew John, Under Secretary to the

Government , who heard the parties, prepared Ext. P8 hearing note in

which it was recorded that the school cannot be granted minority

status under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_1">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution of India and the request

of the manager to declare the school as minority school is rejected.

But, by Ext. P9 order, Sri. P.J. Thomas, the Principal Secretary to the

Government, after observing that 'it is true that it (the school) was

established by a non-muslim and it was purchased by the Muslim

Vidyabhyasa Sanghom, the present management of the school in

1985, from the founder manager', held that the school was established

and administered for the benefit of a minority community and the

school is eligible for minority status. In the meanwhile, Sri. Balan

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08       -: 3 :-</span>

retired from service. However, in view of the observation in Ext. P6

judgment, he challenged Ext. P9 order by filing W.P(C) No.

22337/2005.     Sri. K. Bhaskaran,      the petitioner in W.P(C) No.

11407/2008, another teacher of the school, who was also senior to Sri.

Raveendran, aspiring for promotion as Headmaster, also challenged

the very same order, by filing W.P(C) No. 22857/2005. Both the writ

petitions were heard together and disposed of by Ext. P11 judgment,

finding that the order of the Government cannot be sustained in the

face of the finding that the school was established by a non-muslim

and yet the Government proceeded to confer minority status on the

school. Accordingly, Ext. P9 order was quashed and the Government

was directed to re-consider the matter after hearing the two

petitioners, the manager and Sri. Reaveendran.          Thereafter, the

Government re-considered the matter, after hearing the parties, and

by Ext. P14 order, again decided that the school is eligible for

minority status. The very same order is produced by Sri. Bhaskaran

in W.P(C) No. 11407/2008. The petitioners are challenging that order

in these two writ petitions and seeking successive promotion as

Headmaster, one after the other, based on seniority, since Sri.

Raveendran is junior to them.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   The manager has filed a counter affidavit in W.P(C) No.

9662/2008, seeking to refute the contentions of both petitioners.

According to him, both petitioners being not the next person entitled

for promotion as Headmaster, the impugned order does not affect

their legal right and therefore the writ petitions are not maintainable.

The contention is that there is another graduate teacher who has a

better claim for promotion as Headmistress.             Regarding Sri.

Bhaskaran, the manager would contend that since he was punished

for misconduct involving misappropriation of public funds, he cannot

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08       -: 4 :-</span>

be promoted as Headmaster of the school, for which contention he

relies on the principle laid down in Ext. R6(c) judgment of this Court

in O.P.No. 28868/2002. He would further contend that the school is a

minority school established by muslims for the benefit of the Muslim

community.     According to him, the school was established by one

Ammed on 30-8-1943 and its original name was Mayyannur Aided

Moppila School.      In 1949, its name was changed to Mayyannur

Moppila School and in 1951, the name was again changed to

Mayyannur Central Moppila School.         Since, it was upgraded as

U.P.School, it was known as Mayyannur Central Moppila Upper

Primary School. According to the manager, even in 1944, Sri. Ammad

was the manager, which is evident from the service book of one

Moidu, copy of which he has produced as Ext. R6(a). He would

contend that Sri. Krishnan became the teacher-cum-manager of the

school from 6-4-1949 and thereafter Mathu became the manager on

1-4-1958.    He relies on Ext. R6(c) service book of the said Sri.

Krishnan in support of this averment. According to him, the school

was established for educating Muslim girls of the area and for 12

years only muslims were admitted in the school. Later also, majority

of the students of the school were muslims. He contends that during

the pre-independence period, the schools in Malabar were divided as

Muslim Range Schools and Hindu Range Schools and separate Range

inspectors supervised the schools. He points out that as per Ext.

R6(g) visit book of the school, a Muslim Range Deputy Inspector

visited the school on 3-11-1943 and expressed satisfaction that the

school is    satisfactorily educating muslim girls.   The school is

following Muslim calendar. Although later the school came into the

hands of one Krishnan Master and his wife Mathu, the same again

came under the management of the Villiappally Muslim Vidyabhyasa

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08         -: 5 :-</span>

Sangham as per sale deed no. 991/1985 of Villiappilly Sub Registrar's

office. The manager submits that from Ext. R4(i) sale deed it is clear

that even during the period when Krishnan Master was the manager

of the school, the property in which the school is situated belonged to

Ammed and Ammed transferred the property while Mathu was the

manager. The contention is that the property of the school at the time

of establishment of the school belonged to one Java Ammed Haji, who

transferred the same to Ammad in 1123 ME (1946 AD) as is clear

from Ext. R6(j). Therefore, according to the manager, the school is a

minority school and therefore the appointment of the 5th respondent

as Headmaster of the school by the manager in exercise of the rights

of a minority institution is perfectly valid and sustainable.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.   The petitioners would strongly dispute the claims of the

manager. They would contend that after examining the evidence

adduced by both sides, the Government had, in Ext. P9, come to the

conclusion that the school was established by a non-muslim and it was

purchased by the Muslim Vidyabhyasa Sangham, the present

management of the school in 1985 from the founder manager. It was

because of that specific finding, Ext. P9 was quashed and the matter

was remanded for fresh consideration, by this Court as per Ext. P11

judgment.     According to them, in Ext. P14, there is no contrary

finding, without which the Government could not have found that the

institution is a minority institution. They submit that there is enough

evidence on record to show tat the school was started by a non-

Muslim viz. V.M. Krishnan Master, who was the founder manager and

was succeeded by his wife Mathu, who was again replaced by

Krishnan Master. They would also rely on the very same documents

produced by the manager, in support of their contention. They would

also rely on Ext. P10 chapter on the history of the school in a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08          -: 6 :-</span>

publication titled "Thodannur Upa Jilla Vidyalaya Charitham"

(Educational History of the Thodannur Sub District), by a team of

authors, which, according to them, would prove that the school was

started by Krishnan Master.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. The veracity of the facts stated in the publication relied upon

by the petitioners is disputed by the manager on the ground that the

same is prepared by Sri. Bhaskaran, one of the petitioners and they

have produced copy of the manuscript of the Chapter in the

publication relating to the school as Ext.             R6(f), which is in his

handwriting.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.   I have considered the rival contentions based on the

materials produced by both sides as also those produced by the DEO

in his counter affidavit dated 25-7-2009, filed as directed by me by

order dated 13-7-2009.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7. Before going into the rival contentions, I may refer to the law

on the subject briefly.     The word "minority schools" is defined in

Section 2(5) of the Kerala Education Act thus:

</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             "The definition of minority school in the Act is wider than
      what is contemplated in <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_4">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_5">Article

      administered' will have to be read conjunctively. This is made
      clear in the decision of the Supreme Court reported in <a href="/doc/1801897/" id="a_6">Azeez
      Basha v. Union of India</a> (AIR 1968 S.C. 662) in which the Supreme

            minority will have the right to administer educational

            that even if the educational institution has been established by
            somebody else, any religious minority would have the right to

      clause came up for consideration before a Division Bench of the

After referring to the Madras High Court decision and <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_14">Article 30</a> of

the Constitution of India, the learned Judge further held thus:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">             "Minorities may be based on religion or language but the
      rights is to establish and then to administer.      The right is not
      available to institution not established by the minority but
      administered by the minority. <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_15">Article 30(IA)</a> also emphasis this
      requirement. Hence, if <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_16">Article 30</a> of the Constitution is the ground
      norm and if that is to be given effect to the words "or
      administered" in S.2(5) of the Kerala Education Act will have to be
      ignored. In a writ petition filed by the management of the minority
      school in which there will not be any prayer to declare S.2(5) of
      the Kerala Education Act unconstitutional to the extent it declares
      institutions administered by the minority also minority institution,
      I would not be justified in striking down the section. Therefore, I
      am of the opinion that S.2(5) of the Kerala Education Act has to be
      read down in conformity with the requirements of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_17">Article 30</a> of the
      Constitution and, so read, the words "or administered" occurring
      in the sub section will have to be ignored. Hence, the 2nd prayer to
      declare that the educational institutions mentioned in Ext.P1 are
      minority schools cannot be granted in this writ petition. Such a
      declaration can be given only if the institution is found to be
      established by a religious or linguistic minority and administered
      by them. With these observations, I feel, O.P.7020 of 1989 can be
      closed."

      in <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_20">Art. 30</a> of the Constitution of India must be read conjunctively.
      As observed by the learned Single Judge, the mere fact that the
      educational institution is now being administered by a minority
      community is not sufficient to claim protection under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_21">Art. 30(1)</a> of
      the Constitution of India.       It must also be proved that the
      institution was established by a minority community. The basic
      fact to be proved is that initially the institution was established by
      a minority community. Establishment in this context means the
      bringing into being of an institution. Therefore, it is quite clear
      that the minority community must have some role to play not only
      in the subsequent administration of an institution, but also in the
      initial establishment of the institution.         Here the minority
      institution is nowhere in the picture in the process of establishing
      the institution. A subsequent entry by the minority community into
      the area will not help them to claim protection under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_22">Art. 30(1)</a> of
      the Constitution of India. In the aforesaid view, we are of the
      opinion that the learned Single judge was right in allowing the
      original petition, quashing Ext. P4 and           declaring that the
      educational institution managed by the first appellant is not a
      minority institution entitled to protection under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_23">Art. 30(1)</a> of the
      Constitution of India. This appeal accordingly fails and we dismiss
      the same."

But, this decision was reversed by the Supreme Court on the question

as to whether simply because the institution was started by an

individual belonging to the minority community, it can be denied

minority status, in <a href="/doc/740302/" id="a_24">St. Thomas U.P.S                    v. Commissioner &amp;

established by a minority. The Supreme Court held thus in paragraph

</p><p id="p_13">      10. In support of their contentions, the petitioners would rely

on a publication by team of authors by name "Thodannur Upajilla

Vidyalaya Charitham" (Educational History of Thodannur                        Sub

District), which contains a chapter on the history of the Mayyannur

Central Mappila U.P. School, photocopies of the relevant pages of

which are produced as Ext. P10 in W.P(C) No. 9662/2008.                       The

introductory chapter of the book details the mode of preparation of

the history as complied from various sources such as references,

interviews,      collecting        documents/official          documents/school

documents/Panchayat          Development        document,      visit   books   of

Educational Officers, statistics, minutes of P.T.As and other

associations, old       photographs         and       correspondence,         old

pictures/publications/intimations etc., unofficial discussions and

debates.     As per this publication,            in 1940, the independence

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08      -: 11 :-</span>

movement had its waves in Mayyannur also. Some socialist minded

youths joined together and discussed about starting a school. One

Mr. Krishnan Master gave leadership for the same. Varayalil Ammed,

Anchanvida Kelappan, Java Ammad Haji, Ottapurakkal Pookkan,

Kolakkandi Kannan and Chamakkandi Unniya Dayyinar supported

him. The school was started on 30th August, 1943. The school was

named Mayyannur Girls Elementary School. The first manager was

V.M. Krishnan Master. When, in 1946, the Muslim Range inspector

inspected the school, in the visit book of the school, it was written

thus: "This school should be so conducted as to make the muslim girls

of the village able to read and write." For the first thirteen years only

muslim girls were admitted. The first Hindu girl was V. M. Sobhana

(daughter of the manager). When V.M. Krishnan Master became

Headmaster in 1953, management was transferred to his wife Mathu

teacher.    From the beginning of the school, at the same place

Madrassa teaching was also conducted, for which a              Madrassa

teacher was given salary by the teachers of the school, which

continued till 1973. On 31-12-1963, classes 6 and 7 were also started.

From then onwards, the name of the school was changed to

Mayyannur Central Mappila U.P. School. From 1977 onwards, the

children of Thanvirul Muslim Orphanage used to be admitted to class

five in the school.     In 1978, the Villiappilly Muslim Vidyabhyasa

Sanghom purchased the school from Mathu and then onwards the

school is under the management of the Sanghom.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      11.   The veracity of this history is strongly disputed by the

manager. According to him, the particular chapter in the publication

containing the history of the school was prepared by Sri. Bhaskaran,

one of the petitioners in these writ petitions and therefore much

credence cannot be given to the same. In support of this contention,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08           -: 12 :-</span>

the manager has produced a copy of a manuscript allegedly in the

handwriting of Sri. Bhaskaran. Although in the original of the

publication (a copy of which was made available to the court by the

petitioners), Sri. Bhaskaran's name is not mentioned anywhere, the

counsel for Sri. Bhaskaran does not dispute that Ext. R6(f) is in the

handwriting of Sri. Bhaskaran.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      12. In view of this dispute, I issued the following direction to

the DEO, on 13-7-3009:

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">      14. I find that the findings of the DEO in his counter affidavit is

supported by the documents produced by him as also those filed by

the manager himself. In fact, the same also supports the history of

the school as per the publication produced by Sri. O. Balan in his writ

petition as Ext. P10, the original of which was produced before the

Court for perusal by the counsel for the petitioner. The manager

claimed that one P. Ammad was the initial manager of the school.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">But, from Ext. R6(d), I find that Sri. P. Ammad was the manager of

Mayyannur Aided Mapila School, in 1944 and 1947. On the other

hand, the same document shows that from 1949 to 1957, V.M.

Krishnan was the manager of the Mayyannur Mopla Girls School and

in 1958, Mathu was the manager. Again Ext. R6(c) shows that from

1947 to 1953, V.M. Krishnan was the manager. From Ext. R3(b) ,

which is also a teacher's service register as in the case of Exts. R3(d)

and R6(e), would go to show that in 1944 also V.M. Krishnan Master

was the manager of the school.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      15. Ext. R6(i) is the sale deed executed by Mathu in favour of

Villiappully Muslim Vidyabhyasa Sangham, by which the property

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08      -: 17 :-</span>

comprised of the school was transferred in 1985.        That document

recites that    Mathu was running the Mayyannur Central Mappila

School as its manager and correspondent, which was sold to the

Sangham. It again states that one Ammad sold his rights over the

property in favour of Mathu by sale deed no. 18 of 1962. That Ammad

got rights over the property by Ext. R6(j) document no. 56 of 1961

from Madathil Ammad Haji. Although Exts.R6(i) and R6(j) documents

have been produced by the manager to prove that Ammad was the

owner of the property, those documents actually go to show that till

1985 Mathu was the manager of the school. Although an attempt was

made by the manager to show that Ammad was the manager of the

school, in view of the counter affidavit of the DEO, it is clear that he

was the manager of the Mayyannur Mopila L.P. School which was

closed as per G.O.484/65 dated 1-9-1965. From Ext. R6(d) Teacher's

Service Register of one Moidu also, it is seen that Ammad was the

manager of Mayyannur Aided Mapila School. As such, the manager

could not    succeed in his attempt to show that Ammad was the

founder manager of the school and not V.M. Krishnan Master.

Although there is no clinching evidence to show that V.M. Krishnan

Master was the founder manager, from the evidence available, it is

the most probable conclusion, in so far as there is evidence to show

that at least in 1944 he was the manager and he,         later his wife

Mathu and again he were the managers of the school, successively. It

is all the more so, since the manager could not produce any evidence

to show that anybody else was the manager of the school in 1943.

Further, the case set up by the manager that Ammad was the founder

manager is clearly disproved by the counter affidavit of the DEO and

the documents available.    In fact, the findings of the Government in

Ext. P9 was also that the school was established by a non-muslim, and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08          -: 18 :-</span>

the Muslim Vidyabhyasa Sangham purchased the school from the

founder manager in the year 1985.             As  such, it can be safely

concluded that the school was established by a Hindu and not by a

minority community or any individual of a minority community.

Therefore, the first of the twin requirements for conferring minority

status on this particular school is clearly absent in this case, without

which the Government could not have validly held that the institution

is a minority institution as done in Ext. P14. Since for being eligible

for minority status an educational institution should satisfy both tests,

even if the 2nd test is satisfied, the school cannot be conferred with the

status of a minority educational institution.        Therefore, it is not

necessary to examine whether the 2nd test is satisfied. Accordingly,

Ext. P14 order of the Government is quashed and it is declared that

the Mayyannur Central Mappila U.P. School, of which the 6th

respondent is the manager is not a minority institution. Consequently,

the 6th respondent is not entitled to appoint a teacher of his choice as

Headmaster of the school overlooking seniority among the eligible

teachers.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      16.    The next question is as to         the reliefs to which the

petitioners are entitled. As far as Sri. O. Balan (the petitioner in W.P

(C) No. 9662/2008) is concerned, there is no difficulty. Admittedly,

when the vacancy of Headmaster arose in the school on 1-6-2004, he

was the senior-most teacher in the school. Although the manager

would contend that Smt. Vilasini, a graduate teacher with more than 5

years' service and half of the service of Sri. Balan was available, who

is entitled to be promoted in preference to Sri. Balan, as per Rule 45

of Chapter XIVA of the Kerala Education Rules, the manager has not

chosen to produce any material in support of the said contention.

There is no evidence to show that Amt. Vilasini has raised such a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P.C. Nos.9662 &amp; 11407/08        -: 19 :-</span>

claim also. A Division Bench of this Court had in Ext. P6 judgment

held that if the Government find that the school is not a minority

institution, Sri. O. Balan would be entitled to get all service benefits

including pay and allowances from 1-6-2004 onwards, which is to be

borne by the institution.     That     judgment has become final and

therefore Sri. Balan is entitled to the fruits of that judgment, in view

of my finding that the school is not a minority institution.

</p><p id="p_24">      17.    In respect of Sri. Bhaskaran, the manager takes a

contention that since, as evidenced by Exts.R6(b) series of documents,

he was imposed with the punishment of barring of two increments for

misconducts involving financial irregularity of a very serious nature,

he is not fit for being promoted as Headmaster. He relies on Ext. R6

</p><p id="p_25">(c)   judgment for the proposition that although promotion as

Headmaster is by seniority, the manager can take into account the

punishment to decide whether Sri. Bhaskaran is suitable for

promotion. But, it is admitted that Ext. R6(c) judgment is pending in

appeal before a Division Bench of this Court . I do not propose to

enter a finding regarding the same, since it is for the manager to

take a decision in that regard in the first instance.
