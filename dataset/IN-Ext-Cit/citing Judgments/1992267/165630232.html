	By means of this petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the petitioners have challenged the notification dated 14-02-2005 issued under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_2">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') read with <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_3">Section 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_4">Section 17(4)</a> published in newspaper on 19-03-2005 as well as notification dated 16-03-2006 issued under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_5">Section 6</a> of the Act for acquisition of plots no. 416, 427, 428, 457, 458 &amp; 461 having an area of 0.911 hectare for construction of 80 ft. wide road. 	
</p> 
<p id="p_3">	We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, Sri Pradeep Kumar Tripathi, learned counsel for respondent no. 1 and  learned Standing Counsel for respondents no.  2  to 4.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">	Factual matrix of the case giving rise to the dispute are as under :
</p> 
<p id="p_5">	A notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_6">Section 4</a> of the Act was issued for alleged public purpose i.e. planned development by construction of 80 ft. road, in the official gazette of the State of Uttar Pradesh dated 14-02-2005 read with <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_7">Section 17(1)</a>  and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_8">17(4)</a> of the Act invoking the urgency clause and dispensing the filing of objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_9">Section 5A</a> of the Act. The substance of the said notification was published in Hindi newspaper 'Dainik Aaj' on 19-03-2005. Declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_10">Section 6</a> was published in the official gazette on 16-03-2006. The substance of the said notification was published in local Hindi newspaper 'Dainik Jagran' on 22-03-2006.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">	The petitioners claim that they are owners in possession of the land sought to be acquired and having purchased the same, have constructed their residential house about two decades ago and are living with their family members. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">	The acquisition is sought to be challenged on several grounds including the following :
</p> 
<p id="p_8">(I)That the the petitioners have already constructed dwelling house and as per the policy of the State Government, the residential structure are exempted from acquisition.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_9">(II)That the State Government has arbitrarily invoked <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_11">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_12">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act and deprived them from raising objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_13">Section 5A</a> of the Act. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_10">(III)That the alleged public purpose for which the land is sought to be acquired is non-existent inasmuch as by invoking <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_14">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_15">Section 17(4)</a> dispensing of filing the objection, they have been deprived of a reasonable opportunity of being heard and to establish that there is no need of acquiring the land in dispute.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_11">(IV)That there is already existence of 150 ft. wide road known as 'Awas Vikash - Panki Kalyanpur Road and parallel to the said road, Kanpur Development Authority itself has constructed a 20 ft. wide road inside the colony known as 'Canal Road' and just after the 20 ft. road,  80 ft. road has been proposed for which acquisition is being made and thus the same is useless for the purpose 
 

 
	In support of the challenge to invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_16">Section 17(1)</a> &amp; (4) of the Act, the petitioners have made detailed averments in the writ petition and raised specific grounds, which are extracted below :
</p> 

 
<p id="p_12">"7.  That there is no occasion to invoke the urgency clause and to apply the provisions of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The only purpose of invoking <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> is to deprive the valuable rights under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_19">Section 5-A</a> of the Act and thereby escaping the obligation to consider the objections against the proposal for acquisition. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_13">8.  That the plea of urgency is belied by the fact that even though the notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_20">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act was on 8.3.2004 but was issued in Gazette Notification on 14.2.2005 and published in Dainik Aaj Newspaper on 19.3.2005, although the time for filing objection was only 21 days under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_21">Section 5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act as amended by <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_22">U.P. Act</a> No. XXII of 1954 and likewise notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_23">Section 6</a> was issued after about a year. Thus the aforesaid notifications are tainted with malafide and uncalled for the showing purpose of acquisition. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_14">9.   That mere existence of urgency under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_24">Section 17(1)</a> Land Acquisition Act would not by itself is sufficient for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_25">Section 5-A</a> inquiry inasmuch as the intention of the legislature is to provide opportunity of hearing to the interested person in case of his land is taken but there is no application of mind in the present case from the opposite parties because no plot inspection was made by them and constructing of a third road in presence of two parallel road on the spot belied their claim of urgency in constructing a third road.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_15">11.   That moreover the issuance of Notification under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_26">Section 17</a> (1) and 17 (4) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_27">Land Acquisition Act</a> is non existing in as much as Respondent no. 1 has already parellel 150 F. wife road known as Awas Vikas/Kalyanpur road and 20 F. wide Canal road which are just parallel to the scheme of the  present acquisition and as such the scheme itself is a colourable exercise of jurisdiction of the opposite party no. 1 for constructing the road of 80 F. wife just to satisfy and to safeguard the interest of some interested person and that too under political pressure."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_16">15.   That so far as the process of acquisition is concerned the opposite parties are taking their own time which would be evident from the fact that the Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_28">Section 4</a> (1) read with <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_29">section 17</a> (4) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_30">Land Acquisition Act</a> was issued on 14.2.2005 in Gazette notification while same was published after 35 days on 19.3.2005 in Newspaper and thereafter Section 6 of the Notification was issued about a year thereafter on 22.3.2006 in Dainik Jagaran while the limitation for filing objection was only 23 days under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_31">Section 5-A</a> as amended <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_32">Land Acquisition Act</a>. But the opposite parties have deprived the petitioners to file objection in the name of urgency although they took about 13 months in finalising the scheme and this conduct of opposite parties falsified of acquisition of land in dispute."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_17">16.   That the conclusion becomes in evitable that the action of dispensing with enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_33">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in the present case was not based on any real and genuine subjective satisfaction depending upon any relevant datas available to the State Authorities at the time when they issued impugned notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> (1) of the Act of the land acquisition and dispensed with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_35">Section 5-A</a> enquiry by resorting to <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_36">Section 17</a> (4) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_37">Land Acquisition Act</a> and without application of mind issued notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_38">Section 6</a> Land Acquisition Act."

	Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_46">Dev Saran &amp; others v. State of U.P</a>., (2011) 4 SCC 769 has observed as under : 
</p> 
<p id="p_35">"16.	The concept of "public purpose" cannot remain static for all time to come. The concept, even though sought to be defined under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_47">Section 3(f)</a> of the Act, is not capable of any precise definition. The said definition, having suffered several amendments, has assumed the character of an inclusive one. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_36">17.	It must be accepted that in construing "public purpose", a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people. Any attempt by the State to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people, especially of the common people, defeats the very concept of public purpose. Even though the concept of public purpose was introduced by preconstitutional legislation, its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the directive principles."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_37">	In view of the definition of the "public purpose" contained in the Act and interpretation given to it by the Hon'ble Apex Court, the construction of a road would fall under the planned development for a public purpose and there can be no dispute about the same. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_38">	The next question arises for consideration whether the State Government can be said to be justified for invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_48">Section 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_49">17</a> (4) of the Act and dispensing with the inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_50">Section 5-A</a> of the Act on account of urgency in the matter. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_39">	<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_51">Section 5-A</a> of the Act provides for hearing of objections. The said Section embodies the most important dimension of the rules of natural justice laying down that any person interested in any land notified under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_52">Section 4(1)</a> may, within 30 days of publication of the same, file objection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or any land in the locality before the Collector. Section further provides that the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of hearing either in person or by any person authorised by him or by pleader. After hearing the objector and making such further inquiry as he may think necessary, the Collector has to make a report in respect of the land notified under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_53">Section 4(1)</a> with a recommendation on the objections and forward the same to the Government along with record of the proceedings held by him. It is open to the Collector to make different reports in respect of different parcel of the land proposed to be acquired. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_40">	Upon receipt of the report of the Collector, the Government is required to proceed under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_54">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act, which lays down that after considering the report, if any, made under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_55">Section 5-A(2)</a>, the appropriate Government is satisfied that any particular land is needed for public purpose then a declaration to that effect is to be made in that regard by the Government. This Section also envisages making of different declaration from time to time in respect of different parcel of land covered by the same notification issued under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_56">Section 4(1)</a>. Clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_57">Section 6(1)</a> provides that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_58">Section 4(1)</a> after <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_59">Amendment Act</a>, 1984 can be made after expiry of one year from the date of publication of notification. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_60">The Amendment Act</a>, 1984 was enforced on 24-09-1984. Thus after the said date, no declaration under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_61">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act can be made after expiry of a period of one year from the date of publication of notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_62">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act. In other words, a declaration is required to be made under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_63">Section 6(1)</a> within one year from the date of publication of notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_64">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_65">Section 6(3)</a> provides that declaration made under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_66">Section 6(1)</a> shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the land is needed for public purpose. After publication of the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_67">Section 6</a>, the Collector is required to take order from the State Government for the acquisition of land to be carved out, measured and planned. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_41">	<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_68">Section 9</a> of the Act envisages issuance of public notice and individual notice to the persons interested in the land to file their claim for compensation. 
</p> 
<p id="p_42">	<a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_69">Section 11</a> of the Act provides for holding of an inquiry into the claim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into consideration the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_70">Section 23</a>. 
</p> 
<p id="p_43">	<a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_71">Section 16</a> of the Act lays down that after an award is made, the Collector can take possession of the land, which thereafter shall vest in the Government free from all encumbrances.
</p> 
<p id="p_44">	<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_72">Section 17</a> vests with the Government special power in case of urgency. <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_73">Section 17(1)</a> postulates taking of possession of land without making an award. In case the appropriate government comes to the conclusion that land proposed to be acquired is urgently needed for public purpose then it can authorise  the competent authority to take possession. <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_74">Section 17(2)</a> contemplates a different type of urgency in which the State Government can authorise taking of possession even before expiry of fifteen days period specified in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_75">Section 17(1)</a>. <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_76">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act lays down that in case where appropriate Government comes to the conclusion that there exists urgency and unforeseen emergency, it can direct that provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_77">Section 5-A</a> shall not apply. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_45">	<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_78">Section 5-A</a> vis-a-vis <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_79">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act have been subject matter of interpretation by the Hon'ble Apex Court in large number of decisions.  The importance of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_80">Section 5-A</a> was emphasized by the Hon'ble Apex Court as long back as in 1964. In the case of of <a href="/doc/1296240/" id="a_81">Nandeshwar Prasad v. State of U.P</a>., AIR 1964 SC 1217, while considering rights under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_82">Section 5-A</a>, vis-a-vis <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_83">Section 17</a> of the Act, it was observed as under :
</p> 
<p id="p_46">	"The right to file objection under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_84">Section 5-A</a> is a substantial right when a person's property is being threatened with acquisition and we cannot accept that the right can be taken away as it by a side wind."
</p> 
	
 
<p id="p_47">	<a href="/doc/1564044/" id="a_85">In  Munshi  Singh  v. Union of  India</a>  (1973)  2  SCC  337,  the  three Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court emphasised the importance of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_86">Section 5A</a> in the following words:
</p> 
<p id="p_48">       "7. ............Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_87">Section 5-A</a> makes it obligatory   on   the   Collector   to   give   an   objector   an   opportunity   of   being  heard. After hearing all objections and making further inquiry  he is to make a report to the appropriate Government containing his   recommendation   on   the   objections.   The   decision   of   the   appropriate   Government   on   the   objections   is   then   final.   The   declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_88">Section 6</a> has to be made after the appropriate Government is satisfied, on a consideration of the report, if any,  made   by   the   Collector   under   <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_89">Section   5-A(2)</a>.   The   legislature  has,   therefore,   made   complete   provisions   for   the   persons  interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and  for the disposal of their objections. It is only in cases of urgency that   special   powers   have   been   conferred   on   the   appropriate  Government   to   dispense   with   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_90">Section   5-A</a>."                                                                                  
</p> 

 
<p id="p_49">	 <a href="/doc/354241/" id="a_91">In State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh</a> (1980) 2 SCC 471, the Hon'ble Apex Court emphasized the necessity of reasonableness and fairness in the State action of invoking the urgency provision in the following words:
</p> 

 
<p id="p_50">       "it is fundamental that compulsory taking of a man's  property is a serious matter and the smaller the man the more  serious   the   matter.   Hearing   him   before   depriving   him   is   both reasonable and pre-emptive of arbitrariness, and denial of this  administrative   fairness   is   constitutional   anathema   except   for  good reasons. Save in real urgency where public interest does   not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land  acquisition authorities should not, having regard to Articles 14 (and 19), burke an enquiry under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_92">Section 17</a> of the Act. Here a  slumbering   process,   pending   for   years   and   suddenly   exciting        itself   into   immediate   forcible   taking,   makes   a   travesty   of  emergency power."

The  person interested, or known to be interested, in the land is to be  served personally of the notification, giving him the opportunity  of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right. That the objection  is to be in writing, is indicative  of the fact  that   the   enquiry  into   the   objection  is  to  focus   his   individual  cause as well as public cause.

</p> 
<p id="p_57">	"31.  <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_105">Section 17(4)</a> as noticed above, provides that in cases where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there exists an urgency or unforseen emergency as required under sub-section (1) or (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_106">Section 17</a>, it may direct that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_107">Section 5-A</a> shall not apply and if such direction is given then <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_108">Section 5-A</a> inquiry can be dispensed with and a declaration may be made under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_109">Section 6</a> on publication of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_110">Section 4(1)</a> notification and possession can be made.  
</p> 

 
<p id="p_58">32.	A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows that mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_111">Section 17(4)</a>, that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of the <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_112">Section 5-A</a> inquiry. It requires an opinion to be formed by the Government concerned that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency that there is also a need for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_113">Section 5-A</a> enquiry which indicates that the legislature intended the appropriate government to apply its mind before dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_114">Section 5-A</a> enquiry. It also indicates that mere existence of an urgency under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_115">Section 17(1)</a> or unforeseen emergency under <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_116">Section 17(2)</a> would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_117">Section 5-A</a> enquiry. If that was not the intention of the legislature then the latter part of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_118">Section 17</a> would not have been necessary and the legislature in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_119">Sections 17(1)</a> and (2) itself could have incorporated that in such situation of existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency automatically <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_120">Section 5-A</a> enquiry will be dispensed with. But then that is not the language of the Section which in our opinion requires the appropriate Government to further consider the need for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_121">Section 5-A</a> enquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency. This understanding of ours as to the requirement of an application of mind by the appropriate Government while dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_122">Section 5-A</a> enquiry does not mean that in each and every case when there is an urgency contemplated under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_123">Section 17(1)</a> and unforeseen emergency contemplated under <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_124">Section 17(2)</a> exists that by itself would not contain the need for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_125">Section 5-A</a> enquiry. It is possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate Government under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_126">Section 17(1)</a> or the unforeseen emergency under <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_127">Section 17(2)</a> itself may be of such degree that it could require the appropriate Government on that very basis to dispense with the inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_128">Section 5-A</a> but then there is a need for application of mind by the appropriate Government that such an urgency for dispensation of the <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_129">Section 5-A</a> inquiry is inherent in the two types of urgencies contemplated under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_130">Sections 17(1)</a> and (2) of the Act."

</p> 
<p id="p_62"> "43. The exceptional and extraordinary power of doing away with an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_144">Section 5-A</a> in a case where possession of the land   is   required   urgently   or   in   an   unforeseen   emergency   is  provided in <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_145">Section 17</a> of the Act. Such power is not a routine  power   and   save   circumstances   warranting   immediate  possession   it   should   not   be   lightly   invoked.   The   guideline   is inbuilt in <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_146">Section 17</a> itself for exercise of the exceptional power in dispensing with enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_147">Section 5-A</a>. Exceptional the  power,   the   more   circumspect   the   Government   must   be   in   its exercise. The Government obviously, therefore, has to apply its mind before it dispenses with enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_148">Section 5-A</a> on the       aspect   whether   the   urgency   is   of   such   a   nature   that   justifies  elimination of summary enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_149">Section 5-A</a>".
</p> 

 
<p id="p_63">"44. A repetition of the statutory phrase in the notification that the  State   Government   is   satisfied   that   the   land   specified   in   the   notification   is   urgently   needed   and   the   provision   contained   in <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_150">Section   5-A</a>   shall   not   apply,   though   may   initially   raise   a  presumption   in   favour   of   the     Government   that   prerequisite       conditions for exercise of such power have been satisfied, but such   presumption   may   be   displaced   by   the   circumstances hemselves   having   no   reasonable   nexus   with   the   purpose   for which   the   power   has   been   exercised.   Upon   challenge   being made   to   the   use   of   power   under   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_151">Section   17</a>,   the   Government       must   produce   appropriate   material   before   the   Court   that   the opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_152">Section 5-A</a> has been formed by the Government after due application of mind on the material placed before it".
</p> 

 
<p id="p_64">"45. It   is   true   that   power   conferred   upon   the   Government   under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_153">Section   17</a>   is   administrative   and   its   opinion   is   entitled   to   due  weight, but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency   based   on   considerations   not   germane   to   the   purpose, the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_65">"46. As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be invoked   are   specified   in   <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_154">Section   17(2)</a>   but   circumstances necessitating invocation of urgency under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_155">Section 17(1)</a> are not stated   in   the   provision   itself.   Generally   speaking   the development of an area (for residential purposes) or a planned development   of   city,   takes   many   years if  not   decades   and, therefore,   there   is   no   reason   why   summary   enquiry   as contemplated under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_156">Section 5-A</a> may not be held and objections of   landowners/persons   interested   may   not   be   considered.   In many cases, on general assumption likely delay in completion of   enquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_157">Section   5-A</a>   is   set   up   as   a   reason   for invocation   of   extraordinary   power   in   dispensing   with   the enquiry  little  realizing  that  an important and valuable  right of the person interested in the land is being taken away and with some effort enquiry could always be completed expeditiously."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_66">"47. The special provision has been made in <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_158">Section 17</a> to eliminate enquiry under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_159">Section   5-A</a>   in   deserving   and   cases   of   real urgency. The Government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates  dispensation of enquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_160">Section   5-A</a>.   We   have   already   noticed   a   few decisions  of this Court viz. Narayan Govind Gavate and Pista Devi. In Om Prakash this Court held that the decision in Pista Devi must be confined to the fact situation in those days when it was rendered  and the two-Judge  Bench  could not have laid down a proposition contrary to the decision in Narayan Govind Gavate. We agree."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_67">"48. As   regards   the   issue   whether   pre-notification   and   post-notification   delay   would   render   the   invocation   of   urgency power void, again the case  law is not consistent. The view of this   Court   has   differed   on   this   aspect   due   to   different   fact situation   prevailing   in   those   cases.   In   our   opinion   such   delay will   have   material   bearing   on   the   question   of   invocation   of urgency power, particularly in a situation where no material has been   placed   by   the   appropriate   Government   before   the   Court justifying   that   urgency   was   of   such   nature   that   necessitated elimination of enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_161">Section 5-A</a>."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_68">	On the issue it may be also be pertinent to notice the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/1002007/" id="a_162">Radhy Shyam v. State of U.P. &amp; others</a>, (2011) 5 SCC 553. After analyzing the provisions of the Act and interpretation thereof made by various judicial pronouncements culled out the following principles for invocation of urgency clause by resorting to provisions of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_163">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_164">Section 17(4)</a> dispensing with the filing of objections under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_165">Section 5-A</a> of the Act. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_69">"(i) Eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate property belonging to citizens for public use. To put it differently, the sovereign is entitled to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private property without its owner's consent provided that such assertion is on account of public exigency and for public good. - <a href="/doc/1880952/" id="a_166">Dwarkadas Shrinivas v. Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd</a>., AIR (1954) SC 119, <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_167">Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v.

</p> 

 
<p id="p_70">(ii) The legislations which provide for compulsory acquisition of private property by the State fall in the category of expropriatory legislation and such legislation must be construed strictly - <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_169">DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana</a> (2003) 5 SCC 622; <a href="/doc/1074081/" id="a_170">State of Maharashtra v. B.E. Billimoria</a> (2003) 7 SCC 336 and Dev Sharan v. State of U.P., Civil Appeal No.2334 of 2011 decided on 7.3.2011. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_71">(iii) Though, in exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Government can acquire the private property for public purpose, it must be remembered that compulsory taking of one's property is a serious matter. If the property belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of the society or people suffering from other handicaps, then the Court is not only entitled but is duty bound to scrutinize the action/decision of the State with greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in view the fact that the land owner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of his livelihood and/or shelter. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_72">(iv) The property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities without complying with the mandate of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_171">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_172">5-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_173">6</a> of the Act. A public purpose, however, laudable it may be does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency provisions because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without being heard. Only in a case of real urgency, the State can invoke the urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing the land owner or other interested persons. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_73">(v) <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_174">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_175">Section 17(4)</a> confers extraordinary power upon the State to acquire private property without complying with the mandate of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_176">Section 5-A</a>. These provisions can be invoked only when the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the delay of even few weeks or months. Therefore, before excluding the application of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_177">Section 5-A</a>, the concerned authority must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in conducting inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_178">Section 5-A</a> will, in all probability, frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_74">(vi) The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_179">Section 17(1)</a> and the same can be challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and the records. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_75">(vii) The exercise of power by the Government under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_180">Section 17(1)</a> does not necessarily result in exclusion of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_181">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection. The use of word "may" in sub- section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_182">Section 17</a> makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_183">Section 5-A</a> would not apply to the cases covered under sub-section (1) or (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_184">Section 17</a>. In other words, invoking of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_185">Section 17(4)</a> is not a necessary concomitant of the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_186">Section 17(1)</a>. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_76">(viii) The acquisition of land for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional purposes can be treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the meaning of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_187">Section 4</a> but that, by itself, does not justify the exercise of power by the Government under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_188">Section 17(1)</a> and/or 17(4). The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that planning, execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of residential, commercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take few years. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_77">Therefore, the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency provision contained in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_189">Section 17(1)</a>. In any case, exclusion of the rule of audi alteram partem embodied in <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_190">Section 5-A</a> (1) and (2) is not at all warranted in such matters. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_78">(ix) If land is acquired for the benefit of private persons, the Court should view the invoking of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_191">Section 17(1)</a> and/or 17(4) with suspicion and carefully scrutinize the relevant record before adjudicating upon the legality of such acquisition."
</p> 
	
 
<p id="p_79">	On the touch stone of aforesaid tests laid down by judicial pronouncements in the case in hand also absolutely no material has been produced before us to demonstrate that at the time of formation of opinion by the Government for dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_192">Section 5-A</a> of the Act there was due application of mind on the material which were before the State government. The counter affidavit of the Additional District Magistrate (Land Acquisition), Kanpur Nagar filed on behalf of State respondents is not only sketchy but lacks even a reference to any material which may have been relied upon to formulate the opinion to dispense the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_193">Section 5-A</a>. What has been stated is "that for well and planned development of Kanpur city the land in dispute has been acquired on the basis of report submitted by respondent no. 1 (Kanpur Development Authority) and after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_194">Section 17</a> urgency clause has rightly been used in view of the fact that land is urgently required by the State Government in order to provide facilities of residential and traffic to the public at large as per demand raised before the Government. The alleged report of Kanpur Development Authority has not been produced. Thus the Court is at a total loss to know that what was the material before the State Government on which there was a proper application of mind to arrive at a conclusion that there was a real urgency in the matter and of such a nature that enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_195">Section 5-A</a> of the Act would have resulted in delay in implementation of project for planned development.

If   that   be   so,   it   was expected   that   pursuant   to   the   requisition   of   14-12-1989   by        NOIDA   invoking   urgency   powers   of   the   State   Government,         consequential notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_201">Section 4(1)</a> would have seen   the light of day at the earliest in connection  with acquisition of  the   proposed   494.26   acres   of   land   for   the   development   of Sector   43   and   other   sectors.   But   curiously   enough,   nothing  happened   urgently   and   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_202">Section   4</a>   notification   which   is  impugned   in   the   present   case   was   issued   on   5-1-1991.  Thus         despite  the invocation of urgency by NOIDA by its letter dated 14-12-1989, it   appears   that   the   State   did   not   think   the   said   proposal to be so urgent as to immediately respond and to issue  notification   under   <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_203">Section   4</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_204">Section   17</a>   sub-section (4) till 5-1-1991. More than one year elapsed in the meantime.  Why this delay took place and why the State did not think it fit to urgently respond to the proposal of NOIDA, has remained a   question   mark   for   which   there   is   no   answer   furnished   by   the   respondent-authorities   in   the   present   cases   and   nothing   is  brought   on   the   record   by   them   to   explain   the   delay.   It   has,  therefore,   necessarily   to   be   presumed   that   despite   the   emergency powers of the State Government being invoked by NOIDA, the State authorities in their wisdom did not think the matter to be so urgent as to immediately respond and promptly  issue <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_205">Section 4</a> notification read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_206">Section 17(4)</a>.   ...  Even   that   apart,   despite   proposal   to   acquire   this   land   was moved by NOIDA as early as on 14-6-1988, and even thereafter when   the   request   was   sent   in   this   communication   on   14-12-1989, the State  authorities  did not think the situation to be so urgent as to respond quickly and could wait for more than one year. When the appellants in the writ petitions  before the High Court raised their grievances regarding dispensing with inquiry under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_207">Section   5-A</a>   being   not   backed   up   by   relevant   evidence and   the   subjective   satisfaction   of   the   State   in   this   connection was brought in challenge, all that was stated by NOIDA in its counter in para 26 was to the effect that the contents of paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition were denied and that the petitioners were not able to point out any lacunae in the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_208">Land Acquisition Act</a>. The position was no better so far as the counter of the State authorities was concerned. In para 24 of the counter before the High Court, all that was stated was that paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition were denied. When we turn to paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition, we find averments to the effect   that   the   urgency   of   the   acquisition   was   only   for   the purpose   of   depriving   the   petitioners   of   their   rights   to   file objections   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_209">Section   5-A</a>   and   their   right   to   hold   the possession till they got compensation for which the respondents had   issued   notification   under   <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_210">Section   17(1)</a>   as   well   as notification <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_211">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. But so far as  the process of the acquisition was concerned,  the respondents  were taking their own time, which would be evident from the fact that the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_212">Section 4</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_213">Section 17(4)</a> was issued on   5-1-1991 but   was published in the newspaper  on 30-3-1991, whereas the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_214">Section 6</a> of the Act was made   on   7-1-1992   and   that   on   the   one   hand,   the   respondents had   deprived   the   petitioners   of   filing   their   objections   under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_215">Section 5-A</a> of the Act on the ground of urgency of acquisition, but   on   the   other   hand,   they   themselves   had   taken   more   than nine   months   in   issuing   the   declaration   under   <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_216">Section   6</a>   of   the said Act. This conduct of the respondents falsified their claim of urgency of acquisition....The   additional   material   which   was   produced   before   the   High Court was by way of Annexures CA-3, CA-4 and CA-5. When we   turn   to   these   annexures,   we   find   that   AnnexureCA-3   is   a letter   dated   21-4-1990 written   by   the   District   Magistrate, Ghaziabad,   to   the   Joint   Secretary,   Industries,   Government   of Uttar Pradesh. It recites that on examination, it was found that the land was immediately required in public interest so that the  development   work   in   the   said   land   could   be   carried   out  smoothly.  What was the nature of urgency is not mentioned in   the   said   letter.   Therefore,   the   position   remains   as   vague   as   it  was   earlier.   When   we   turn   to   Annexure   CA-4   which   is   dated 12-6-1990,   we   find   that   the   District   Magistrate,   Ghaziabad  wrote to the Joint Secretary, Industries, State of U.P., that as to how many farmers were going to be affected by the proposed  acquisition. It does not even whisper about the urgency of the situation   which   requires   dispensing   with   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_217">Section   5-A</a>   inquiry. The last, Annexure CA-5 is the letter dated 14-12-1989 written by   NOIDA   to   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   proposing   urgent  acquisition   of  the   lands   in  question.   We   have   already   made  a reference to the said letter. It recites that if immediate action for acquisition   of   the   aforesaid   lands   adjacent   to   Sector   43   for development of which the acquisition was to be resorted to was not taken, then there was possibility of encroachment over the  area cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be a  germane   ground   for   invoking   urgency   powers   for   dispensing  with   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_218">Section   5-A</a>   inquiry.   Even   if   acquisition   takes   place urgently by dispensing with inquiry  under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_219">Section 5-A</a> and the  possession is taken urgently after <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_220">Section 6</a> notification within  15 days of issuance of notice under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_221">Section 9</a> sub-section (1),  even then there is no guarantee that the acquired land would not  be   encroached   upon   by   unruly   persons.   It   is   a   law   and   order   problem   which   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   acquisition   and  urgency   for   taking   possession.   Even   that   apart,   it   is   easy   to  visualize that if objectors are heard in connection with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_222">Section   5-A</a>   inquiry   they   would   be   the   best   person   to   protect   their  properties   against   encroachers.   Consequently,   the   ground   put forward by NOIDA  in its written request dated 14-12-1989 for  invoking     urgency   powers   must   be   held   to   be   totally  irrelevant..............."

<p id="p_82">15. 	So far as the present proceedings are concerned, the situation was tried to be salvaged further in the counter- affidavit filed on behalf of NOIDA. Its working secretary Ram Shankar has filed a counter-affidavit in the present proceedings explaining the necessity to apply emergency provisions. It has been averred in para 9 of the counter to the effect that what necessitated application of emergency provisions was imminent possibility of unauthorised construction and/or encroachment upon the suit land which would have hammered the speedy and planned industrial development of the area which was the purpose of acquisition proceedings. This stand is in line with the earlier stand of NOIDA in its written requisition dated 14th December, 1989. We have already seen that the said stand reflects a ground which is patently irrelevant for the purpose of arriving at the relevant subjective satisfaction by the State authorities about dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_223">Section 5-A</a> inquiry. We could have appreciated the stand of the State authorities for invoking urgency clause under <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_224">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act on the ground that when about 500 acres of land were to be acquired for further planned development of Sector 43 and other sectors of Noida, as mentioned in the impugned notification, hearing of objectors who might have filed written objections when there are large number of occupants of these lands and who possess about 438 plots of land under acquisition, would have indefinitely delayed the acquisition proceedings and years would have rolled by before <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_225">Section 6</a> notification could have been issued. Under these circumstances, the entire further development of the area would have, on the peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases, come to a grinding halt. Such a stand would have justified the subjective satisfaction of the authorities for invoking <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_226">Section 17</a> (4) of the Act. Such satisfaction then could not have been gone behind by court of law. But unfortunately for the respondents such was not their case nor did they even whisper in these cases that these aspects were kept in view while dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_227">Section 5-A</a> inquiry. The court cannot obviously, therefore, make out a new case for them which is not pleaded in these proceedings to justify their action.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_83">16. 	In the light of the aforesaid factual position emerging on the record of the case it becomes clear that there was no relevant material before the State authorities when it invoked powers under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_228">section 17</a> for dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_229">Section 5-A</a> inquiry while issuing the impugned notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_230">Section 4</a> followed by <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_231">Section 6</a> notification of 7.1.92."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_84">	It is an altogether different question that after laying down the above law, the Hon'ble Apex Court did not quash the notifications instead relegated the appellants to avail the remedy before the State Government under <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_232">Section 48</a> of the Act, and that was done on peculiar facts of the said case as has been observed in paragraph 29 of the reports. 
</p> 
	
 
<p id="p_85">	In view of above legal position settled by judicial pronouncements and facts of the case in hand, we have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion that there has been no application of mind by the State Government to form an opinion that there was extreme urgency in the matter to invoke the provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_233">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act, and to eliminate the enquiry provided by <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_234">Section 5-A</a> of the Act, as the State Government has completely failed to justify the dispensation of enquiry prescribed by <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_235">Section 5-A</a> by invoking <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_236">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. 
</p> 
	
 
<p id="p_86">	Another issue which draws our attention is whether time gap in issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_237">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_238">6</a> and delay would render the invocation of urgency power void. The facts as noted above go to show that last date of publication of notification is 19.3.2005 when it was published in Hindi daily 'Aaj'. Declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_239">Section 6</a> of the Act in official gazette was made on 16.03.2006 i.e. after 11 months and 27 days. It just fell short of 4 days in getting hit by the provisions of clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_240">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act providing a limitation of one year in publication of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_241">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_242">6(1)</a> of the Act. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_87">	The State Government as well as Development Authority have failed to place on record the material to indicate when the proposal was sent to the Government. However, it is admitted in the counter affidavit that indexing in respect of notification was done on 08.03.2004 which means that in 2004 pre-notification exercise was underway. State Government took full one year to issue notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_243">Section 4</a> read with <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_244">Section 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_245">17(4)</a> and thereafter, further almost one year in making the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_246">Section 6</a> of the Act.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_88">	The slow pace at which the State Government functioned in processing the acquisition and the time spent in pre-notification process as well as in time gap in notifications under Section <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_247">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_248">6</a> clearly demonstrates that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_249">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act, and the same has been done in a routine manner mechanically. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_89">	The view taken by us finds support from the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in the case of Anand Singh (Supra) and Radhey Shyam (Supra). In the case of Dev Sharan vs. State of U.P., (Supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as under, which again goes to support the view being taken by us. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_90">	"This Court has also held that in view of ratio in <a href="/doc/1481537/" id="a_250">Union of India vs. Mukesh Hans</a>, sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_251">Section 17</a> cannot be pressed into service by officers who are negligent and lethargic in initiating acquisition proceedings." 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_91">	The only possible conclusion which can be drawn in the facts and circumstances is that there was no real urgency to justify invoking of the provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_252">Section 17(4)</a> doing away with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_253">Section 5-A</a>. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_92">	Thus it is not possible to accept that making an enquiry in the objections which would have been filed under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_254">Section 5-A</a> and the time spent in making enquiry under sub-section (2) would have defeated the object of acquisition. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_93">	In such facts and circumstances of the case as discussed above, the Government has completely failed to justify the dispensation of enquiry provided by <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_255">Section 5-A</a> of the Act by invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_256">Section 17(4)</a>. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_94">	For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned notification dated 14.02.2005 under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_257">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act and declaration dated 16.03.2006 under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_258">Section 6</a> of the Act  cannot be sustained and are hereby quashed.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_95">	Writ petition accordingly stands allowed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_96">	However, there shall be no order as to costs.
