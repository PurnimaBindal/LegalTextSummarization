              cooler is a functional requirement
              prescribed     by    BIS     standard.
              Therefore, water mark or window to
              get the water level is a functional
              requirement which is bound to be
              there in water cooler. The averments
              thereof on a body of water cooler,
              other location would fall under the
              design. The specification thereof
              with colour, style and shape would
              fall under the design part which can
              be   protected.   Therefore,   bearing
              this definition of design in mind
              now let me think the decisions
              relied upon by the learned counsel
              for both the sides in support of
              their rival contentions.

<p id="p_53">              19. The   close   perusal  of   these
              decisions    cited    herein    above
              persuade this Court to say that what
              is important is the design appealed
              to the consumers&#x27; eye. The Court is
              unable to accept the       submission
              made on behalf of the defendants
              that &#x27;trained eye&#x27; or &#x27;deserving
              eye&#x27; is required to be applied for
              examining   the  design.   As   those
              judgment cited on their behalf, if
              perused closely, would show that
              there was a stage when the Court was
              called upon to examine the design in
              comparison with the earlier designs.
              In the instant case, unfortunately
              for the defendants, they have not
              produced any materials to indicate
              that there exists design prior to
              the design registered by the present
              plaintiff. Therefore, in absence of
              any such materials, the Court would
              not be in a position to accept the
              plea of &#x27;deserving eye&#x27; or &#x27;trained
              eye&#x27;, as sought to be made out by

              duplication or replication. If one
              looks at two sets of designs applied
              by the plaintiff on their articles
              and on the defendants of their
              products then, the Court has to

              counsel for the plaintiff that two
              consumers     eye     difference    is
              absolutely     not    desirable    and
              therefore, at this stage, prima-
              facie to accept there is a substance
              and what has been contended on
              behalf of the plaintiff&#x27;s article,
              is   &#x27;obvious    imitation&#x27;   of   the
              design, which has been registered
              long back by the plaintiff. This
              observation of the Court is prima-
              facie and shall have no bearing of
              the examination of the issue at
              large when the evidences are adduced
              in its totality at the hearing of
              the suit stage. But suffice to it
              say that so far as the documents
              produced viz.brochures of the other
              products then, the perusal of the
              brochures would also leave no room
              of doubt in saying that there is
              marked similarity between the design
              of the plaintiff and those of the
              defendants, which has been assailed
              to be imitation by the plaintiff.
              The Court is also not impressed by
              the findings and point of difference
              pointed   out    on  behalf   of   the
              defendants     to     suggest    their
              existence difference in continuing
              small detailing as the court is of
              the considered view that what is to
              be borne in mind is the word
              &quot;obvious imitation&quot;. The &quot;obvious
              imitation&quot; attempted to be a vital
              on account of small meaning and
              answer features of distinctive. But,

              those features of distinctive, if
              are not capable to readily notice to
              the consumers, then the same will
              have   to    be    treated     as    merely
              imitation and those fine difference
              will   have      to    be     treated    as
              incorporated merely to avoid the
              charge    of    imitation.      Therefore,
              prima-facie,     this     court   has    to
              record that the designs of the
              defendant     in    respect      of    four
              articles    appear     to    be   &quot;obvious
              imitation&quot;       than       the      design
              registered by the plaintiff. Having
              come to the prima-facie conclusion
              based upon the examination aspects
              and hearing of the counsel, this
              Court will have to consider the
              other contention raised on behalf of
              the defendants for registering the
              suit, as per prayer made in the
              suit.    This     will     have     to   be
              considered on the maintainability
              aspect of the preliminary issue
              raised    by    the    defendants      that
              continuation suit on passing off
              design, is not maintainable and it
              was contended that both the action
              i.e. infringement and passing off
              would     not     be     available      and
              therefore, the reliance is placed
              upon the decision of the Supreme
              Court in case of &#x27;Dhodha House Vs.
              S.K. Maingi&#x27; reported in 2006 (9)
              SCC 41. This judgment is based upon
              the aspect of nonavailability of
              peculiar clause which canvassed the
              right upon the plaintiff to bring at
              the place of ordinarily business.

              plea is considered as to whether the
              defendants&#x27; counsel is justified in
              submitting that there exists no
              cause of action for bringing in
              action or filing of the suit in
              Ahmedabad   as   it  was   merely   on
              apprehension.   But   the   Court   is
              persuaded to hold that the counsel
              for the plaintiff is justified in
              submitting the action, which is
              based upon qua-timet action. In

              controverted, the same cannot be
              brushed aside merely holding to its
              perception based upon the threat.

              would    support    the    aforesaid
              proposition. Therefore, the action
              cannot be said to be wholly based
              upon the apprehension or like any
              base. On the contrary, the chain of

              generally to grant a prompt ex-parte
              injunction followed by appointment
              of local Commissioner, if necessary.
              In our opinion the trial court was
              fully justified in granting the ex-
              parte injunction to the plaintiff
              based on the material made available
              by him to the court. The Trial Court
              fell   in  error   in  vacating  the
              injunction and similar error has
              crept in the order of the High
              Court. The reasons assigned by the
              Trial Court as also by the High
              Court for refusing the relief of
              injunction to the plaintiff are
              wholly unsustainable.

<p id="p_58">              17. We are conscious of the law that
              this Court would not ordinarily
              interfere   with   the   exercise    of
              discretion in the matter of grant of
              temporary injunction by the High
              Court   and  the   Trial    Court   and
              substitute    its    own     discretion
              therefor except where the discretion
              has   been   shown    to   have    been
              exercised        arbitrarily         or
              capriciously or perversely or where
              the   order   of   the   Court    under
              scrutiny    ignores     the     settled
              principles of law regulating grant
              or    refusal     of     interlocutory
              injunction.    An    appeal     against

              the trial court reasonably and in a
              judicial manner the fact that the
              appellate court would have taken a

              present one is a case falling within
              the    well    accepted     exceptions.
              Neither the Trial Court nor the High
              Court have kept in view and applied
              their mind to the relevant settled

              grant or refusal of interlocutory

              name disputes. A refusal to grant an
              injunction     in    spite    of    the
              availability of facts, which are

              overwhelming evidence and material

              justice and such injury to the

              being undone at a latter stage. The
              discretion exercised by the Trial
              Court and the High Court against the
              plaintiff, is neither reasonable nor
              judicious.       The      grant      of
              interlocutory     injunction   to   the
              plaintiff    could    not   have   been
              refused,    therefore,     it   becomes
              obligatory on the part of this Court
              to interfere.

<p id="p_65">                  Once it is clear that the registered
                  design has been infringed and the
                  goods are being passed off, then, in
                  view of the object for which the Act
                  is enacted, it is necessary to
                  restrain   the   infringer   forthwith
                  unless exceptional grounds are made
                  out for refusal. After coming to a
                  prima-facie conclusion that there is
                  infringement of registered design,
                  the injunction cannot ordinarily be
                  deferred till the conclusion of the

                  protection granted under the Act,
                  illusionary. Once a prima-facie case
                  was made out in this case that the

              registered proprietor seeks reliefs in
              the form of damages, injunction, etc.
              against the infringer. Such relief can
              be sought even against a registered
              proprietor of a design by questioning
              his registration. The Defendant too
              can submit that the Plaintiff is not
              entitled to any relief in terms of
              damages,      injunction          etc.      by
              questioning the registration of the

              under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_45">Section    19</a> of      the     Act    for
              cancellation     of      a     registration.
              Again, <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_46">Section 19</a> entitles a party to
              move the Controller for cancellation
              of a design even where the registered
              proprietor     is      not      using      the
              design. <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_47">Section 19</a> therefore affords a

              registration          is           considered
              objectionable and a mere factum of
              registration    affords       a    cause    of

              or   not.  In   this   connection,   the
              Assistant Controller has only observed
              that he has made a visual comparison of
              the U.K. registered design No.2022468
              with the impugned design No.190336 and
              he was satisfied that both the designs
              make same appeal to the eye and there
              was sufficient resemblance between the
              two designs. Therefore, the Assistant
              Controller  held   that   the   impugned
              design was prior published and it could
              not be said to be new or original. The
              Assistant Controller further observed
              that the proprietor of this design had
              not been able to make a difference
              between the U.K. design and the present
              design. This was not accepted by
              learned Single Judge of the Calcutta
              High Court and for the good reason. It
              was observed by learned Single Judge as

              the United Kingdom Patent Office depict
              the patterns that may be applied to
              glass sheets. The patterns may be same
              but the illustrations do not give the
              same visual effect as the samples of
              the glass sheets produced by the
              appellant in Court. There are also no
              clean   unmistakable   instructions  or
              directions for production of glass
              sheets of the pattern illustrated.
              The visual effect and/or appeal of a
              pattern embossed into glass sheets by
              use of embossing rollers could be
              different from the visual effect of the

                  appeal thereof, but not the visual
                  appeal    of    the     pattern    and/or
                  configuration on the article. In other
                  words, the Respondent No.1 has not
                  considered the visual appeal of the
                  finished    product.    There    are    no
                  materials on record to show that the

                  glass sheets. On the other hand, an
                  affidavit was sworn on behalf of the
                  appellant    by   a   Liaison   Executive
                  affirming that he had ascertained that
                  the proprietor of the design registered
                  in   the   United   Kingdom   had    never
                  manufactured glass sheets of the design
                  registered.&quot;From this it appears that
                  in fact the pattern of the design which
                  is reproduced on the glass-sheet and
                  the design and the pattern which was
                  reproduced on the glass-sheet of the
                  United Kingdom was not common.&quot;

                  to the enactment and enforcement
                  of the 2000 Act prior registration
                  or publication of the design in
                  India     was   a      ground    for
                  cancellation   of    a    registered
                  design, but not prior registration
                  or publication abroad. Parliament
                  in its wisdom deemed it expedient
                  to add prior publication in a
                  country other than India as a
                  ground   for  cancellation    of   a
                  registered    design,     but    not
                  registration in a country other
                  than India.
</p>
<p id="p_118">              29. Parliament has thereby consciously
              differentiated       between       prior
              registration   in   India    and   prior
              registration abroad. No such difference
              has, however, been made in the case of
              prior publication. Prior publication
              either in India or abroad is a ground
              for   cancellation   of   a   registered
              design.
</p>
<p id="p_119">              41. To constitute prior disclosure by
              publication to destroy the novelty of a
              registered   design,   the  publication
              would have to be, in tangible form, of
              the design applied to the same article.
              Prior publication of a trade catalogue,
              brochure, book, journal, magazine or
              newspaper containing photographs or
              explicit picture illustrations that
              clearly depict the application of the
              design on the same article, with the

              Manufacturers Ltd. v. Airfix Ltd</a>.,
              reported in 1957 RPC 239, Lord Evershed
              M.R. held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_123">              In this respect the test of prior
              publication of an alleged invention,
              should, in my judgment, be no less
              applicable in the case of a registered
              design, and as regards the former, I
              venture to cite once more the oft-
              quoted language of Lord Westbury in
              Hills v. Evans : &#x27;The antecedent
              statement must, in order to invalidate
              the subsequent patent, be such that a
              person of ordinary knowledge of the
              subject would at once perceive and
              understand and be able practically to
              apply   the   discovery   without   the
              necessity     of     making     further
              experiments.&#x27; By a like reasoning, to
              my mind, if a document is to constitute
              prior publication, then a reader of it,
              possessed ordinary knowledge of the
              subject, must from his reading of the
              document be able, at least, to see the
              design in his mind&#x27;s eye and should not
              have to depend on his own originality
              to construct the design from the ideas
              which the document may put into his
              head.

              same visual effect as the samples of
              the glass sheets produced by the
              appellant in Court. There are also no
              clear   unmistakable   instructions or
              directions for production of glass
              sheets of the pattern illustrated.

<p id="p_125">              46. The visual effect and/or appeal of
              a pattern embossed into glass sheets by
              use of embossing rollers could be
              different from the visual effect of the
              same pattern etched into glass sheets
              manually. The respondent No. I has not
              considered these factors.

<p id="p_126">              47. The order impugned considered with
              the materials on record, including in

              clearly reveals that the respondent No.
              1 has only compared the pattern and/or
              configuration and considered the visual
              appeal thereof, but not the visual
              appeal    of    the    pattern    and/or
              configuration on the article. In other
              words, the respondent No. 1 has not
              considered the visual appeal of the
              finished product.

              show that the design had previously
              been applied to glass sheets. On the
              other hand, an affidavit was sworn on
              behalf of the appellant by a Liason
              Executive   affirming   that   he   had
              ascertained that the proprietor of the

              thereupon     the     infringing      goods
              disappeared from the market. Thereafter
              on June 22, 2009, the defendants made
              an application for design registration
              identical to that of plaintiff. Prayer

              trade with a functional aspect. People
              at large and persons in the trade

              said pattern even prior to registration
              of   the    plaintiff&#x27;s   design.   The
              plaintiff&#x27;s design is not significantly
              distinguishable from known designs and/
              or is a combination of known designs.

              from each other. The top of the stud in
              the defendants&#x27; footwear has a surface
              pattern of circles within circle while
              the top of the stud in plaintiff&#x27;s

              passing off. The hearing of the Notice
              of Motion was concluded on December 19,

              passed an order dated December 20, 2011
              cancelling    defendant&#x27;s    design.    The
              plaintiff, therefore, submitted that
              injunction may be granted, both on the
              basis of infringement of the registered
              design and also on the basis of passing
              off. The learned Single Judge passed
              the impugned order dated December 23,
              2011 granting injunction on the basis
              of   passing    off   after    giving   the
              following reasons :-
</p>
<p id="p_142">              a) The defendant&#x27;s rubber footwear seen
              as a whole indicates an intention on
              the part of the defendants to pass off
              their app - 62/12 products as those of
              the      plaintiffs.     The      shape,
              configuration and the placements of
              components are identical. The products
              are likely to be sold not merely in the
              same   shop   but  are  likely   to   be
              displayed on the same shelf, thus
              enhancing the probability of confusion;

              certain brochures but none of the items
              in    the   brochures     indicate    any
              similarity    with    the     plaintiff&#x27;s
              products;
</p>
<p id="p_144">              c) The defendants had not offered any
              explanation    as     to    how  they
              conceptualized their products;
</p>
<p id="p_145">              d)   The   defendants&#x27;  conduct   also
              supported plaintiff&#x27;s case that the
              defendants were trying to pass off
              their goods as that of the plaintiff.
              When   the   plaintiff   noticed   the
              defendants&#x27; products in June 2009, the
              plaintiff issued a seize and desist
              notice in the newspapers as they were
              not aware of manufacturer of such
              products.
</p>
<p id="p_146">              Thereupon,   the   infringing   products
              disappeared from the market and they
              appeared again at the end of the year
              but with a registration number.
</p>
<p id="p_147">              6. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid
              order dated December 23, 2011, the
              defendant nos.1 to 4 have filed Appeal
              No.62 of 2012. The plaintiff has filed
              cross-objections insofar as learned
              Single   Judge   did  not   accept the
              plaintiff&#x27;s prayer for grant of ad-
              interim app - 62/12 injunction on the
              basis    of    infringement    of  the
              plaintiff&#x27;s registered designs.

              Tulzapurkar&#x27;s     arguments     is    that
              originality    of   plaintiff&#x27;s    designs
</pre><p id="p_148">              themselves is doubtful, and keeping

              place the plaintiff could not have been
              granted       design       registrations.
              Undoubtedly, the existence of Padukas
              in ancient times cannot be denied.
              However, in the recent past, it is not

 C/CS/2/2021                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 29/10/2021



                  known that said feel and look of
                  Padukas with the modification of strap
                  to support the foot has been applied by
                  any person to footwear. Application of
                  design of Padukas - of its &quot;look and
                  feel&quot;, to footwear by the plaintiff in
                  the recent past certainly falls within
                  the meaning of &quot;Original&quot; as defined in
                  <a href="/doc/1234344/" id="a_104">section 2(g)</a> of the Act to the extent
                  of &quot;and includes the cases which though
                  old in themselves yet are new in their
                  app - 62/12 application&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_149">                  17. What is important to note is that
                  the   defendants    themselves   sought
                  registration of their &quot;look and feel&quot;
                  in Padukas and therefore it is not open
                  for the defendants to say that the
                  plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity. The
                  defendants themselves procured design
                  registration in relation to footwear
                  under design registration No. 223556 in
                  June   2009,  which   was  subsequently
                  cancelled by the Assistant Controller
                  of Patents and Designs on 20th December
                  2011. In these circumstances it cannot
                  lie in the mouth of defendants to
                  contend that the plaintiff&#x27;s design is
                  not new or original or there is no
                  novelty. We also find merit in the
                  plaintiff&#x27;s contention that there is no
                  footwear in the market having unique
                  features of stud and strap like that of
                  plaintiff. So far as the plaintiff&#x27;s
                  designs are concerned, novelty lies in
                  the shape, configuration and pattern of
                  the footwear and there is no product in
                  the market having similar design.&quot;

              design were scrutinized as detailed
              below:
</p>
<p id="p_155">                   (a)      Petitioner, in Para 11 of
              statement of case, stated that the
              impugned product of the respondent is
              common    to   trade    and   pictorial
              representation of various water jugs
              used by various parties like Bajrang
              Plastic, Hello Polymer, Royal Plastic,

<p id="p_156">              (b) Petitioner also submitted pictorial
              representations of his design of water
              jug (pages 9-10) but those were not
              substantiated with date of publication
              or sale.

              jugs. These designs are not similar to
              the impugned design. Further the date

              of registration of the impugned design.

              date appearing as 24/12/2011 which is
              later than the date of registration of
              the impugned design. The water jugs
              shown therein do not resemble to the
              impugned one.

              www.chocolateboxes.com (Pages 23, 26,
              27, 29 of evidences) also show some
              water jugs where the date appeared as
              24/11/2012. These pictures also do not
              depict the impugned design.

<p id="p_161">              (g) Similar is the case for website
              print outs submitted by the petitioner
              in pages 30 to 42 of the evidences. The
              designs of water jugs revealed in those
              print outs are not similar to the
              design   of  the  water   jug   of  the
              respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_162">              Petitioner also submitted the same set
              of documents of evidence along with
              submission under Rule 29(4), discussion
              of which are not repeated as those were
              basically same documents as discussed
              above. From the foregoing analysis, it
              is   seen  that   those   evidences  of
              publication do not substantiate that
              the impugned design was published prior
              to its date of registration.
</p>
<p id="p_163">              In view of above findings that the
              impugned design was not published prior
              to its date of registration and as well
              as   the  visual   impression  of   the
              impugned design is different from that
              of the cited designs of the petitioner,
              I construe that the subject design is
              new. As per <a href="/doc/1234344/" id="a_108">Section 2(g)</a> of the Designs
              Act, 2000, &#x27;&quot;Original&quot;, in relation to

 C/CS/2/2021                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 29/10/2021



              a design, means originating from the
              author of such design and includes the
              cases which though old in themselves
              yet are new in their application&#x27;.
              Petitioner could not also substantiate
              that the design is not originating from
              the author of such design or it is a
              known design. Thus, I opine that the
              impugned design is new and original.
              The visual effect of the picture
              illustrations of published designs and
              that of the impugned designs are
              different. The features of designs in
              registered design no.235010 are not
              insignificant from the known designs
              cited by the petitioner. Hence there is
              nothing to suggest that the impugned
              design is not registrable under <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_109">Section
              4</a> of the Designs Act, 2000. Counsel for
              the petitioner also pled that the
              impugned design of the respondent was
              disclosed to the public prior to its
              date of registration as evident from
              the dates of bills/vouchers submitted
              by the respondent. Upon scrutiny of
              those vouchers of respondent, it is
              seen that respondent claimed to be in
              the trade since 1989 by way of selling
              of Mayur water filters, water jugs etc.
              It is further observed that respondent
              is having registration of trade mark
              &#x27;Mayur&#x27; since 2002. The same was also
              registered under Copyright in 2003.
              Respondent   also  produced   a  search
              certificate regarding the expression
              &#x27;5o C&#x27;. All these documents suggest
              that respondent is bonafide user of
              these. Vouchers indicating sale of
              Mayur water jugs before the date of
              registration of the impugned design
              does not necessarily mean that the
              impugned design was sold prior to its
              date of registration. Further none of
              the bills and vouchers depicts design
              of the products sold there through.
              Hence these bills cannot be considered
              as document evidencing prior sale/use

              of   the     article    bearing    impugned
              registered design. Another contention
              of petitioner was that the impugned
              design is mere mechanical device and
              hence is not a design as defined under
              clause (d) of <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_110">Section 2</a> of the Act. It
              was stated that as per submission of
              respondent in Para 9 of page 7 of the
              counter statement as well as Para 7 of
              the affidavit, the impugned design is
              functional. A mere mechanical device is
              a shape in which all the features are
              dictated solely by the function or
              functions which the article has to
              perform [<a href="/doc/166217099/" id="a_111">Amp Inc vs. Utilux Pty</a>. Ltd
              1972 RPC 103]. At the same time, it is
              observed      from     the     petitioner&#x27;s
              evidences that there are variety of
              water jugs having distinctive features
              of shape and configuration. The article
              of the impugned design is an article
              under <a href="/doc/541198/" id="a_112">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act. The
              article has certain design features of
              shape and configuration applied to it.
              The article is not a mere mechanical
              device and the features of the impugned
              design are not solely dictated by the
              function the article has to perform.
              There is no bar as to being the
              impugned design under the definition of
              &#x27;design&#x27; as defined in clause (d) of
              <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_113">Section     2</a>     of    the    Act.    Upon
              consideration of the Statement of Case,
              Counter    Statement,      evidences,   and
              submissions of both the parties and
              after careful analysis of the documents
              submitted by both the parties in the
              instant case as above, I decide that
              the petitioner could not establish the
              grounds of prior publication of the
              registered      design     no.235010    and
              therefore I decide that the design
              no.235010 is new and original and
              registrable under the provisions of the
              Act.&quot; (emphasis added)

                   will be obvious that under the 2000 Act

                     design prior to the registration was
                     already published, it could not be
                     registered by the concerned authority

                     of defence in the present suit to the

                     the averments made by the plaintiff in
                     the plaint, the advertisement was made
                     of the design and the plaintiff has
                     procured the business based on the

                     then the registration was not made

              whereas, as per the original plaintiff
              respondent herein, the figure shown is
              composite in nature since the plaintiff
              was already in business and the process
              of   advertisement   was   for  various
              purposes. It was submitted that it is
              no publication, which prohibits the
              registration    and,   therefore,   the
              learned Counsel for the respondents
              submitted that the discretion has been
              properly   exercised  by   the  learned
              Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_168">                   9. In our view, as such the
              publication presupposes the publication
              to be made by making known to the
              public at large and more particularly
              the consumers thereof. It is true that
              the figures of advertisement expenses
              are mentioned and a general statement
              is made for expenses incurred for
              advertisement, including the design,
              but no material has come on record
              showing the publication, in any manner,
              like that of a circulation through
              pamphlets or any paper advertisement or
              otherwise. It deserves to be recorded
              that when the design is registered by
              the   Registering   Authority,   who  is
              considered as an expert in the field
              the normal presumption would be that
              the registration is made in proper
              manner. If one is contending by way of
              defence that the registration was not
              available for one reason or another,
              the burden would be upon the party so
              asserting. If the defendant is raising
              the contention of prior publication,
              the    burden   would    be   open   the
              defendants. No material is produced by
              the defendants for such purpose. The
              contention raised on the basis of the
              averments made by the plaintiff in the
              plaint, per se, cannot be said as
              publication,   which   is   barring  the
              registration. In our view, unless a
              full-fledged fact finding inquiry is

                  undertaken and parties are allowed to
                  lead the evidence, it is not possible
                  to conclude that there was publication
                  of the design as required under the Act
                  prohibiting the registration of the
                  design. Be it noted that it is not a
                  matter   where  the   suit  is   to  be
                  concluded after an elaborate evidences
                  led by the parties, but we have to
                  consider the matter at the stage when
                  the interim application for temporary
                  injunction is considered by the learned
                  Single Judge and the matter is to be
                  examined in appeal. Therefore, prima
                  facie material is only to be taken into
                  consideration as available on record.
                  If prima facie once the design is
                  registered and no reliable material has
                  come on record showing the publication
                  by making it known to the public at
                  large or the consumers of an article,
                  it cannot be said that there was
                  publication of an article with new
                  design prohibiting the registration of
                  the design on the date when the
                  registration was applied. Therefore,
                  the said contention does not deserve to
                  be accepted.&quot;

              a particular figure / shape conceived
              by its designer, in his mind and it is
              reproduced in some identifiable manner

              chosen    for    registration   to    be
              reproduced in any article. The original
              plaintiff had approached the court,
              seeking     injunction     and    sought
              protection of his design applied to
              copper tubes. It is not the case of the
              plaintiff that the copper tubes were in
              existence earlier or were put to the
              use the way they are being put to use
              including its use in air- conditioner
              but the plaintiff came up with a design
              which he claimed to be a new and
              original and as per the plaintiff, it
              was already manufacturing the copper
              tubes with varied applications for a
              considerable long time but in the year
              2009 it conceived of a unique, novel
              shape, configuration for its tubes and
              applied this uniqueness and novelty on
              copper tubes and this uniqueness lied
              in the expanded bell-shaped ending to
              the copper tube. It is this idea
              applied to the copper tubes which was
              registered and the Borey 33/47 spb/
              comapeal-133-17R.doc plaintiff sought
              its protection. As the Hon&#x27;ble Apex

              of form or ornament to be applied to a

              suggestion or idea, and not an article,
              which is the thing capable of being

</p>
<p id="p_172">              A design capable of registration cannot
              consist of a mere conception of the
              features mentioned in the definition,
              or in the case of an article in three
              dimensions, of a representation of such
              features   in   two   Borey   34/47 spb/

              must, in such a case, in order to
              comply with the definition, consist of
              the features as they appear in the
              article to which they have been applied
              by some industrial process or means. An
              applicant for registration of a design
              has to produce a pictorial illustration
              of the idea or suggestion which he has
              to establish as new or original;&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_173">              Therefore, the concept of design is
              that a particular figure conceived by
              its designer in his mind and it is

                  registration is required then those
                  configuration has to be chosen for
                  registration to be reproduced in any
                  article. The idea is that the design
                  has to be registered which is sought to
                  be    reproduced   on    any   article.
                  therefore, both the things are required
                  to go together, i.e. the design and the
                  design which is to be applied to an
                  article.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_174">                  &quot;37 In the present case, the design has
                  been reproduced in the article like
                  glass which is registered. This could
                  have been registered with rexin or
                  leather. therefore, for registration of
                  a    particular     configuration    or
                  particular shape of thing which is
                  sought to be reproduced on a particular
                  article has to be applied. As in the
                  present case the design sought to be
                  reproduced on a glass-sheet has been
                  registered and there is no evidence to
                  show that this design was registered
                  earlier to be reproduced on glass in
                  India or any other part of the country
                  or in Germany or even for that matter
                  in United Kingdom, therefore, it is for
                  the first time registered in India
                  which is new and original design which
                  is to be reproduced on glass sheet.
                  therefore, the submission of learned
                  senior counsel for the appellant, Mr.
                  Gupta cannot be accepted that this
                  design was not new and original.&quot;

                   to have been &quot; published&quot; by Clarice
                   Jones? To my mind the question must
                   sensibly be answered negatively. As was
                   observed by Farwell, J., in Morton&#x27;s
                   Design (1900) 17 R.P.C. 117, at p. 121:
                   &quot;.. . what you have to see is whether,
                   &quot;tested by the eye, the design is novel
                   or original . . .&quot;. Applying this test
                   it is essential to bear always in mind
                   that the Respondents&#x27; design is a
                   particular appearance or shape to be
                   judged by the eye alone. So regarded it
                   represents a   bucket of specific and
                   distinct characteristics including a
                   handle of Particular, type at the top
                   and a sharply narrowing body with its
                   distinct base. | have been quite unable
                   to find any such design anywhere
                   presented to the eye or described in
                   Clarice Jones&#x27; specification so that
                   the mind&#x27;s eye can see it, That
                   Specification is nowhere related to a
                   bucket at all. I agree that in the
                   Respondents design the handle may be of
                   less distinctive importance than other
                   features in the design. Still, bucket
                   handles take more than one form; and
                   this handle is a part and a necessary
                   part of the design as a whole.&quot;

<p id="p_197">        64.         Whereas     on       the          other      hand,            the
              defendants       have             not     denied             and/or
              submitted that they have not copied the
              design of the grill for air cooler as
              registered by the plaintiffs with effect
              from 24.12.2019. The crux of the case of
              the    defendants          is        that        the         design
              registered      by    the         plaintiff          could          not
              have been registered at all in view of
              the provisions of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_142">section 4(b)</a> read with
              <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_143">section      19(1)(b)</a>of           the    design          Act,2000
              on    the    ground    that        the      design         of       the
              grill for air cooler registered by the
              plaintiffs has been published prior to
              the date of making the application for
              registration and for that the defendants
              have relied upon the following aspects:

              not    in        favour        of       the     plaintiffs                 and
              whether in view of the allegations of
              prior publication of the design by the

              test        to      the         design             used         by         the
              defendants, it is clear to the eye that
              it     is        essentially             the       same          as        the

              whether the design of the plaintiffs has
              been    published              prior          to     the        date         of

              which     reliance             is      placed            by         the
              plaintiffs. It was also pointed out that
              the     air    cooler          manufactured               by        the
              plaintiffs       using       the      registered             design
              was displayed in various exhibitions as
              well as on the web site of Amazon and

              was contended that once there is a prior
              publication of the design, the same is
              prohibited        to      be        registered            as        per

              adjudicate upon the validity of the

              advanced at the hands of the learned
              counsel for the appellants, on the
              instant aspect of the matter, are being
              summarized hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_209">              10.1 Firstly, it was submitted, that
              where a &quot;counter-claim&quot; is instituted
              in response to a suit for infringement
              of a patent in the High Court, there
              can be no further proceeding in the
              &quot;revocation petition&quot; filed before the
              &quot;Appellate Board&quot;. In this behalf it
              was further contended, that it would
              make   no   difference,  whether   such
              proceedings had been instituted prior
              to, or after the filing of the suit for
              infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_210">              10.2 Secondly, it was contended, that
              the jurisdiction of a High Court to
              decide     a    &quot;counter-claim&quot;     for
              revocation, was exclusive, and could
              not be taken away, by initiating
              proceedings simultaneously, before the
              &quot;Appellate Board&quot;. In this behalf it
              was sought to be explained, that the
              proceedings before the High Court in
              furtherance of the &quot;counter-claim&quot;,
              would negate all similar proceedings
              against the same patent, on the same
              grounds, before the subordinate forum
              (the &quot;Appellate Board&quot;), for the simple
              reason, that the inferior forum would
              have to make way for the superior
              forum.
</p>
<p id="p_211">              10.3     Thirdly, it was submitted,
              that the jurisdiction vested with the

 C/CS/2/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 29/10/2021



              taken away by an independent petition
              for revocation, of the same patent, and
              on the same grounds, pending before the
              &quot;Appellate Board&quot;. In this behalf it
              was   submitted   that   the   &quot;Appellate
              Board&quot;   was   only   an   administrative
              tribunal, which was neither superior to
              the High Court nor vested with a
              coequal status (as that of the High
              Court). Accordingly it was submitted,
              that    the    determination    by    the
              &quot;Appellate Board&quot; which could even
              otherwise be corrected by the High
              Court (in an appropriate case, through
              writ proceeding) could not be allowed
              to derail the plea of revocation raised
              through the &quot;counter-claim&quot;, before the
              High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_212">              10.4 Fourthly, it was contended that
              once a &quot;counter-claim&quot; for revocation
              was instituted, the High Court alone
              would be vested with the charge for
              determining the merits of the plea of
              revocation. Placing reliance on the
              proviso to <a href="/doc/831888/" id="a_147">Section 104</a> of the Patents
              Act, it was sought to be asserted that
              once a &quot;counter-claim&quot; had been filed
              in a suit for infringement, the same
              was liable to be transferred to the
              High Court for determination.
</p>
<p id="p_213">              20.The defendant party to a suit for
              infringement, who seeks to repudiate
              the charge of infringement, is allowed
              to raise a &quot;counter-claim&quot;, so as to
              enable him to raise a challenge, to the
              validity of the patent assigned to the
              author of the suit (under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_148">Section 64</a> of
              the Patents Act). This is so, because a
              &quot;counter-claim&quot; can be filed only by
              such person, against whom a suit for
              infringement has been filed (by the
              patent-holder). The grounds of such
              challenge have already been enumerated
              above.

</p><p id="p_215">              25. A &quot;counter-claim&quot; for all intents
              and purposes, must be understood as a
              suit, filed by one who is impleaded as
              a   defendant.   A    &quot;counter-claim&quot;   is
              essentially filed to obstruct the claim
              raised in a suit. A &quot;counter-claim&quot; is
              tried jointly, with the suit filed by
              the plaintiff, and has the same effect
              as a cross-suit. Therefore, for all
              intents and purposes a &quot;counter-claim&quot;
              is treated as a plaint, and is governed
              by the rules applicable to plaints. The
              court trying a suit, as well as, the
              &quot;counter-claim&quot;, has to pronounce its
              judgment on the prayer(s) made in the
              suit, and also, those made in the
              &quot;counter-claim&quot;.    Since    a   &quot;counter-
</p><p id="p_216">              claim&quot;   is   of   the    nature   of   an
              independent suit, a &quot;counter-claim&quot;
              cannot be allowed to proceed, where the
              defendant has already instituted a suit
              against the plaintiff, on the same
              cause of action. The above conclusion
              is drawn on the basis of the accepted
              principle   of    law    crystallized   in
              Section 10 of the Code of Civil
              Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred
              to as, the CPC) read with Section 151
              of the CPC. Both the above provisions
              are being extracted hereunder:-

              Explanation- The pendency of a suit in
              a foreign Court does not preclude the
              Courts in India from trying a suit
              founded on the same cause of action.
</p>
<p id="p_219">              151. Saving of inherent powers of
              Court.- Nothing in this Code shall be
              deemed to limit or otherwise affect the
              inherent power of the Court to make
              such orders as may be necessary for the
              ends of justice or to prevent abuse of
              the process of the Court.&quot; Therefore,
              where an issue is already pending
              adjudication between the same parties,
              in a Court having jurisdiction to
              adjudicate     upon      the     same,    a
              subsequently instituted suit on the
              same issue between the same parties,
              cannot be allowed to proceed. A similar
              question    arises     for    consideration
              before this Court, in the present
              controversy. If the respondents in
              their    capacity      as    &quot;any    person
              interested&quot;, had filed a &quot;revocation
              petition&quot; before the institution of an
              &quot;infringement suit&quot;, they cannot be
              permitted to file a &quot;counter-claim&quot; on
              the same cause of action. The natural
              conclusion in the above situation would
              be, the validity of the grant of the
              patent would have to be determined in
              the &quot;revocation petition&quot;. Therefore,
              in the above situation, while the
              &quot;revocation petition&quot; will have to be
              permitted to be pursued, the &quot;counter-
              claim&quot; cannot be permitted to be
              continued. Therefore, in the above
              eventuality, it is apparent that the
              situation would be resolved, in the
              same manner, as it would have been
              resolved in cross-suits filed by the
              rival    parties,      before     different
              jurisdictional      courts.       In    our
              considered view, the above conclusion
              is    imperative     for    a    harmonious
              interpretation      of     the     relevant

                  provisions of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_149">Patents Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_220">                  26. In cases where the &quot;infringement
                  suit(s)&quot;    was/were   filed     by  the
                  appellant herein (as plaintiff in the
                  &quot;infringement    suit&quot;),    before   the
                  &quot;revocation petition(s)&quot; was/were filed
                  by the respondents (as defendants in
                  the    &quot;infringement      suit&quot;),    the
                  respondents had the right to file
                  &quot;counter-claim(s)&quot; to seek revocation
                  of the patent, under the strength and
                  authority emerging from <a href="/doc/1499217/" id="a_150">Section 64(1)</a>
                  of the Patents Act. Having once filed a
                  &quot;counter-claim&quot;, in response to the
                  &quot;infringement suit(s)&quot;, on the same
                  analogy as has been recorded above, it
                  would not be open to the respondents
                  herein    (the    defendants    in   the
                  &quot;infringement     suits&quot;)     to    file
                  &quot;revocation petition(s)&quot;, as they would
                  likewise be barred by the rule of res
                  judicata.     As    such,    &quot;revocation
                  petitions&quot; filed later in point of
                  time, than the institution of the
                  &quot;infringement     suit&quot;,     would    be
                  unsustainable in law. In such cases,
                  the prayer for revocation of the patent
                  shall be adjudicated, while disposing
                  of the &quot;counter-claim&quot; filed by the
                  respondents. Therefore, in the above
                  situation, while the &quot;counter-claim&quot;
                  will have to be permitted to be
                  pursued,   the   &quot;revocation   petition&quot;
                  cannot be permitted to be continued.&quot;

              In Niky Tasha India Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
              the Division Bench of the Delhi High
              Court had taken the view that the Court
              will   not    grant  an   interlocutory
              injunction at the instance of a party
              holding a registered design where the
              design is of a recent date and there is
              a serious question as to the validity
              of the design to be tried in the suit
              and the application for cancellation
              has been made. Where a person is
              entered as a proprietor of a registered
              design under the Act, that is no
              conclusive proof that the plaintiff is
              the proprietor of the design but it is
              only a prima facie evidence that he is,
              the proprietor. It will be odd to hold
              that on the strength of a recent
              registered design, the plaintiff can
              claim an absolute right to restrain
              everyone else from carrying on his
              business    unless   and    until   the
              registered design of the plaintiff is
              cancelled in appropriate proceedings by
              a competent court of law.

                     suit under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_163">Section 22</a> of the Act
                     complaining   about    piracy   of  the
                     registered design. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_164">The Designs Act</a>,
                     2000   does   not   provide   that  the
                     defendant can plead any ground of
                     cancellation as a defence only after
                     filing an application for cancellation
                     under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_165">Section 19</a> of the Act. However,
                     it is not necessary to pursue the
                     discussion further in as much as in
                     each of the five suits, the first
                     defendant has filed an application for
                     cancellation of the registration in
                     favour of the plaintiff and such
                     applications under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_166">Section 19</a> of the

                     authority.

<p id="p_230">                     26. In view of the above quoted clear-
                     cut statutory provisions of Sub-section
                     (3) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_167">Section 22</a>, it is not possible
                     to accept the contention urged by the
                     learned counsel for the plaintiff that
                     the factum of registration of designs
                     in favour of the plaintiffs by itself
                     is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff
                     to get interim injunction against the
                     defendants. As laid down by the Full
                     Bench of the Delhi High Court, the
                     Court must take into consideration all
                     relevant facts, which would include the
                     grounds urged by the first defendant
                     for cancellation of the registered
                     designs in favour of the plaintiff. The
                     Court must decide whether or not to
                     grant    injunction   in    favour   of
                     registered owner. Such a decision must
                     be made judicially and in such cases
                     the Court would apply the principles
                     which govern grant of injunction under
                     Order 39 Rules 1 and 2, CPC.&quot;

                  decision in Metro Plastic Industries

                  plaintiffs. <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_181">Under the Designs Act</a>,
                  1911, <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_182">Section 53</a> did not have any
                  provision like Sub-section (3) of
                  <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_183">Section 22</a>, therefore, when the Full
                  Bench of this Court was dealing with
                  the provisions of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_184">Designs Act</a> under
                  the Act of 1911, it was in that
                  context that the Full Bench held
                  that if there was no application for
                  cancellation of design made, no
                  defense   can    be    taken   based   on
                  grounds as available in the grounds
                  for cancellation of registration of
                  a design. As far as present Act is
                  concerned, the legislature in its
                  wisdom by incorporating Sub-section
                  (3) of <a href="/doc/1437994/" id="a_185">Section 2</a> of the Act has made
                  every ground, on which registration
                  of   a  design     may    be   cancelled,
                  available as a ground of defense.
                  The ground on which cancellation can
                  be   sought    of     registration    are
                  enumerated in <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_186">Section 19</a> of the Act.
                  It may be noticed that the design is
                  a conception, suggestion or idea of
                  a shape and not an article. If is
                  has already been anticipated, it is
                  not new or original. If it has been
                  pre-published,      it    cannot    claim
                  protection    as    publication    before
                  registration           defeats        the

              principles apply to the case of a

              a patent. The plaintiff must show that

              been infringed by the defendant. The

              registered design is not of itself
              necessarily prima facie evidence of
              validity. On the contrary, where it
              appears that the design has only
              recently been registered, and where it
              appears that there is a substantial

              decided. Parker, J. put it very shortly
              in Trautoer v. Patmore (1912) 29 Rpc 60
              at 63 : &#x27;I cannot grant an interim
              injunction. It is very unusual if the
              patent has not been estabilshed.&#x27; It is
              put at greater length by the Court is
              the case of Jackson vs. Needle, which
              was decided just after the Patents,
              Designs and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_189">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1883 where
              both Baggallay, L. J. and Cotton, L. J.
              State that, where it is a new patent,
              or a recent patent, the court is not in
              the habit of granting these injunctions
              until the title has been established. I
              take the principle that underlies that
              to be this, that the court leans
              against monopolies. Where you find a
              respectable    and    old    established
              monopoly which has been in existence
              for years and not challenged, there is
              no reasons for the court to lean too
              hardly against it, but when you find a
              recent monopoly which there has not yet
              been time to challenge sought to be
              enforced, the Court is inclined to take
              the view as a general rule, unless
              there are special circumstances to
              overcome it, that the title to the
              monopoly must be established before it
              interferes by interlocutory injunction.
              It is not a universal rule : there may
              easily be facts which will lead the
              court in a particular case to depart
              from it, but as a general rule that is
              the practice of the court&quot;. Atkin, LJ.

              adopted in respect of a person claiming
              an interlocutory injunction restraining
              the infringement of a patent is that
              the plaintiff has always to establish
              at any rate a prima facie case of
              having a right which has been infringed
              by the defendant, and according to our
              patent law, which in this respect I
              think differs from that of some other
              countries.   the   mere   fact  of   the

              granting of a patent is not in self an
              indication   that  the   plaintiff   has
              established to the satisfaction of any
              authority that he has the right to the
              monopoly which he claims. In the case
              of a patent, therefore, the mere fact
              that a patent has been granted does not
              show that those conditions have been
              performed   which   alone    entitle   a
              plaintiff to a conclusive right, and
              therefore the courts, when they are
              approached by a plaintiff who says : &#x27;I
              am the owner of a patent and the
              defendant has infringed if, say where
              the patent is of recent date : &#x27;Your
              right is not established sufficiently
              by the mere fact that a patent has been
              granted to you&#x27;; and unless there is
              some kind of substantial case evidenced
              before the court that there is in fact
              a valid patent, then the court refuses
              to a grant an injunction. I think the
              same thing must apply in the case of a
              person who claims under a registered
              design&quot;.

<p id="p_239">              &quot;It is naturally with reluctance that I
              differ from the view of so experienced
              a Judge but I cannot think this is a
              proper case in which to grant the
              relief of an interlocutory injunction.
              The grant of such relief can be a very
              serious matter, especially if it leads
              to the closing down of the defendants&#x27;

              the possibility of throwing a number of
              people out of employment. In the
              circumstances of this case I do not see
              that,    in    the   absence   of    an

              suffering any irreparable injury. I see
              no reason why damages should not afford
              an adequate remedy, assuming that the
              plaintiff ultimately succeeds in the
              action We have not been informed as to
              the scale on which the defendants are
              operating, but if it turns. out that
              they are operating on a large scale
              then   no   doubt,    if   the   plaintiff
              succeeds in the action, she will
              recover    substantial     damages.    But
              equally on that basis there should be
              no doubt as to the ability of the
              defendants to pay them. If, on the
              other    hand,    the    defendants    are
              operating on only a small scale, then I
              venture to think that any injury to the
              plaintiff will be almost minimal&quot;. Lord
              Denning in Hubbard vs. Vosper (1972) 2
              Wlr   389   (396)    (5)    said   :   &quot;In
              considering    whether    to    grant   an
              interlocutory injunction, the right
              course for a judge is to look at the
              whole case. He must have regard not
              only to the strength of the claim but
              also to the strength of the defense and
              then decide what is best to be done.
              Sometimes, it is best to grant an
              injunction so as to maintain the status
              quo until the trial. At other times it
              is best not to impose a restraint upon
              the defendant but leave him free to go
              ahead. For instance in Fraservs. Evans
              (1969) 1 Qb 349, although the plaintiff
              owned the copyright, we did not grant
              an injunction, because the defendant
              must have a defense of fair dealing.
              The remedy by interlocutory injunction
              is so, useful that it should be kept
              flexible and discretionary. It must not
              be made a subject of strict rules&quot;.
              (12) I take it to be well settled, both
              in India and in England that an
              interlocutory    injunction     will   not
              normally, be granted where damages will
              provide an adequate remedy should the
              claim succeed. Furthermore, I have

              always understood the rule to be that
              the   court    will    not    grant    an
              interlocutory     injunction       unless
              satisfied   that   there   is    a   real
              probability of the plaintiff succeeding
              on the trial of the suit. Where the
              design is of a recent date, as in this
              case, no injunction should be granted.
              More so, when there is a serious
              question as to the validity of the
              design to be tried in the suit and an
              application for cancellation has been
              made. Where a person is entered as a
              proprietor of a registered design, that
              is under the Act no conclusive proof
              that the plaintiff is the proprietor of
              the design, but only a prima facie
              evidence that he is the proprietor. The
              plaintiff has this advantage that if no
              evidence at all is given then the
              certificate is sufficient evidence that
              he is the proprietor. Mohd. Abdul Karim

</p>
<p id="p_240">              (21) The principles are clear. The
              difficulty lies in their application.
              On the recent design in this case the
              plaintiffs   cannot   be    granted  an
              injunction when there is a serious
              question to be tried in the suit. If
              there is any real dispute on the
              questions   as   to   infringement   or
              validity of the registered design the
              court will, as a general rule, refuse
              an interim injunction. Damages will
              afford    a  sufficient    remedy.  The
              defendants are prepared to give an
              undertaking as to damages.

              right, a right which is good even

                  monopolies&quot;. The certificate does not
                  establish a conclusive right. It has to
                  be tried and tested in the laboratory&#x27;
                  of courts. We must not forget that the
                  registered design of the plaintiffs is
                  of a very recent date. In case of a
                  recent monopoly which is seriously .
                  disputed on various grounds such as
                  prior publication, lack of originality
                  trade variation etc. it will not be
                  proper to grant an injunction. There is
                  a serious question to be agued as to
                  whether the design is valid or not, and
                  on the facts lam not satisfied that the
                  balance of convenience requires an

              Judge has further observed that when
              the validity of the patent has been
              challenged on the ground that patent
              has been obtained by fraud, there is
              no new invention of a new product,
              but it is simply an extension of
              what was earlier used or was known
              to the world, then, the extra burden
              lies upon the plaintiffs to show to
              the   Court   that   their   work   or
              invention of the product is not
              simply an extension. The Learned
              Single Judge has further observed
              that when the defendants come out
              with a case that patent is illegal
              and deserves to be revoked, then,
              obviously there would be a triable
              issue in favour of the defendants
              and not in favour of the plaintiffs.
              With regard to the process of the
              plaintiff&#x27;s   product,   the   Learned
              Single Judge has observed that the
              plaintiffs cannot be allowed to say
              that the method of weaving is the
              only statement in the application,
              but, they can refer to any other
              method of manufacture. According to
              the Learned Single Judge, weaving is
              a different process than the process

 C/CS/2/2021                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 29/10/2021



              of intermeshing and textile experts
              know that what is weaving and what
              is the difference between weaving
              and intermeshing. The defendants are
              not using any weaving process in
              manufacturing     the   gabions,     their
              process is certainly intermeshing.
              The Learned Single Judge was also of
              the view that if the gabions made of
              different materials were used to
              avoid or protect soil erosion for
              more than 7,000 years, then the
              innovation of a gabion cannot be
              said   to     be    a    new     inventive
              invention, no research was required
              to be made in something which was
              publicly    known.    It     is    further
              recorded   that     rope    gabions    and
              polymer gabions are being used in
              Maharashtra and Bihar since 1991 and
              1987. If Nylon Crates and gabions
              are used by the Governments for long
              many     years      and      are     being
              manufactured by Netlon and other
              companies, then the plaintiff would
              not be entitled to say that they
              have separate existence of a new
              product which was not known. The
              Learned Single Judge further took
              the view that patent may not be
              granted in favour of some one, who
              very cunningly make an application
              to the authority for grant of patent
              without even disclosing that what is
              new in its item and how it was not
              known to the public previously. It
              is further observed by the Learned
              Single Judge that Nylone, which is
              also used for manufacturing the
              gabions,         is        a        strong
              polymer/material and if that use is
              known to the world, then, simply by
              replacing    nylone    by    some    other
              synthetic material, the plaintiff

              would not be allowed to claim that
              they have invented a product. The
              Learned Single Judge has also given
              specific finding to the effect that
              the defendants are successful in
              showing    that   their    product   is
              something different than what has
              been registered in favour of the
              plaintiffs. The product manufactured
              by the defendants, in the considered
              opinion of the Learned Single Judge,
              is not same or similar to what is
              patented     in    favour     of    the
              plaintiffs. Ultimately, the Learned
              Single    Judge   has   come   to   the
              conclusion that the product of the
              plaintiff is neither new nor a
              result of the research, nor it is
              cheaper, nor it is something, which,
              for   the   first   time,   came   into
              existence and was not known in the
              field.

<p id="p_245">              47. The Court finds some substance at
              this stage in the submission that no
              interim   injunction     protecting    the
              patent and restraining the defendant
              from continuing the manufacturing and
              marketing of products in dispute would
              be granted if the patent is new, its
              validity has not been upheld in any
              judicial    proceedings     and    serious
              controversy    raised     regarding    its
              validity    either     by     filing    an
              application in revocation or claiming
              revocation and counter claim in the
              suit. The defendant&#x27;s contention may
              not be brushed aside at this stage that
              the grant of patent is no proof of its
              validity and principles laid down in

<p id="p_246">                     48 . So far as the present case is
                     concerned, the patent application
                     had been originally submitted on
                     22.06.1999. It was returned by the
                     Registry      on     30.12.2002       and
                     resubmitted only on 29.03.2004. It
                     was published on 04.02.2005 and the
                     patent    was      sealed     only     on
                     13.05.2005. The suit was filed on
                     17.10.2005. The patent is thus new
                     and its validity has not been upheld
                     in judicial proceedings and as is
                     being     pointed       out,      serious
                     controversy is raised regarding its
                     validity in the counter claim and
                     the records produced. Since patent
                     was granted only in May 2005, its
                     validity    could     not    have    been
                     challenged and decided earlier. The
                     Learned Single Judge has adequately
                     protected    the    interest    of    the
                     plaintiff by directing the defendant
                     to maintain account and directing
                     the defendant to secure their claim
                     for damages. The plaintiff has not
                     shown   how    and   why    payment    of
                     compensation is not an adequate
                     remedy.&quot;

              establish    before      the     Court    that
              the patent is valid. Where the patent
              is   of      a      recent       date,      no

              has to be tried and tested             in the

              it        was        held       that         same
              principles      apply      to      the case of

              necessarily prima facie evidence               of
              validity.      On    the contrary,          where
              it   appears       that     the design        has
              only    recently       been registered, and
              where it appears that there               is    a
              substantial       issue       to     be tried,
              an    interlocutory          injunction      will

              the   prima facie case. The defendants
              have declared     before        this     Court,
              even     during        the       course      of
              argument, that they do not use any
              vacuum pump or       any      apparatus     for
              removal         of          bubbles         and
              therefore, only because the end result
              of the     two      machines         is     the
              same,    the     same      in     prima facie
              opinion      of     this       Court      would
              not    constitute infringement of the
              Suit     Patent.        As            discussed
              hereinabove,       the       apparatus      and
              the   method of the same is protected

</p>

<p id="p_303">              It is clear from the facts narrated by
              us   that   the   Herbicide    CP   53619
              (Butachlor) was publicly known before
              Patent Number 125381 was granted. Its
              formula and use had already been made
              known to the public by the report of
              the    International     Rice    Research
              Institute for the year 1968. No one
              claimed any patent or any           other
              exclusive right in Butachlor.          To
              satisfy      the      requirement      of
              being      publicly known as used in
              clauses (e) and (f) of sec. 64(1), it
              is not necessary that it should be
              widely used to the knowledge of the
              consumer public. It is sufficient if it
              is known to the persons who are engaged
              in the pursuit of knowledge of the
              patented product or process either as
              men of science or men of commerce or
              consumers. The section of the public

              in      knowing       about        Herbicides
              which      would destroy weeds but not
              rice, must have been aware of the
              discovery       of     Butachlor.        There
              was    no    secret     about      the active
              agent Butachlor as claimed by the
              plaintiffs since there was no patent
              for   Butachlor,     as admitted        by the
              plaintiffs.     Emulsification       was   the
              wellknown and common process by which
              any Herbicide could be used. Neither
              Butachlor      nor     the      process     of
              Emulsification was capable of being
              claimed by the plaintiff as their
              exclusive property. The solvent and the
              emulsifier were not secrets and they
              were admittedly not secrets and they
              were ordinary market products. From the
              beginning to the end, there was no
              secret and there was no invention by
              the plaintiffs. The ingredients,           the
              active     ingredient,       the       solvent
              and    the emulsifier,        were      known;
</p><p id="p_304">              the     process      was       known,      the
              product was known and the use was
              known. The plaintiffs were              merely
              camouflaging       a     substance       whose
              discovery was known through out the
              world and trying to enfold it in their
              specification relating to Patent Number
              125381.   The     patent    is,    therefore,
              liable to be revoked. We do not think
              that it is necessary for us to go into
              the various questions of            law     so
              carefully     and    meticulously       argued
              by      Mr. Chellaswamy. The questions
              were no doubt interesting and arose for
              the first time. But we desire to keep
              our interest purely         academic       and
              within    bounds.      So     we     do    not
              pronounce upon those questions. The
              appeal is dismissed with costs.&quot;

              (1979) 2 Supreme Court Cases 511, in
              which it was observed that the object
              of   Patent    Law     is   to   encourage
              scientific research, new technology and
              industrial      progress.      It      was
              further observed that grant and sealing
              of the patent, does not guarantee      the
              validity    of     the    patent,    which
              can     be challenged before the High
              Court on various grounds in revocation
              or infringement proceedings.

<p id="p_307">              &quot;139. The dichotomy that is sought to
              be drawn between coverage      or    claim
              on      the       one       hand       and
              disclosure     or enablement or teaching
              in a patent on the other hand, seems to
              strike   at   the   very   root   of   the
              rationale of the law of patent. Under
              the scheme of patent, a monopoly is
              granted to a private individual in
              exchange of the invention being made
              public so that, at the end of the
              patent term, the invention may belong
              to the people at large who may be
              benefits by it. To say that the
              coverage in a patent might go much
              beyond    the   disclosure    thus    seem
              to     negate      the fundamental rule
              underlying the grant of patents.&quot;

              injunction in a patent matter, the
              prima facie validity of the patent
              should be shown and also the prima

              one and I find that the         decisions
              have    uniformly    taken    the    view
              that     any patent which is less than
              six years old is regarded as a recent
              one. The statement of the law in Terrel
              on Patent, 9th Edn pages 318320 shows
              that     a    patentee     should    show

              enjoyment of the patent atleast for a
              period   of   six  years  before  the
              controversy arose.
</p>

<p id="p_318">              In Boots pure Drug and Co. (India) Ltd
              v.     May      and     Baker     Ltd.,
              MANU/WB/0212/1947 : 52 CWN 253, this
              rule that there should be proof of
              actual user of the patent for more than
              six years was applied in India. Thirdly
              there is also a serious controversy
              about the validity of the grant of the
              patent touching the originality or the
              inventive genius of the plaintiff or as
              to how far the prior knowledge holding
              the   field    would   disentitle   the
              plaintiff to the grant of the patent.
              The defendant is certainly not a new
              entrant in the field but he has himself
              been a dealer, manufacturer and seller
              of ploughs of various patterns. For all
              these reasons I entirely agree with the
              order of the learned District Judge
              holding that the plaintiff has not made
              out any case for the grant of an
              interim injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_319">              &quot;23.    The   legal  position   on  the
              interpretation of the said provisions
              as   it    broadly  emerges   from  the
              judgments cited at bar would be thus :
</p>

<p id="p_320">              1)     Mere grant of patent would not
              give an indefeasible right to the
              plaintiffs to enforce the patent in a
              suit   and   to   claim  the   interim
              injunction pending such suit. Though
              grant of patent would be one of the
              considerations, would not be the sole
              consideration.
</p>

              one, existing since long, the Court

              would consider it with due regard and
              would lean in favour of enforcing it in
              absence of any other reason to      the
              contrary.    On    the   other    hand,
              if   the    patent   is relatively new,
              the Court would be slow in enforcing it
              at the interim stage, unless shown to
              be beyond vulnerability.
</p>

<p id="p_322">              3)    In the context of patent being new
              or old, the Courts have often employed
              a yardstick of six years time. Though
              counsel for the respondent could not
              bring to our notice source of selection
              of this cutoff line of six years, it
              was argued they agree that same has
              been employed by several Courts in the
              past.
</p>

<p id="p_323">              Division Bench of this Court in case of
              GarwareWall Ropes     Ltd.(supra),     as
              noted,    observed   that    no   interim
              injunction was granted by the Court, if
              patent is a new one and its validity
              has   not   been   upheld   in   judicial
              proceedings and    serious    controversy
              is       raised       regarding       its
              validity. Likewise the learned Single
              Judge of Delhi High Court in case of
              TEN DC Wireless Inc and Anr.(supra)
              referred and followed the observations
              of the Division Bench that grant of
              patent to the plaintiff will not ipso
              facto    entitle    them    to    interim
              injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_324">              Division Bench of Madras High Court in
              case    of       TVS    Motor   Company
              Limited(supra), observed that patent is
              a new one. Mere challenge at bar would
              be quite sufficient for refusal of
              interim injunction as compared to a
              fairly old patent.

              Learned Single Judge of Madras High
              Court in case of Manioka Thevar(supra),
              observed that patent in the said case
              was      a     recent      one      and
              decisions   of   the   Courts uniformly
              take a view that any patent which is
              less than six years old is regarded as
              a recent one.
</p>

<p id="p_326">              4) We have however noticed some of the
              recent decisions of the Courts where
              this principle of recent patents not
              being readily enforced at the interim
              stage is questioned. Learned Single
              Judge    of Madras High Court in case of
              Bajaj      Auto      Ltd.,      State      of
              Maharashtra          rep         by        S.
</p><p id="p_327">              Ravikumar(supra)      granted     injunction
              noticing that patent was in existence
              since about five years. Division Bench
              of Madras High Court in case of
              Mariappan     and   ors.(supra)      rejected
              the      contention        that        patent
              being     less     than      six years old,
              injunction     should    not    be    granted
              observing that the       view      held    in
              Manioka      Thevar(supra)       has     lost
              its significance in view of latest
              developments in the field of science
              and technology. Now that the patent
              life is very short in view of new
              innovations and inventions which are
              frequently taking place, wherein a new
              product is using its significance and
              market very quickly. Likewise in case
              of Metro Plastic Industries (supra),
              Full Bench of Delhi High Court         agreed
              to    the     suggestion      that     merely
              because     a registration is recent is
              by itself no ground for refusing an
              injunction. That also would be a factor
              which can be taken into consideration
              by the Court.

              and in respect of which revocation
              application is      pending    could    be

              challenging    the    validity    of   the
              patent   would     also    be   a relevant

<p id="p_332">              b)    Whether the person interested have

              patent   on   any  of   the  grounds
              otherwise available for revocation

              any   new    or   original     design   not
              previously published in India. Under
              the scheme of the Act there is no
              provision for notice to the public
              regarding the registration of a design
              or for opposition by the public to the
              registration of the design. Even an
              inspection of the Register of Designs
              is not open for a period of two years
              from the date of registration thereof.
              It is manifestly impossible for the
              Controller when registering a design to
              know of every possible publication
              which may anticipate a design. It is
              for this reason that protection is
              afforded under <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_236">Section 51-A</a> to the

                  life to the match box and indeed to a
                  succession   of    match   boxes.   The
                  container casing will also preferably
                  have an aperture or apertures at the
                  side or sides to expose the match
                  striking and igniting surface carried
                  by the match box. Improvements in the
                  container are then specified. It then
                  states that in placing the match box
                  into position in this container the
                  slide is removed from the matchbox
                  with. the contained matches and the
                  outer sheath of. the match box is
                  slipped into the space between the

                  the elastic spring inside the match box
                  sheath. The match box outer sheath is
                  pushed down until its lower edge is
                  against the inner side of the bottom of
                  the contraire casing. The match box
                  slide containing the matches is then
                  pushed in and its lower edge engages
                  the loop of the elastic. The elastic is
                  stretched as the slide is pressed home.
                  It then mentions that the match box may
                  be struck against the striking and
                  igniting surface which shows at each

                  selling or displaying to the public articles to which the

              design has been applied, and by paper publications of one
              sort or another.
</p>

<p id="p_346">              3.92. Prior publication of a design by prior use can be said to
              take place when the design has been applied to articles and
              those articles have been used in such a way that the design
              becomes disclosed to the public before the date of
              application for registration of the design in suit. It should be
              noted that it is sufficient if the design is used on any kind of
              article, and it need not be the same article, or even in the
              same category, as the article in respect of which the design is
              registered or sought to be registered.
</p>

<p id="p_347">              3.93. In general there will be publication if articles to which
              the design is applied are manufactured, displayed or used in
              such a way that members of the public will or might see
              them. It is not necessary that the articles should have been
              sold.
</p>

<p id="p_348">              3.95. Thus, if the use was in such a position and in such
              circumstances that some members of the public would be
              likely to have seen the design, there will be publication, even
              though it is not proved that anyone did examine it.
</p>

<p id="p_349">              3.96. The disclosure of the prior use need not be to a large
              number of the public. If there has been a disclosure of the
              design to any individual member of the public....
</p>

<p id="p_350">              3.121. ...However, there is no restriction on the manner in
              which the design comes to be published and the disclosure
              could even be purely oral. In general, there will be
              publication if the design is disclosed to any individual
              member of the public who is not under any obligation to
              secrecy. Disclosure to merely one such person will be

              class of articles to which the design applies. The introduction
              of ordinary trade variants into an old design cannot make it
              new or original. For example, if it is common practice to
              have or not to have spikes in the soles of running shoes, a
              man does not make a new or original design out of an old
              type of running shoe by putting spikes into the soles.
</p>

<p id="p_352">              3.181. In order to ascertain what the registered design is, so
              that it may be compared with the alleged infringement, it is
              necessary to examine the representation of the design on the
              register. A copy of this is in practice attached to the
              certificate of registration...although if this course is adopted
              care should be taken to avoid introducing further features
              which are not present on the representation on the register....

<p id="p_353">              3.182. A registration, if valid gives to the registered
              proprietor an exclusive right in relation to article to which

              the plaintiff possesses registration of
              designs in question, defendant can, in
              an action by the plaintiff brought in
              the suit, plead that the designs in

              that the plaintiff is the proprietor of
              the design but only a prima facie
              evidence that he is the proprietor. The
              plaintiff has the advantage that if no

              &quot;If it has been pre-published it cannot

              that the effect of <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_241">Section 53</a> of the
              Act is to grant statutory right to the
              person   who   happens   to   have got
              registered and that the person has an
              absolute statutory right until the
              registration is set aside. I do not
              agree. The reason is that it really
              does not matter much in this case
              whether the defendants&#x27; defenses are
              considered in the infringement suit or

              a serious dispute as to the validity of

              has held as under :

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">                     &quot;11. It is the case of the Plaintiffs
                     that they have been manufacturing and
                     marketing Electric Kitchen Appliances
                     for several years. During the course of
                     business, they have designed a novel
                     Unitary Multilayer Container and Idly
                     Plates. The said design was registered
                     with the Controller General of Patents,
                     Designs and Trade Marks in Design No.
                     256062. While so, recently, in the year
                     2014, the Plaintiffs came to know that
                     the Defendants are also manufacturing
                     and    selling      Unitary    Multilayer
                     Container and Idly Plates, which is an
                     exact     imitation     of    Plaintiffs&#x27;
                     registered design. It is the further
                     case of the Plaintiffs that unlike the
                     Trademarks Act, the Plaintiffs need not
                     establish the prior usage or good will
                     or reputation and if there is valid
                     registration, that would suffice to
                     grant   Interim   Injunction    in  their
                     favour. Per contra, according to the
                     Defendants, the design adopted by the
                     Plaintiffs is not a new and original
                     one and hence, the same ought not to
                     have been registered. In fact, the
                     Defendants have also filed a Petition
                     in Form 8 for cancellation of the
                     registration of the Design No. 256062
                     in Class 07-02 before the Controller of

              outer wall of the Plaintiffs&#x27; container
              was already in public domain. Further,
              a perusal of the Tamil Nadu Stainless
              Steel Merchants Association Member&#x27;s
              Directory,   2009,   would   show  that
              already the design was in public domain
              and further from the United States
              Design Patent Nos. US D 522,809 and US
              D545,137 produced by the Defendants, it
              could be seen that the said design was
              already registered in United States.
              Under such circumstances, I am of the
              opinion, the design is not liable to be
              registered and the same is liable to be
              cancelled under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_255">Section 19(1)(a)</a> &amp; (b)
              of the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_256">Designs Act</a>, 2000. But, it is
              the submission of the learned Counsel
              appearing for the Plaintiffs that since
              the said design is registered, unless
              the said registration is set aside, the
              Defendants cannot oppose the grant of
              Interim Injunction. But, I am not
              inclined to accept the said submission
              made by the learned Counsel appearing

              this Court as held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_378">                   &quot;15. By incorporating sub-section
              (3) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_263">Section 22</a> of the Designs Act,
              the registration of a design may be
              cancelled on every ground available as
              a ground of defence. The grounds on
              which the registration of a design can
              be cancelled have been enumerated in
              <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_264">Section 19</a> of the Act. If a design is a
              conception, suggestion or idea of a
              shape is not an article. If it has
              already been anticipated, it is not new
              or original. If it has been pre
              published, it cannot claim protection
              as   publication    before   registration
              defeats   the   proprietor&#x27;s   right   to
              protection under the Act. Thus, looked
              at from any angle from the documents
              placed    on    record,    the    designs
              registered by the Plaintiffs have been
              pre-published and therefore they cannot
              claim      protection,     since      the
              registration of the designs are only
              few years later than the publication of
              the         designs        by         the
              Respondents/Defendants. The grounds of
              defence as mentioned in <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_265">Section 19</a> can
              be taken by the Respondents/Defendants
              pursuant to sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_266">Section
              22</a> of the Designs Act and therefore no
              injunction can be granted as there is a
              serious dispute with regard to the
              validity of the designs to be tried in
              the        Suit.        Hence,        the
              Applicants/Plaintiffs are not entitled

                   The dictum laid down in the above
              judgment would show that if the design
              is already in public domain, the same
              cannot be registered. If such a design
              is   registered,   the   same   can   be
              cancelled. Even before cancellation of
              the design, if a Suit is brought
              against a person for infringement, the

<p id="p_380">                   13.   In  yet   another   decision
              reported in <a href="/doc/1666328/" id="a_268">Taparia Tools Limited v.
              Ambica Overseas and Anr</a>., : , the
              Bombay High Court has held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_381">                   &quot;21. I am, prima facie, of the
              view that Plaintiffs design of Wrench
              is   published    in   India   and    other
              countries    prior    to   the   date    of
              registration by them. Although, Mr.
              Shah would contend that the statement
              in the affidavit in reply to the
              aforesaid effect is not supported by
              any materials, in my view, a perusal of
              Exhibits to the Affidavit in reply and
              the further reply would go to show that
              the designs of Wrenches have been
              published   in    India   prior    to   the
              registration in favour of Plaintiffs.
              The exhibits are not mere extracts of
              information available on inter-net.
              There is an extract of the Certificate
              of   ISI.   The    information    may    be
              available on inter-net/web-site but
              when the same contains statements about
              parties using such designs from 1984-
              85, it cannot be brushed aside straight
              away. The truth and veracity of such
              statements     in    addition    to     the
              assertions on affidavit will have to be
              decided   at    the    trial.   Even    the
              Plaintiff could have filed further
              Affidavit but that opportunity is not
              availed off. Further, several Wrenches

              available in the market were produced
              for my perusal. When I saw each one of
              them it is clear to the naked eye that
              their shape and configuration is common
              to that of the Plaintiff. Even the
              scale marking appears to be common.
              Thus, insofar as the scale marking is
              concerned, there does not appear to be
              any novelty. Even as regards the shape
              and configuration of the Wrench, there
              is ample material produced by the First
              Defendant to prima facie negative the
              pleas of Plaintiff.&quot;

              reported in <a href="/doc/793618/" id="a_269">Rotela Auto Components Pvt.
              Ltd. v. Jaspal Singh and Ors</a>., 2002 24
              PTC 449, it has been held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_383">                   &quot;28. As far as present Act is
              concerned,   the    legislature   in  its
              wisdom by incorporating sub-section (3)
              of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_270">Section 22</a> of the Act has made every
              ground, on which registration of a
              design may be cancelled, available as a
              ground of defense. The ground on which
              cancellation     can     be   sought   of
              registration are enumerated in <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_271">Section
              19</a> of the Act. It may be noticed that
              the design is a conception, suggestion
              or idea of a shape and not an article.
              It has already been anticipated, it is
              new or original, if it has been pre-
              published, it cannot claim protection
              as   publication     before  registration
              defeats the proprietor&#x27;s rights to
              protection under the Act.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_384">                  In the instant case, several
              materials   are  produced   by   the
              Defendants to show that the design
              alleged to have been invented by the
              Plaintiff, was already in public
              domain. When it is already in public
              domain, it is a valid ground for
              cancellation of the registration.

                  When the ground for cancellation of
                  the design is established before
                  this Court, this Court cannot grant
                  Interim Injunction. In this regard,
                  learned Counsel appearing for the
                  Plaintiffs    by   relying    upon   the
                  decision of this Court reported in
                  <a href="/doc/113164365/" id="a_272">M.C. Jayasingh v. Mishra Dhatu Nigam

                  (Regional   Cancer     Centre),    :   ,
                  submitted that if there is a valid
                  registration,    the   Plaintiffs    are
                  entitled for Interim Injunction. A
                  reading of the said judgment would
                  show   that    in    that   case,    the
                  Defendant therein had not challenged
                  the registration of the design. In
                  fact, the learned Judge has observed
                  in that judgment that since the
                  Defendant had not challenged the
                  registration, it has to be taken
                  that the validity of the Plaintiffs
                  design was not under challenge. But,
                  in the instant case, the Defendant
                  has     already      challenged      the
                  registration    by   filing    necessary
                  Application.    Therefore,    the   said
                  decision cannot be made applicable
                  to the facts of the present case.

<p id="p_387">              &quot;21. We have reproduced a large number
              of paragraphs both of the judgments, of
              the learned Single Judge in Gopal Glass
              work&#x27;s case, and of the Supreme Court
              in the appeal from the judgment of
              Gopal Glass Work&#x27;s case in Bharat Das
              Tools Ltd. because, it is only on the
              reading of these paras it becomes clear
              that the Supreme Court in no manner
              laid down an absolute rule that there
              can never be prior publication although
              in the public record of the Registrar
              of Design abroad a particular design is
              found to be registered. The Supreme
              Court in fact has specifically held
              that facts in each case have to be very
              minutely examined and Courts have to be
              extremely   cautious     by    thoroughly
              scrutinizing the evidence in each case
              for deciding whether the public record
              available in Registrar of Design abroad
              could or could not be taken as prior
              publication, and in the peculiar facts
              of the case before the Supreme Court
              when we refer to paragraphs 45 to 47 it
              becomes clear that the Supreme Court
              approved the view of the learned Single
              Judge of the Calcutta High Court in
              Gopal Glass Work&#x27;s case because even
              the Supreme Court found that sufficient
              evidence was not led on behalf of the
              objector to the registered design and
              that the documents downloaded through
              internet from the website of U.K.
              Patent Office did not add that amount
              of clarity for the same to be said to
              be   prior   publication    for   seeking
              cancellation on the basis of such
              alleged prior publication of a design
              registered in India.

              and Howe on Industrial Designs VIIIth
              Edition:
</p>
<p id="p_389">              What counts as &quot;published&quot; for the
              purpose of calling into question the
              novelty of a later design registration?
              This is broader than the word at first
              suggests. It is by no means limited to
              the publishing of a design in a printed
              publication, although it includes that.
              In practical terms, there are two main
              ways   in  which   a   design  can   be
              published: by prior use of the design,
              by selling or displaying to the public
              articles to which the design has been
              applied; and by paper publications of
              one sort or another. It is not, in
              fact, necessary that publication should
              be on paper; an oral disclosure,
              provided it is non-confidential, will
              amount to publication.
</p>
<p id="p_390">              Re-registration of the same design for
              different articles, or a similar design
              for same or different articles.
</p>
<p id="p_391">              A special exception existed to the
              general rule that the novelty of a
              design will be destroyed by the prior
              registration or publication of that
              design as applied to any kind of
              article. By S.4(1) of the RDA(A), the
              proprietor of a registered design was
              entitled to apply for registration of
              the same design, or a design with
              modifications    or    variations   not
              sufficient to affect its identity, in
              respect of another article. His own
              previous    registration,     or    the
              publication    of    his    design   as
              registered, does not then destroy the
              novelty of his new design registration
              in respect of the new article, but his
              term of protection is limited to the
              term of the original design. This, in
              effect, gave the proprietor of a design
              registration the ability to extend the

              scope of the registration during its
              lifetime to cover further articles,
              although    in    formal   terms    each
              application to protect his design on a
              new   article   will   be   a   separate
              application   leading   to   a  separate
              design registration. It appears that
              his application for registration of the
              design on the new article must precede
              his actual use of the design on the new
              article. This is because, if he uses
              the design on an article which falls
              outside the scope of his earlier
              registration, then that will not 3-106
              count   as   a   publication   &quot;of   the
              registered design&quot;, which is all that
              s.4(1) of the RDA(A) shields him
              against as regards the novelty of his
              new application.
</p>
<p id="p_392">              A person who makes an application to
              register a design and finds that it has
              previously been registered in respect
              of a different article was allowed to
              buy up the earlier design registration
              while his own application was still
              pending, and if he did so he could take
              advantage of this rule in the same way
              as if he had himself been the owner of
              the earlier registration all along.
</p>
<p id="p_393">              The   same    rule    applied   to  the
              registration (whether in respect of the
              same article or a different article) of
              a design which is not exactly the same
              as the earlier registered design, but
              has &quot;modifications or variations not
              sufficient to alter the character or
              substantially to affect the identity
              thereof&quot;. However, this provision has
              been   interpreted   narrowly   so that
              practically any significant change or
              difference between the earlier and
              later    design    will    destroy  the
              protective effect of this provision.

</p>
<p id="p_394">              In Sebel Ltd&#x27;s Application (No.1), it
              was held that substitution in the old
              design   of  a   different  stand   did
              substantially alter the identity of the

              subsection did not apply. Since the
              stand had already been published in an
              advertisement showing it applied to
              another horse, it was held that design
              failed to qualify for novelty under
              s.1, the said stand being a mere trade
              variant. In Sebel Ltd&#x27;s Application
              (No.2), a design was held not to fall
              within s.4 because the character of the
              design was different from the character
              of the applicant s earlier design. Thus
              it seems that the applicant s own
              earlier design may be sufficiently
              similar to destroy the novelty of his
              later application for protection of his
              modified design, and yet too different
              to allow him to take advantage of the
              protection of RDA(A) s.4(1). This is an
              odd and unfortunate result if it is
              indeed correct.

<p id="p_395">              Publication in documents In cases of
              publication of a design by prior use as
              applied to an article, normally the
              only questions which arise are whether
              it has been published at all (i.e
              whether the articles to which it has
              been applied have been disclosed to the
              public), and whether the design is
              similar enough to the design in suit to
              destroy the latter s novelty. But where
              the novelty of a design is tested
              against a prior published document, a
              number of additional questions can
              arise which do not arise in the case of
              a prior use.

              catalogue containing photographs or
              illustrations of articles to which a
              design has been applied may be a clear
              enough case.
</p>
<p id="p_397">              But the publication in a document of a
              pattern or picture does not as such
              destroy the novelty of a design which
              consists of applying that pattern or
              picture to an article. For it to
              destroy the novelty of such a design,
              the paper publication must suggest
              explicitly or implicitly by context
              that the pattern or picture should be
              applied to an article.
</p>

              dimensional) or shape (if it is three-
              dimensional) of the design may not be
              clear from the document. Particularly
              in a case where it involves a written
              description rather than an explicit
              picture or illustration, there may be
              room for argument as to the precise
              nature of the design which the document
              discloses, before one can go on to ask
              whether or not it is similar enough to
              the later design to destroy novelty.

              did not apply it industrially to an

              of it counting against the novelty of

<p id="p_401"> C/CS/2/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 29/10/2021



              In order to destroy the novelty of a
              design registration, an earlier design
              must be published &quot;in respect of the
              same or any other article&quot;. Mere
              publication   of   the   pattern  which
              constitutes the design was therefore
              not sufficient to destroy the novelty
              of   a   design   registration,   which
              consisted of the application of that
              pattern to an article. In principle,
              the same holds true of the publication
              of a shape, although it is less easy to
              envisage cases where the publication of
              a shape does not implicitly convey the
              article to which that shape is to be
              applied. Thus, novelty may reside in
              the application of an old shape or
              pattern to new subject-matter. This was
              first laid down in the leading case of
              Saunders v Wiel. There, the design
              consisted of the handle of a spoon made
              to represent Westminster Abbey seen
              from a particular point of view. The
              design had actually been copied from a
              photograph of the Abbey.
</p>
<p id="p_402">              The validity of the design was upheld,
              Bowen L.J. saying &quot;It seems to me that
              the novelty and originality in the
              design, within this section, is not
              destroyed by its being taken from a
              source common to mankind...The novelty
              may consist in the applicability to the
              article of manufacture of a drawing or
              design which is taken from a source to
              which   all  the   world  may   resort.
              Otherwise, it would be impossible to
              take any natural or artistic object and
              to reduce it into a design applicable
              to an article of manufacture, without
              also having this consequence following,
              that you could not do it at all in the
              first place unless you were to alter
              the design so as not to represent
              exactly the original; otherwise there
              would be no novelty in it, because it
              would be said that the thing which was

              taken was not new. You could not take a
              tree and put it on a spoon, unless you
              drew the tree in some shape in which a
              tree never grew, nor an elephant unless
              you drew it and carved it of a kind
              which   had    never   been    seen.   An
              illustration, it seems to me, that may
              be taken about this is what we all know
              as the Apostles spoons. The figures of
              the Apostles are figures which have
              been   embodied    in  sacred   art   for
              centuries, and there is nothing new in
              taking the figures of the Apostles, but
              the novelty of applying the figures of
              the   Apostles    to   spoons    was   in
              contriving   to   design   the   Apostles
              figures   so    that  they    should   be
              applicable to that particular subject-
              matter. How does a building differ from
              that? In no sense it seems to me.
</p>
<p id="p_403">              It should be recalled that under the
              1949 Act, if a pattern (or shape) has
              been published in respect of any
              article, the publication will destroy
              the   novelty     of   any    design   which
              consists of the application of that
              pattern (or shape) to an article of any
              kind, however different it is from the
              kind    of    article     to    which    the
              publication suggests that the design
              should    be    applied.     However,    the
              publication will not invalidate such
              later design registrations if it does
              not suggest the application of the
              pattern (or shape) to an article at
              all.   Thus,    a    series    of   pictures
              published in a fine art catalogue would
              not destroy the novelty of a later
              design consisting of the application of
              one of those pictures to, say, the back
              of a chair, because a painting or
              picture     simpliciter      is    not    an
              &quot;article&quot;.    But     the   same    pictures
              published in a catalogue of patterns
              for application to wallpaper would
              destroy the novelty of such a later

              is an article.

<p id="p_404">              What design is disclosed by a prior
              published document? Assuming that a
              prior published document does satisfy
              the requirement that it discloses a
              design, i.e a shape or pattern, as
              applied or to be applied to an article,
              the next question may be what is the
              shape or pattern which it discloses? In
              some cases this will be clear, for
              instance where the publication contains
              explicit pictures or illustrations.
              However, it may be less clear and the
              disclosure may consist in whole or in
              part of written text which needs to be
              interpreted, or general instructions
              which can be put into practice in a
              variety of ways. In such cases the test
              to be applied is that borrowed from the
              pre-1977 patent law of anticipation,
              i.e that the prior art document must
              contain    &quot;clear   and    unmistakable
              directions&quot; to make an article with the
              shape or pattern which is the same as ,
              or similar enough to the registered
              design in suit to deprive it of
              novelty.

<p id="p_405">              This   was   laid   down  in   Rosedale

              case of a registered design, and as
              regards the former, I venture to cite
              once more the oft-quoted language of
              Lord Westbury in Hills v Evans: &#x27;The

              experiments. By a like reasoning, to my
              mind, if a document is to constitute
              prior publication, then a reader of it,
              possessed 3-123 of ordinary knowledge
              of the subject, must from his reading
              of the document be able at least to see
              the design in his mind&#x27;s eye and should
              not   have  to   depend   on  his   own
              originality to construct the design

              the question is solely a question of

              apparatus    described    in  an    earlier
              specification could have been used to
              produce this or that result. It must
