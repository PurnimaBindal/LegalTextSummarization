                          Date of Judgment: 17.05.2013

</pre><p id="p_3">B.N. MAHAPATRA, J. This writ petition has been filed with a prayer to quash the

        order dated 20.09.2011 passed under Annexure-11 by opposite party No.1

        Appellate Authority-cum-Deputy Electrical Inspector (T &amp; D), Balasore in

        AAC No.01.07.2011 on the ground that the same is illegal, arbitrary and

        contrary to Rules and Regulations of OERC Distribution (Conditions of

        Supply) Code, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as "OERC Distribution Code,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>



2004"). The further prayer of the petitioner is to declare the order of final

assessment passed by the Assessing Officer as legal, correct and justified.

</p><p id="p_4">2.          Petitioner's case in a nut-shell is that opposite party No.2 is a

consumer of electricity under the petitioner and initially on 07.04.1999

executed an agreement in order to avail power supply to his rice mill for a

contract demand of 83 KW as a medium industry. It has been specifically

stated in the said agreement that the tariff shall be applicable for supply of

powers at a single point for the purpose of industrial production with a

contract demand/connected load of 22 KVA and above but exceeding 110

KVA where power is provided as motive force. Further condition was that

the consumer shall take from the supplier a supply up to but not exceeding

the contract demand of 83 KW. On a general review, it was found from the

meter reading that the M.D.I. was recorded as 146.5 KW which is more

than the existing contract demand of 83 KW. Since said additional load was

extracted without taking permission from the authority, opposite party No.2

was requested to execute fresh agreement on enhanced load after

completion of all formalities. Opposite party No.2 deliberately with a mala

fide intention did not execute the agreement and simply paid the over-

drawal penalty. Charges were levied on the basis of contract demand or

energy charges on the basis of actual consumption and on payment of the

penalty, subsequent bill was raised treating it as large industry. On many

occasions, it was found that the M.D.I. exceeds contract demand for which

penalty for over-drawal has been charged as per Regulation and prevailing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>



RST order. It was further found that the contract demand enhanced from

83 KW to 160 KVA and bill was raised according to consumption as large

industry tariff and then 260 KVA and finally 340 KVA. Permission was

granted for enhancement of contract demand from 160 KVA to 260 KVA on

15.11.2003 with condition to execute the agreement. In spite of the same,

opposite party No.2 did not come forward to execute the agreement. In the

said letter, additional security deposit for 260 KVA to a tune of

Rs.3,46,050/- was directed to be deposited before entering into fresh

agreement. It was further intimated that the previous agreement, which

was executed on 07.04.1999, would be superseded by the fresh agreement.

Due to excess drawal of 340 KVA over contract demand of 260 KVA,

opposite party No.2-consumer was noticed vide letter No.2620 dated

18.11.2006 to execute fresh agreement at enhanced load after observing all

formalities. Till the date of filing of the writ petition, except the initial

agreement under Annexure-1, opposite party No.2 has not executed any

agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.           While the matter stood thus on 10.05.2011, the premises of

opposite party No.2-consumer was verified by a Vigilance team of NESCO

and during inspection, it was found that the said opposite party No.2 itself

is indulged in unauthorized use of power. On such inspection, it was found

that opposite party No.2-consumer has given.-- (i) extended load to an

under-construction oil refinery unit adjacent to the existing unit; (ii) the

consumer has used a black colour 35 mm sq. 3 and Â½ core cable and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      4</span>



availed power supply from distribution panel board existing at SNM

business own building to the under construction building near about 200

meter approximately; (iii) the consumer has taken extended load violating

the OERC Code, 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          Though opposite party No.2 was present at the spot but

refused to sign. However, one Sanjay Somai received one copy at the

instance of the consumer. One Chandan Pal was also present as

representative of the consumer. Spot verification report dated 10.05.2011

under Annexure-5 was filed. Provisional assessment was made on the basis

of the spot verification report of the premises of opposite party No.2. The

Assessing Officer passed the provisional assessment order raising demand

of Rs.11,98,934.88, which was served upon opposite party No.2 with a

request to file objection within seven days of receipt of the same and fixed

the date of hearing to 27.05.2011. Cost of cubical meter was separately

added and opposite party No.2 was directed to pay Rs.15,48,371/- under

Annexure-6. Opposite party No.2 sought for extension of time to file

objection and filed the same on 30.05.2011 challenging the provisional

assessment order dated 10.05.2011. In the objection, opposite party No.2

has stated that since verification was made on 10.05.2011, calculation for

12 months is wrong. It was further stated that the calculation made during

spot verification about unauthorized consumption of power of 69 KVA is

wrong and the same is 77 KVA. The penalty for over-drawal has been

charged and he has paid the same. Therefore, the load has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                             5</span>



regularized. Taking into consideration the objection filed by opposite party

No.2   on   30.05.2011,      the   Assessing       Officer   disposed    of   the    said

objection/show cause after providing opportunity of hearing and passed the

final assessment order on 10.06.2011 raising demand of Rs.11,98,934.88.

The cost of cubical meter was excluded while passing the final assessment

order on 10.06.2011 under Annexure-8.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.          Challenging      the    final       assessment    order     passed      under

Annexure-8 opposite party No.2 preferred appeal before the appellate

authority. In the said appeal, allegation of unauthorized extension of power

to an under-construction oil refinery unit adjoining to the original unit was

challenged. It was further contended that opposite party No.2 has applied

for a contract demand of 600 KVA as additional load to the new unit which

is a part and parcel of the existing unit and therefore the use of power for

the said construction purpose cannot be said to be unauthorized. The said

appeal was contested by the petitioner by filing reply justifying the order of

final assessment. The appellate authority after hearing both parties passed

the impugned order on 20.09.2011 under Annexure-11 setting aside the

final order of assessment and directed the petitioner herein to return 50%

of the penal assessment amount deposited with petitioner by the appellant-

opposite party No.2 by way of adjustment in subsequent energy bill. Hence,

the present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          Mr.P.K. Tripathy, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner-

Licensee submitted that the entire order of appellate authority is based on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>



no evidence. The said order is completely inconsistent with both fact and law

for which the order of the appellate authority is liable to be quashed. Spot

verification and assessment have been made in accordance with law that too

after providing opportunity of hearing to opposite party No.2. Therefore, the

final assessment order is legal and justified. The appellate authority has not

assigned any reason for holding that the spot verification report and

enhancement of load bears no weight because of procedural lapses.

</p><p id="p_9">7.          Placing reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in the cases of Sant Lal Gupta and others Vs. Modern Cooperative Group

Housing Society Ltd. and others, (2010) 13 SCC 336 and State of Uttaranchal

and another Vs. Sunil Kumar Vaish and others, AIR SCW 5486 it was

submitted that not only administrative but also judicial order must be

supported by reason recorded in it and while deciding an issue the Court is

bound to give reason for its conclusion. But in the impugned order passed by

the appellate authority no reason has been assigned in support of its findings.

The finding of the appellate authority at page 3 itself speaks that opposite

party No.2 was consuming unauthorized power without prior approval of the

licensee for such enhancement of load as per OERC Code, 2004. In absence of

any agreement or sanction for the purpose of oil refinery and solvent

extraction plant, the appellate authority wrongly came to the conclusion that

the Assessing Officer had the latent willingness. Additional security has not

been taken at any point of time for oil refinery and solvent extraction plant.

Opposite party No.2 has not executed agreement for oil refinery and solvent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>



extraction plant. Before taking power supply, execution of agreement in the

standard format as per Form No.3 is mandatory for those who intend to avail

power supply in three phases. Only after execution of the agreement, the

consumer can be authorized to draw power. Therefore, consumption of power

without execution of agreement is unauthorized.

</p><p id="p_10">8.          It was submitted that payment of over-drawal penalty and

consumption of unauthorized power are two different things. So far the

payment of over-drawal penalty is concerned, the Commission has allowed

the consumer with two part tariff to draw up to 120% of their contract

demand during off peak hours, i.e., 12 mid night to 6 AM next day with a

view that drawal during off peak hours helps the system for maintenance of

better frequency profile. In reverse, consumer will pay penalty. At the same

time, the consumer is paying penalty for unauthorized consumption of

power as per Section 126 when he used excessive load as against the

installed load simpliciter and there is violation of terms and conditions of

supply. As per Clause 105 of the OERC Code, 2004, no consumer shall sell

or transfer or divert power to any person or premises unless the agreement

so provides. Clause-106 of the said Code provides that no consumer shall

make use of power in excess of the approved contract demand or use power

for a purpose other than the one for which agreement has been executed or

shall dishonestly abstract power from the licensee's system. Therefore,

consumption of power in violation of Regulation and agreement for the

purpose of construction of oil refinery and solvent extraction plant is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       8</span>



unauthorized and the assessment made under Section 126 is justified.

Placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case

of Punjab State Electricity Board Vs Vishwa Caliber Builders, (2010) 4 SCC

539, Mr. Tripathy submitted that on payment of over-drawal penalty, the

unauthorized consumption cannot be regularized. The appellate authority

is not justified to hold that the supply of power to the oil refinery and

solvent extraction plant cannot be treated as different from the earlier

purpose for which power supply was permitted, i.e., for the rice mill.

Violation of terms and conditions of the agreement lead to mal practice.

Finding of the appellate authority to the effect that construction of the

extended premises could be treated in the same manner as repair and

maintenance and renovation work of the existing unit is not correct. On the

face of admission by opposite party No.2 that he was using power supply

for other purpose, the appellate authority is not justified to set aside the

order impugned therein. Further, placing reliance on the judgment of this

Court in the case of Dinesh Kumar Pathak and another vs. Sri Trailokya

Mishra, 2010 (Supp-II) OLR 426 and judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in Sant Lal Gupta (supra), it was submitted that the present writ

petition is maintainable. Unauthorized consumption of power is loss to the

licensee.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.          Mr. Tripathy further submitted that there is no provision under

the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 and Regulations framed thereunder for regularization

of unauthorized use of electricity. Consumption of excess load is always
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       9</span>



considered as unauthorized. Placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Executive Engineer and another Vs. M/s Seetaram Rice Mill,

(2012) 2 SCC 108, Mr. Tripathy submitted that provision of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Section 126</a> read

with <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">Section 127</a> of the Act, 2003, in fact, becomes a Code in itself and right

from initiation of the proceedings by conducting an inspection, to the right of

filing an appeal before the appellate authority, all matters are squarely

covered under these provisions. It specifically provides the method of

computation of electricity and the manner of conducting assessment

proceedings. Execution of agreement between the parties at the time of

sanction of the load prohibits consumption of electricity in excess of

maximum sanctioned/ installed load. In the event of default, it embodies

complete process of assessment, determination and passing of a demand

order. The defined legislative purpose cannot be frustrated by interpreting a

provision in a manner not intended in law. Execution of agreement on

30.05.2012 between the parties for enhancement of load from 340 KVA to 600

KVA proves itself that in absence of agreement and sanction, opposite party

No.2 was drawing excess power for the purpose of construction of oil refinery

unit, which is unauthorized in view of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Section 126</a> of the Act, 2003. Therefore,

the proceedings initiated against opposite party No.2 is legal and justified.

Concluding the argument, Mr.Tripathy prayed to allow the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_12">10.         Mr.L.Pangari, learned counsel appearing for opposite party

No.2 submitted that ordinarily while exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India a writ Court does not sit on appeal to re-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      10</span>



appreciate the evidence on record unless it is shown that the order of the

Court/forum below is patently illegal, perverse and cannot be allowed to

stand as it is. Since the matter involves use of electricity, it requires

adequate knowledge and experience in the subject/field. The Legislature in

its wisdom has entrusted the task of deciding an appeal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Section 127</a>

of the Act, 2003. In the instant case, appellate authority being the fact

finding authority has decided the appeal by passing a reasoned order and

therefore the same is not open for challenge by the petitioner on flimsy and

mere technical grounds and therefore the writ petition is liable to be

dismissed. The provisional assessment order is passed without jurisdiction

and without authority of law in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_7">Section 126</a> of the

Act, 2003, inasmuch as, when there is no allegation regarding theft of

electricity by way of hooking, by-passing or tampering of meter and more

particularly when there is no allegation regarding any escaped consumption

or loss to NESCO. The alleged enhancement / extension of load by the

petitioner was within the knowledge and with the consent of the petitioner.

Earlier enhancement of load to 260 KVA and 340 KVA was within the

knowledge and approval of the petitioner as per Annexure-A/2 series.

Hence, the allegation of unauthorized use of electricity is misconceived.

</p><p id="p_13">11.         It was submitted that whenever opposite party No.2 exceeded

the contract demand of 340 KVA, it was subjected to over-drawal charges

at the rate prescribed under the relevant Tariff Order of the OERC and

opposite party No.2 has paid such over-drawal charges as claimed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>



petitioner in the energy bills for the months of January, February, March

and April, 2011. Referring to paragraph 523 of the OERC Tariff Order dated

20.03.2010 for the financial year 2010-11, Mr.Pangari submitted that the

existing tariff structure for the consumers availing power supply with a

contract demand of 110 KVA and above, which includes Large Industry

category like opposite party No.2, permits such consumer to draw power in

excess of his contract demand subject to payment of over-drawal charges.

There is no illegality in drawing excess load subject to payment of over-

drawal charges, which is permissible under law. Further placing reliance on

paragraph 539 of the said Tariff Order, it is submitted that when the

maximum demand exceeds the contract demand during the hours other

than off peak hours, such excess demand is liable for a penalty and

payable at the prescribed rate of demand charge.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.          Mr.Pangari further submitted that when the allegation in the

verification report is confined to drawl of excess load of 69 KVA by opposite

party No.2 over and above the existing contract demand of 340 KVA, the

same would be permissible under law and cannot be said to be

unauthorized use/consumption within the meaning of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_8">Section 126</a> of the

Act, 2003, more particularly when the application dated 07.04.2011 of

opposite party No.2 for enhancement of load is under process by the

petitioner. The allegation regarding extension of excess load to an adjacent

oil refinery unit is totally misconceived in fact and law. The adjacent

premises is also owned by opposite party No.2 and the refinery unit is a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12</span>



downstream sub-unit of the main rice mill for better utilization of the by-

products of the rice mill.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.          Mr. Pangari further submitted that opposite party No.2 having

applied for enhancement of the load and while such application is under

process by the petitioner, passing of provisional as well as final assessment

order basing upon verification report dated 10.05.2011 for the self same

use is illegal, which has been rightly set aside by the appellate authority.

Appellate authority is fully justified to hold that the extended premises of

the existing unit cannot be treated as a different premises keeping in view

the nature and purpose of use of electricity by opposite party No.2 in its

rice mill and the expanded units like oil mill and solvent extraction plant

and the refinery mill. Therefore, question of sale or transfer or diversion of

power to any other person as prohibited under Regulation-105 of the OERC

Code, 2004 does not arise, inasmuch as the refinery unit is not a different

unit altogether having no nexus with the main unit, i.e., the rice mill.

Concluding his argument, Mr. Pangari submitted for dismissal of the writ

petition and for a direction to refund the amount of Rs.5,99,468/-

deposited by opposite party No.2, as per the order of the appellate

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.          On the rival contentions of both parties, following questions

arise for consideration by this Court.

              valid in law? If the answer is affirmative whether the order of
              the appellate authority is sustainable in law?
</p><p id="p_23">      (vi)    What order?
</p><p id="p_24">15.           Question No.(i) relates to maintainability of the writ petition.

Case of opposite party no.2- consumer is that ordinarily while exercising

power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the Court does not sit

on appeal to re-appreciate the evidence on record. Unless, it is shown that

the order of the Forum below is patently illegal, perverse and cannot be

allowed to stand as it is, the Court should not exercise its judicial review

power. The appellate authority who possesses adequate knowledge and

experience in the subject/ field having decided the appeal, the same is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                       14</span>



open for challenge by the licensee on flimsy and technical grounds and

therefore, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The contention of the

licensee-petitioner is that power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_11">Article 227</a> of the Constitution can

be exercised to interfere with the order of the Lower Court in cases of

serious derelictions of duty and flagrant violation of fundamental principle

of law or injustice, but in absence of intervention by the Hon'ble Court,

grave injustice would be caused.
</p>
<p id="p_25">16.         At this juncture, it is necessary to refer to the decision of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shivedeo Singh and others vs. State

of Punjab and others, AIR 1963 SC 1909, wherein it is held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "8.    The other contention of Mr. Gopal Singh pertains
            to the second order of Khosla, J., which in effect,
            reviews his prior order. Learned counsel contends that
            <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution does not confer any power
            on the High Court to review its own order and,
            therefore, the second order of Khosla, J., was without
            jurisdiction. It is sufficient to say that there is nothing
            in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution to preclude a High
            Court from exercising the power of review which
            inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent
            miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable
            errors committed by it. Here the previous order of

<p id="p_26">17.         The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sant Lal Gupta

and Ors (supra), held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "28. The High Court ought to have considered that it
            was a writ of certiorari and it was not dealing with an
            appeal. The writ of certiorari under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the
            Constitution can be issued only when there is a failure
            of justice and it cannot be issued merely because it
            may be legally permissible to do so. There must be an
            error apparent on the face of record as the High Court
            acts merely in a supervisory capacity. An error
            apparent on the face of the record means an error
            which strikes one on mere looking and does not need
            long drawn out process of reasoning on points where
            there may conceivably be two opinions. Such error
            should not require any extraneous matter to show its
            incorrectness. Such errors may include the giving of
            reasons that are bad in law or inconsistent,
            unintelligible or inadequate. It may also include the
            application of a wrong legal test to the facts found,
            taking irrelevant considerations into account and
            failing to take relevant considerations into account,
            and wrongful admission or exclusion of evidence, as
            well as arriving at a conclusion without any
            supporting evidence. Such a writ can be issued when
            there is an error in jurisdiction or authority whose
            order is to be reviewed has acted without jurisdiction
            or in excess of its jurisdiction or has failed to act.
            While issuing the writ of certiorari, the order under
            challenge should not undergo scrutiny of an appellate
            court. It is obligatory on the part of the petitioner to
            show that a jurisdictional error has been committed by
            the statutory authorities. There must be a breach of
            the principles of natural justice for resorting to such a
            course. (<a href="/doc/227988/" id="a_15">Vide Harbans Lal v. Jagmohan Saran</a>, AIR

<p id="p_29">            The stand of the petitioner-licensee is that the spot verification

has been made in accordance with law, whereas the case of the consumer is

contrary to the same. The appellate authority without discussing the rival

contentions of the parties in this regard and assigning any reason observed

that "some procedural lapses have been committed by both the appellant

and respondent in the matter of verification of premises and request for

enhancement of CD which bears no weight at this stage in view of the core of

allegations made by the respondent and objections raised by the appellant

against the same." No reason has been assigned in support of the above

conclusion. There is also no detailed discussion as to why the appellate

authority has come to such a conclusion.

arbitrariness and ensures a degree of fairness in the process of decision-

making. The said purpose would apply equally to all decisions and its

application cannot be confined to decisions which are subject to appeal,

</p>
<p id="p_37">23.          Case of the petitioner-licensee is that the consumer has utilized

the electricity other than the purpose for which the use of electricity was

authorized under the agreement and also that the electricity has been used

for the premises or areas other than those for which the supply of electricity

was authorized. Such allegations are based on the vigilance verification
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       18</span>



report dated 10.05.2011. From the said report, it reveals that during

surprise checking on 10.05.2011 it was found that the consumer has given

extended load to an under-construction oil Refinery Unit which was

adjacent to the unit to which power supply was given by the petitioner-

licensee as per agreement dated 07.04.1999 under Annexue-1. The

consumer has used a black colour 35 mm sq. 3 Â½ core cable and availed

power supply from distribution penal board existing at SNM Business own

building to the under-construction building near about 200 metre distance

approximately. Pursuant to the said report, the Assessing Officer issued a

provisional order alleging unauthorized use of electricity as contemplated

under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_21">Section 126</a> of the Act, 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_38">24.         The case of the opposite party-consumer is that the provisional

assessment order is passed without jurisdiction and without authority of

law in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_22">Section 126</a> of the Act, 2003, inasmuch as

when there is no allegation regarding theft of electricity by way of hooking,

by-passing or tampering of meter and more particularly where there is no

loss to NESCO. The alleged extension of load by the consumer to the

adjacent premises of opp. Party no.2 for the purpose of construction of oil

refinery unit was within the knowledge and with the consent of the

petitioner. In support of his contention, opposite party No.2 relied upon

Annexure-A/2 to the counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_39">25.         Further case of opposite party No.2-consumer is that whenever

it has exceeded the contract demand, it has been subjected to overdrawal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       19</span>



charges at the rate prescribed under the relevant tariff order of the OERC

and opposite party no.2 paid such over-drawal charges claimed by the

petitioner in the energy bill. The existing tariff structure for the consumers

availing power supply with a contract demand of 110 KVA and above which

includes "Larger Industry" category like opposite party No.2 permits such

consumer to draw power in excess of its contract demand subject to

payment of overdrawal charges. Further contention of opposite party no.2

is that verification report is confined to drawal of extended load of 69 KVA it

over and above the existing contract demand of 340 KVA and the same

would be permissible under law and cannot be said to be unauthorized

use/consumption within the meaning of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_23">Section 126</a> of the Act, 2003, more

particularly when the application dated 07.04.2011 of opposite party no.2

for enhancement of load was under process by the petitioner. The allegation

regarding extension of the excess load to an adjacent Oil Refinery Unit is

totally misconceived in fact and law as explained by opposite party no.2 in

it's objection to provisional assessment that the adjacent premises is also

owned by opposite party No.2 and the refinery unit is a downstream sub-

unit of the main Rice Mill for better utilization of the by-products of the

Rice Mill.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            "16. First and foremost, we have to examine how
            provisions like <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_27">Section 126</a> of the 2003 Act should be
            construed. From the objects and reasons stated by
            us in the beginning of this judgment, it is clear that
            "revenue focus" was one of the principal
            considerations that weighed with the legislature
            while enacting this law. The regulatory regime under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                         22</span>



the 2003 Act empowers the Commission to frame the
tariff, which shall be the very basis for raising a
demand upon a consumer, depending upon the
category to which such consumer belongs and the
purpose for which the power is sanctioned to such
consumer. We are not prepared to accept the
contention on behalf of the respondent that the
provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_28">Section 126</a> of the 2003 Act have to be
given a strict and textual construction to the extent
that they have to be read exhaustively in absolute
terms.
</blockquote><p id="p_56">17. This is a legislation which establishes a
regulatory regime for the generation and distribution
of power, as well as deals with serious fiscal
repercussions of this entire regime. In our considered
view, the two maxims which should be applied for
interpretation of such statutes are ex visceribus
actus (construction of the Act as a whole) and ut res
magis valeat quam pereat (it is better to validate a
thing than to invalidate it). It is a settled canon of
interpretative jurisprudence that the statute should
be read as a whole. In other words, its different
provisions may have to be construed together to
make consistent construction of the whole statute
relating to the subject-matter. A construction which
will improve the workability of the statute, to be more
effective and purposive, should be preferred to any
other interpretation which may lead to undesirable
results.

</pre><p id="p_57">"unauthorised use of electricity" under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_29">Section 126</a> of
the 2003 Act deals with cases of unauthorised use,
even in the absence of intention. These cases would
certainly be different from cases where there is
dishonest abstraction of electricity by any of the
methods enlisted under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_30">Section 135</a> of the 2003 Act. A
clear example would be, where a consumer has used
excessive load as against the installed load simpliciter
and there is violation of the terms and conditions of
supply, then, the case would fall under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_31">Section 126</a> of
the 2003 Act. On the other hand, where a consumer,
by any of the means and methods as specified under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                          23</span>



without authorisation, like providing for a direct
connection bypassing the installed meter, the case
would fall under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_34">Section 135</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_58">30. Therefore, there is a clear distinction between the
cases that would fall under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_35">Section 126</a> of the 2003
Act on the one hand and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_36">Section 135</a> of the 2003 Act
on the other. There is no commonality between them
in law. They operate in different and distinct fields.
The assessing officer has been vested with the powers
to pass provisional and final order of assessment in
cases of unauthorised use of electricity and cases of
consumption of electricity beyond contracted load will
squarely fall under such power. The legislative
intention is to cover the cases of malpractices and
unauthorised use of electricity and then theft which is
governed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_37">Section 135</a> of the 2003

</p><p id="p_60">39. ......The expression "unauthorised use of
electricity" on its plain reading means use of electricity
in a manner not authorised by the licensee of the
Board. "Authorisation" refers to the permission of the
licensee to use of electricity, subject to the terms and
conditions for such use and the law governing the
subject.
</p><p id="p_61">40. To put it more aptly, the supply of electricity to a
consumer is always subject to the provisions of the
2003 Act, <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_38">State Act</a>s, Regulations framed thereunder
and the terms and conditions of supply in the form of
a contract or otherwise. Generally, when electricity is
consumed in violation of any or all of these, it would
be understood as "unauthorised use of electricity". But
this general view will have to be examined in the light
of the fact that the legislature has opted to explain this
term for the purposes of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_39">Section 126</a> of the 2003 Act.
</p><p id="p_62">41. The "unauthorised use of electricity" means the

the      illustratively    stated    circumstances      of
"unauthorised use" in the section cannot be construed
as exhaustive. The "unauthorised use of electricity"
would mean what is stated under that Explanation, as

Explanation (b) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_41">Section 126</a> alone, then it shall
defeat the very purpose of the 2003 Act, inasmuch as

            the proposition that the cases of excess load of

            Once this factor is established, then the assessing

Builder Pvt. Ltd.,(supra) held as under:

<pre id="pre_6">            "13. We have considered the arguments of            the
            learned counsel and agree with him that in          the
            absence of any provision in the Act or              the
            Regulations    framed   by   the   appellant,       the
            Ombudsman committed jurisdictional error             by

</p><p id="p_73">31.         In the present case, it is not in dispute that the original

agreement annexed to the writ petition as Annexure-1 reveals that the

consumer has been authorized to utilize the power supply for the purpose

of Rice Mill only but the verification report reveals that opposite party No.2

has extended and utilized the power supply for construction of the oil

refinery unit. The contention of opp. parties no.2-consumer is that use of

the extended load by it for the purpose of construction of oil refinery unit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                      26</span>



was within the knowledge and consent of the petitioner is well evident from

Annexure-A/2 to the counter affidavit filed by opposite party no.2. Perusal

of the said counter affidavit does not reveal that the extended load was

given to an under-construction oil refinery unit. Therefore, such contention

of the petitioner does not merit consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_74">32.         Assuming that extension of load given by the consumer for the

purpose of construction of oil refinery unit was within the knowledge and

consent of the petitioner, it cannot absolve the consumer from being

assessed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_47">Section 126</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_75">            Law is well-settled that there is no estoppel against law.

      Central Excise, Bombay, 1991 Supp. (I) SCC 57)

</p><p id="p_76">33.         Needless to say that any action of public authority de hors the

provision of law or not supported by any provisions of law lacks legal

sanction and therefore does not confer any enforceable right in law.

</p><p id="p_77">34.         Law is well-settled that an order passed by the Court must not

only be inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the

Constitution, but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive

provision of the relevant statute. [<a href="/doc/1624404/" id="a_48">See A.B. Bhaskar Rao vs. Inspector of

OERC for the financial year 2011 has nothing to do with making of

assessment under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_51">Section 126</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_80">37.            Therefore, this Court is of the view that the extension of load

given by the consumer was for the purpose other than for which the use of

electricity was authorized under assessment (Annexure-1) to the writ

petition and the same amounts to unauthorized use of electricity as

contemplated under Explanation (b)(iv) of Sec. 126 of the Act, 2003 and

violative of Clause 106 of OERC Code, 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_81">38.            Now, the question arises whether extension of 69 KVA load by

opp. party no.2 to an adjacent premises for construction purpose amounts

to unauthorized use of electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_82">               Annexure-1, which is a copy of the agreement dated 7 th day of

April, 1999,     reveals that a request has been made by the consumer to

supply electricity energy to its premises situated over Plot No.23, Khata

No.105, Mouza: Patra (Sergad), Tahasil: Balasore and Dist: Balasore for the

purpose of Rice Mill to which the petitioner agreed to supply the power. But

clause (ii) of the application dated 7.4.2011 for power supply of electrical

energy filed by opposite party No.2 (which is available at page 16 of the

counter affidavit) shows that such power is sought in respect of several

plots and Khata numbers. Clause-(iii) of the said application contains the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                      28</span>



purpose for which power is proposed to be used, i.e., processing of paddy,

extraction and refining of oil with its allied and ancillary activity.

Comparison of Annexure-1 and application dated 7.4.2011 for power

supply of electrical energy clearly shows that power supply is required for

different premises.
</p>
<p id="p_83">39.         In the fact situation, this Court is of the view that electricity

used for construction of the oil refinery unit being in a premises other than

the premises for which the supply of electricity was authorized under

Annexure-1 such use of electricity amounts to unauthorized use of the

electricity as contemplated under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_52">Section 126</a> of the Act and violative of

Clause 105 of OERC Code, 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_84">40.         Question No.(v) is as to whether determination of quantum of

electricity as unauthorized use of electricity and extra demand raised on

best judgment basis in the provisional assessment order dated 10.05.2011

and confirmed in final assessment order is valid in law. If the answer is in

affirmative, whether the order of the appellate authority is sustainable in

law.

<p id="p_85">            Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_53">Section 126</a> of the Act contemplates that

when the Assessing Officer comes to the conclusion that a person is

indulging in unauthorized use of electricity, he shall provisionally assess to

the best of his judgment, the electricity charges payable by such person or

by other person benefited by such use.

</p><p id="p_87">41.         Mr. Pangari submitted that the calculation adopted by the

Assessing Officer to convert the KVA to unit has not been prescribed either

in the Regulation or in the Act. It is further submitted that the Central

Government vide the Electricity (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2005 dated

8th June, 2005 has framed the Rule to include in<a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_54"> the Electricity Supply

Code</a>, the method of assessment of the electricity charges payable in case of

theft of electricity pending adjudication by the appropriate Court. Pursuant

to such Order, 2005, the OERC has not yet prescribed any method of

calculation to be adopted in the assessment.
</p>
<p id="p_88">            Referring to paragraph-11(p) of the provisional order under

Annexure-6 to the writ petition, Mr. Pangari submitted that while

converting 69 KVA to units, the Assessing Officer had made calculation on

the basis that such power is used round the clock, i.e., 24 hours.

</p><p id="p_89">42.         Mr. Tripathy, learned counsel for the petitioner referring to the

Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission Regulations, 2004 submitted that

the said Regulations provide the load factor in terms of percentage for

calculation of energy consumption in respect of different categories of

consumers and as per the said load factor 30% of 24 hours has been taken

into account which comes to 7.20 hours per day for the purpose of

conversion and the same is quite reasonable. It is further submitted that as

per Regulation 2(aa) in order to convert KVA to units .9 multiplier factor has

to be applied.

</p><p id="p_91">43.          At this juncture, it is relevant to refer to Clause 11(p) of the

Provisional order under Annexure-6 which reads as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             "p. Quantum of Electricity being
             unauthorized used on best judgment
             basis            :69Kva*.9x24x30x.30 = 13414 Unit"</blockquote><p id="p_92">

</p><p id="p_93">             Perusal of Clause 11(p) of the provisional order reveals that the

contention taken by Mr. Tripathy merits consideration.

</p><p id="p_94">             Perusal of provisional assessment order further reveals that

while passing the same the billed amount against 69 KVA in ST category

amounting to Rs.64,304/- per month has already been taken into

consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_95">44.          It may be noted that the assessment under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_55">Section 126</a> in the

instant case has been made on the ground of unauthorized use of

electricity, i.e., (i) use of the electricity other than the purpose for which the

use of the electricity was authorized, and (ii) use of electricity in a premises

other than the premises for which the supply of electricity was authorized.

Therefore, there is no need to deal with the other contention taken by the

petitioner that after payment of electricity duty for consumption of excess

power and over drawal penalty, the assessment made under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_56">Section 126</a> is

not legal, as the same would be of mere academic in nature. Otherwise

also, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Seetaram Rice Mill (supra), the cases of excess load of consumption would

be squarely covered under explanation (b)(iv) of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_57">Section 126</a> of the Act,

2003. Once this factor is established then the Assessing Officer has to pass

the final order of assessment in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_58">Section 126(3)</a> to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_59">Section 126(6)</a> of

the Act, 2003. Moreover, provisional assessment order reveals that the

payments made by opp. party no.2-consumer for the period of assessment

in respect of extended load of 69 KVA has already been deducted from the

total amount assessed in the provisional assessment order.

</p><p id="p_96">45.         Even though, the appellate authority in his order has noted that

the provisional assessment order has been passed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_60">Section 126(1)</a> and

(2) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_61">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 on the basis of a verification report dated

10.05.2011 of the verification squad of NESCO alleging violation of

Regulations 34, 104, 105 and 106 of OERC (Distribution and Condition of

Supply) Code, 2004, it has not taken into consideration those statutory

provisions while adjudicating the issues involved in the appeal. This Court

further notices that despite observing that the consumer never sought for

prior approval of the Licensee for enhancement of the loads as per provision of

Regulations 53, 72, 73 and 74 of the OERC Code, 2004, the appellate

authority has set aside the final order of assessment made under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_62">Section 126</a>

of the Act on the ground of unauthorized use of electricity. I am shocked that

the appellate authority while exercising power under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_63">Section 127</a> of the Act

to examine the correctness of the order passed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_64">Section 126</a> of the Act

has closed its eyes to various statutory provisions and the judicial

pronouncements, which have strong bearing for deciding the issues involved

in the present case.
