<p id="p_1">                  The sole accused in S.C.No.110 of 2006 of the

court of the Third Additional Sessions Judge (ADHOC-I),

Thodupuzha is the appellant as he is aggrieved by the judgment dated

10.1.2008 in the above Sessions Case, by which he is convicted and

sentenced for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_1">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C.

</p><p id="p_2">        2.    The prosecution allegation is that the accused had

lawfully married one Reena, daughter of PW1 on 7.2.2000 according

to the religious custom prevailing in their community, receiving a

dowry of      `.75,000/- along with ornaments, but the accused

physically and mentally harassed her on 8.12.2000, during the month

of June 2004 and on 22.8.2005 and on other occasions, demanding

her to bring    more dowry and as a result of such cruelty and

harassment meted out by her husband in connection with demand for

dowry, she consumed carbofuran poison at the toilet attached to her

<p id="p_3">house bearing No.IV/374 and died at 7 p.m. on 23.8.2005 while

undergoing treatment at the Holy Family Hospital, Muthalakodam and

thus, the accused has committed the offence of dowry death

punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_2">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          3. In order to prove the above allegation, the prosecution has

produced Exts.P1 to P19 documents and examined PWs.1 to 18. A

plastic bottle labelled "Ethipone Tacpone" is marked as material

object MO1. No evidence either oral or documentary was adduced

from the side of the defence. Finally, the trial court has found that the

accused caused Reena to suffer the dowry death in her matrimonial

home and therefore, the accused is guilty of offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_3">Section

304B</a> of I.P.C. and accordingly, he is convicted thereunder. On such

conviction, the learned Judge of the trial court sentenced the appellant

to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_4">Section 304B</a>

of I.P.C. Set off under <a href="/doc/914361/" id="a_5">Section 428</a> of Cr.P.C. is allowed. It is the

above finding, order of conviction and sentence are challenged in this

appeal.

</p>
<p id="p_6">          4.    Challenging the judgment of the trial court and the

conviction and sentence, the accused has preferred the above appeal

by engaging an Advocate of his own choice and when the above

appeal came up for consideration, another learned Judge of this Court

by order dated 14.1.2008 in Crl.M.A.No.354 of 2008 suspended the

execution of the sentence incorporating certain conditions including a

condition to the effect that he shall deposit Rs.40,000/- as security,

though there was no sentence of fine. Though this Court passed such

an order, the same was not executed as the appellant is not financially

sound and subsequently, the counsel, through whom the appeal was

preferred, relinquished the vakalath.  As the counsel for the appellant

relinquished the vakalath and as there was no representation, a learned

Judge of this court on 24.3.2011 issued a bailable warrant against the

appellant, which was returned by a report filed by the Sub Inspector of

Police, Karimannoor stating that the appellant is admitted in the

hospital due to chest pain and therefore, the warrant could not be

executed. A medical certificate was also produced along with the said

<p id="p_7">report of the Police Officer. In the mean while, the Registry of this

Court received a letter No.OP2-59/2010 of the Office of the

Superintendent, Open Prison, Nettukaltheri forwarding a letter of the

appellant whereby it is requested by the appellant that the appeal

proceedings may be stopped in the circumstances mentioned therein.

On receiving the above letter from the appellant, this Court directed

the Registry to appoint an Advocate from the panel of State Brief to

prosecute the appeal on behalf of the appellant, especially when the

counsel, who filed the appeal, relinquished the vakalath. Accordingly,

Advocate Sri.B.H.Mansoor is appointed as State Brief. Thus, I have

heard Sri.B.H.Mansoor, the learned counsel for the appellant and

Smt.Laliza, the learned Public Prosecutor for the State.

</p><p id="p_8">          5. Now let us examine the evidence on record. PW1 is the

father of the deceased Reena.       When he was examined, he had

deposed in terms of the prosecution allegation. According to him, the

marriage was an arranged one and in accordance with the religious

custom and connected with the marriage, `.75,000/- was given and

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                :-5-:
</p>
<p id="p_9">ornaments valuing `.75,000/- was also given to the accused.

According to him, on the 8th day of marriage, a sum of `.25,000/- was

also given to the accused. According to him, after the marriage and

when his daughter started to reside with the accused, after four or five

months from the date of the marriage, the accused took up quarrel

with the deceased and after expending all the amounts given to him,

he had demanded to bring more dowry. The deceased Reena was

subjected to harassment and she was hospitalised and a case was also

registered against the accused. According to PW1, due to the quarrel,

the deceased stayed in her house and the house of the accused now

and then. EXt.P1 F.I.statement was launched by PW1 and when he

was examined, the same was marked through him. PW2 is a resident

adjacent to the house of the accused and he is an attestor to Ext.P2

inquest report on the body of Reena, who died on 23.8.2005.

</p><p id="p_10">          6. PW3 is the elder brother of the deceased Reena and when

he was examined, he had deposed in tune with the deposition of PW1,

especially regarding the marriage, dowry arrangement etc. According

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                :-6-:
</p>
<p id="p_11">to PW3, when the deceased and the accused visited his house after

four days of the marriage, the accused demanded some money and he

replied that money would be provided and advised the accused not to

sell the gold. PW3 claimed that she was told by Reena that the

accused used to harass her. It is also the version of PW3 that Reena

telephoned him saying that she wants money because the accused is

harassing her. According to PW3, he telephoned to the house of the

wife of the brother of the accused and then, he informed that the

aforesaid Reena consumed poison and was being taken to the hospital.

According to PW3, the accused has persistently demanded for money

to repay the loan, to purchase motor, to plant rubber etc. and thus,

money was paid to him by himself and his father.

</p><p id="p_12">          7. PWs.4 to 11 are the neighbors of the accused. According

to PW4, on the date of the incident, he came to the house of the

deceased and he heard child in the cradle crying incessantly and when

he enquired about the mother Reena, the accused went behind the

house to search her and the accused called PW4 to the place where he

</p>
<p id="p_13">found Reena lying with half portion of her body in bathroom and the

other portion on the veranda.   He had stated that the accused himself

took her to the hospital and PW4 stated that he had heard the accused

telling that '                                                      . '

PW5 is a neighbour of the accused. According to him, when he was

returning after selling milk and hearing about the incident, he rushed

to the house of the accused where he found Reena vomiting blood and

Reena was taken to the hospital in an autorickshaw by the accused and

at that time, the accused has no affection towards the deceased.

According to PW5, he heard once Reena asking the accused as '

                                      ' He had also deposed that

the deceased took shelter in the neighbouring house after physical

harassment of the accused and the accused is a drunkard.     However,

the witness has no good relationship with the accused. PW6, who is

the wife of PW5, has deposed that on the date of the occurrence, there

was quarrel in the house of Reena connected with a demand to bring a

Reena told her that the accused sold the entire gold ornaments and one

day when herself and her husband happened to be gone to the house

of Reena, they saw Reena sitting in the court yard, weeping and the

accused had drunken. According to PW6, Reena was not a moody

woman and only occasionally, she was found going to church and she

was worried for her being deprived of her gold ornaments. PW7

another neighbour also stated that in the house of the accused, there

used to be constant quarrels alleging that money brought by Reena is

not enough and the accused was always drinking and becoming

quarrelsome. PW8 is a Priest through whom the prosecution proved

Ext.P3 kychit for the return of marriage register recovered by the

investigating officer and the extract of which is marked as Ext.P4,

signed by PW8. PW9 another resident also deposed that the accused

was used to be drunken and was picking up quarrels in the name of

money as told by Reena. He had also stated that when Reena was

taken to the hospital, the accused was under the influence of drink.

</p>
<p id="p_15">PW9 had deposed that on a day when he came to the house of accused

hearing Reena crying, he was told by Reena that accused beat her with

a spade handle and Reena took her child and went into the teakwood

coup and that incident was in June, 2004. PW10 has also stated that

there was constant quarrel between the accused and Reena.

According to PW10, once Reena went into the teakwood coup with

child and was found sitting at a place damp with raining wearing a

torn nighty. According to PW10, Reena was shivering, telling that

'     .                         '. PW10 says that she took

the deceased to her house and offered her porridge and stayed there

over night and she was also given a nighty, and that was in June 2004.

PW11 similarly deposed that there were frequent quarrels in the name

of money in the house of the accused and women were heard weeping.

Ext.P19 is the copy of case sheet. According to PW18, the patient was

drowsy and gasping and was admitted due to consumption of poison of

ethephan as disclosed by the husband. According to him, at 7.10 p.m., the

patient clinically expired. These are the evidence and materials referred to

by the learned Judge in support of his finding and convicting the appellant.

</p><p id="p_21">      11. Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that the

prosecution has miserably failed to prove as to whether the death is suicide

or homicide. According to the learned counsel, the evidence available on

record contains the contradictions and infirmities and the same are not

sufficient to prove that the accused has committed the offence as alleged

against him. It is the specific submission of the learned counsel that except

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                   :-12-:
</p>
<p id="p_22">the fact that the accused is a drunkard, absolutely there is no evidence to

prove that the accused has demanded dowry or harassed the deceased

demanding dowry.      It is also pointed out by the learned counsel that none

of the witnesses have any direct knowledge with respect to any of the

incident and as such, their evidence is liable to be discarded as hearsay. It

is also the submission of the learned counsel that the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses itself shows that it was the accused who took the

wife to the hospital and the said fact itself would be sufficient to hold that

the accused is affectionate to his wife It is the submission of the learned

counsel that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the essential

ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_7">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C.           To substantiate the above

submission, the learned counsel invited my attention to the decision

reported in <a href="/doc/1802261/" id="a_8">Kaliyaperumal v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> [AIR 2003 SC 3828] ,

<a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_9">Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra</a> [2007(4) KLT 463 (SC)] and the

unreported judgment of the Apex Court in Crl.A.No.828 of 2009 dated 24th

April,2009.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      12. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

the evidence of PWs.1,3 and 4 to 11 and particularly, the depositions of

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                 :-13-:
</p>
<p id="p_24">PWs.1 and 3 positively prove the harassment meted out by the accused

against the deceased as a result of which the deceased committed suicide.

Thus, according to the learned Public Prosecutor, the finding of the court

below is fully supported by the evidence and materials on record. It is also

the submission of the learned Public Prosecutor that because of the ill-

treatment and harassment, the deceased herself was constrained to file a

case against the accused, as evidenced by the prosecution documents and

therefore, to prove the harassment and cruelty meted out against the

deceased, no other evidence is required. It is also the submission of the

learned Public Prosecutor that in the light of the decision of the Apex

Court reported in <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_10">Bachni Devi and another v. State of Haryana</a>

[(2011)(4) SCC 427], <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_11">Section 304B</a> is very much attracted in the

present case and though one of the incidents has taken place during

the month of June 2004, the said incident has proximity and link with

the occurrence, which persuaded the deceased to commit suicide.

Therefore, according to the learned Public Prosecutor, no interference

is warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_25">Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                 :-14-:
</p>
<p id="p_26">      13. I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the

learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Public Prosecutor. I

have perused the judgment of the trial court and scrutinised the

evidence and the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      14. In the light of the rival contentions advanced by the counsel

for the appellant and the learned Public prosecutor, the only point to

be considered is whether the trial court is justified in its finding under

point No.1 that the death of the deceased is a dowry death and the

accused is guilty of the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_12">Section 304B</a> of

I.P.C. Admittedly, the marriage between the accused and the deceased

has taken place on 7.2.2000 in accordance with the religious customs

and the wife of the accused Reena died on 23.8.2005 within seven

years from the date of the marriage and the death of Reena was

otherwise than under normal circumstances. Of course, the above

three essential ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_13">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C.- Dowry death are

established by the prosecution evidence. Still then, the question is

whether the prosecution has succeeded in showing that soon before

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                               :-15-:
</p>
<p id="p_28">the death of Reena, whether she was subjected to cruelty or

harassment by her husband, the accused herein in connection with any

demand for dowry. I have already referred to evidence particularly the

deposition of prosecution witnesses. It is true that all the prosecution

witnesses particularly Pws.1,3 and 4 to 11 have deposed before the

court below that there were frequent quarrels between the deceased

and the accused and the accused is a drunkard. But, except PWs.3,6

and 10, no other witnesses have stated any particular incident other

than the vague or general statement. Now let us examine the evidence

of PW3. It is relevant to note that PW1 is the father of the deceased

and PW3 is her brother. But, when those witnesses were examined,

they have no case that the accused demanded a particular amount or

thing towards the marriage or a particular dowry was fixed on the

basis of the demand made by the accused. It is true that when they

were examined, they have deposed that the payment of Rs.75,000/- in

cash and ornaments for the value of RS.75,000/-. But, they have no

definite case that the same were paid in pursuance of the demand of

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                 :-16-:
</p>
<p id="p_29">the accused and any balance amount was to be paid to the accused

towards the dowry. In the decision reported in <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_14">Appasaheb v. State of

Maharashtra</a> [2007(4) KLT 463 (SC)], the Apex Court has held that

the demand for money on account of financial stringency or for

meeting some urgent domestic expenses will not come under the

dowry defined in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_15">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.

According to the above decision, the giving or taking of property or

valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the

parties and the correlation between the giving or taking of property or

valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential. But, in

the present case, as I indicated earlier, the witnesses PWs.1 and 3, who

are competent to state about the dowry, has not deposed before the

court that any dowry was demanded by the accused connected with

the marriage and whatever given to the deceased, was as per the

settlement of dowry on demand of the accused. There is also no

evidence to the effect that any amount towards the balance of the

dowry is yet to be paid by them. Though PW3 has stated about the

                                   :-17-:

What PW3 has stated in the chief examination is that

    . The deposition of PW3 that the deceased was chased

by the accused for the purpose of killing her is not corroborated by

any evidence particularly the evidence of PW1, the father of the

incident. It is further clear that even though the prosecution witnesses

have stated about the harassment, before the death, the deceased gave

birth to three children which fact itself are sufficient to hold that the

deceased had condoned the so-called harassment mentioned by PW3

and other witnesses and the death was in pursuance of any such

harassment. It is true, PW3 has further deposed that '    

                                                                  phone

including the time at which PW3 was called by the deceased and what

was the nature of the harassment and the date of the harassment etc,

show that the said demand is not connected with dowry as held in the

<p id="p_36">decision reported in Appa Saheb's case [2007(4) KLT 463 SC]

wherein the Apex Court has held that demand for money on account

of financial stringency or for meeting urgent domestic expenses

cannot be termed as demand for dowry.                      The learned Public

Prosecutor submitted that in the light of the decision of the Supreme

Court reported in <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_16">Bachni Devi and another v. State of Haryana</a>

[(2011)(4) SCC 427], the demand for money even under the guise of

purchasing manure, motor pump etc. will come under the definition of

dowry. I am unable to sustain the above contention. In the above

decision in para 21, the Apex Court has held as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "21.  The High Court has also examined the
            matter thoroughly and reached the finding that A-1 and
            A-2 had raised a demand for purchase of motorcycle
            from PW8; this demand was made within two months
            of the marriage and was a demand towards "dowry"
            and when this demand was not met, Kanta was
            maltreated and harassed continuously which led her to
            take extreme step of finishing her life................."

The facts and circumstances involved in the present case are entirely

different from the facts involved in the above reported decision. As I

                                :-20-:

<p id="p_37">have already indicated earlier, there was no demand of dowry and the

prosecution witnesses have no case that any balance amount of dowry

is pending. So in the light of the admission of PW3 even if it is

considered that the accused has demanded money, it is only for the

agricultural purpose which demand will not come under the definition

of dowry as held by the Supreme Court in the decision reported in

Appa Saheb's case [2007(4) KLT 463(SC)]. So the evidence of PW3

is not helpful for the prosecution to prove that the accused demanded

any dowry and in pursuance of such demand, the accused has

subjected the deceased to cruelty or harassment.

</p><p id="p_38">      15. PW6 is another witness who was the neighbour of the

accused. According to her,  23-8-05-

<p id="p_40">hearsay. So, the evidence of PW6 as well is not helpful for the

prosecution to prove the incident.     The other evidence is that of

PW10. According to PW10, she knew the reason for the death and it

is her deposition that always there was quarrel between the accused

and the deceased Reena. She has further deposed                    coup-

</p><pre id="pre_3">               .        nighty-

                . According to PW10, Reena

</pre><p id="p_41">was taken to the house of PW10 and she informed PW1 and other

brothers of the deceased and they came and took Reena to their house.

It is true, PW10 has also stated that

<p id="p_42"> .                                       . But, it is

pertinent to note that during the cross-examination, it is clarified that

during the month of June, 2004, PW10 took Reena to her house. So,

whatever may be the reason for the quarrel, that was one year back to

                                 :-22-:
</p>
<p id="p_43">the date of the incident. PW10 has no case that she had witnessed any

incident immediately before the death of the deceased. It is also a fact

that after the alleged incident during the month of June, 2004, Reena,

the wife of the accused joined with him and resided along with him in

his house. Thus, the evidence of PW10, according to me, is also not

sufficient to prove that the accused has made any dowry demand and

connected with the same, she was subjected to cruelty which led to the

death of Reena.
</p>
<p id="p_44">      16.      Thus, on a scanning of the entire evidence of the

prosecution, I am of the definite view that the prosecution has

miserably failed to prove and establish that the accused had demanded

dowry connected with the marriage between himself and the deceased

Reena or a particular amount was fixed as dowry upon the demand of

the accused or any amount was outstanding to be paid to the accused.

It is also clear that there was no sufficient and convincing evidence to

hold that the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment on

demand of dowry so as to attract <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_17">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C.

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                                  :-23-:
</p>
<p id="p_45">      17. It is true that the witnesses have stated that there was quarrel

between the accused and the deceased and the accused is a drunkard

etc. But, none of the witnesses miserably failed to point out any

particular incident under which the accused had demanded dowry and

the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment connected with

such demand of dowry prior to the occurrence in the present case. It is

also clear from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses especially,

in the light of the evidence of Pws.1 and 3 that the deceased has

though made allegation or complaint against the accused, she had

condoned the same on several occasions and though came to the

parental house, she had gone back to the matrimonial home and

resided there along with the accused. Exts.P11 and P12 show that

though a complaint was launched before the Police, subsequently, the

same was settled and accordingly, the accused was acquitted in that

case. The said fact itself would be sufficient to hold that the deceased

had condoned the cruelty if any meted out by the accused against her.

Therefore, the stray incident taken place in the family of the accused

subjected to cruelty by the accused demanding dowry. Thus, the

prosecution has miserably failed to prove convincingly supported by

sufficient evidence that the accused was subjected to cruelty or

harassment connected with the demand for dowry.

</p><p id="p_47">      18.    Even if it is admitted for the argument's sake that the

The incident described in Ext.P12 F.I.statement of Reena in Crime

No.230 of 2000 does not dispel any demand from the part of the

accused towards the dowry. In that statement, the deceased has no

case that the accused demanded money towards dowry or the amount

being the balance towards the dowry fixed. It is also discernible from

Ext.P12 that even though she had made some allegation and complaint

against the accused, with respect to certain incidents, she had

condoned all the incidents and she had been residing along with the

accused and while she was giving Ext.P12, she was pregnant. It is

pertinent to note that Ext.P12 F.I.statement is dated 9.1.2000 and

thereafter, from the evidence of PW7 in the present case, it appears

that case, the accused was acquitted as found by the leaned Judge of

the trial court in paragraph 22 of its judgment.       Going by the

documents like ExtsP11,P12 and P13, it can be seen that whatever

incidents covered by those documents had taken place much earlier to

Crl.A.No.87 of 2008
                               :-30-:
</p>
<p id="p_59">the date of Ext.P12 F.I.statement and the incident, which is the subject

matter of Ext.P12 statement and Ext.P13 F.I.R., there was no demand

for dowry. Even if the same is taken as a case connected with the

dowry remand, thereafter the said Reena resided along with the

accused till her death on 23.8.2005 and there is a long gap between

the date of the incident covered by Exts.P11 and P12 documents and

the date of the death of the deceased in this case. Thus, on a close

scrutiny of the evidence and materials on record and the incident

under which Exts.P11 and P12 launched and the long gap between the

date of death of the deceased in the present case, from the date of

Exts.P11 and P12, it cannot be said that there was any proximity

between the incident covered by Exts.P11 and P12 and the death of

the deceased. Thus, there is no evidence to show that the deceased

was subjected to cruelty or harassment connected with the demand for

dowry, soon before her death. Thus, the only inevitable conclusion

that can be arrived is that the prosecution has miserably failed to

prove and establish the most essential ingredients of Section 304 B

guilty of the offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_33">Section 304B</a> of I.P.C. and according to
