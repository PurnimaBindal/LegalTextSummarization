thereafter the matter was adjourned twice at the

counsel for the Applicant, Shri Saurav Kumar.

Court No.6 (item No.32)



</p><p id="p_13">        i) That the transfer order dated 16.9.2022 and the

        relieving order dt 19.09.2022 are against the

        Transfer Guidelines, 2021. These guidelines were

        formulated to maintain transparency and to avoid

        arbitrariness and discrimination. The Order date

        12.9.2021         suspending   Clause-6    of   the    said

        guidelines defeats the very objective of ensuring

        transparency and fair play. There is no cogent

        reason given as to why this clause has been

        suspended.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">        (ii) The transfer Order dt 12.9.2022 violates the

        Clauses 6,7,9 and 16 of the Transfer Guidelines.

        Clause-5          talks   about   the     Administrative

        Transfers, Clause -6 assigns Displacement Count

        and the higher the displacement count, the more

        likely the employee will get transferred. Clause -7

        stipulates the modes of Administrative Transfers

        and Clause -16 deals with request Transfers.

        None of these processes are followed while

        effecting the transfers on 12.9.2022.           In view of

        this the transfers are arbitrary and smacks non-

        application of mind.

</p><p id="p_18">        (iii) The impugned suspension of Clause -6 of the

        Transfer Guidelines was issued in violation by the

        Education Code issued the BOG of Kendriya

        Vidyalay Sangathan on 28.12.2012. The BOG is

        competent to modify the Transfer Guidelines,

        where as the suspension of Clause -6 and Annual

        Transfers was issued by an executive order

        without taking approval of the BOG. Hence the

        impugned orders are issued without competency.

        N.K. Bajpai, is a chronic patient of Sugar and is

        on insulin for the last 6 years. The applicant

        herself is suffering with arthritis and        both her

        knees are damaged, and doctors have advised her

        knee replacement as soon as possible. The

        applicant herself is under LTR and less than 3

        years are left for her retirement. The son of the

        applicant also preparing for exams and her

        preparations are adversely          affected by this

        transfer order from K.V. No.1, Armapur, Kanpur,

        which is more than 2000 kms from her present

        place of posting as well as from her hometown

        and the same is going to create great difficulties to

        her family life. She(the applicant) further stated

        that the said transfer order is passed without

        considering          the   abovementioned               facts      and

        medical condition at the verge of retirement age.


</p><p id="p_20">         (v) The present applicant has been transferred to

        another state where she has to teach in their

        mother tongue. The applicant is not conversant

        with the local language of Araia, Bihar.


</p><p id="p_21">        (vi) Moreover, the transfer order is violative of the

        National          Education         Policy   2020,     framed        by

        Government of India. Para 5.3 of this policy (NEP

        2020) says that, &quot;the harmful practice of excessive

        teacher transfers will be halted, so that students

        have       continuity      in       their    role    models        and

        educational environments.&quot;

        arbitrariness        and      discrimination          as    seniority

        principal has not been observed while transferring

        KVS Teachers. The Counsel for the applicant has

        cited the case of Mrs. Been Prajapati (Para 4.18
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8</span>

        of OA). Further he cited that the ratio of 50 % has

        not been maintained in many schools and in

        respect of subjects and disciplines (Para 4.19 &amp;

        4.31 of the OA)


</p><p id="p_24">7. The counsel for the applicant has further averred

that the          coordinated   bench of this Tribunal at

Ahmedabad has adjudicated the matter in OA No. 347

of 2022 and other 13 tagged OAs passing the following

orders on 16.1.2023:
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        &quot;13. In view of the above circumstances, we are of
        the view that if the impugned transfer order qua
        the applicants are not quashed, it will create more
        inconvenience to all the concerned than to serve
        the purpose behind effecting the impugned
        transfer. It will not be in the interest of the
        students for which the teachers are meant. As
        stated earlier the academic session is going to
        complete soon and status quo is already in
        existence regarding posting place of the present
        applicants. In the facts and circumstances of the
        case discussed above, we set aside the transfer
        order dated 16.09.2022 qua the applicants.
        However, it is made clear that after completion of
        the current academic session, the respondents
        are at liberty to pass fresh transfer order in
        accordance with the latest transfer guidelines and
        Government Order as also principles of natural
        justice.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_26">The counsel for the applicant argued that the Transfer

order qua the applicants in said OAs was quashed

because it would create more            inconvenient to the

applicants and an the said transfer orders are not in

the interest of students as these orders were issued in

the middle of the academic session. Drawing parallel

with these OAs, the counsel for the applicant argued

that the transfers in the instant case have been

effected in the middle of the academic session and the

applicant has all the personal and family issues to

attend. Being transferred to a far off place, she would

face grave personal difficulty. The Transfer Guidelines

of 2021 have provision to look into such eventualities

to consider the personal and family of employees of

KVS.

</p><p id="p_29">9.    The counsel for the respondents argued that the

Transfer orders are not merely transfers.            He argued

that the suspension of Clause-6 and the Annual

Transfers has effectively taken away the provisions

under Clauses 5, 7 and 9. Moreover, the order dated

12.9.2022 has also mentioned that the said orders are

not only transfer orders; these are also redistribution of

the teaching staff for effecting rationalization of the

deployment of teaching staff in various Kendriya

Vidyalays in the country.                The rationale for the

rationalization           and   redistribution   comes   from       a

detailed exercise undertaken by the KVS authorities to

access the staff strength, existing deployment and

vacancies in various KVS. It was a massive exercise to

find out the KVS having less than 50% of sanctioned

strength and KVs having 80% or more regular teaching

staff. As per station seniority, the staff having longest

stay at a particular station having existing staff to the

tune of 80% or more of regular vacancies                       were

transferred out to locations having 50% or less regular

staff.     He further stated that the Transfer guidelines

allow the KVS Authorities to transfer any employee on

administrative Exigencies. These transfers are called

Administrative Transfers which are defined as &quot;those

transfers which KVS orders suomotu in the exigencies

of service and administration and public interest.&quot;


</p><p id="p_30">10.       The counsel for the Respondent quoted the

following Order Dated 20.12.2022 (Annexure A-1) [in

respect of the representation of the present applicant,

in support of the massive exercise undertaken for

rationalization of deployment of teaching staff in KVs;

which reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        Whereas the above transfers have been effected
        recently in KVS for reasons that due to disruption
        in normal schooling for past two years owing to
        the pandemic situation, there has been significant
        learning loss amongst students due to online
        blended mode of teaching. According to the
        mental health and well being of school students
        2022 report published by NCERT in the chapter
        relating to KVS, it has been stated that during
        COVID-19, as classes were taking place in online
        mode, 54% of the students who participated in
        the survey reported facing difficulties in
        understanding and learning of content through
        online mode. Hence the need was felt to address
        on priority, the learning challenges being faced by
        the students for the past two years due to
        pandemic through administrative means. The
        rationalization of teachers &amp; redistribution of the
        existing teaching staff have been effected to
        address the above core challenges after the
        pandemic so that at least 50% of regular teaching
        staff (inclusive of all cadres) are available in all
        KVs.</blockquote><p id="p_32">

        Whereas, KVS has identified around 237 KVs
        having less than 50% of regular teaching staff on
        its rolls and about 481 KVs having 80% or more
        regular teaching staff on its rolls in all over India
        on the basis of available vacancy. As per Station
        Seniority (All India /cadre/subject wise), who has
        the longest stay in a station, as per date of joining
        at the station was taken as the criteria for
        transfer. Most of the teachers who have been
        transferred have had a stay in a particular station
        for more than 10 years. Out of the total teaching
        staffs in position, only 1455 transfers have been
        effected which is less than 4 % of the total
        teaching strength in position.

        a particular cadre of transferable posts from one
        place to the other is an incident of service. No
        Government servant or employee of Public
        Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at
        any particular place. Transfer from one place to
        other is generally a condition of service and the
        employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer
        from one place to other is necessary in public
        interest     and    efficiency   in     the    Public
        administration. Whenever, a public servant is
        transferred he must comply with the order but if
        there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on
        transfer it is open to him to make representation
        to the competent authority for stay, modification
        or cancellation of the transfer order. If the order of
        transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
        concerned public servant must carry out the
        order of transfer. In the absence of any stay of the
        transfer order a public servant has no
        justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
        merely on the ground of having made a
        representation, or on the ground of his difficulty
        in moving from one place to the other. If he fails
        to proceed on transfer in compliance to the
        transfer order, he would expose himself to
        disciplinary action under the relevant Rules, as
        has happened in the instant case. The respondent

</blockquote><p id="p_44">15.      The counsel for the respondents countered the

argument that the Order dated 12.9.2022 suspending

Clause 6 was ultra vires because of lack of competency.

The decision to suspend clause 6 of the Transfer

Guidelines, 2021 was taken in a meeting chaired                        by

the Union Education Minister                   (who is Chairman of

BOG)          wherein senior Officers of the Education

department           and KVS      (who are ex-officio member of

BOG) were present . Hence, the assertion that the

order is ultra vires of the Education Code 2012 falls

flat.     As the annual transfers were suspended and the

transfers         vide    order   dt.    12.9.2022       effected     for

administrative exigencies, other clauses of the Transfer

guidelines are not attracted in such exigencies.


</p><p id="p_45">16. The counsel for the respondent further averred

that in pursuance of the order dated 23.9.2022, of this

Tribunal, the representation of the applicant was duly

considered. Her personal and family problems were

also considered. Because of administrative exigencies,

the personal discomfort of the present applicant was

considered          subservient    to    the    public    interest      of

providing adequate teaching staff at KVS having 50%

or less of the sanctioned strength of teaching staff .In

view of this, the applicant has no valid cause of action

pleaded that it should be dismissed.


</p><p id="p_46">17. I have gone through the records of the case

thoroughly and heard the arguments carefully. It has

been held in several judgments by the Apex court that

transferring an employee and reassigning duties and

responsibilities at the same place of posting or at a new

location is the prerogative of the competent authorities.


</p><p id="p_47">18.          Transfers,       deployments,            redeployment          or

Management Strategies of any organization, be it in

private sector or in the Government or Public sector.

These        strategies      are    s         aimed   at    realizing      the

organizational            goals    for        furtherance     of     mission

</p><p id="p_49">19.      Deployment or transfer is also the process of

providing sub-entities and subordinate offices                          with

the required human resources and support they need

to be successful in their roles. This is akin to allocation

of organizational resources to achieve organizational

goals. Modern governments and organizations begin

the      process          prior   to    adopting        transfers     as     a

redeployment tool by assessing the organization&#x27;s

current and future human resources needs. Following

these assessments, the competent authority makes

decisions how best to deploy the human resources to

meet the identified needs. These include the type of

human resources required, the number of human

resources          required,      the        location   of   the    human

resources, and the timing of the deployment. In

Government, generally this task is assigned to an

        transfers or containing transfer policies at best
        may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
        concerned to approach their higher authorities for
        redress but cannot have the consequence of
        depriving or denying the competent authority to
        transfer a particular officer/servant to any place
        in public interest and as is found necessitated by
        exigencies of service as long as the official status
        is not affected adversely and there is no infraction
        of any career prospects such as seniority, scale of
        pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
        often reiterated that the order of transfer made
        even in transgression of administrative guidelines
        cannot also be interfered with, as they do not
        confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as
        noticed supra, shown to be vitiated by mala fides

        normally be eschewed and should not be

        though they are Appellate Authorities over such
        orders, which could assess the niceties of the
        administrative needs and requirements of the
        situation concerned. This is for the reason that
        Courts or Tribunals cannot substitute their own
        decisions in the matter of transfer for that of
        competent authorities of the State and even
        allegations of mala fides when made must be such
        as to inspire confidence in the Court or are based
        on concrete materials and ought not to be
        entertained on the mere making of it or on

of 1994,              Decided on 25 February 1994 held that

there is hardly any scope of judicial review of

administrative action in the form of transfer orders. It

has been held as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        &quot;4. In our opinion, in the present case there is no
        material to justify interference with the mere
        order of transfer made by the competent authority
        for administrative reasons particularly when the
        Tribunal had rejected the respondent&#x27;s assertion
        that the transfer had been made on account of
        certain complaints he had made regarding the
        functioning of the Dept. We have no doubt that
        the view taken by the Tribunal is not justified on
        the facts found by it. It is also not within the
        scope of permissible judicial review in such
        matters relating to mere transfer made by the
        competent authority for administrative reasons.&quot;

education of children, health issues of self and

dependant             family   members     are    matters       for

consideration for the competent authority but not for

the courts/ tribunals to decide the matter as an

Appellate Authority. The decision of the Administrative

Authorities after considering these personal difficulties

is considered final. The Apex court in State of MP and

Ors Vs S.S. Kourav &amp; Ors [CA No. 1285 of 1995

        area. This court cannot go into that question of
        relative hardship. It would be for the
        administration to consider the facts of the given
        case and mitigate the real hardship in the interest
        of good and efficient administration. If there is
        any such hardship, it would be open to make a
        representation to the government and it is for the
        government to consider and take appropriate
        decision in that behalf.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_74">31. Sometimes, employees or employee groups assail

the transfer policy or suspension of any particular

clause or clauses of the transfer policy as it may create

difficulties for individual or group of employees. As the

transfer policies/circulars are only guidelines for the

administrative Authorities, these cannot be enforceable

by the courts [Punjab and Sind Bank &amp;Ors. Vs.

Durgesh Kuwar, 2020 (supra)]. Whether, the transfer

policy or suspension of particular clause of transfer

policy is good or bad, it is           for the administrative

authorities to consider the grievances of the employees

in respect of a particular issue regarding transfer

policy. In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and others Vs

Sate of UP and Others [1991 AIR 537, 1990 SCR

Supl. (1) 625], the Apex Court held that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                &quot;The wisdom of the policy or the lack of it or
                the desirability of a better alternative is not
                within the permissible scope of judicial
                review in such cases. It is not for the courts
                to recast the policy or to substitute it with
                another which is considered to be more
                appropriate, once the attack on the ground

                showing that the act which was done, was
                fair and reasonable in the facts and
                circumstances of the case.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                      As indicated by Diplock, L.J., in

                for the Civil Service [(1984) 3 All ER 935] the
                power of judicial review is limited to the
                grounds of illegality, irrationality and
                procedural impropriety.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_75">32. The aforementioned judgments of the Apex Court

have       given          upper   hand    to    the     administrative

authorities or the Government in matters of Transfers.

However, transfers may affect negatively the level of

productivity, motivation, innovation quality, relations,

and participation and communication patterns among

other core human resources activities. When handled

well      and        in     accordance    with        the    employees&#x27;

circumstances,               deployment        increase         employee

performance through increased innovation, creativity,

quality, productivity, profitability, loyalty flexibility,

efficiency, effectiveness, and low levels of discontents,

dysfunctional conflicts. In other words, employee

welfare is also in the interest of the organizations. The

principles of effectiveness, efficiency and economy in

matters of deployment of human resources are sought

to be aligned with organizational mission goals.

Court No.6 (item No.32)



</p><p id="p_77">33.      While effecting redeployment through transfers,

the organizations should also treat all such employees

fairly      and       without        any         bias    or     malafide       or

discrimination. Moreover, a model employer like the

government            also      treats     its     employees          far   more

transparently and it is expected that the government

ensures that there is no violation of Articles 14 and 16

Indian Constitution.                Based on the twin objectives of

satisfying organizational goals (public interest and

better governance for delivery of public services ) and

employee            welfare,         growth          and        development,

organizations              including       government            departments

formulate transfer /placement policies. These policies

ensure         transparency            and        also     provide          better

opportunities to officers for excellence and more

planned approach to cadre planning.                            Such transfer

policies develop some sort of reasonable employee

expectations              to   be   treated       fairly      while     effective

redeployment               through       transfers.           Similarly,      the

government                departments         also       have      reasonable

expectations from its employees to cooperate in such

deployment to achieve mission goals of departments

and other entities.

Court No.6 (item No.32)



</p><p id="p_80">34. Redeployment in the form of transfers inter alia

should also satisfy the test of reasonable expectations

of the employees to be treated fairly and such

administrative action should not be based on malafide,

bias and unreasonable factors.              There are several

judgments of the Apex court which have moderated the

absolute power of the government/ administrative

authorities in the matters of transfer. The earliest of

this genre is the judgment of the Apex court in E.P.

Royappa Vs State Of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr [ 1974 AIR

555, 1974 SCR (2) 348; Dated 23/11/1973]. The

Apex court has held that:
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                &quot;It is an accepted principle that in public
                service transfer is an incident of service. It is
                also an implied condition of service and
                appointing authority has a wide discretion in
                the matter. The Government is the best
                judge to decide how to distribute and utilize
                the services of its employees. However, this
                power must be exercised honestly, bona fide
                and reasonably. It should be exercised in
                public interest. If the exercise of power is
                based on extraneous considerations or for
                achieving an alien purpose or an oblique
                motive it would amount to mala fide and
                colorable exercise of power. Frequent
                transfers, without sufficient reasons to
                justify such; transfers, cannot, but be held
                as mala fide. A transfer is mala fide when it
                is made not for professed purpose, such as
                in normal course or in public or
                administrative interest or in the exigencies of
                service but for other purpose, than is to
                accommodate         another     person        for
                undisclosed reasons. It is the basic principle

                of rule of law and good administration that

in Shilpi Bose case (supra) and Gujarat Electricity

review          in        transfer   matters   under      certain

circumstances: It was held that a judicial review of an

administrative action is of course permissible, but

orders of transfer are interfered when:-

competency has been squarely rebutted by the counsel

for the respondent. The BOG Chairman, i.e. the Union

Education Minister held meeting of senior officers of

the education department and the KVS , who are ex-

officio Members of the BOG. Hence, it has the

equivalent competency of the BOG. A formal meeting of

BOG would not have taken any different decision as

most of the members of BOG were present in the

meeting         chaired    by   the        Education   minister,      the

chairperson of BOG.

assert any arbitrariness, malafide or bias in the

suspension of the Clause-6 of the Transfer Guidelines

transfers are part of rationalization and redistribution

of the human resources following a well-thought-out

exercise to find out KVs having 50% or less staff

compared to their sanctioned strength and also KVs

having 80% or more staff. As it has been stated in the

impugned           order   dated      13.01.2023,      most     of    the

teachers, who were transferred out, were based on the

seniority roster maintained at each station and most of

the transferred teachers had a stay of more than 10

years at their respective previous KVs. In view of this

the Transfer guidelines and non-operationaliation of

infringement              of   statutory   provisions,       lack       of

competency, non-application of mind, etc, the courts
