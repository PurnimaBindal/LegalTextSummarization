<p id="p_1">:      D. N. PATEL, Chief Justice (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.     This appeal has been preferred by the original defendants No.1 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">2 in CS (Comm.) No.330/2019.</span>
</p><p id="p_3">2.     The learned Single Judge had initially granted ex parte ad interim
relief to the plaintiffs in their application being IA No.8584/2019 in Civil
Suit (Comm.) No.330/2019, preferred under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2
of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). This ex parte ad interim relief was
granted by the learned Single Judge on 21.06.2019 (Annexure A-2 to the
memo of this appeal).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                         Page 1 of 17</span>
<p id="p_4"> 3.      These appellants (Original defendant nos.1 and 2 in the suit) preferred
interim application being IA No.8856/2019 under Order XXXIX, Rule 4
CPC for vacating ex parte ad interim relief granted by the learned Single
Judge which was dated 21.06.2019.
</p><p id="p_5">4.      After hearing the original plaintiffs and the defendants in the suit, ex
parte ad interim stay granted by the learned Single Judge vide order dated
21.06.2019, was confirmed vide order dated 26.08.2019 (Annexure A-1 to
the memo of this appeal) and thereby application preferred by the original
defendants bearing IA No.8856/2019 for vacating the ex parte ad interim
relief was dismissed by the learned Single Judge. Thus, IA No.8854/2019
preferred by the original plaintiffs under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC,
was allowed and IA preferred by the original defendants - qua appellants of
this appeal being IA No.8856/2019 for vacating the ex parte stay was
dismissed by the learned Single Judge. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied by
the order passed by the learned Single Judge dated 26.08.2019 (Annexure
A-1 to the memo of this appeal), the present First Appeal from Order (FAO)
is preferred by the original defendant nos.1 and 2.
</p><p id="p_6">5.      As the Civil Suit (Comm.) No.330/2019 is pending before the
learned Single Judge, we refrain from analysing the facts as well as the
documents upon which these appellants (original defendants) have placed
reliance but suffice it to say that-
</p><p id="p_7">(i)     Original plaintiffs are the owner of the trademark „PARKO‟;
</p><p id="p_8">(ii)    Original plaintiffs are the owner of the copyright of the original
        artistic work of its logo;
</p><p id="p_9">(iii)   Original Plaintiffs claim to be using the trademark &quot;PARKO&quot; for
        labelling/ packaging of goods since 1963;

<p id="p_10"> (iv)        Through an agreement between original defendant No.1 and original
            plaintiff No.1, dated 03.07.2010, the original defendant No.1
            (appellant herein) had agreed to not use the trademark, but use the
            word PARKOVIC or any other such word.
</p><p id="p_11">6.          The plaintiffs are using copyright &quot;PARKO&quot; from the year 1964.
Looking to the agreement dated 03.07.2010, it is explicitly clear that the
original plaintiffs are having exclusive right to use the copyright &quot;PARKO&quot;
and these appellants (original defendant nos.1 and 2) were given permission
to use the trademark &quot;PARKOVIC&quot;.
</p><p id="p_12">7.          It also appears from the facts of the case that the following trademarks
have already been registered in favour of the plaintiffs:-

</pre><p id="p_13">8.      Thus, in view of the aforesaid marks, fifteen trademarks have been
registered in favour of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.      It is also a prima facie fact in favour of the plaintiffs that there are
three registered copyrights in favour of the plaintiffs for the original artistic
work within the meaning of <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_1">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 and
they are as under:-

</pre><p id="p_15">10.     The aforesaid registration, as per the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">Copyright Act</a>, was in favour of
the plaintiffs earlier in the year 1982 and as stated hereinabove in the
aforesaid table that the second and third art work was registered in the year
2001.

<p id="p_16">11.     Looking to the family settlement dated 03.07.2010, much has been
argued about by the counsel appearing for the appellants (Original defendant

 nos.1 and 2) that they were also permitted to use &quot;PARKOVIC&quot; as their
trademark. For ready reference, the trademark and art work of the original
plaintiffs and original defendants - who are appellants before this Court are

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">12.    Now, applying a test of man of average intelligence and of
imperfect recollection, to the aforesaid usages of the trademark/art work,
by the original plaintiffs and original defendants, they are prima facie
visually similar, prima facie deceptively similar and prima facie both these
trademarks and art works create confusion in the mind of a person of
average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. These aspects of the

 matter have been properly appreciated by the learned Single Judge while
confirming the ex parte ad interim relief vide order dated 26.08.2019
(Annexure A-1 to the memo of this appeal).       We are in full agreement with
the reasons given by the learned Single Judge in the order dated 26.08.2019
(Annexure A-1) to be read with order dated 21.06.2019 (Annexure A-2).
</blockquote><p id="p_17">13.      The use of trademark and art work by the defendant is at a subsequent
point in time, than that of plaintiffs. Moreover, prima facie by virtue of the
agreement dated 03.07.2010 which is referred to hereinabove, the same
prima facie suggests a permissive use to the original defendants by the
original plaintiffs, with certain restrictions. Moreover, the defendants have
applied for trademark much later in point of time i.e. in the year 2011 and
the objections have also been raised by the original plaintiffs in the year
2017.
</p><p id="p_18">14.      The learned counsel for the appellants (original defendant nos.1
and 2) has argued at length that the defendants are using the trademark and
their art work from the year 2011 onwards and the objections have been
raised for the first time in the year 2017 i.e. after approximately six years
and the suit has been filed only in 2019, i.e. after approximately eight
years.
</p><p id="p_19">15.      As the suit is pending, we are finally disposing of this appeal but
suffice it to say, at this stage, that as per the plaintiffs, the cause of action
has arisen from the date of their knowledge i.e. from the year 2010 and in a
replication, it has been mentioned by the original plaintiffs that numerous
family meetings took place from the year 2010 to 2018 in which it is alleged
by the original plaintiffs that during these talks, it has been agreed by the
appellants (original defendants) that original defendants will not use the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                             Page 6 of 17</span>
 impugned trademark and will use some other marks.              There is also a
reference in the suit about the fact that the plaintiffs are also contacting with
Railway authorities and the said Railway authorities have also informed the
original plaintiffs about the use of deceptively similar mark by these
appellants (original defendants).
</p><p id="p_20">16.    Reference in this regard may be made to the decision in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_3">Corn
Products Refining Co. vs. Shangrila Products Ltd</a>., AIR 1960 SC 142
where the dispute was regarding two rival marks „Gluvita‟ and „Glucovita‟,
in paragraphs 17, 18 and 19, it was held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       &quot;17. We have already said that in our view the mark
       „Glucovita‟ has acquired a reputation among the general buying
       public. The first question that then arises is whether the marks
       „Glucovita‟ and „Gluvita‟ are so similar as to be likely to cause
       confusion to the buying public or deceive them. On this matter,
       we have not the advantage of the view of the learned appellate
       Judges of the High Court. They did not express any view on
       this aspect of the question at all. We are however inclined to
       think that their answer to the question would have been in the
       affirmative. However that may be, the Deputy Registrar felt that
       the words were not so similar as to be likely to give rise to
       confusion or to cause deception. He felt that the syllable „co‟ in
       the appellant&#x27;s mark was an emphatic characteristic and was not
       likely to be slurred over. He apparently felt that this syllable
       would prevent any confusion arising between the two marks or
       any person being deceived by the use of them both. He thought
       that the test laid down in what is called the &quot;Ovax&quot; case (In re:
       an application by Smith Hayden and Co. Ltd.) [63 RPC 97]
       should be applied and that the emphatic characteristic of the
       second syllable in the mark &quot;Glucovita&quot; should decide that
       there was no likelihood of confusion arising. Desai, J., thought
       that the Deputy Registrar was wrong.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is
       well known that the question whether the two marks are likely

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                             Page 7 of 17</span>
        to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression.
       It is for the court to decide that question. English cases
       proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word
       by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the same,
       may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding
       questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that
       the word is an English word which to the mass of the Indian
       people is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in deciding a
       question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be
       considered as a whole. So considered, we are inclined to agree
       with Desai, J., that the marks with which this case is concerned
       are similar. Apart from the syllable &quot;co&quot; in the appellant&#x27;s mark,
       the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion
       such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish
       the one mark from the other.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       19. We also agree with Desai, J., that the idea of the two marks
       is the same. The marks convey the ideas of glucose and life
       giving properties of vitamins. The Aquamatic case (Harry
       Reynolds v. Laffeaty&#x27;s Ld.) [1958 RPC 387] is a recent case
       where the test of the commonness of the idea between two
       marks was applied in deciding the question of similarity
       between them. Again, in deciding the question of similarity
       between the two marks we have to approach it from the point of
       view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect
       recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic
       similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is
       reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them.&quot;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                             Page 8 of 17</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        &quot;6. It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and
       relevant for our purpose are &quot;likely to deceive or cause
       confusion&quot;. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">The Act</a> does not lay down any criteria for
       determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
       Therefore, every case must depend on its own particular facts,
       and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual
       decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to
       deceive or cause confusion. On an application to register, the
       Registrar or an opponent may object that the trade mark is not
       registrable by reason of clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1661909/" id="a_5">Section 8</a>, or sub-section
       (I) of <a href="/doc/938587/" id="a_6">Section 10</a>, as in this case. In such a case the onus is on
       the applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade mark applied
       for is not likely to deceive or cause confusion. In cases in which
       the tribunal considers that there is doubt as to whether
       deception is likely, the application should be refused. A trade
       mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion by its resemblance
       to another already on the Register if it is likely to do so in the
       course of its legitimate use in a market where the two marks are
       assumed to be in use by traders in that market. In considering
       the matter, all the circumstances of the case must be considered.
       As was observed by Parker, J., in Pianotist Co
       Application [(1906) 23 RPC 774] which was also a case of the
       comparison of two words.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">              &quot;You must take the two words. You must judge
              them, both by their look and by their sound. You
              consider the goods to which they are to be applied.
              You must consider the nature and kind of customer
              who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact
              you must consider all the surrounding
              circumstances; and you must further consider what
              is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is
              used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods
              of the respective owners of the marks.&quot; (p. 777)
       For deceptive resemblance two important questions are: (1)
       who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to
       deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to be
       adopted in judging whether such resemblance exists. As to
       confusion, it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                             Page 9 of 17</span>
        mind of a customer who, on seeing a mark thinks that it differs
       from the mark on goods which he has previously bought, but is
       doubtful whether that impression is not due to imperfect
       recollection. (See Kerly on Trade Marks, 8th Edition, p. 400.)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our
       consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names
       &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshman-dhara&quot; are in use in respect of
       the same description of goods, namely a medicinal preparation
       for the alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal
       preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of
       going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick
       alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and townsfolk,
       literate as well as illiterate. As we said in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_7">Corn Products
       Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd</a>. [(1960) (1) SCR
       968] the question has to be approached from the point of view
       of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To
       such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of the
       two names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; is, in our
       opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider
       the overall similarity of the two composite words &quot;Amritdhara&quot;
       and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. We do not think that the learned Judges
       of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would
       mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average
       intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High
       Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and
       consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the
       meaning of the composite words as &quot;current of nectar&quot; or
       &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. He would go more by the overall
       structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine
       he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about
       which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase.
       Where the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or
       badly educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person
       educated in the Hindi language would go by the etymological
       or ideological meaning and see the difference between &quot;current
       of nectar&quot; and &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of Lakshman&quot;
       in a literal sense has no meaning; to give it meaning one must

        further make the inference that the &quot;current or stream&quot; is as
       pure and strong as Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary
       Indian villager or townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the
       story of the Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he
       would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called
       ideological     difference   between      &quot;Amritdhara&quot;     and
       &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He would go more by the similarity of the
       two names in the context of the widely known medicinal
       preparation which he wants for his ailments.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       8. We agree that the use of the word &quot;dhara&quot; which literally
       means &quot;current or stream&quot; is not by itself decisive of the matter.
       What we have to consider here is the overall similarity of the
       composite words, having regard to the circumstance that the
       goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations of the
       same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is
       not to be refused, because unusually stupid people, &quot;fools or
       idiots&quot;, may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two
       names may disclose some points of difference, but an unwary
       purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection
       would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names
       having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for
       with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a
       similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name.
       The trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be
       considered. In the case of the application to register &quot;Erectiks&quot;

              so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise
              and the court reaches the conclusion that there is

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       31. Trade mark is essentially adopted to advertise one&#x27;s product
       and to make it known to the purchaser. It attempts to portray the
       nature and, if possible, the quality of the product and over a
       period of time the mark may become popular. It is usually at
       that stage that other people are tempted to pass off their
       products as that of the original owner of the mark. That is why
       it is said that in a passing-off action, the plaintiff&#x27;s right is

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       33. The decisions of English courts would be relevant in a
       country where literacy is high and the marks used are in the
       language which the purchaser can understand. While English
       cases may be relevant in understanding the essential features of
       trade mark law but when we are dealing with the sale of
       consumer items in India, you have to see and bear in mind the
       difference in situation between England and India. Can English
       principles apply in their entirety in India with no regard to
       Indian conditions? We think not. In a country like India where
       there is no single common language, a large percentage of
       population is illiterate and a small fraction of people know
       English, then to apply the principles of English law regarding
       dissimilarity of the marks or the customer knowing about the
       distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods seems to
       overlook the ground realities in India. While examining such
       cases in India, what has to be kept in mind is the purchaser of
       such goods in India who may have absolutely no knowledge of
       English language or of the language in which the trade mark is
       written and to whom different words with slight difference in
       spellings may sound phonetically the same. While dealing with
       cases relating to passing off, one of the important tests which
       has to be applied in each case is whether the misrepresentation
       made by the defendant is of such a nature as is likely to cause
       an ordinary consumer to confuse one product for another due to
       similarity of marks and other surrounding factors. What is
       likely to cause confusion would vary from case to case.
       However, the appellants are right in contending that where
       medicinal products are involved, the test to be applied for

        adjudging the violation of trade mark law may not be on a par
       with cases involving non-medicinal products. A stricter
       approach should be adopted while applying the test to judge the
       possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for another by
       the consumer. While confusion in the case of non-medicinal
       products may only cause economic loss to the plaintiff,
       confusion between the two medicinal products may have
       disastrous effects on health and in some cases life itself.
       Stringent measures should be adopted specially where
       medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in
       such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects.
       The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have
       dire effects on the public health.&quot;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">               &quot;17. We think that the view taken by Desai, J. is
               right. It is well known that the question whether
               the two marks are, likely to give rise to confusion
               or not in a question of first impression. It is for the
               Court to decide that question. English cases
               proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an
               English word by Englishmen, which it may be
               stated is not always the same may not be of much
               assistance in our Country in deciding question of
               phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that
               the word is an English word which to the mass of
               the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well
               recognised that in deciding a question of similarity
               between two marks, the marks have to be
               considered as a whole. So considered, we are
               inclined to agree with Desai, J. that the marks with
               which this case is concerned are similar. Apart
               from the syllable &quot;co&quot; in the appellant&#x27;s mark, the
               two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our
               opinion such as would enable the buyers in our
               country to distinguish the one mark from the other.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">               18. We also agree with Desai, J. that the idea of the
               two marks is the same. The marks convey the ideas
               of glucose and life giving properties or vitamins.
               The Aquamatic case (harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty&#x27;s
               Ld) 1958 RPC 887 is a recent case where the test
               of the commonness of the idea between two marks
               was applied in deciding the question of similarity
               between them. Again, in deciding the question of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS)(Comm.)295.2019                                         Page 15 of 17</span>
               similarity between the two marks we have to
              approach it from the point of view of a man of
              average intelligence and of imperfect recollection.
              To such a man the overall structural and phonetic
              similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two
              marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion
              between them.&quot;

       Thus, from the aforesaid judgment, it is clear whether the trade
       marks are likely to create confusion or not in question of first
       impression. It is for the Court to decide that question. Looking
       to the similarity between marks used by the plaintiffs and the
       original defendants, they are likely to create confusion at first
       impression. The manner in which mark RANGOLI is written
       which is a trade mark of the original plaintiffs which is a Hindi
       version in Devnagri script, is overall structurally (colour, size,
       length, breadth and scriptwise) and phonetically similar to the
       mark RANGILI used by the original defendants. The person
       who is going to purchase Agarbatti (essence stick) will be
       prima facie deceived by the mark used by the defendants. Thus,
       from the view point of the consumer, of an imperfect
       recollection and of an average intelligence, there will be a
       confusion, if the defendants are allowed to use the mark
       RANGILI which is visually, structurally and phonetically much
       similar to the trade mark RANGOLI used by the original
       plaintiffs.&quot;                               (emphasis supplied)

plaintiffs. Moreover, balance of convenience is also in favour of the original
plaintiffs and if the stay as prayed for is not granted, it will cause an
irreparable loss to the plaintiffs. These aspects of the matter have been
