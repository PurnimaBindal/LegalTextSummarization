</p><p id="p_3">      2.      T.J. Joseph was a Professor of Newman

College, Thodupuzha. He had set Malayalam          question

paper for internal examination of B.Com Degree.

There was allegation that one of the questions was

ridiculing or insulting          Prophet Muhammad.    There

was protest from several corners.          Sub Inspector of

Police, Muvattupuzha registered Crime 327/2010 of

that Police Station, under <a href="/doc/345634/" id="a_12">section 153A</a> and <a href="/doc/1803184/" id="a_13">295A</a> of

Indian       Penal      Code  on  26.3.2010,  against   the

Professor.               He      surrendered  before    the

investigating          officer  and  produced  before   the

Magistrate.          He was remanded to judicial custody

and later released on bail.          There was protest from

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      3

various      religious      fundamentalist  group   against

Professor Joseph.          Prosecution case is that accused

who are leaders and activists of Population Front

of India and its political wing Social Democratic

Party of India conspired           to give a suitable set

back to the said Professor.               Pursuant to the

conspiracy, meticulous plans were drawn to form

separate groups to undertake specified assignments

to perpetuate the evil plan.          On 4.7.2010 at about

8 a.m while Professor Joseph along with          his sister

Sr.Stella and mother were           returning in a Wagon R

Car after attending Sunday mass at Nirmala Matha

Church, one group comprising seven accused armed

with deadly weapons like small axe, chopper and

explosive substances came in a Maruti Omni Van

displaying registration No.KL-07/AD 7201, a false

registration          number,    though  the   registration

number was KL-07/AH 8768. They intercepted the

Wagon R         Car, near to the house of Joseph, the

place they were waiting. They smashed the window

panes of the Wagon R           Car.  One among the accused

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      4

inflicted cuts on the right palm of the Professor

with a small axe           causing amputation of his  right

palm,         evidently for the reason that with that

hand Professor          prepared the objectionable question

paper.        Several cut injuries were inflicted on

various parts of the body of Professor Joseph.          His

sister      was     also   manhandled  and  was  wrongfully

prevented        from helping the Professor.     The mother

aged more than 80 years was also not spared.

Though Salomi, wife of the Professor and Midhun,

the son rushed to the scene of occurrence, they

were threatened and intimidated by throwing bombs

causing explosion and smoke.          Though Midhun went to

his father to help him, a cut injury was inflicted

on his back.         They lifted Midhun and threw him into

nearby compound which lies at a lower level of more

than     four     metres     causing  injuries  to  Midhun.

Hearing the sound of explosion and the hue and cry

though      local      people   started  rushing,  all  the

assailants escaped from the scene in the Maruti

Van,     after      throwing   the   severed  palm  of  the

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010       5

Professor to into a nearby compound.                Getting

information Police headed by the Sub Inspector of

Police, rushed to the spot.          By that time Professor

was shifted to nearby Nirmala Hospital by his son.

The     Sub     Inspector      of  Police  recovered    the

amputated        palm      from  the  nearby  compound  and

transferred it to the hospital.            It is thereafter

Crime 704/2010 was registered.           It is based on the

investigation, Annexure A2(Annexure B) report was

submitted before the Magistrate incorporating the

offences under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_14">Unlawful Activities (Prevention)

Act</a>,1967.         In view of the incorporation of the

offences under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_15">Unlawful Activities (Prevention)

Act</a>, as provided under section 43D(2)(b) Annexure C

report       was     submitted    as  the  proviso  thereto

enables the investigating officer to get the period

of remand extended beyond the period of 90 days

upto     180     days.        Learned Magistrate  recording

satisfaction, extended the period of remand beyond

the period of 90 days as sought for in Annexure C

report.      In both Criminal Miscellaneous      Petitions,

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010       6

the report submitted by the Circle Inspector of

Police        who        was    investigating   the    case,

incorporating          the   offences  under   the  <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_16">Unlawful

Activities (Prevention)           Act</a> is challenged.  Though

in Crl.M.C.4285/2010 in addition,             accused No.11

had challenged Annexure C remand report and the

orders      passed       therein,  learned   senior  counsel

submitted        that      as   per   order  in   BA   5134,

5795,5824,5940, 5950, 6017 and 6186 of 2010 as well

as B.A, 4826,           4881, 5080 and 5192 of 2010    filed

by the petitioners along with accused 12 and 13,

this court has already found that Magistrate has no

jurisdiction to pass an order under the first

proviso      inserted       by  <a href="/doc/183369517/" id="a_17">section  43D(2)(b)</a>  of   the

Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and it is only

the      Sessions          Court   concerned,   which    has

jurisdiction to pass an order and the Assistant

Public      Prosecutor       in  charge  of  the   court  of

Judicial First Class Magistrate has no locus standi

to submit a report for extension of the period of

remand, under the proviso to <a href="/doc/183369517/" id="a_18">Section 43D(2)(b)</a> and

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     7

it is only the Public Prosecutor who is competent

to file a report and that too only to the Sessions

Court having jurisdiction and directed that the

Public Prosecutor attached to the Sessions Court,

Ernakulam shall file the necessary reports under

<a href="/doc/183369517/" id="a_19">section       43D(2)(b)</a>     of  the Unlawful  Activities

(Prevention) Act and it is for the Sessions Court

to consider the same and pass orders and in such

circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the

additional relief sought for in Crl.M.C.4285/2010.

When     an    offence     under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_20">Unlawful Activities

(Prevention) Act</a> is involved, as provided under

<a href="/doc/107536610/" id="a_21">section 43</a> of the Act, only an officer not below

the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police, who is

competent to investigate the offence and not the

Circle Inspector of Police, who submitted Annexure

A2 report who is incompetent to incorporate an

offence under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. I cannot agree with the submission.        When

the case was registered only for the offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">

Indian Penal Code</a> and <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_23">Explosive Substances Act</a>, the

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      8

Circle       Inspector       of   Police   who   was    the

investigating officer is           definitely competent to

investigate the said offences.              When the said

investigating officer, on investigation, found out

that the offences committed include               not only

offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> the Indian Penal Code</a> but also under

the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_25">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>, he is

definitely competent to file a report before the

concerned        Magistrate     intimating  that  such  an

offence is attracted and therefore the said offence

is also incorporated and is being investigated.

True,      once       an    offence  under   the   Act  is

incorporated,           the  case   shall  necessarily   be

investigated by a competent officer as provided

under      <a href="/doc/107536610/" id="a_26">section       43</a>  of  the   Unlawful  Activities

(Prevention) Act,1967.          It is not disputed that the

case is now being investigated after incorporation

of    the     offence      under  the  <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_27">Unlawful  Activities

(Prevention) Act</a>, and in the light of the findings

of this court in the Bail Applications, the            case

is being investigated by a competent officer. Hence

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      9

the only question is whether the offences under the

<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_28">Unlawful       Activities     (Prevention)  Act</a>, 1967,  is

attracted or not.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4. Before considering the facts and the law,

one aspect is to be borne in mind.                Case was

registered for the offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29"> the Indian Penal

Code</a> and the <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_30">Explosive Substances Act</a>.          It is based

on the materials collected during investigation,

getting satisfied that the offences involved are

serious and include           offences under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_31">Unlawful

Activities (Prevention) Act</a>, 1967 also, Annexure B

report was submitted.             Investigation is at the

nasal        stage.        The  challenge    against   the

incorporation of the offence under the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_32">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a> is to be

appreciated in this background.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. The argument of the learned senior counsel

appearing for the petitioner in Crl.M.C.4285/2010

and     the      learned     counsel  appearing   for  the

petitioner in Crl.M.C.3961/2010 is that,             as is

clear from Annexure A1 F.I.R the incident occurred

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      10

not on account of any personal animosity against

Professor Joseph or because he belongs to another

religion but only because he allegedly published         a

blasphemous           matter    insulting   the   Prophet.

Therefore the act was not a            simple criminal act

against an individual but an attack for an act,

which      the accused believed was blasphemous.        It

is contended that even if the said prosecution case

is accepted, the case could be successfully and

properly handled by the State Police by following

the procedure provided under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33"> the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure and the ordinary law and does not require

the     incorporation        of  stringent  provisions  of

<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_34">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>.         It is argued

that though terrorism is not defined under the

<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_35">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>, the decisions

of the Honourable Supreme Court on the previous

repealed       Act,      TADA  and  POTA  are     relevant

guidelines especially when             "terrorist act" as

provided        under      <a href="/doc/503626/" id="a_36">section  15</a>  of   the  Unlawful

Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 is identical to

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     11

the "terrorist act" provided under section 3 of

TADA and to attract terrorist act under <a href="/doc/503626/" id="a_37">section 15</a>,

there should be an allegation that there was a

requisite        intention    of  threat  to  the   unity,

integrity, security and sovereignty         of India or to

strike terror in the people or any section of the

people in India and even if the act alleged against

the accused may have caused shock in the conscience

of the people, such shock cannot be equated to

terrorizing the people as at no part of the State

life     of    the     society was  affected  due  to  the

incident.           It is also argued that causing some

disturbance of law and order or public order, can

never be termed as terrorist activity and when the

criminal activity could be handled by the Police

and     the crime could be investigated by the Kerala

State Police Force, incorporation of the stringent

provisions of <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_38">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a>

is    illegal.       It    is also contended  that  though

incident of serious           nature, where   even   while

attending the court murder had taken place and

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      12

hands of the deceased were severed, in none of

those cases             provisions of <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_39">Unlawful Activities

(Prevention)         Act</a>   is  incorporated  and the  said

provision is incorporated in the crime only because

the accused belong to the minority community. It is

contended that when the alleged acts do                not

attract Section 15 of the Unlawful Acitivities

(Prevention) Act,            incorporation of the offences

under the said Act and its investigation under

Annexure A2 report is to be quashed.               Learned

counsel relied on the decisions of the Apex Court

in <a href="/doc/1211819/" id="a_40">Prakashkumar v. State of Gujarat</a> (2005(2) SCC

</p><p id="p_7">409), <a href="/doc/1275754/" id="a_41">Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and others v. State of

Maharashtra</a>         (1994(SC    2623),  <a href="/doc/1420067/" id="a_42">Ravindra Shantaram

Karnataka</a> (2000 Crl.L.J. 3182) and argued that in

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      13

the light of the decisions, Annexure A2 report can

only be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.Deputy Superintendent of Police, Muvattupuzha

who is now investigating the crime, filed a counter

affidavit         disclosing      the   details   of    the

investigation.          The counter affidavit shows that on

getting information of the incident all the police

personnel in and adjacent district of the Ernakulam

Rural were alerted by the higher authorities and

consequently          a white Omni Van bearing reg. No.KL-

07/AH 8768 was intercepted by the Sub Inspector of

Police,         Perumbavoor      at   Vattakkattupady    on

Muvattupupuzha           Perumbavoor road   by  9-25   a.m.

First accused Jaffer was driving the vehicle.            On

verification getting suspicious on the statements

of the       driver, the Sub Inspector       inspected the

van and found that there were blood stains inside

and outside of the Van and also broken glasses.

The van was seized and the first accused was taken

into custody. On questioning, part of the incident

was unveiled.             Based on the investigation, 24

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      14

accused were arrested later.              According to the

Dy.Superintendent of Police, investigation revealed

that after the question paper issue involving the

Professor       has     arisen,   PFI  and  SDPI  activities

conducted violent protest march to Newman College,

Thodupuzha.            Eventhough   Professor  Joseph    was

brought           before     the      court  to   face   the

consequences, the leaders and activities of those

parties were intolerant.            They conspired to take

revenge by attacking his house,           either to kill him

or to amputate his right palm with                which the

Professor        prepared      the  question   paper.     On

28.3.2010 the working committee meeting of SDPI

held     in    an     auditorium,   conspired  together  and

prepared the plan to implement the action against

the     Professor.         Fifth  accused   was  given   the

leadership. Different specific duties were assigned

to the       leaders like selecting suitable manpower ,

collecting details of the professor and his family,

watching movements of the Professor and family,

movements        of     police,   preparing  route   sketch,

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      15

collecting          sufficient     communication   devices,

suitable         hideouts,      collecting   weapons    and

collecting money for the expenses etc.            After the

preliminary preparations, fifth accused constituted

different teams assigning separate work for each

group.      Some were given the charge for removing the

vehicle used in the            commission of the offences,

other group was entrusted the work to dispose the

bloodstained dresses worn by the operation team,

another group was assigned the work of disposing

weapons      and      another  group   for  collecting  the

operation        team,     another  team  to   prepare  the

hideouts etc.             It is alleged that even separate

teams      were     prepared    for    meeting   the  legal

requirements and also for contacting the police

authorities.          It is alleged that there were    even

separate group for surrendering before the police,

instead of the actual offenders so as to mislead

the police.            It was also disclosed that during

investigation raids were conducted at different

places and the said searches and seizure          unearthed

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010    16

anti-national fundamentalist ideas of the groups

and 19 cases were registered in Ernakulam Rural

District alone and those accused are all either PFI

or SDPI leaders or activists.       It is also contended

that the details of the terrorists activity was

brought to the notice of this court while hearing

Bail Applications 4826, 4881, 5080 and 5192 of 2010

and    Bail     Applications   were dismissed.    It  is

alleged that result of violence was          not merely

physical inflicted on the victims but         mental and

not only to the victims but also to the society

with an intention to have          psychological effects

in the society as a whole.           The object of the

activity is to disturb the religious harmony and

the tranquillity of the society by creating sense

      any act, commits a terrorist act."

When     <a href="/doc/1633290/" id="a_74">Section 3</a> provides         that  to constitute a

terrorist act there should be an intent to overawe

the Government as by law established or to strike

intention to threaten or likely to threaten the

unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India

or to strike terror in the people or any section of

the people in India or in any foreign country.

Therefore when <a href="/doc/1633290/" id="a_76">section 3</a> provides the intent to

overawe the Government as by law established, under

<a href="/doc/503626/" id="a_77">section      15</a>     the    intent  is to  threaten   unity,

criminal force or show of criminal force do or

attempts to do             or causes death of any public

act.       Under section 3 of TADA and <a href="/doc/503626/" id="a_79">section 15</a> of

the Act, it is provided that           using bombs dynamite

any     other       substances    (whether  biological   or

disruption of any supplies or services essential to

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          "7. It may be possible to describe

          it as use of violence when its most

          important result is not merely the

          physical and mental damage of the

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     30

          victim          but    the     prolonged

          psychological effect it produces or

          has the potential of producing on

          the society as a whole. There may be

          death,      injury,  or  destruction  of

          property       or  even  deprivation  of

          individual liberty in the process

          but the extent and reach of the

          intended terrorist activity travels

          beyond the effect of an ordinary

          crime      capable   of  being  punished

          under the ordinary penal law of the

          land and its main objective is to

          overawe the Government or disturb

          of the society and create a sense of

          fear and insecurity. A `terrorist'

          activity does not merely arise by

          causing disturbance of law and order

          or of public order. The fall out of

          the intended activity must be such

          that it travels beyond the capacity

          of    the     ordinary  law   enforcement

          agencies       to tackle  it  under  the

          ordinary penal law. Experience has

          shown       us    that   `terrorism'   is

          generally an attempt to acquire or

          maintain        power   or   control   by

          intimidation and causing fear and

          helplessness in the minds of the

          people      at   large  or  any   section

          thereof and is a totally abnormal

          phenomenon.         What    distinguishes

          `terrorism'       from  other  forms   of

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      32

          violence, therefore, appears to be

          the deliberate and systematic use of

          coercive       intimidation. More  often

          than not, a hardened criminal today

          takes advantage of the situation and

          by wearing the cloak of `terrorism',

          aims       to    achieve   for   himself

          acceptability and respectability in

          the society because unfortunately in

          the States affected by militancy, a

          `terrorist' is projected as a hero

          by his group and often even by the

          misguided youth. It is therefore,

          essential to treat such a criminal

          and deal with him differently than

          an    ordinary     criminal  capable  of

          being tried by the ordinary courts

          under the penal law of the land.</blockquote><p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">          Even though the crime committed by a

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     33

          `terrorist' and an ordinary criminal

          would be overlapping to an extent

          but then it is not the intention of

          the Legislature that every criminal

          should be tried under TADA, where

          the fall out of his activity does

          not     extend     beyond   the   normal

          frontiers of the ordinary criminal

          activity. Every `terrorist' may be a

          criminal but every criminal cannot

          be given the label of a `terrorist'

          only    to     set in  motion  the  more

          stringent provisions of TADA. The

          criminal activity in order to invoke

          TADA    must     be committed with  the

"terrorist        activity"   under   <a href="/doc/1125563/" id="a_88">Section  3(1)</a>, the

            of the TADA Act. It appears that

            the learned        trial Judge  inferred

            that the investigating agency had

            come to the conclusion         that  the

            accused        had  a   personal  grudge

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      41

            against        the   deceased  but   the

            allegations are to the effect that

            the      main    object  underlying  the

            alleged crime was to propagate pro-

            Khalistan cult among Sikh community

            consequences under the pretext of

            championing       the   cause   of  Sikh

            of the trial court that prima facie

            the provisions of TADA Act are not

            will, undoubtedly, be held to be

            a terrorist act. The question,

            therefore, does not really boil

            down     to    an examination  as  to

            whether for the activities, under

            the     normal    criminal  law,  the

            accused persons can be punished

            but to examine the real impact of

            activities       on  the  society  at

            large or at least on a section of

            the society. If the case in hand

            is examined from the aforesaid

            standpoint,      on  the  facts  that

            shortly after the demolition of

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      45

            communal riot erupted in Mumbai

            and during that period in the

            locality in question which was

            predominantly         occupied     by

            Muslims,       a  chawl occupied   by

            Hindus who were in minority was

            set     to     fire  by  the   people

            belonging to the rival community

            and     on    account of  such  fire,

            several people were burnt alive,

            it is difficult to accept the

            contention of Mr Jain that the

            activities do not fall within the

            ambit of TADA. In our considered

            opinion,        judging   from    the

            atrocity of the activities and

            judging from the sensitive and

            tense      atmosphere  prevailing  in

            the town under which the acts

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      46

            were         perpetrated     resulting

            ultimately       in   the   death  of

            several persons, the conclusion

            becomes       irresistible that   such

            activities         had    far-reaching

            consequences and it affects the

            society at large and the even

            tempo had been greatly disturbed

            activities."
</p>
<p id="p_35">      11.    The argument of the learned senior counsel

appearing for the petitioners is that the case does

not involve any act which was allegedly committed

either with an intent to threaten the unity ,

integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to

strike terror in the people or in any section of

the people or in any foreign country and if at all

it could only be the reaction of the culprits to an

action on the part of an individual, who according

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      47

to them had done a blassphemous act.            The attack

against the victim professor was only          against him

and not          against his community and cannot be

interpreted as a terrorist act and therefore the

incorporation of the stringent provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_91">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a> is only to

deny the        accused the benefits provided under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_92"> the

Applications 5134/2010 and connected cases and the

learned single Judge had perused the Case Diary and

found that the attack against Professor              is a

terrorism        Act.        It   was  pointed  out   that

investigation reveals that funds were flown from

foreign countries for perpetrating the plan and

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     48

also to aid the accused to escape from the clutches

of    law      by     providing   hideouts  and   providing

necessary        amenities     and  it   reveals   a   deep

conspiracy to disrupt the unity and integrity of

India and in such circumstances, at this stage when

the case is being investigated, Annexure B report

may not be quashed. Learned Additional Director

General of Prosecution also made available the Case

Diary which runs to several volumes.

</p><p id="p_37">      13. On perusal of the Case Diary, I cannot

agree with the submission of the learned counsel

appearing        for      the petitioners  that   the   act

committed against Professor Joseph was an ordinary

criminal act.          It is definitely implemented after a

conspiracy and that too with meticulous planning.

The materials collected during investigation shows

that before the criminal act was committed on that

fateful Sunday on 4.7.2010, plan was hatched and

works      were      entrusted  to   different  groups   to

implement the respective duties assigned to each

groups. The work of implementing the overt act, was

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     49

assigned to one group. Another group was assigned

the work of finding out proper persons to implement

the same. Another group was constituted to gather

the necessary finance. Another group to arrange

transport, another to destroy the evidence, another

group to provide shelter and hideout after the

gruesome act.          It also reveals that funding for the

implementation of the plan has its source from

foreign countries.          When the  entire facts are thus

appreciated in the proper perspective, it cannot be

said that the act was directed against Professor

Joseph alone.           It was definitely a message to the

general public as to what the group could and would

do, if something is done            against the wishes of

that group or which the group does not agree.

There is a deep conspiracy behind the attack.

Definitely the question whether the intention is to

divide the community on religious lines is also a

matter to be properly investigated.          The submission

of the Additional Director General of Prosecution

that     even     materials    indicating  that  the  group

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      50

intends to follow the heinous method being adopted

by the Taliban, as materials of Taliban showing how

they     anihilate persons        was used for the purpose

of    training,        is  a  serious matter   which  shall

necessarily be properly investigated.              At this

           by     a    large  number  of   persons

           within the court premises. Such

           activities       have   the effect   of

           undermining the very authority of

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010      52

           the State and have a terrorizing

           effect on those who witness such

           an incident, and those who come to

           know of it. The terror, fear and

           panic        which   they   suffer  is

           unfathomable         and     tend   to

           completely demoralize the ordinary

           man in the street. The blatant

           manner       in   which the   plan was

           executed        in  the  instant  case

           leaves no manner of doubt that the

           intention of the perpetrator was

           not merely to kill the victim, but

           also to send a terrorising message

           to the people in general, so that

           there was no defiance of their

           command in future. An attempt was

           also made on the lives of three

           policemen       which   reinforces the

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010     53

           conclusion that the intention was

           to strike terror and the killing

           was      attempted   to  achieve  that

           objective. We have therefore no

           doubt, that the facts proved do

           establish        the   commission   of

           offences         under     TADA.    No

           interference       with  the  sentence

           passed will be justified in the

           facts of this case."

<p id="p_40">      14.     On    going   through  the  Case  Diary and

appreciating           the   materials  collected   during

investigation and considering the nature of the

commission of the dastardly act and the attending

circumstances, it is clear that the crime committed

cannot       be     tackled    as  an   ordinary  criminal

acitivity.         The intended extent and reach of the

criminal acitivity travels beyond the gravity of

mere attack against an individual.           It transcends

the     frontiers        of the   locality  and may   even

Crl.M.C.3961 &amp; 4285 of 2010       54

challenge the very integrity and sovereignty of our

country and its democratic polity. Hence I find

that it is not in the interest of justice to quash

Annexure B report              incorporating   the offences

under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_95">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act</a> at

this       stage       and     thereby   thwart  a    proper

investigation as sought for by the petitioners.

The      materials         collected  during   investigation

warrants a proper and thorough investigation on all

aspects of the case so that all the culprits could

be brought for trial.
