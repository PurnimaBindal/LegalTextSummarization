 Land Records passed its order allowing the application for

 condonation of delay, observing that the same had been done in

 consonance with the principles of natural justice. This order was

 challenged by the petitioner before the Deputy Director of Land

 Records. But, by order dated 17/07/2015 the said Authority

 had concentrated only on the merits of the matter and without

 any discussion on sufficiency of reasons demonstrated by

 respondent No.1 for condonation of delay. This contention raised

 respondent No.1, without adverting to the only aspect that the

 said Authority was expected to consider i.e. whether respondent

 No.1 had demonstrated sufficient cause for condonation of delay.

 It was submitted that a perusal of the application for condonation

 there was delay of more than seven years in filing the appeal. It

 was submitted that the application for condonation of delay did

 not demonstrate any cogent reasons to justify the delay in

 approaching the Superintendent       of Land Records.             It was

 submitted that this aspect was not touched at all by the

 Superintendent of Land Records in the impugned order, despite

 the fact that in the second round before this Court, the order of

 the said Authority had been set aside on the very same ground

 that discussion was limited to the merits of the case of respondent

 No.1, without reference to sufficiency of cause demonstrated by

 the said respondent while seeking condonation of delay. Reliance

 was placed on judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case

 material to demonstrate that respondent No.1 was well aware

 about the existence of the said gift deed and the entry made in the

 counsel for the petitioner invited attention of this Court to a

 proceeding before the Civil Court filed by a tenant in the property

 in question, where both the petitioner as well as respondent No.1

 were defendants. In the said suit, the aforesaid property card with

 the entry dated 09/09/2002 was placed on record on behalf of the

 defendants and reference to the same was made by the Civil Court

 while passing its judgment in Regular Civil Suit No.1956 of 1999.

 The learned counsel relied upon documents i.e. vakalatnama filed

 in the said proceeding, which was signed by both the petitioner

 and respondent No.1, as also judgment passed by the Civil Court

 in the said proceeding making a reference to the said property

 card.       The vakalatnama was said to have been filed on

 condonation of delay and appeal before the Superintendent of

 Land Records on 14/09/2009. On this basis, it was submitted that

 the claim made by respondent No.1 that he first became aware

 about the aforesaid entry in July, 2009 was palpably false.

 the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the writ

 petition was maintainable. It was submitted that in the earlier

 round of litigation also the petitioner had filed writ petition before

 this Court challenging the order of the Superintendent of Land

 Records, which was entertained by this Court, particularly when

 the Deputy Director of Land Records, as an officer under the said

 objection regarding maintainability of the writ petition, the same

 deserves to be considered at the outset. It is submitted that on

 behalf of respondent No.1 that section 257 of the aforesaid Code

 read with section 259 thereof clearly provided an alternative

 efficacious remedy in the form of a revisional proceeding before

 the State and that the same ought to have been exhausted by the

 petitioner before seeking to invoke writ jurisdiction of this Court.

 The fact that such jurisdiction of the State was clearly available in

 the present case was canvassed on behalf of respondent No.1 by

 placing reliance on judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

 the case <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_6">Gurudassing Nawoosing Panjwani v. State of Maharashtra

 including section 257 thereof to recognize that the State can

 exercise revisional jurisdiction under section 257 of the Code to

 set right illegal orders that may be passed by the Revenue Officers

         Section 257 to call for and examine the record. If it decides
         not to call and examine the record, then there would not be
         any occasion for the applicant to ask for the decision as a
         matter of right. There is no right to relief as is available in
         appeal to the party aggrieved. In view of this, it cannot be
         said that Section 257 of the MLR Code provides statutory
         remedy of revision as an alternate and efficacious remedy to
         challenge the order passed in appeal under Section 247 of
         the MLR Code. The two decisions cited by Shri Gordey lay

         down general propositions of law which are not disputed. "

 so as to claim that a writ petition was not maintainable. Apart

 from this, in the present case, it is an admitted position that in the

 second round of litigation, this Court had entertained writ petition

 order of the said Authority was set aside in writ jurisdiction by this

 earlier approached the Deputy Director of Land Records, who by

 order dated 17/07/2015 had held that an appeal against interim

 order condoning delay was not maintainable under the provisions

 of the said Code.             This also indicates that a forum for raising

 grievance on behalf of the petitioner against the order of the

 Superintendent of Land Records was not available under the

 provisions of the said Code, prompting him to approach this Court

 by filing the earlier writ petition.

         Secondly, limitations placed on the court's decision to exercise
         or refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction are selfimposed. It is
         a well settled principle that the writ jurisdiction of a High
         Court cannot be completely excluded by statute. If a High
         Court is tasked with being the final recourse to upholding the
         rule of law within its territorial jurisdiction, it must necessarily
         have the power to examine any case before it and make a
         determination of whether or not its writ jurisdiction is

 condonation of delay in respect of an appeal filed by respondent

 position that the period of limitation for filing such an appeal is 60

 days from the date of the order. The order in the present case was

 passed on 09/09/2002, while the application for condonation of

 delay along with the appeal was filed on 14/09/2009, which was a

 certified copies of relevant documents were obtained on

 02/09/2009. On this basis, it was claimed that the appeal filed on

 14/09/2009 was in fact within limitation, but to avoid any

 technical point of delay, the application was being filed by way of

 precaution. This is the only material placed on record on behalf of

 respondent No.1 while seeking to explain considerable delay of

 more than seven years in preferring the appeal before the

 Superintendent of Land Records. Applying the position of law laid

 down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a catena of judgments,

 reiterated in the above quoted judgment, it becomes clear that the

 manner in which the application was drafted in the present case

 demonstrated a non-serious approach and showed a nonchalant
