<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

G.P. Mathur, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. The points involved in this bunch of writ petitions is similar and therefore they are being disposed of by a common order.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. The three principal prayers made in the writ petitions are (1) that a writ of certiorari be issued for quashing the first information report dated 13-6-1996 which was registered as Case Crime No. 700 of 1996 under Sections 419, 420, 470 and 471, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">I.P.C</a>. of police Station Coloneganj, Allahabad (2) that a writ of mandamus be issued commanding the respondents not to arrest the petitioners in pursuance of the aforesaid F.I.R. and (3) that a writ of mandamus be issued commanding the Senior Superintendent of Police, Allahabad not to compel the petitioners to deposit their weapons.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. From the short counter-affidavit filed by Sri Jagdish Prasad Yadav, Arms Clerk, Collectorate Allahabad in writ petition No. 2287 of 1996, it transpires that the Senior Superintendent of Police of another district namely Ambedkar Nagar sent a letter dated 5-4-1996 to the District Magistrate, Allahabad making inquiry regarding the arms licences of certain persons who were arrested in connection with a criminal case in his district. The City Magistrate/Officer In-charge Arms, after inquiry, came to the conclusion that the entries made in the Arms Register, maintained in the office of the District Magistrate, Allahabad, showing grant of arms licences in favour of the aforesaid persons who had been arrested in district Ambedkar Nagar were forged and fictitious. The District Magistrate, Allahabad, then by his order dated 16-4-1996 constituted a three member committee consisting of Sri K. S. K. Dwivedi, A.D.M. (City), Sri K. N. Singh A. D. M. (Admn.) and Sri S. K. Singh, City-Magistrate, Officer In-charge, Arms to hold an inquiry. The Committee after considering relevant document submitted a detailed report dated 13-6-1996 to the District Magistrate. After receipt of the report the District Magistrate passed an order on the same day i.e., on 13-6-1996 and as it has a bearing on the controversy involved, it is being reproduced in toto.

The order of the District Magistrate was communicated to the Inspector In-charge Police Station, Colonelganj, who treating it as a first information report, registered a case as crime No. 700 of 1996 under <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_2">Sections 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1991013/" id="a_4">470</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a>,<a href="/doc/1873250/" id="a_6">1</a>.P.C. The first information report is a verbatim reproduction, from beginning to the end, of the above quoted order. After the words' Zilladhikari Allahabad' which is at the bottom of the order one line has been added which reads as follows.
</p><p id="p_6"> Licence Panjiyon men pratham dristaya pai gai shastra licenso Ki Pravistiyon Ki Sunchi. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7">Translated into English it would read-list of the entries regarding arms licences in the arms Register which were prima facie found to be forged. Then there is a long list which contains about 346 names. The names of the person, number of the licence and its date and the nature of weapon for which the licence was issued is mentioned therein.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">4. The recital in the body of the order passed by the District Magistrate is to the effect that the report dated 13-6-1996 and the accompanying list made by the inquiry committee which had been entrusted the job of holding inquiry regarding the making of illegal entries in the Arms Register by the order dated 16-4-1996 was perused. According to the report, the entries in the Arms Register regarding grant of arms licences to the persons mentioned in the list from page 1 to 22 were found to be prima facie forged. The Committee had made recommendation for cancelling the arms licences and for lodging first information report under the relevant sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> of the Penal Code</a> against the then Arms Clerk and all the persons mentioned in the list for having entered into a criminal conspiracy and for making forged entries in the Arms Register and thereby fraudulently and illegally obtaining arms licences. Then it is mentioned that in view of Supreme Court judgment in <a href="/doc/1122454/" id="a_8">U.P. Junior Doctors Members Action Committee v. Dr. B. Sheetal Nandwani</a> AIR 1991 SC 909, no notice is required to be given for cancelling arms licences as the same had been obtained fraudulently and on the basis of forged entries. Thereafter the order recites that the records were examined and agreeing with the report of the inquiry committee all the licences mentioned in the list running from page 1 to 22 are being cancelled with immediate effect and the list page 1 to 22 shall be part of this order. The order is then signed by Sri B. M. Meena, District Magistrate Allahabad on 13-6-1996. After the order, there is a further noting to the following effect.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">Office of District Magistrate Allahabad." Then there are no directions to three different authorities which are noted as Nos. 1,2 and 3. By the first direction the Senior Superintendent of Police, Allahabad was informed of the order and was asked to get the licences and arms of all the persons mentioned in the list deposited at the concerned police Station within a week and to submit his compliance report. By the second direction the Officer In-charge (Joint Office) Collectorate, Allahabad was asked to inform the name of the then arms clerk to the Inspector In-charge, Colonelganj, Police Station. By the third direction the Inspector In-charge, Colonelganj, was instructed to write a first information report under the relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9"> of the Penal Code</a> against the persons whose names are mentioned in the list (page 1 to 22) and the then arms clerk for entering into a criminal conspiracy and for obtaining or procuring arms licences by making or getting forged entries in the Arms Register and to take necessary steps in that connection. He was also directed to send copy of the first information report to the office of the District Magistrate.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">5. As mentioned earlier the F.I.R. which is impugned in this bunch of the writ petitions is a verbatim reproduction of the order passed by the District Magistrate. The question to be examined is whether by the order dated 13-6-1996 the District Magistrate intended that his own order be treated as first information report or that the order was passed for a different purpose and a specific direction was issued to Inspector In-charge Colonelganj, Police Station to write and lodge a first information report against the concerned persons. It is true that Code of Criminal Procedure does not lay down any particular form in which information may be given to an officer in charge of police Station regarding commission of a cognizable offence. <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_10">Section 154</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. merely requires that every information regarding commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally shall be reduced in writing and every such information whether given in writing or reduced to writing shall be signed by the person giving it and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer, in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf. The main order passed by the District Magistrate shows that it is not intended to be an information to the officer in charge of the police station. The order has been passed only for one purpose namely for cancelling the arms licences of the persons mentioned in the list. In the initial part of the order the District Magistrate has made a reference to the report of the Enquiry Committee which had prima facie found the entries in the arms Register to be forged. He has also taken notice of the recommendation made by the Committee for lodging first information report against all such persons. Then he has considered the question as to whether a prior notice should be given for cancelling the arms licences and after placing reliance upon a Supreme Court decision, he has held that no notice was required to be given and then he has passed the order cancelling the arms licences with immediate effect. This is the main order of the District Magistrate and the object of the order was to cancel the arms licences. It does not show that any information is sought to be given to an Officer-In-charge of the Police Station regarding com-mission of a cognizable offence. After the order had been signed there is a further note in the manner in which it is normally done for communication of the order to other authorities for either taking further steps in pursuance thereof or for compliance of the same. The first note which is a direction to the Senior Superintendent of Police to get the arms and arms licences of the persons mentioned in the list deposited in the police stations and the second direction which is to the officer In-charge Collectorate to intimate the names of the then Arms Clerks again can not be said to be an information to an Officer In-charge of the Police Station regarding commission of an offence. In-fact these directions have no relevance in a document which may be a first information report. It is the third direction which is of importance in the present case. By this the Inspector In-charge Colonelganj Police Station was directed to write a first information report under the relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12"> of the Penal Code</a> against the then Arms Clerk and those persons whose names are mentioned from page 1 to 22 of the list for having entered into a criminal conspiracy and obtaining arms licences by making or procuring forged entries in the Arms Register. The words used in Hindi are 'Pratham Suchana Report Ankit Kar' which means to write or scribe a first information report. The words are not "Pratham Suchana Report Panjikrit Kar" namely to register a first information report. If the order is read as a whole it shows that the District Magistrate has passed the order revoking the arms licences in exercise of his powers under Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1845798/" id="a_13">Section 17</a> of the Arms Act. The reasons for passing such an order have also been given. This has been done in compliance of Sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/1845798/" id="a_14">Section 17</a> of the Act which provides that where the Licensing Authority makes an order revoking a licence under Sub-section (3) it shall record in writing the reasons therefor. Thus there can be no doubt that the order of the District Magistrate has been passed under <a href="/doc/456259/" id="a_15">Section 17(3)</a> of the Arms Act and it was never intended that the order itself should be treated as information regarding commission of a cognizable offence to a police officer as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_16">Section 154</a>, Cr. P.C. which could be registered as a criminal case.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">6. The direction at the bottom of the order, no doubt, instructed the inspector In-charge of Police Station, Colonelganj to write or scribe a first information report against the then Arms Clerk and the persons mentioned in the list. Instead of complying with that part of the order by writing a first information report, the Inspector In-charge committed the error of recording the order of the District Magistrate as a first information report. The direction issued by the District Magistrate to the Inspector of the Colonelganj, Police Station has so far not been complied with. We are, therefore, of the opinion that till this part of the order of the District Magistrate has been complied with and a first information report is either written or scribed and thereafter registered as a criminal case, the police shall not get the right to investigate or make arrest in accordance with <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_17">Section 157</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">7. If the order of the District Magistrate is treated to be an information to the police Officer regarding commission of a cognizable offence as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_19">Section 154</a>, Cr. P. C, certain problems may crop up which deserve notice. If the findings of the Enquiry Committee are correct and persons have procurred arms licences on the strength of forged entries in the arms register, it would mean that they are having no valid arms licences with them. Almost every one has obtained weapons on the basis of the aforesaid licences and they are in possession of the same. Possession of a weapon without a valid arms licence is an offence under <a href="/doc/239593/" id="a_20">Section 25(1B)</a> of the Arms Act. But prosecution for such an offence requires previous sanction of the District Magistrate in view of <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_21">Section 39</a> of the Act. The act of grant of sanction for launching the prosecution is not an empty formality which can be mechanically performed. The dictionary meaning of the word sanction is as under :
</p>  

<p id="p_13">Webster's Third New International Dictionary-
</p>  

<p id="p_14">explicit permission or recognition by one in authority that gives validity to the act of another person or body; something that authorizes, confirms, or countenances. The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary-
</p><p id="p_15"> explicit permission given by some one in authority. 
</p> 

<p id="p_16">The Concise Oxford Dictionary-
</p><p id="p_17"> approval or encouragement given to an action etc., by custom or tradition express permission, confirmation or ratification of a law etc. authorize, countenance, or agree to (an action etc.) 
 

Stroud's Judicial Dictionary-
</p><p id="p_18"> Sanction not only means prior approval; generally it also means ratification.  
</p> 

<p id="p_19">Words and Phrases-
</p><p id="p_20">  The verb 'Sanction' has a distinct shade of meaning from 'authorize' and means to assent, concur, confirm or ratify. The word conveys the idea of sacredness or of authority. 
</p> 

<p id="p_21">The Law Lexicon by Ramanath Iyer.
</p> 

<p id="p_22"> Prior approval or ratification
 

The fact that the Legislature has given greai importance to sanction will be clear from the Scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure, <a href="/doc/1865807/" id="a_22">Section 216</a> of the Code gives power to the Court to alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced but Sub-section (5) thereof lays down that if the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded. This was also emphasised by the Privy Council in the famous case of <a href="/doc/1841408/" id="a_23">Gokulchand Dwarka Das v. The King</a> AIR 1948 PC 82 : 1948 ALJ 170 wherein para 9 it was observed as follows (at page 84; of AIR PC):
</p><p id="p_23"> ...The sanction to prosecute is an important matter; it constitutes a condition precedent to the institution of the prosecution and the Government have an absolute discretion to grant or withhold their sanction. They are not, as the High Court seem to have thought, concerned merely to see that the evidence discloses a prima facie case against the person sought to be prosecuted.... 
</p> 

<p id="p_24">In para 10 it was observed that the giving of sanction confers jurisdiction on the Court to try the case. This case has been quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1440006/" id="a_24">Madan Mohan v. State of U.P</a>. AIR 1954 SC 637 : AIR 1954 Cri LJ 1656 and <a href="/doc/49086800/" id="a_25">Major Som Nath v. Union of India</a> AIR 1971 SC 1910 : 1971 Cri LJ 1429 and the dictum of the Privy Council that in order to constitute a valid sanction it must be established that the same was granted with reference to the facts constituting the offence was reiterated. In the impugned F.I.R. the first informant or the complainant is the District Magistrate. To us it appears extremely doubtful whether a person who is himself the complainant or the first informant and has set the machinery of law into motion can also perform the important function of a Sanctioning Authority as envisaged by <a href="/doc/534261/" id="a_26">Section 39</a> of the Act.
</p> 

<p id="p_25">8. Another legal point which may be noticed here is that according to the report of the Inquiry Committee there are 346 such persons who have obtained arms licences in a fraudulent manner. These persons are different people living in different areas of the city or villages in the District of Allahabad and most of them have no connection of any kind whatsoever with each other. As per the prosecution case, they either singly or collectively in a group entered into a criminal conspiracy with the then arms clerk and by procuring forged entries in the Arms Register managed forged arms licences in their favour. The arms licences purport to have been issued on different dates over a period of several years. At any rate this is certain that all the 346 persons did not jointly enter into a conspiracy with the arms clerk and procured arms licences at one point of time or Within quick succession and within such period which may form one transaction. <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_27">Section 223</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28">Cr.P.C</a>. enumerates the category of persons who may be charged and tried together. Sub-section (a) thereof mentions persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of same transaction and Sub-section (d) thereof mentions persons accused of different offences committed in the course of same transaction. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_29">Section 219</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_30">Cr.P.C</a>. provides that offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with same amount of punishment under the same section<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> or of any special or Local law. Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_32">Section 220</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_33">Cr.P.C</a>. provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form the san transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence. The illustrations to this sub-section mentioned in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_34"> the Code</a> throw light as to when a series of acts will form the same transaction. <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_35">Sections 220</a> and <a href="/doc/1737687/" id="a_36">223</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, are similar to Sections 235 and 239 of the Old Code of 1898. <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_37">In State of A.P. v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao</a> AIR 1963 SC 1850, it was held that the expression "same transaction" occurring in Clauses (a) and (d) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_38">Section 239</a> as well as that occurring in <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_39">Section 235(i)</a> ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of Statutes. Though the investigation is yet to be completed but from the contention advanced by the learned State Counsel it appears to us that different persons whose names are mentioned in the list while procuring the allegedly forged arm licences cannot be said to have committed the crime in the course of the same transaction. The crime would have been committed by them in conspiracy with the then arms clerk and other persons in the concerned office at different time and on different dates. Prima facie, it appears to us that in view of the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure all these 346 persons cannot be charged or tried together.
</p> 

<p id="p_26">9. It is needless to emphasise that no innocent should be harassed and no guilty should escape punishment. In order to bring the guilty to book, it is necessary that the prosecution should proceed in such a manner that there are least hurdles in its way. It is not in public interest that such prosecution may be launched which gets bogged down on account of technical objections as they cause delay in proceedings. If the infirmities can be rectified at the initial stage, it will save public time and expense. Launching of prosecution of such a large number of persons on the basis of a single F.I.R. like the one in hand, of which the District Magistrate himself is the author may not be proper in the larger public interest on account of the legal problems indicated earlier.
</p> 

<p id="p_27">10. Before parting with the case it is necessary to dispose of a serious contention raised on behalf of the petitioner namely that the report of the Inquiry Committee dated 13-6-1996 referred to in the order of the District Magistrate was actually not at all in existence. Reference in this connection is made to an application which was moved in Writ Petition No. 2287 of 1996 on 27-6-1996 wherein a prayer was made to summon the original inquiry report. A learned single Judge passed an order on the same day directing the State counsel to file a reply within twenty four hours. A counter-affidavit of the arms clerk (Collectorate) was filed on 28-6-1996 wherein the assertion made by the petitioners was denied and it was reiterated that a three member committee was ?constituted by the District Magistrate by his order dated 16-4-1996 and the said Committee had submitted a report on 13-6-1996. Some petitions came up before us on 1-7-1996 when the Court reopened after summer vacation. Though 4-7-1996 was fixed for hearing but we orally directed the State counsel to produce the report on the very next day in order to verify the assertion made in the counter-affidavit. The original report was produced before us on 2-7-1996. We do not think that the report, which is a fairly bulky document, could have been subsequently prepared in such a short time. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the District Magistrate has based his order on a non existent report cannot, therefore, be accepted.
</p> 

<p id="p_28">11. In view of the discussion made earlier we are clearly of the opinion that the order dated 13-6-1996 passed by the District Magistrate was not an information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, to the Officer In-charge of a police Station as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_41">Section 154</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_42">Cr.P.C</a>. and it was wrongly registered as case Crime No. 700 of 1996. We accordingly issue a writ of mandamus to the respondents not to arrest the petitioners in pursuance of Case Crime No. 700 of 1996 of Police Station Colonelganji Allahabad.
</p> 

<p id="p_29">12. During the course of hearing of the petitions it was made clear that we are confining ourselves to the first and second reliefs claimed by the petitioners regarding quashing of the F.I.R. and the arrest of the petitioners and are not examining the validity of the order dated 13-6-1996 passed by the District Magistrate by which their arms licences have been cancelled. We are expressing no opinion on this question. It will, therefore, be open to the petitioners to avail of such remedy as is available to them under law to assail the validity of the order dated 13-6-1996 of the District Magistrate by which their arms licences have been cancelled and a direction has been issued to the Senior Superintendent of Police to get their arms and arms licences deposited at the police station.
</p> 

<p id="p_30">13. We further make it clear that it will be open to Inspector In-charge of Police Station, Colonelganj or any other competent person to lodge first information reports against those who appear to have committed the crime either singly or collectively as the facts and circumstances require. After such first information reports have been lodged and cases have been registered, it will be open to the police authorities to commence investigation in accordance with <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_43">Section 157</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_44">Cr.P.C</a>. and to take all such steps as are permissible in law.
</p> 

<p id="p_31">14. With these observations, all the writ petitions are finally disposed of.
</p>
