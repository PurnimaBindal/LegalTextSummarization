         4.1   There was a long-standing demand from Patidar and other

         communities for providing reservation in the government jobs and

         higher education. There was also agitation/movement as these

         demands were not considered for reservation. To consider such

         representations demanding reservation in higher education from

         social groups and communities, the government constituted a High

         Power Committee of Hon'ble Ministers headed by Shri Nitin Patel as

         Chair-Person. The High Power Committee prepared its report dated

         25.4.2016, which is placed on record. A perusal of the Committee's

         report indicates that the Committee has considered representations

              Kadva-Leua Patidar and Kachchhi Patidar communities do not

              get the benefit of reservations. It is their case that though they

              are also involved in the agricultural activities, they should also

              be included in the other backward classes.

         cannot be          considered as backward, the government should

         undertake a survey for the purpose and such castes that are no

         Rs.4.5 lakh     were given different types of assistance for primary,

         secondary and higher education, and later on the government has

         increased the ceiling limit of annual income                up to Rs. 6 lakh to

         extend the benefit of the scheme. Further under the Mukhyamantri

         Yuva Swavlamban Yojna, the State Government has also provided

         financial support to students of all castes and communities, based on

         their merit and family income for higher education. The Committee

         noticed that such issues related to reservation in admission in

         educational institutions and direct recruitment in the government

         jobs still persist in spite of such benefits extended by the government

         by granting financial assistance to the students.



         4.5   With reference to the demands before the Committee, after

         analyzing the schemes which were already in force and available for

         benefit of the students below ceiling limit income, the Committee

         concluded that it is necessary and proper to take some definitive

         decision of reservation based on income criteria. The Committee

         observed in its report that financial assistance alone does not suffice

         for providing sufficient opportunities of education and employment to

         the economically backward class youth of unreserved category. While

         considering the issue of demand of Patidars to incorporate them in

         the Socially and Educationally Backward Class, the Committee

         realized that        along with the Patidars, there are many other

         unreserved category castes of the society whose youth are facing

         difficulties in getting higher education and government jobs due to

         weaker financial background of the family. The Committee found that

         economically weaker families of unreserved category and socially

         forward class lag behind in aggregate development of their castes as

         they are devoid of opportunities to higher education. The Committee

         made reference to the recommendations made by Justice Rane

         Commission which recommended for reservation based on economic

         criteria. The Committee further found that provision for admission in

         primary education to the children belonging to Below Poverty Line

         (BPL)    families      of   unreserved      category        has      been       done       with

         implementation and enforcement of the Right to Education Act.

         However, the Committee found that there is no provision of

         reservation in the higher education for students belonging to the

         economically weaker families of unreserved category. The Committee

         further found that Social Welfare Department and Tribal Development

         Department have been operating a number of schemes for self-

         employment of youth, but such schemes are not available to the

         youth of economically weaker section of unreserved category, as

         such, they have to rely largely upon the government jobs. The

         Committee found that lack of opportunity for higher education and

         employment has infused disappointment in youth belonging to

         unreserved category and as such, economically weaker sections of

         unreserved category should be given the benefits without adversely

         affecting the benefits of reservation etc already given to the

         Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Socially and Economically

         Backward Classes. The Committee therefore, recommended that such

         complex issues can           be resolved only if justice is done to all the

         economically weaker families of different castes and communities by

         reserving 10% of the seats in               appointments to the government

         services and in educational institutions which will serve the purpose.

         4.7   In the statement annexed to the impugned Ordinance, it is

         stated that the State Government is following and implementing the

         policy of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and

         educational institutions in the State and in the appointments in the

         implementation of the reservation policy for such classes, a

         reasonable number of persons belonging to the said classes are being

         benefited both socially and educationally to some extent and the

         existing policy of reservation for these classes in the State to

         continue. At the same time, economically weaker sections of

         unreserved categories of the society have expressed their inability to

         compete with higher strata who are economically sound and as a

         result     of     which,       such    economically             weaker         sections            feel

         disadvantaged in terms of their representation in the matter of

         admission to educational institutions and in the services and posts

         under the State. It is further stated in the statement that it is the

         prime duty of the government to strive for inclusive development and

         address the reasonable requirement of such Economically Weaker

         Sections of unreserved categories of the society so that they may

         also share the fruits of the policies of the government. Thus, the

         government          considers     it   necessary         to     provide       ten     per      cent

         reservation on the basis of economic status to economically weaker

         sections of the society other than the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled

         Tribes     and      Socially    and     Educationally           Backward          Classes           for

         6.3   It is stated in the petition that there was no reservation till last

         year for economically weaker sections of the unreserved category for

         admission to educational institutions and for employment and posts

         under the State services, and by the impugned Ordinance which is

         arbitrary and illegal, they are sought to be denied 10%                                 of the

         available seats for the purpose of admission to educational

         institutions. It is the case of the petitioners that such ordinance is

         violative of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15

         and 16 of the Constitution and is arbitrary and runs contrary to the

         constitutional scheme and structure of the Constitution. It is their

         case that equality guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> is one of the basic

         tenets of the Constitution and the State policy and actions for

         admission and employment should be within the framework of such

         constitutional scheme. It is their further say that reservation provided

         under the impugned Ordinance is unreasonable and runs contrary to

         the public interest as it results in sacrifice of merit. It is further case

         of the petitioners that such benefit can be sacrificed only for the

         purpose of reservation as well as for making special provision under

         <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_10">Article   15(4)</a>    or    under   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_11">Article     16(4)</a>        of    the     Constitution            for

         backward classes but not for making any other classification on the

         ground of economic criteria. It is stated that as the Ordinance has

         continued to retain 49% seats, that is, 7% seats for Scheduled Castes,

         15% for Scheduled Tribes and 27% for Socially and Educationally

         Backward Classes, and further 10% reservation is provided for

         economically weaker sections of unreserved category for admission

         to educational institutions, which will come to 59% and rest of the

         communities have to compete only with 41% that will result in

         sacrificing merit and the same is not in larger public interest. While

         referring to case-law on the subject in the case of <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_12">Indra Sawhney

         vs. Union of India</a>, reported in AIR 1993 SC 477 and in the case of

         <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_13">M. Nagaraj &amp; Ors vs. Union of India</a>, reported in AIR 2007 SC 71,

         it is stated that percentage of reservation is contrary to the upper

         ceiling limit fixed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid

         cases. It is further case of the petitioners that as no extraordinary

         jurisdiction existed there as observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in

         the above judgments, compelling the government to breach the

         declaration of law, the impugned Ordinance is fit to be struck down as

         invalid. It is their say that income cannot be the criteria to constitute

         a class for providing reservation to economically weaker section of

         unreserved category and the same is a fraud on the Constitution and

         blatantly violating the rights of the citizens guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article

         14</a> of the Constitution. It is also the say of the petitioners that in the

         absence of any empirical data and material, the Committee

         considered the representations and recommended for reservation

         and such recommendations made are readily accepted by the

         government which resulted in issuance of the impugned Ordinance. In

         6.4   It is also the say of the petitioners that the State Government

         has issued resolutions on 7th October, 2015                         and 5th April, 2016,

         granting benefit to the children whose parents' income is to the

         extent of Rs. 4,50,000/- for the purpose of payment of fees etc and

         without waiting to see the effect, has already issued the impugned

         Ordinance in the absence of any acceptable material on record. On

         the aforesaid grounds, the declaration is sought to set aside the

         impugned ordinance by declaring the same as ultra vires the

         Constitution of India and to restrain the respondent no.1-State from

         enforcing the provisions of the impugned Ordinance No.1 of 2016.

         discrimination in comparison with the higher strata of people who are

         economically sound, and about the resultant inability to compete with

         them in the matters of admissions in educational institutions and in

         the services and posts under the State. There was series of

         representations given to the State Government for doing something

         for the benefit of such economically weaker sections. In view of such

         representations, the State Government appointed a High Level

         Committee      consisting    of   5    Hon'ble        Ministers       by     Government

         Resolution dated 13.8.2015. The said                       High Level Committee

         considered such representations and orally heard various parties for

         providing level playing field in the matter of admission and

         employment. As a result of such consideration, to redress their

         grievances, the State Government issued Government Resolution

         dated 7.10.2015, formulating a policy by providing financial aid to the

         meritorious and needy students on merit-cum-means basis and such

         benefits flowing from the said policy are made admissible to all the

         candidates irrespective of categories. Such policy formulated by

         Government Resolution dated 7.10.2015 was exclusively dealing with

         the grant of financial assistance in the matter of admission and was

         restricted exclusively for meritorious students. The same was

         followed by another Government Resolution dated 5.4.2016 enlarging

         the scope of earlier resolutions so as to cover the Diploma students

         who are aspiring to get admission to recognized degree courses. It is

         which challenge is made to the impugned Ordinance, it is stated that

         the State is enjoined to reach out to more deserving people and the

         task of finding out the most deserving must necessarily be a matter

         of continuous evolution. It is stated that the constitutional reservation

         available to various categories, flowing from Articles 15 and 16 is not

         affected in any manner by the Ordinance and the Ordinance is meant

         only and only for unreserved category covering all the persons not

         which provides for a reasonable classification with reference to

         General/Open/Unreserved category is permissible under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article 14</a>

         6.5.2016 issued by the government read with the Schedule appended

         benefit of the impugned Ordinance, even though their income may be

         less than Rs. 6 lakh per annum. The respondent no.1 has denied the

         allegation of the petitioners that income criteria alone is taken into

         in    AIR 1963 SC 649. It is further pleaded that the Ordinance in

         question provides for only classification/categorization amongst the

         backward classes. Further it is also stated that the Ordinance in

         relatable to <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_21">Article 46</a> of the Constitution and the same is not with

         available in technical courses, it is stated that as the demand is less

         than available seats and there is no reason for providing reservation

         to such courses, as such, that itself shows non-application of mind for

         issuance of the impugned Ordinance and its applicability to

         technology courses. While referring to the provisions under <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_26">Article 46</a>

         of the Constitution, it is pleaded that economically weaker sections do

         not constitute homogeneous class for the purpose of effecting

         reservation. As there is no certain likeness or common strait who are

         identified   by    some       common       attribute       such      as     status,      rank,

         occupation, residence in the locality, race, religion and like, they

         cannot be construed as class for the purpose of effecting reservation.

         pleaded that the same also cannot be treated as a source for making

         admissions to the educational institutions.

         material on record and submits that impugned Ordinance providing

         for reservation of 10% of seats in educational institutions in the State

         and of appointments and posts in the services under the State in

         favour of the Economically Weaker Sections of unreserved category,

         violates the equality clause under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14</a> of the Constitution; no

         classification can be made based on income criteria for the purpose

         of admission into educational institutions and for employment and

         such classification offends <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> of the Constitution; while

         effecting such reservation, the State has overlooked the merit criteria

         for admissions into various important educational courses and for the

         purpose of employment in the services under the State Government;

         economically weaker section of society as contemplated under the

         impugned Ordinance No. 1 of 2016 does not constitute either a class

         or source for the purpose of effecting reservation. According to the

         learned Senior Advocate, in the absence of any extraordinary

         situation, the State has exceeded the maximum cap of 50% of

         reservation and thus, the impugned Ordinance is contrary to the

         authoritative judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the other

         judgments of this Court.

         income    criteria       is    already        disapproved           by     the      authoritative

         pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_40">Indra Sawhney

         v. Union of India</a>, reported in 1992 Suppl. 3 SCC 217. Reservation

         posts in the services under the State in favour of economically

         weaker sections of unreserved category provided in the impugned

         under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_41">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. According to the learned

         counsel, a class which is sought to be created on the ground of

         economic criteria cannot constitute homogeneous class at all for the

         purpose of reservation. In any event, the reservation to the extent of

         10% exceeds 50% of reservation cap determined by the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court in the judgment in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra)

         Ordinance is illegal and arbitrary and is fit to be struck down as the

         same runs contrary to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It

         is further contended by Mr. Mehta that neither the Parliament nor the

         State Legislature can make any law that runs counter to the law

         declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The impugned Ordinance is

         contrary to the judgment declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

         the case of Indra Sawhney (supra) and others. The reservation which

         is sought to be provided is not covered either under Articles 15 and

         16 or under <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_42">Article 46</a> of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that

         such reservation offends Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of

         India. The economically weaker sections of unreserved category are

         heterogeneous and therefore, such reservation is illegal and arbitrary.

         In support of his argument that <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_43">Article 46</a> will not confer any right on

         the State to make reservation to economically weaker sections of

         unreserved category, Mr. Mehta placed reliance on the case of <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_44">State

         of Madras v. Sm. Champakam Dorairajan</a>, reported in AIR 1951

         SC 226. In any event, if there is any clash between the fundamental

         rights and directive principles, the fundamental rights guaranteed to

         the citizens under Articles 14, 15 and 16 cannot be emasculated. It is

         also   pleaded        that   there     cannot         be      any       presumption             of

         constitutionality in favour of         the Ordinance/Legislation when such

         legislation or Ordinance is ex facie contrary to fundamental rights

         guaranteed to the citizens under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_45">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of

         Advocate General, pointed out the following facts leading to passing

         of the impugned Ordinance.
</p>
<p id="p_102">

         16.1 In June-July 2015, various weaker sections of society not

         belonging to reserved categories of SC, ST and SEBC, expressed a

         feeling about they being subjected to discrimination in comparison

         with higher strata of people who are economically sound and

         resultant inability to compete with them in the matter of admission in

         educational institutions and in the services and posts under the State.

         Following this, the State Government appointed a High Level

         Committee consisting of 7 Ministers vide G.R. dated 13.08.2015. The

         said    Committee,        after    considering           the       grievance,           made

         recommendations.
</p>
<p id="p_103">

         16.2 Pursuant to such recommendations, the government issued

         Government Resolution dated 07.10.2015, whereby general policy

         was formulated, inter alia, providing for financial aid to the

         meritorious and needy students on merit-cum-means basis. The

         benefits flowing from the said policy are made admissible to all the

         students irrespective of categories. On 05.04.2016, the government

         issued another Government Resolution, enlarging the scope of the

         earlier Government Resolution dated 07.10.2015 so as to cover the

         Diploma Students, who are aspiring to get admission in the

         recognized degree courses. Despite having taken the aforesaid

         measures, there was still a general feeling of dissatisfaction amongst

         the economically weaker sections of the society that the policy

         contained     in    both   the   aforesaid         Resolutions          needs        further

         strengthening by expanding its scope and purview.



         16.3 On       11.03.2016, a High Power Committee was constituted

         consisting of five Hon'ble Ministers. The said Committee considered

         number      of     representations       and       ultimately          made          certain

         recommendations.

         element of unemployment, economic criteria, etc., request was made

         to His Excellency Governor for promulgation of Ordinance.



         16.5 On 01.05.2016, the impugned Ordinance was promulgated in

         and 16 of the Constitution of India, it is submitted that such

         reservations are class centric and the classification which is made

         under the provisions is not based on such castes and communities,

         but the same is issued only with a view to promote the economically

         weaker sections of unreserved category as it was found that they are

         not able to compete with the economically rich in the field of

         education and employment. By making such classification, reserved

         category is not at all affected and the classification applies only to the

         area which is not covered by earlier reservation made under Articles

         15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

         18.1           It is the contention of the learned Advocate General that

         the Ordinance in question is issued to translate the constitutional

         philosophy provided under the directive principles of the State Policy

         as laid down under Articles 38, 39(b) and 46 of the Constitution of

         India, which inter alia mandates the State to effect economic

         empowerment of the weaker sections of the society. Such Ordinance

         satisfies the twin test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_50">Article 14</a>, viz. it is based on intelligible

         differentia, and it has nexus with the object sought to be achieved as

         discernible from the Ordinance that it promotes economically weaker

         sections belonging to unreserved category of citizens in the matters

         of admissions and appointments. The judgment in the case of Indra

         Sawhney (supra) is with reference to the situation prevailing at the

         time of submission of the Mandal Commission's Report on 31.12.1980

         which has recognized as many as 3743 castes as socially and

<p id="p_110">

         18.2           It is further submission of the learned Advocate General

         that a period of 36 years since the submission of the Mandal

         Commission Report and 24 years since the rendition of the judgment

         of the Apex Court in the said case, has passed by and even as per the

         said report, the same was to be reviewed after 20 years. Therefore,

         time has come for adopting new practices, methods and yardsticks by

         moving away from caste-centric definition of backward class as

         observed by the Apx Court in the case of <a href="/doc/33182715/" id="a_51">Ram, Singh v. Union of

         India</a>, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 697. In any event, as the judgment

         in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra) was only with reference to

         backward classes as referred in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_52">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution, as

         such, now having regard to lapse of time and as it was found that

         economically weaker sections of the society are not able to get their

         due share in admissions and appointments, impugned Ordinance is

         issued by making reasonable classification which does not offend

         equality clause of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_53">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and the same

         is also in conformity with Articles 38, 39(b) and 46 of the Constitution.

         categories flowing from Articles 15 and 16 is not affected in any

         manner by the impugned Ordinance and the impugned Ordinance is

         meant only and only for unreserved category covering all persons not

         falling within the reserved categories of SC, ST and SEBC.



         19.2           Similarly, no question arises with regard to the alleged

         violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_54">Article 14</a> of the Constitution because reasonable

         classification in the open/unreserved category of citizens is always

         permissible, when there is a rationale behind the said classification to

         the extent of 10%, which has nexus to the object sought to be

         achieved. Learned Advocate General referred the comparative chart

         of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_55">Article 15</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_56">Article 16</a> of the Constitution of India.



         19.3 It is submitted that <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_57">Article 46</a> of the Constitution of India deals

         with directive principles of State policy and provides that the State

         shall promote with special care, the educational and economic

         interest of the people from weaker sections. A concept of 'weaker

         section' in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_58">Article 46</a> has no limitation, inasmuch as the individuals

         belonging to the weaker sections may not form a class and they may

         be weaker as individuals only. In this regard, the learned Advocate

         General referred to relevant paragraphs of the decision of the Apex

         Court in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra)



         19.4           Provision of the Ordinance providing for reasonable

         Constitution of India. Learned Advocate General also referred to

         <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_61">Article 38</a> and <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_62">Article 39(b)</a> of the Constitution of India in this regard.



         19.5             Even assuming that the Ordinance in question is relatable

         to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_63">Article 16(1)</a> of the Constitution, then in that case also the

         classification to the extent of 10% in the general/unreserved category

         of    citizens    of   the    State    in    the       matters      of    admissions              and

         appointments cannot be said to be based on economic criteria alone

         and     therefore      such    a   classification          would       be     a    reasonable

         classification under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_64">Article 16(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.



</p><p id="p_113">         19.6             Ordinance            in          question               provides                 for

         classification/categorization amongst the open category to the extent

         of 10%, which is not 'reservation' as provided under Articles 15(4)

         and 16(4) of the Constitution of India, meant for SC, ST, SEBC and

         other backward classes. The said classification to the extent of 10% is

         relatable to <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_65">Article 46</a> of the Constitution. Thus, so far as the

         contention regarding non-permissibility of crossing 50% ceiling is

         concerned, even in case of 'backward classes' under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_66">Article 16(4)</a> of

         the Constitution, the reservation can exceed the said ceiling of 50% if

         the facts and circumstances of the case so warrant. In support of his

         submission, the learned Advocate General referred to the case of

         Indra Sawhney (supra).

         19.7            In the present case, the Ordinance in question does not

         deal with the reservation provided under Articles 15(4) or 16(4) of the

         Constitution, whereas rule of 50% ceiling is confined to reservations

         made under the said Articles.
</p>
<p id="p_115">

         19.8            By the impugned Ordinance, reservation for various

         categories like SC, ST and SEBC has not been touched and therefore

         the said Ordinance does not seek to enhance the percentage of

         backward        classes      contemplated        under        <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_67">Article       16(4)</a>       of       the

         translating      the       constitutional    philosophy          flowing        from     various

         provisions of the directive principles of State policy is not related to

         the 'reservation' as contemplated under Articles 15 and 16 of the

         Constitution and when there is no determination of any SEBC or other

         backward classes, the question does not arise for any empirical

         study. Learned Advocate General referred to pages 2, 24, 26, 27, 56,

         58, 70, 72, 88 and 92 of the Report of Justice Rane Commission in this

         regard. Learned Advocate General relied upon the decision rendered

         by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1759197/" id="a_68">K.G.Vasantha Kumar

         &amp; Anr. v. State of Karnataka</a>, reported in 1985 (supp) SCC

         714, more particularly para 2, 24 to 31, 79, 80, 82 and 84.



         19.11           Earmarking/classification               of     10%         in      favour         of

         economically weaker sections belonging to unreserved category of

         citizens in the matters of admissions and appointments under the

         Ordinance in question is not a 'vertical reservation' as contemplated

         under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_69">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution since it does not deal with SC,

         ST, SEBC or other backward classes. It is also not a 'horizontal

         reservation' under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_70">Article 16(1)</a> since it does not cut across the

         'vertical reservation' as it happens in case of other 'horizontal

         reservations' like reservation in cases of physically handicapped

         persons, women, army personnel, project affected families, etc.

         conduct of empirical study as was done by Mandal Commission.

         However, such detailed empirical study is not required in the matter

         of effecting classification under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_71">Article 14</a> of the Constitution which

         needs to satisfy only twin test being based on intelligible differentia

         and having reasonable nexus with the object of the Ordinance, to be

         achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_118">

         19.13           What is necessary for reasonable classification under

         <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_72">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is that there must be a nexus between

         the basis of classification and the object of the Act under

         consideration.       In    the   present     case,      promotion         of interest           of

         economically weaker sections belonging to unreserved category of

         citizens in the matter of admissions and appointments is the objective

         of the impugned Ordinance which is required to be achieved.



         19.14           Mere use of the word 'reservation', per se, does not have

         the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism

         underlying the Constitutional concept of a protective reservation.



         19.15           The rule of ceiling of 50% applies only to reservation in

         favour of backward classes made under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_73">Article 16(4)</a> of the

         Constitution. In the present case, earmarking/classification to the

         extent of 10% in favour of economically weaker sections belonging to

         unreserved category of citizens is not falling under the purview of

         Articles 15(4) or 16(4) of the Constitution. Hence, the same is not in

         addition to the reservation to the extent of 27% in favour of SEBC or

         in addition to 7% and 15% in favour of SC and ST respectively.



         19.16           Homogeneity of the class of citizens is inevitable for

         determining Social and Educational Backwardness as refereed to

         under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_74">Article 15(4)</a> where the words 'Class of Citizen' immediately

         following the expression 'Socially and Educationally' are used.

         However, this test of homogeneous class is not applicable in the

         matter of classification under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_75">Article 14</a> of larger category of citizens

         belonging to unreserved category in contradiction with the citizens

</p><p id="p_133">         20.           Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned Sr. Advocate assisted by Ms

         Amrita Thakore, learned counsel for respondent nos. 6 to 9 in Special

         Civil Application No.8655 of 2016 would contend that as per the

         constitutional scheme, Articles 15(4), 16(4),(4A) and 4(B) of the

         Constitution of India alone provide for                     reservation and the

         reservation and the impugned ordinance providing 10% reservation

         for the purpose of admission in educational institutions, in the

         services and in the employment, are only classification traceable to

         power under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_91">Article 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_92">Article 16</a> of the Constitution of

         India. According to Mr. Thakore, classification in respect of admission

         is permissible under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_93">Article 14</a>, while in respect of employment, it is

         permissible under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_94">Article 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_95">Article 16(1)</a>                               of the

         Constitution. It is contended that when such classification meets the

         twin criteria of test under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_96">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, it is

         permissible for the State to bring such ordinance. Reservation

         contemplated by ordinance is not reservation in true and strict sense,

         but it is classification permissible under the constitutional scheme. It

         is also contended that while interpreting the constitutional provision,

         there cannot be blanket proposition that classification done on the

         basis of income is per se illegal and ultra vires the Constitution of

         India. Such criteria for classification will have to be tested on the

         basis of objectives sought to be achieved by such Act and ordinance.

         Shivani Rajpurohit, appearing for respondent no.5, by taking us to

         various clauses in the ordinance, submitted that the State of Gujarat

         has issued ordinance for reserving 10% of available seats for

         admission in educational institutions and in services and posts under

         the State, only to strike balance of reservation in SC, ST and ECBC

         and unreserved category of people. It is submitted that such

         ordinance is issued to protect the citizens from social injustice and to

         avoid exploitation by the rich against the persons belonging to

         economically weaker sections of the society. It is submitted that such

         reservation of 10% under the ordinance is not a quota, but is an

         additional requirement amongst the general category of people

         within 51% and such classification is extended only to the weaker

         sections of 51% people without touching the communal reservation of

         49%    under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is

         submitted that such ordinance is issued in conformity with Articles 14

         and 46 of the Constitution. By referring to the provision under <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_117">Article

         46</a> of the Constitution of India, it is submitted by the learned counsel

         that it is the duty of the welfare state to promote the educational and

         economic interest of SC, ST and also other weaker sections of the

         society. It is further contended that it is an obligation on the State to

         apply all directive principles under the Constitution of India for

         making laws. Learned counsel places reliance upon the judgment of

         the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_118">State of Madras vs.

         Champakam Dorairajan</a>, reported in AIR 1951 SC 226 and also

</p><p id="p_149">         956. Thus, it is submitted that this Court may not entirely ignore the

         directive principles and the State Policy laid down in Part-IV of the

         Constitution,     but    should   adopt       the     principles        of    harmonious

         construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as

         possible. Placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

         Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1939993/" id="a_119">Minerva Mills Ltd v. Union of India</a>, reported

         in (1980) 3 SCC 625, it is contended by the learned counsel that

         directive principles of Chapter-IV impose an obligation on the State to

         take positive action for creating socio-economic conditions in which

         there will be an egalitarian social order with social and economic

         justice to all. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the judgment of

         the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/63489929/" id="a_120">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v.

         Union of India</a>, reported in (2008) 6 SCC 1, in support of his

         argument that when a constitutional provision is interpreted, the

         cardinal rule is to look to the Preamble to the Constitution as the

         guiding star and directive principles of the Sate Policy as the book of

         interpretation. Learned counsel placed reliance on the publication of

         the Indian Constitution, Cornerstone of a Nation, published by Oxford

         University Press, wherein, author has discussed about the rights and

         obligations with reference to fundamental rights and directive

         principles under the State Policy.

         Advocate, in his reply-argument contends that the impugned

         ordinance provides reservation to the extent of 10% to the

         economically weaker sections of the society in the educational

         institutions and services and posts under the State. When the

         language is clear from the ordinance/legislative document, there is no

         reason to read such reservation as a classification as explained by

         the learned counsel appearing for the respondents. It is submitted

         that it is well-settled principle that when language is plain and

         unambiguous, it is to be read as it is but not to interpret in a manner

         contrary to the legislative intent. The said ordinance is issued for

         indefinite period        and is not temporary measure for any particular

         period and also not a source for the purpose of effecting reservation.

         judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indra Sawhney

         (supra).What cannot be the criteria for the purpose of reservation

         under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_127">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution can equally be applied for the

         purpose of reservation of 10% quota in unreserved category to

         economically weaker sections         of the society and the same is

         violative of equality clause under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_128">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

         Economic criteria cannot be construed as homogeneous clause for

         the purpose of reservation. Ordinance is issued based on the report of

         the Committee constituted by the government and there was no data

         before the Committee and the Committee has not considered the

         financial assistance granted earlier by the government to the

         students belonging to economically weaker sections of the society. In

         the absence of any quantifiable data before the Committee, the

         Committee constituted by the government just based on the

         representations pending before it, recommended reservation of 10%

         to the economically weaker sections of the society and based on such

         recommendations of the Committee, the impugned ordinance is

         issued. Thus, such ordinance is illegal, arbitrary and cannot stand the

         legal scrutiny as it violates the principles to meet the requirement

         under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_129">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel in

         support of his arguments also placed reliance on the following

<p id="p_152">         23.           Mr. S.N. Shelat, learned Sr. Advocate, would contend that

         the impugned ordinance clearly provides reservation of 10% quota to

         economically weaker sections and the same cannot be construed as a

         classification as projected by the learned Advocate General on behalf

         of the State of Gujarat. In support of his argument, he placed reliance

         on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/508231/" id="a_132">State of

         Madhya Pradesh v. Union of India</a>, reported in (2003) 7 SCC 83. It is

         submitted that income criteria can never be the criteria for the

         purpose of grouping persons with income less than Rs.6 lakh to a

         class for the purpose of effecting reservation. Reliance is placed in

         this connection on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

         case of <a href="/doc/1461661/" id="a_133">Deepak Sibal v. Punjab University and another</a>,

         petitions, submitted that the impugned ordinance providing for 10%

         reservation to economical weaker sections is vertical reservation

         based on economic criteria only. In support of his argument, learned

         counsel placed on record the Admission Prospectus, 2016-17 issued

         for giving Admissions to Medical Educational Courses for academic

         years 2016-17, issued by the Chairman of Admission Committee for

         Professional Medical Educational Courses and submitted that quota of

         10% for economical weaker sections is clearly shown under the

         heading of "reservation of seats along with Scheduled Castes,

         Scheduled Tribes, Socially &amp; Educationally Backward Class and

         Economical Weaker Sections", in the ratio of 7%, 15%, 27% and 10%

         respectively. In that view of the matter, it is clear that what is

         provided in the impugned ordinance is only reservation to class of

         persons who are having income of less than Rs.6 Lakhs. The learned

         counsel would contend that income criteria cannot be the criteria for

         the purpose of effecting reservations and while pleading that same

         runs contrary to the authoritative pronouncements of the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court in various judgments, it is submitted that if such

         income criteria is allowed for the purpose of reservation, then some

         people may try to reduce their income purposefully so as to gain the

         benefit of such reservation. Reservation to the reserved categories

         viz. SC, ST, SEBC, women, Physically Handicapped, Army personnel

         etc is definite one where there is no scope for variation, but whereas

         if income criteria is shown for the purpose of reservation, the same is

         a fluctuating factor which cannot be the basis for reservation.

         Learned counsel would also contend that even assuming that it is a

         classification as projected on behalf of the State, the same is not

         based on any intelligible differentia and there is no reasonable

         classification for such ordinance. It is issued on the basis of the

         recommendation of the Committee of the Hon'ble Ministers in the

         absence of any empirical study, there was no material at all before

         the Committee of Hon'ble Ministers which was constituted to consider

         the   representations     and    High-Powered             Committee           has      made

         recommendations in the absence of any quantifiable data for the

         purpose of recommending reservations. Such reservation which is

         ordered by the impugned ordinance is whimsical and is a fraud on the

         Constitution. Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgments of the

         Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1934185/" id="a_134">Atyant Pichhara Barg

         Chhatra      Sangh       and    Anr.     v.       Jharkhand          State        Vaishya

         (2014) 5 SCC 438. It is also contended that in any event, if the

         impugned ordinance is allowed to be given effect to, it exceeds the

         reservation of more than 50% ceiling limit which is fixed by the

         Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra). As it is

         there are reservations for various categories to the tune of 49% and if

         further reservation of 10% is allowed, it will be 59%, leaving the

         balance of only 41% for general category and thus, results in denial

         of equal opportunity for meritorious personnel in the matter of

         admissions in educational institutions and in the services and posts

         24.1            It is submitted by the learned counsel that economic

         criteria adopted for the purpose of distinguishing the creamy layer

         within backward classes cannot be the criteria for the purpose of

         determining the economically weaker sections having annual income

         below the limit of Rs.6 lakhs as a class for the purpose of effecting

         reservations. All the families having annual income below Rs.6 lakh

         cannot be treated as homogeneous                     class in absence of empirical

         study. Rane Commission              is constituted only for the purpose of

         identification of socially and educationally backward classes to

         extend the benefits under Articles 16(49) of the Constitution and the

         report of the said Rane Commission is not acted upon by the

         government and its recommendations are also confined only for the

         purpose of extending benefits of reservations to Socially and

         Educationally Backward Classes for providing benefits under Articles

         16(4)      of     the      Constitution.      It      is    submitted           that       such

         ratio decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indra

         Sawhney (supra) has to be applied to test the validity of the

         impugned ordinance. It is submitted that if implementation of such

         ordinance is allowed, it will amount to overlooking the merit. Lastly, it

         is submitted that so-called representations which were taken into

         consideration and placed before the Committee cannot be the basis

         for issuing ordinance and such representations and the steps taken

         by the Committee on such representations can be starting point to

         examine the issue and such representations themselves cannot be

         the sole material and basis for making recommendations for

         reservations.        As         the       High-Powered               Committee               made

         recommendations, it is not the basis of any quantifiable data and

         petitioners, Mr. Kamal B.Trivedi, learned Advocate General further

         contended that even in the judgment in the case of Indra

         criteria cannot be the criteria for the purpose of identification of

         backward classes, cannot be construed as ratio decidendi as much as

         the same is contrary to the view of the majority in the judgment.

         Further, by referring to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

         the case of <a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_139">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>,

         reported in (1995) 5 SCC 403, it is submitted that in the aforesaid

         judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has approved the economic

         criteria for the purpose of identifying the creamy layer by approving

         the rule of exclusion framed by the Government of India under para

         2(c) read with the Schedule of Office Memorandum quoted in the

         aforesaid judgment. It is submitted that when such criteria is

         accepted for determination of creamy layer, economic criteria can be

         the criteria for the purpose of identifying a class within the

         economically weaker sections for giving the benefit of reservation of

         10% seats in educational institutions and in appointments and posts

         in the services under the State. Placing reliance on the judgment of

         class, can be identified based on economical backwardness. In this

         regard, emphasis is laid by the learned Advocate General on para-23

         of the aforesaid judgment. Further placing reliance on the judgment

         of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/190245590/" id="a_142">Rajeev Kumar Gupta

         v. Union of India</a>, reported in (2016) 2                  SCC 445, the learned

         Advocate General would contend that the principles laid down in the

         case of Indra Sawhney (supra) are applicable only when the State

         seeks to give preferential treatment in the matter of employment

         under the State to certain classes of citizens identified to be a

         backward class. As such, it is submitted that class is identified based

         on the economic criteria to extend the benefit for admissions in

         educational institutions and appointments and posts in services under

         the State and therefore, no empirical study is required to be made.

         unreserved category is permissible, it is pleaded in the affidavit in

         reply filed on behalf of the respondent no.1-State of Gujarat that it is

         only a classification and in stricto sensu, it is not reservation for

         Socially and Educationally Backward Classes as provided under

         Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Even during the course

         of arguments, the learned Advocate General, appearing on behalf of

         the State of Gujarat, specifically argued that such Ordinance is issued

         only for making a reasonable classification to provide reasonable

         opportunities to the economically weaker sections of unserved

         category and it meets the twin test, to examine, whether the same is

         in breach of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_145">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. It is contended by

         the learned Advocate General that merely because the word

         "reservation" is used in the impugned Ordinance, the same cannot be

         treated as the reservation but, the same is classification, and it

         withstands the legal scrutiny under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_146">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of

         India and the same is to be construed as reasonable classification,

         within the class of unreserved category. On the other hand, it is

         submitted by Shri S.N. Shelat as well as Mr. Mehta, learned counsel

         appearing on behalf of the petitioners that when the legislative intent

         28.3           It is clear from the background facts and the contents of

         the Report which led to issuance of the impugned Ordinance and

         various clauses in the Ordinance that what is provided is 10% of seats

         in educational institutions and in appointments and posts in the

         services under the State to economically weaker sections of

         unreserved category is nothing but reservation and not classification.

         Even if dictionery meaning of reservation is seen, the reservation is

         nothing but an act of booking, kept blank, destined for                    a particular

         specific       number of seats/posts available to unreserved category

         are reserved for economically weaker sections. As it is clear from the

         same that every candidate belonging to unreserved community

         cannot compete with the quota of 10%, such allocation of 10% is

         nothing but reservation. From the reading of various clauses in the

         government, it is clear that only such of the candidates having family

                It is now well established that while <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_157">Art. 14</a> forbids class
                legislation it does not forbid reasonable classification for the
                purposes of legislation and that in order to pass the rest of
                permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled,
                namely, (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible
                different which distinguishes persons or things that are
                grouped together from others left out of the group and (ii) such
                differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to
                be achieved by the statute in question. The classification, it has
                been held, may be founded on different bases, namely,
                geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like
                and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between
                the basis of classification and the object of the Act under
                consideration. The pronouncements of this Court further
                establish, amongst other things, that there is always a
                presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment

         the presumption of constitutionality the Court may take into
         consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of
         common report, the history of the times and may assume
         every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time
         of legislation. We, therefore, proceed to examine the impugned
         Acts in the light of the principles thus enunciated by this Court.

</p><p id="p_182">         16. The impugned Acts, it may be recalled, have been made by
         the States in discharge of the obligations imposed on them by
         <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_158">Art. 48.</a> In order to implement the directive principles the
         respective Legislatures enacted the impugned Acts in exercise
         of the powers conferred on them by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_159">Art. 246</a> read with entry 15
         in List II of the Seventh Schedule. It is, therefore, quite clear
         that the objects sought to be achieved by the impugned Acts
         are the preservation, protection and improvement of
         livestock's. Cows, bulls, bullocks and calves of cows are no
         doubt the most important cattle for the agricultural economy of
         this country. Female buffaloes yield a large quantity of milk and
         are therefore, well looked after and do not need as much
         protection as cows yielding a small quantity of milk require. As
         draught cattle male buffaloes are not half as useful as bullocks.
         Sheep and goat give very little milk compared to the cows and
         the female buffaloes and have practically no utility as draught
         animals. These different categories of animals being
         susceptible of classification into separate groups on the basis
         of their usefulness to society the butchers who kill each
         category may also be placed in distinct classes according to the
         effect produced on society by the carrying on of their
         respective occupations. Indeed the butchers, who kill cattle,
         according to the allegations of the petitioners themselves in
         their respective petitions, form a well defined class based on
         their occupation. That classification is based on an intelligible
         differentia which places them in a well defined class and
         distinguishes them from those who kill goats and sheep and
         this different has a close connection with the object sought to
         be achieved by the impugned Act, namely, the preservation,
         protection and improvement of our livestock. The attainment of
         these objectives may well necessitate that the slaughters of
         cattle should be dealt with more stringently than the
         slaughterers of, say, goats and sheep. The impugned Acts,
         therefore have adapted a classification on sound and
         intelligible basis and can quite clearly stand the test laid down
         in the decisions of this Court. Whatever objections there may
         be against the validity of the impugned Acts the denial of equal
         protection of the laws does not prima facie, appear to us to be
         one of them. In any case, bearing in mind the presumption of
         constitutionality attaching to all enactments founded on the
         recognition by the Court of the fact that the legislature
         correctly appreciates the needs of its own people there appears

         whether it has a reasonable relation with the object for which
         the rules for admission are made. Rules for admission are
         inevitable so long as the demand of every candidate seeking
         admission cannot be complied with in view of the paucity of
         institutions imparting training in such subjects as medicine. The
         definition of a 'political sufferer' being a detailed one and in
         certain terms, it would be easily possible to distinguish children
         of such political sufferers from the rest as possessing the
         criteria laid down by the definition. The object of the rules for
         admission can obviously be to secure a fair and equitable
         distribution of seats amongst those seeking admission and who
         are eligible under the University Regulations. Such distribution
         can be on the principle that admission should be available to
         the best and the most meritorious. But an equally fair and
         equitable principle would also be that which secures admission
         in a just proportion to those who are handicapped and who, but
         for the preferential treatment given to them, would not stand a
         chance against those who are not so handicapped and are,
         therefore in a superior position. The principle underlying <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_163">Article
         15 (4)</a> is that a preferential treatment can validly be given
         because the socially and educationally backward classes need
         it, so that in course of time they stand in equal position with
         the more advanced sections of the society. It would not in any
         way be improper, if that principle were also to be applied to
         those who are handicapped but do not fall under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_164">Article 15(4).</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_186">         It is on such a principle that reservation for children of Defence
         personnel and Ex-Defence personnel appears to have been
         upheld. The criteria for such reservation is that those serving in
         the Defence forces or those who had so served are and were at
         a disadvantage in giving education to their children since they
         had to live, while discharging their duties, in difficult places
         where normal facilities available elsewhere are and were not
         available. In our view it is not unreasonable to extend that
         principle to the children of political sufferers who in
         consequence of their participation in the emancipation struggle
         became unsettled in life; in some cases economically ruined
         and were therefore not in a position to make available to their
         children that class of education which would place them in fair
         competition with the children of those who did not suffer from
         that disadvantage. If that be so, it must follow that the
         definition of 'political sufferer' not only makes the children of
         such sufferers distinguishable from the rest but such a
         classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the
         rules which can be nothing else than a fair and just distribution
         of seats. In our view neither of the two contentions raised by
         counsel for the petitioner can be accepted with the result that
         the writ petition fails and is dismissed."

         28.8           All the aforesaid judgments relate to classification into

         categories and groups. In all the cases referred above, the issue fell

         for consideration was whether such categorisation, reservation

         university wise was within the scope of reasonable classification and

         meets the requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_165">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The

         meaning, scope and effect of Articles 14 which is the equal protection

         clause in our Constitution, has been explained by                           the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court in series of decisions. It is fairly well settled that while

         <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_166">Article 14</a> forbids class legislation and it does not forbid reasonable

         classification for the purposes of legislation and that in order to pass

         the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled,

         namely, (i)      the classification    must be founded on an intelligible

         differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped

         together from others left out of the group and (ii) such differentia

         must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by

         the statute in question. By applying the above practice, such

         classification and categorisation was held to be reasonable in the

         above cases. Setting apart 10% of seats to weaker sections of

         unreserved category is a classification or reservation is addressed by

         us separately. By drawing distinction between the classification and

         reservation, we have already held that by the impugned Ordinance

         what is allocated separate quota of 10% seats in educational

         institutions and in appointments and posts in the services under the

         State is reservation but not classification.

                         between them. In short, while <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_174">Article 14</a> forbids class

                 legislature for the purpose of attaining specific ends. What is

                 in mind certain well established principles which have been
                 evolved by the courts as rules of guidance in discharge of its
                 constitutional function of judicial review. The first rule is that
                 there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality
                 of a statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show
                 that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional
                 principles. This rule is based on the assumption, judicially
                 recognised and accepted, that the legislature understands and
                 correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, its laws are
                 directed to problems made menifest by experience and its
                 discrimination are based on adequate grounds. The
                 presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in
                 order to sustain it, the Court may take into consideration
                 matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, the

         category itself is a class and it is not open for the State to issue any

         order either by legislative action or by issuing executive order to

         effect the reservation on the ground that part of section in that

         category is economically weak. While extending the benefit of

         reservation to the socially and economically backward class and for

         removal of creamy layer, economic criterion can also be looked into.

         But it is not open for the State to make any reservation for section of

         citizens in unreserved category, only on the ground that section of

         such category of citizens belong to economically weak. As the

         economically weaker sections among unreserved category cannot

         constitute as homogeneous group for the purpose of reservation and

         such reservation will not withstand to the scrutiny of twin test under

         being fluctuating issue, the same cannot be the basis for any

         classification for the purpose of affirmative action for admission to

         educational institutions and while filling up the posts in the services

         under the State. Thus, such Ordinance which itself is issued based on

         economic criteria and as the same is in breach of equality clause

         under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_200">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, it is to be declared as void in

         direction of destruction of caste structure. To the extent of

                reference to economic criterion. It may be a consideration or
                basis along with and in addition to social backwardness, but it
                can never be the sole criterion. This is the view uniformly taken
                by this Court and we respectfully agree with the same."


         29.9           In the said judgment, out of 9 Hon'ble Judges, 8 Hon'ble

         Judges were of the same view and there was dissenting judgment by

         one of the Hon'ble Judges. Even the extent of percent of reservation

         in the aforesid judgment was addressed under Question 6(a) and (b)

         with reference to reservation under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_209">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution

         and it was answered that reservation contemplated under clause (4)

         of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_210">Article 16</a> should not exceed 50%. Paragraphs 809 and 810 of the

         majority judgment read as under:

                that follows is that the reservations contemplated in clause (4)
                of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_211">Article 16</a> should not exceed 50%.

                that in farflung and remote areas the population inhabiting
                those areas might, on account of their being out of the

                and characteristical to them, need to be treated in a different
                way, some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative.
                In doing so, extreme caution is to be exercised and a special

<p id="p_201">         Thus, it is clear that in the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme

         Court has held that economic criteria cannot be the criterion for the

         regard to cap of percentage of reservation, from the above said

         judgment, it is clear that reservation cannot exceed 50% and 50%

         shall be the rule. Exception is carved out only in certain extraordinary

         situation, as referred in the above paragraph, to make some

         departure by some relaxation. As we do not find any such

         extraordinary        circumstance      for    making         departure         to    50%        of

         is to be noted that when the economic criterion cannot be the sole

         basis for determination of Socially and Economically Backward Class

         of citizens under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, equally                           it

         cannot be accepted that such criteria adopted by the respondent-

         State is for giving effect of allocation of 10% reservation in

         educational institutions and in services to the economically weaker

         sections of unreserved category. What cannot be accepted as criteria

         to extend the benefit under Articles 15 and 16, can by all force

               to the extent of reservation, is an inroad on the right of others
               to work and to learn. <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_216">Article 47</a> recognises the improvement of

               obligation of the State towards the weaker segments of the

         primary level betrays bigwigs' desire to keep the crippled
         crippled for ever. Rabindra Nath Tagore's vision of a free India
         cannot be complete unless "knowledge is free" and "tireless
         striving stretches its arms towards perfection". Almost a
         quarter century after the people of India have given the
         Constitution unto themselves, a chapter on fundamental duties
         came to be incorporated in the Constitution. Fundamental
         duties, as defined in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_217">Article 51A</a>, are not made enforceable by a
         writ of Court just as the fundamental rights are, but it cannot
         be lost sight of that 'duties' in Part IVA - <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_218">Article 5lA</a> are prefixed
         by the same word 'fundamental' which was prefixed by the
         founding fathers of the Constitution to 'rights' in Para III. Every
         citizen of India is fundamentally obligated to develop the
         scientific temper and humanism. He is fundamentally duty
         bound to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual
         and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to
         higher levels of endeavour and achievements. State is, all the
         citizens placed together and hence though <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_219">Article 51A</a> does not
         expressly cast any fundamental duty on the State, the fact
         remains that the duty of every citizen of India is the collective
         duty of the State. Any reservation, apart from being sustainable
         on the constitutional anvil, must also be reasonable to be
         permissible. In assessing the reasonability one of the factors to
         be taken into consideration would be - whether the character
         and quantum of reservation would stall or accelerate achieving
         the ultimate goal of excellence enabling the nation constantly
         rising to higher levels. In the era of globalisation, where the
         nation as a whole has to compete with other nations of the
         world so as to survive, excellence cannot be given an
         unreasonable go by and certainly not compromised in its
         entirety. Fundamental duties though not enforceable by a writ
         of the Court, yet provide a valuable guide and aid to
         interpretation of constitutional and legal issues. In case of
         doubt or choice; people's wish as manifested through <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_220">Article
         51-A</a>, can serve as a guide not only for resolving the issue but
         also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the
         Courts. Constitutional enactment of fundamental duties, if it
         has to have any meaning, must be used by Courts as a tool to
         tab, even a taboo, on State action drifting away from
         constitutional values.

<p id="p_207">         Conclusion

</p><p id="p_208">         53. The upshot of the above discussion is that institutional
         reservation is not supported by the Constitution or
         constitutional principles. A certain degree of preference for
         students of the same Institution intending to prosecute further
         studies therein is permissible on grounds of convenience,
         suitability and familiarity with an educational environment.

         Such preference has to be reasonable and not excessive. The
         preference has to be prescribed without making an excessive
         or substantial departure from the rule of merit and equality. It
         has to be kept within limits. Minimum standards cannot be so
         diluted as to become practically non-existent. Such marginal
         institutional preference is tolerable at post-graduation level but
         is rendered intolerable at still higher levels such as that of
         super-speciality. In the case of institutions of national
         significance such as AIIMS additional considerations against
         promoting reservation or preference of any kind destructive of
         merit become relevant. One can understand a reasonable
         reservation or preference being provided for at the initial stage
         of medical education, i.e., under-graduate level while seeking
         entry into the institute. It cannot be forgotten that the medical
         graduates of AIIMS are not 'sons of the soil'. They are drawn
         from all over the country. They have no moorings in Delhi. They
         are neither backward nor weaker sections of the society by any
         standards-social, economical, regional or physical. They were
         chosen for entry into the Institute because of their having
         displayed and demonstrated excellence at all India level
         competition where thousands participate but only a mere 40 or
         so are chosen. Their achieving an all-India merit and entry in
         the premier institution of national importance should not bring
         in a brooding sense of complacence in them. They have to
         continue to strive for achieving still higher scales of excellence.
         Else there would be no justification for their continuance in a
         premier Institution like AIIMS. In AIIMS where the best of
         facilities are available for learning with best of teachers, best of
         medical services, sophistication, research facilities and
         infrastructure, the best entrants selected from the length and
         breadth of the country must come out as best of all India
         graduates. We fail to understand why those who were assessed
         to be best in the country before entering the portals of the
         Institute fall down to such low levels as having perceptibly
         ceased to be best, not remaining even better, within a period of
         a few years spent in the Institute. They trail behind even such
         candidates as fall in constitutionally reserved categories and
         yet steal a march order them in claiming creamy disciplines.
         The only reason which logically follows from the material
         available on record is that being assured of allotment of post-
         graduation seats in the same institution, the zeal for preserving
         excellence is lost. The students lose craving for learning. Those
         who impart instructions also feel that their non-seriousness
         would not make any difference for their taughts. If that is so,
         there is no reason why at the point of clearing graduation and
         seeking entry in post-graduation courses of study they should
         not give way for those who deserve better, and much better,
         than them. AIIMS holds and conducts a common entrance
         examination for post-graduation wherein graduates of AIIMS

         and graduates from all over the country participate and are
         tested by common standards. The AIIMS students trail in the
         race and yet are declared winners, thanks to the ingenious
         reservation in their favour. One who justified reservation must
         place on record adequate material enough, to satisfy an
         objective mind judicially trained, to sustain the reservation, its
         extent and qualifying parameters. In the case at hand no such
         material has been placed on record either by the institute or by
         the AIIMS Students' Union. The facts found by Delhi High Court,
         well articulated by the learned Chief Justice speaking for the
         Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi, visibly demonstrate
         the arbitrariness and hence unsustainability of such a
         reservation. It was an outcome of agitation-generated-pressure
         depriving application of mind reason and objectivity of those
         who took the decision. No material has been placed on record
         to show that Institute graduates, if asked to face all-India
         competition while seeking PG seats, would get none or face
         feeble opportunities because of the policies of other
         universities. The way merit has been made a martyr by
         institutional reservation policy of AIIMS, the high hopes on
         which rests the foundation of AIIMS are belied. No sound and
         sensible mind can accept scorers of 15-20% being declared as
         passed, crossing over the queue and arraigning themselves
         above scorers of 60-70% and that too to sit in a course where
         they will be declared qualified to fight with dreaded and
         complicated threats to human life. Will a less efficient post
         graduate or specialist doctor be a boon to society? Is the
         human life so cheap as to be entrusted to mediocre when
         meritorious are available? If the answer is yes, we are cutting
         at the roots of nation's health and depriving right to equality of
         its meaning. We have no hesitation in holding, and thereby
         agreeing with the Division Bench of High Court, that reserving
         33% seats for institutional candidates was in effect 100%
         reservation for subjects. Coupled with 50% reservation in
         allocation of specialities not exceeding overall 33% reservation
         integrated with 65 percentile - a complex method, the actual
         working where of even the learned senior counsel for the
         parties frankly confessed their inability in demonstrating before
         us at the time of hearing - is a conceited gimmick and
         accentuated politics of pampering students, weak in merit but
         mighty in strength. Such a reservation based on institutional
         continuity in the absence of any relevant evidence in
         justification thereof is unconstitutional and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_221">Article
         14</a> of the Constitution and has therefore to be struck down. The
         impugned reservation, obnoxious to merit, fails to satisfy the

                 reservation. Can the Court sustain and uphold such
                 reservation? 'Justice is the earnest and constant will to render
                 every man his due. The precepts of the law are these: to live
                 honorably, to injure no other man, to render to every man his
                 due' - said Justinian. Giving a man his due, one of the basics of
                 justice, finds reflected in right to equality. Mediocracy over
                 meritocracy cuts at the roots of justice and hurts right to
                 equality. Protective push or prop, by way of reservation or
                 classification must withstand the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_223">Article 14.</a> Any over-

                 Founding Fathers on which they structured the great document
                 of Constitution and so must fall to the ground. To deprive a
                 man of merit of his due, even marginally, no rule shall sustain
                 except by the aid of Constitution; one such situation being

<p id="p_212">                 65. What we mean to say is that Parliament and the
                 Legislatures in this country cannot transgress the basic feature
                 of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined
                 in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_226">Art. 14</a> of which <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_227">Art. 16(1)</a> is a facet. Whether creamy layer is
                 not excluded or whether forward castes get included in the list
                 of Backward Classes, the position will be the same, namely,
                 that there will be a breach not only of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_228">Art. 14</a> but of the basic
                 structure of the Constitution. The non-exclusion of the creamy
                 layer or the inclusion of forward castes in the list of Backward
                 Classes will, therefore, be totally illegal. Such an illegality
                 offending the root of the Constitution of India cannot be
                 allowed to be perpetuated even by constitutional amendment.
                 The Kerala Legislature is, therefore, least competent to
                 perpetuate such an illegal discrimination. What even
                 Parliament cannot do, the Kerala Legislature cannot achieve."

         in 1993 SC 477, a Division Bench of this Court Court held it to be

         illegal by considering the reservation based on economic criteria. The

<p id="p_227">         30.1 With reference to the above point, it is the specific case of the

         petitioners      that      the   impugned      Ordinance          is    issued       providing

         reservation of 10% of available seats in educational institutions and

         to fill posts in the services under the State without carrying out

         the affidavit in reply filed by the State that based on representations

         numbering about 225, High Power Committee consisting of 5 Hon'ble

         Ministers recommended the reservation of 10% to weaker sections in

         unreserved category. It is also the contention of the learned Advocate

         General that since such reservation is not traceable to provision

         under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, no such

         technical impact assessment study by experts and quantifiable and

         empirical data is required. In this regard, it is relevant to note that

         apart from the fact that the respondent-State is not empowered

         under the constitutional scheme to make such law for reservation

         exclusively for economically weaker sections of unreserved category,

         we are of the view that there is no technical impact assessment study

         and quantifiable and empirical data before arriving at the conclusion

         that such reservation is necessary. When equality is the rule of law

         under the scheme of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_245">Article 14</a>, for creating group for the purpose of

         providing reservation, unless detailed scientific and technical study is

         made, no such reservation can be permitted. Except by referring to

         representations based on which the High Powered Committee has

         recommended reservation, there is no other scientific data collected

         by the Committee for making recommendations for reservation. In

         this regard, it is relevant to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble

         Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1934185/" id="a_246">Atyant Pichhara Barg Chhatra

         Sangh and Anr. v. Jharkhand State Vaishya Federation and

         Ors</a>.reported in (2006) 6 SCC 718. In the aforesaid judgment, while

         as under:-

               except for a bald statement that the same was done after
               careful application of mind and due statement that the same
               was done after careful application of mind and due deliberation
               by the highest policy-making body I.e the Council of Ministers.

               undertaken any study, research or work. In such circumstances
               to merely suggest that the Council of Ministers had applied
               their minds and had reached a decision is arbitrary and

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">               23. Mandal Commission case has specifically noted that
               there is no constitutioal bar to a State categorising the
               Backward Classes as backward and more Backward Class. The
               State of Jharkhand by its actions seeks to disempower
               communities that have been extended the benefits of
               reservation after a conscious adoption of the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_247">Bihar Act</a>. What
               GO No. 5800 seeks to do by combining the Extremely

               unequals as equals thus violating the notion of substantive
               equality and <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_248">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India bringing it

<p id="p_229">         From the aforesaid judgment also it is clear that unless there is

         empirical study on the subject, there cannot be any casual approach

         in the matter relating to separation of group for affirmative action

         contrary to the rule of equality guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_249">Article 14</a> of the

         Constitution. Thus, the above observations in the judgment referred

         above, fortify the case of the petitioners. In the above view of the

         matter, we answer the point no. 3 in favour of the petitioners by

         holding    that     the   impugned     Ordinance            is     based        on         the

<p id="p_231">         31.1           With reference to the above point, it is the case of the

         and 7.5.2016 granting financial assistance to the students belonging

         to economically weaker sections of unreserved category but without

         waiting for any period to assess the benefits from such Government

         Resolutions, the impugned Ordinance is issued in haste. But having

         regard to our findings recorded on point nos. 1 to 4, we are of the

         view that there is no need to adjudicate on the said issue any further

         without going into the merits of such contention, and having regard

         to the findings recorded on the other points, we are of the view that

         no other findings are required to be recorded on this point.

         allowed. The impugned Ordinance No. 1 of 2016 titled as "the Gujarat

         Unreserved Economically Weaker Sections (Reservation of Seats in

         Educational Institutions in the State and of Appointments and Posts in

         services under the State) Ordinance, 2016, issued by the State

         and admissions to be made by treating such quota in unreserved
