<p id="p_1">[1.0]		Present
Miscellaneous Civil Application has been preferred by the applicant
herein - M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Ors. through its
partner Smt. Kishori Devi to modify the Scheme of Arrangement entered
into between the "Demerged Company" and the "Resulting
Company" which has been sanctioned by this Court vide order
dated 10.10.2006 passed in Company Petition No.126 of 2006 in Company
Application No.267 of 2006 submitting that it has caused material
prejudice to the rights of the applicant and restraining the D.B.
Corp. Limited not to use the title "Dainik Bhaskar" Hindi
daily newspaper.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_2">[1.1]		It is also
further prayed to pass appropriate order to direct the competent
authority/Court to initiate criminal proceedings as fraud has been
practiced by the Directors of D.B. Corp Ltd. and  M/s. Writers and
Publishers Limited, who were parties to Company Petition Nos.126 of
2006 with Company Application No.267 of 2006.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_3">[2.0]		At
the outset it is required to be noted that when the present OJMCA was
filed by the applicant herein, it was not stated under which
provision the applicant had preferred the present application and
therefore, a preliminary objection was raised by the contesting
respondents by filing an affidavit-in-reply raising preliminary
objection with respect to maintainability of the present application
submitting that the applicant does not state the provision of law
under which the application is filed.  It was also submitted that it
has not been stated whether the application is filed under the
provisions of Rule 6 of the Company (Court) Rules, 1959 read with
provision of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred
to as "CPC") or under Rule 9 of the Companies (Court)
Rules, 1959
or
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_1">Section 392</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other provision
of law.  It was also submitted that irrespective of any of the
aforesaid provisions under which the application can be stated to
have been filed, the application is barred by limitation.  Number of
other objections were also raised by the contesting respondent with
respect to the maintainability of the present application even at the
instance of the applicant herein against whom an injunction/restraint
order is in operation restraining her from doing any correspondence
on behalf of the applicant firm and/or acting as partner of applicant
Firm.  Having served with a copy of the preliminary
affidavit-in-reply dated 22.12.2011, the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the applicant submitted the draft amendment submitting that
the application be treated as application under Order 47 Rule 1 of
the CPC and <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_2">Section 392</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter
referred to as "Act, 1956") also.  The applicant also
sought permission to amend the application by adding M/s. D.B. Corp
Limited - "Resulting Company" to be joined as
opponent No.2 and the draft amendment submitted by the applicant came
to be allowed by this Court by order dated 31.01.2012 permitting the
applicant to amend the application as prayed for.  However, by making
specific observation that the amendment is allowed, without
expressing anything on merits with respect to the entertainability
and/or maintainability of the present application by the applicant
under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC and keeping all the objections /
defences open to be raised by the respondent.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_4">[2.1]		It
appears that pursuant to the said amendment, according
to the applicant, the said application was under Order 47 Rule 1 of
the CPC also and if that be so there was a delay in preferring the
application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC and therefore, the
applicant submitted OJ Civil Application No.66 of 2012 in present
application with a request to condone the delay of 1790 days in
filing the OJMCA by submitting that in view of the order passed by
the Registrar of Firms, Societies &amp; Chits, Uttar Pradesh passed
way back in 2003 i.e. prior to passing of the order dated 10.10.2006
by this Court in Company Petition No.126 of 2006, Smt. Kishori Devi
was restrained from acting as partner of the applicant firm and
therefore, she was under "legal disability" to make her
stand against the demerger as the nub of the grievance is that the
title of the firm "Dainik Bhaskar" is owned by the
applicant firm and not by respondent No.1 Company.  It was submitted
that legal disability conferred on the applicant has been erased on
21.09.2011 by the order of the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High
Court, Lucknow Bench by virtue of which the orders passed by the
Registrar in 2003 and 2004 restraining Smt. Kishori Devi to act as
partner of the applicant firm has been set aside, by judgment and
order dated 21.09.2011.  Therefore, it was submitted that the legal
disability is the main ground of delay if any, otherwise according to
the applicant actually there was no delay, if 21.09.2011 - date
of order passed by the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench removing
the legal disability is taken as the starting point of limitation. 
Therefore, it was requested to condone the delay of 1790 days in
filing the present OJMCA.  Having served with the copy of the said
application, a strong objection was raised by the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the contesting respondent submitting
that there is a suppression of material fact in the application in as
much as it has not been pointed out that order dated 21.09.2011
passed by the learned Single Judge of the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad
High Court has been set aside by the Division Bench and the matter is
remanded to the learned Single Judge.  It was submitted that the
aforesaid fact has not been mentioned in the application and the same
has been suppressed.  Shri Oza, learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the applicant fairly conceded that in the application, there is no
reference to the order passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad
High Court quashing and setting aside the order dated 21.09.2011
passed by the learned Single Judge.  However, he submitted that there
was no malafide intention on the part of the applicant in not
disclosing the said fact in the application and it was bonafide error
on the part of the learned advocate who drafted the said application.
 He tendered unconditional apology for not disclosing the aforesaid
fact in the application and he requested to accept the same and
permit him to withdraw the said application with a liberty to file a
fresh application on the same subject matter with full facts and
accurate pleadings.  This Court accepted the request made by Shri
Oza, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant and
accepted the unconditional apology and permitted the applicant to
withdraw the said application (which was submitted to condone the
delay of 1790 days in preferring the OJMCA) with a liberty to file a
fresh application on the same subject matter with full facts and
accurate pleadings. Accordingly the said application stood dismissed
as withdrawn with above liberty.   
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">[2.2]		It is to be
noted that thereafter no fresh application to condone the delay in
preferring OJMCA has been preferred by the applicant.  Therefore, at
the time of hearing of the present application when it was submitted
on behalf of the respondents that if the present application is also
under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC, in that case, there is a delay and
there is no application to condone the delay and therefore, the
present application is not maintainable, Shri Prashant Chandra,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant has declared at
the Bar that the present application be treated as application under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_3">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only and the present application may not
be treated as having been filed under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC. 
Under the circumstances, present application is treated to have been
filed under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_4">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only and therefore, this
Court is required to consider the present application considering
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_5">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_6">[2.3]		It is also
required to be noted at this stage that the learned counsels
appearing on behalf of the respective parties have addressed the
Court only with respect to prayer in terms of para 5(b) only and have
not made any submissions with respect to prayer in terms of para
5(c).   Therefore, this Court is required to consider the present
application under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_6">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only by which the
applicant herein has requested to modify the Scheme of Arrangement
entered into between the "Demerged Company" and the
"Resulting Company" - respondents herein which has
been sanctioned by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2006 while
passing the order in Company Petition No.126 of 2006 connected with
Company Petition No.267 of 2006.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">[3.0]		It is
required to be noted that after the arguments were concluded, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties were
requested to submit the written submissions if they so choose, on or
before 11.05.2012.  However, no written submissions have been
received by the Court from the applicant side till the date on which
Court dictated the judgment and written submissions were received
only from learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.2. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_8">[4.0]		Before
considering the present application on merits, facts leading to the
present application deserve to be considered which in nut-shell are
as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">[4.1]		That
respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein - M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers
Limited ("Demerged Company") and D.B. Corp Limited
("Resulting Company") submitted the Company Petition
Nos.126 of 2006 in Company Application No.267 of 2006 before this
Court under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_7">Section 391</a> read with <a href="/doc/301194/" id="a_8">Section 394</a> of the Act, 1956 for
sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement in the nature of demerger and
transfer of the publishing business of the "Demerged Company"
into the "Resulting Company".  That prior thereto vide
order dated 13.06.2011 passed in Company Application No.226 of 2006,
the meeting of the equity and preferential shareholders of the
"Demerged Company" were dispensed with in view of written
consents of all the equity preferential shareholders of the "Demerged
Company" which were produced on record.  As per the order of
this Court, meeting of the secured creditors and unsecured creditors
of the "Demerged Company" were convened and it was
submitted that the secured and unsecured creditors of the "Demerged
Company" unanimously approved the scheme in the meeting convened
on 18.04.2006.  That vide order dated 13.06.2011 passed in Company
Application No.268 of 2006, the meeting of the equity preferential
shareholders of the "Resulting Company" were dispensed with
in view of the consent letters from the shareholders approving the
scheme placed on record.  It also appears that the extraordinary
general meeting of the equity shareholders of the "Resulting
Company" was duly convened and, equity shareholders passed a
resolution with requisite majority approving share capital of the
"Resulting Company".  It appears that thereafter the
aforesaid petitions came to be admitted and the same were duly
advertised in the newspapers (Indian Express, English and Divya
Bhaskar, Gujarati) both of Ahmedabad Editions.  That no one came
forward with any objection to the said petitions even after the
publication.  At the time of hearing of the aforesaid petitions, the
learned Central Government Standing Counsel appeared on behalf of the
Central Government and placed on record the affidavit dated
11.09.2006 filed by the Deputy Registrar of the Companies along with
the letter from the Regional Director, by which the Regional Director
decided not to oppose the petitions.   
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_10">[4.2]		That
thereafter having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the respective applicants - respondents herein i.e. the learned
Advocates appearing on behalf of the "Demerged Company" as
well as the "Resulting Company" and as such there was no
opposition to the said applications by anybody and considering the
proposed scheme of demerger and having satisfied with the proposed
demerger which was found to be in the interest of the Company, their
members and creditors, this Court allowed both the Company Petitions
and sanctioned the Scheme of Arrangement between the "Demerged
Company" and the "Resulting Company" -
</p><p id="p_11">respondents herein by common judgment and order dated 10.10.2006. 
That thereafter the Scheme of Demerger sanctioned by this Court by
order dated 10.10.2006 has been fully implemented and acted upon and
thereafter after a period of almost 5 years, the applicant Dwarka
Prasad Agarwal and others a partnership firm through its partner Smt.
Kishori Devi has preferred the present OJMCA under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_9">Section 392</a> of the
Act, 1956 to modify the Scheme of Arrangement between the "Demerged
Company" and the "Resulting Company" -
</p><p id="p_12">respondents herein.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_13">[5.0]		Shri
Prashant Chandra, learned Senior Advocate has appeared with Shri Y.N.
Oza, learned Senior Advocate on behalf of the applicant and Shri U.K.
Chaudhary, learned Senior Advocate on behalf of respondent No.1 -
"Demerged Company" and Shri S.N. Soparkar, learned counsel
with Shri A.S. Vakil, learned advocate appearing on behalf of
respondent No.2 - the "Resulting Company".  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_14">[5.1]		At the
outset it is required to be noted that the main ground on which the
present application has been filed by the applicant is with respect
to suppression of material facts including the facts pertaining to
various litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the present application
and that there has been suppression of judgment and order dated
07.07.2003 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dwarka

respect to ownership of the newspaper namely "Dainik Bhaskar"
(the business of which is now transferred to "Resulting
Company"), the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the order dated
03.09.1992 passed by the Registrar of Newspapers for India by which
pursuant to the order dated 29.06.1992 passed by the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Case No.1182 of 1992, the "Demerged
Company" - M/s. Writers and Publishers Limited, Bhopal was
declared to be the owner of "Dainik Bhaskar" came to be
set aside.  Shri Chandra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
applicant has vehemently submitted that in view of the above judgment
and order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the dispute with
respect to the ownership of the "Dainik Bhaskar" was at
large and/or atleast the order passed by the Registrar, Newspapers
for India declaring the "Demerged Company" as owner of the
"Dainik Bhaskar" came to be set aside, the respondent
No.1 - "Demerged Company" atleast was required to
declare the same before this Court in the aforesaid Company Petition.
 Therefore, it is submitted that there is a suppression of material
fact and while getting the scheme sanctioned, respondent No.1 has not
declared the correct facts.  It is further submitted by Shri Chandra,
learned counsel that even number of other litigations / various
proceedings pending between the parties as mentioned in para 4(a) of
the application, though required to be declared, were not declared
while submitting the application for demerger of the scheme by
respondent No.1. It is submitted that if correct facts would have
been pointed out, this Court might not have sanctioned the Scheme of
Demerger.

submitted that in the said proceedings various reliefs were sought. 
It is submitted that during the pendency of the writ proceedings, the
petitioner therein (Bishambar Dayal Agarwal), Ramesh Chandra Agarwal
</p><p id="p_16">- son of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Mahesh P. Agarwal along with
their sons Kailash, Sudhir and Sanjay entered into a deed of
settlement.  It is submitted that though the Dwarka Prasad Agarwal
was respondent therein and although his rights as partners were
directly affected thereby, he was neither a party to the said
settlement nor a signatory to the said deed.  It is submitted that
said agreement was filed before the Madhya Pradesh High Court by the
petitioner of that petition alleging that he and the contesting
respondents have reached a full and final settlement of "disputes
raised in the petition and other connected matters" pending

disposed of in terms of the said agreement.  The said settlement was
accepted and the writ petition came to be disposed of by the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in terms thereof on 29.06.1992.  It is further
submitted that pursuant to the order passed by the Madhya Pradesh
High Court dated 29.06.1992, RNI altered the name of the owner of the
"Dainik Bhaskar" in its register from the firm
(partnership firm) to M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers Limited on or
above 03.09.1992.  It is submitted that the Dwarka Prasad Agarwal
filed the review petition before the Madhya Pradesh High Court which
came to be dismissed.  It is submitted that the order passed by the
Madhya Pradesh High Court dated 29.06.1992 disposing of the writ

Bhaskar" from the "firm" to M/s. Writers &amp;
Publishers Limited, Bhopal were subject matter before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in a decision reported in (2003)6 SCC 230 and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the said Appeals and set aside the
orders dated 29.06.1992 and 13.11.1992 passed by the Madhya Pradesh
High Court as also the order dated 03.09.1992 passed by the RNI.  It
is submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court also further passed the
order that all actions taken and all orders passed by the statutory
authorities and the Civil Courts shall also stand quashed and as a
logical corollary to the said order it was held that the writ
petition filed by late Bishambar Dayal Agarwal does not survive and
therefore, the same also came to be dismissed.  It is submitted that
the Hon'ble Supreme Court further clarified that the consequence of
the said order would be that the parties shall be relegated to the
same position in which they were immediately prior to passing of the
order dated 29.06.1992.  Therefore, it is submitted by Shri Chandra,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant that pursuant to
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dwarka
Prasad Agarwal (Supra), the position which was prevailing prior to
the order dated 29.06.1992 stood restored meaning thereby the
ownership of the newspaper Dainik Bhaskar continued to be with the
partnership firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers.
Therefore, it is submitted that as the ownership of the newspaper
'Dainik Bhaskar' continued to be of the partnership firm and the
order passed by RNI declaring M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers Limited
as owner of the Dainik Bhaskar dated 03.09.1992 came to be set aside,
the respondent No.1 could not have submitted the scheme by
transferring the business of Dainik Bhaskar to the "Resulting
Company" as M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers Limited - respondent
No.1 was not the owner.  It is submitted that as such the aforesaid
facts as well as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
required to be pointed out before this Court while submitting the
scheme.  It is submitted that as such the aforesaid material facts
have been suppressed by the respondent while submitting the scheme
which has been subsequently sanctioned by this Court and therefore,
it is requested to exercise powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_11">Section 392</a> of the Act,
1956.  It is submitted by Shri Chandra, learned counsel that as such
by not producing the relevant materials and suppressing the material
facts, the respondent No.1 has played a fraud even with the Court and
therefore, it is requested to recall the order sanctioning the Scheme
of Arrangement which the respondent No.1 has obtained by suppressing
the material facts and by playing the fraud. It is submitted that
fraud vitiates everything and any order which has been obtained by
playing fraud with the Court is a nullity.  It is further submitted
by Shri Chandra, learned Counsel that while submitting the scheme for
arrangement, the correct facts ought to have been brought on record. 
It is further submitted that as such nothing should have been
concealed and it was not open for the respondent to consider which
facts were relevant.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_17">[5.3]		Shri
Chandra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant has
relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/1659850/" id="a_12">Ganpatbhai Mahijibhai Solanki vs. State of Gujarat and Ors</a>.
reported in AIR 2009 SC (Supp) 986 by submitting that as
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, order obtained by practicing fraud
on the Court is liable to be recalled. It is submitted that as
observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, even if the application for
recall is made after inordinate delay, notwithstanding the same, the
order obtained from the Court by fraud or by suppression of material
fact is liable to be recalled, as the fraud vitiates all solemn acts.
 Shri Chandra, learned counsel has also relied upon the following
decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in support of his submission
that as respondent No.1 while submitting the scheme before this Court
had not pointed out the correct facts and by suppressing the material
facts has obtained the order by committing fraud on the Court and
therefore, the order passed by this Court sanctioning the scheme for
arrangement is to be recalled.

submitted that the cause title of the application suggests that the
applicant is M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers (a  partnership
firm), through its partner - Smt. Kishori Devi.  It is
submitted that however, it is nowhere stated that the partnership
firm of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers have authorized
Smt. Kishori Devi to file the present application.  It is submitted
that even Smt. Kishori Devi has no authority to represent the
applicant firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers It is
submitted that Smt. Kishori Devi is still under "legal
disability" to act as partner of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp;
Brothers  It is submitted that even Smt. Kishori Devi in the present
application has stated that earlier she was under "legal
disability" to act as partner of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp;
Brothers pursuant to the restraint order / injunction passed by the
Registrar of Firms, Societies and Chits, Uttar Pradesh dated
08.09.2003 and 07.01.2004, however, the same has been set aside by
the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench.  It
is submitted that however the order passed by the learned Single
Judge dated 21.09.2011 passed in Writ Petition No.2996 (MH)/2004
quashing and setting aside the orders passed by the Registrar, Firms
dated 08.09.2003 and 07.01.2004 has been set aside by the Division
Bench of the Allahabad High Court vide judgment and order dated
15.11.2011 and the matter has been remanded to the learned Single
Judge to decide the aforesaid writ petition afresh on merits and the
said writ petition is still pending before the Allahabad High Court. 
Therefore, it is submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 that the orders passed by the
Registrar of Firms dated 08.09.2003 and 07.01.2004 under which Smt.
Kishori Devi is restrained from acting as partner of the applicant
firm are in existence and therefore, Smt. Kishori Devi is still under
a "legal disability" to act as a partner of the applicant
firm.  Therefore, it is submitted that as such Smt. Kishori Devi has
no authority to represent the applicant firm as its partner.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_38">[6.1]		Present
application is opposed by the respondents also on the ground of delay
and laches and on the ground that the scheme sanctioned by this Court
which is sought to be recalled has been acted upon fully since long
and is in operation since last more than 5 years.  It is submitted
that the scheme which has been sanctioned which is sought to be
recalled has been sanctioned by this Court as far as back in the year
2006 and the present application under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_29">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956
to modify the Scheme of Arrangement and/or recall the order
sanctioning the scheme has been made after a period of 5 years of
sanctioning the scheme.  It is submitted that as the scheme which has
been sanctioned is fully acted upon and the shares under the demerged
scheme are already transferred in favour of the respective
shareholders, it is requested not to recall the order by further
submitting that if the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned by this Court
which is already acted upon is recalled in that case, there are
likelihood of number of complications and as such it is not possible
to restore the position and it is likely to create more complications
and are likely to affect the rights of the other shareholders of the
"Demerged Company" as well as the "Resulting Company".

<p id="p_39">[6.2]		It is
submitted that in the application it has been explained that as Smt.
Kishori Devi was under a "legal disability" to act as
partner of the applicant firm, earlier she could not file the
objections to the scheme and she could not submit the application. 
However, in view of the order passed by the learned Single Judge
quashing and setting aside the order passed by the Registrar, Firms,
the said restraint is not there and therefore, she has approached and
filed the present application.  It is submitted that as stated herein
above, in view of the order passed by the Division Bench quashing and
setting aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge, the
"legal disability" which according to Smt. Kishori Devi
was already there prior to the order passed by the learned Single
Judge, still continues.

<p id="p_40">[6.3]		Now
so far as the contention on behalf of the applicant of suppression of

no suppression at all.  It is submitted that all the material facts
which were required for the scheme under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_30">Section 392</a> and <a href="/doc/506042/" id="a_31">393</a> and for

and
disclosure contemplated under <a href="/doc/682416/" id="a_35">Sections 393(1)</a> and (2) of the Act,

specifically pleaded in the application whether alleged suppression
would fall under <a href="/doc/682416/" id="a_36">Sections 393(1)</a> and (2) of the Act, 1956.  It is
submitted that in any case there has not been any suppression, much

were statutorily required to be disclosed by the respondents in the
proceedings under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_37">Sections 391</a> - 394 of the Act, 1956.  It is
further submitted that the words "and the like" at the
end of proviso of <a href="/doc/108996/" id="a_38">Section 391(2)</a> of the Act, 1956 is required to be
considered ejusdm

the legislature, therefore, has supplied the words "and
the like"
</p><p id="p_41">so as to bring in any other item of the same class or genus.  In

<p id="p_42">[6.4]		Now so far
as the contention on behalf of the applicant with respect
non-disclosure of the various litigations referred to in para 4(a) is
concerned, Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

same are totally irrelevant to the scheme proceedings/proceedings
under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_39">Sections 391-394</a> of the Act, 1956.  It is submitted that as
such on a mere perusal of the "present status" of the

said litigations stood disposed of and/or withdrawn as on the date
the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_40">Sections 391-394</a> of the Act, 1956 were
commenced by the respondents.  It is submitted that similarly, the
non-disclosure of the judgment and order dated 07.07.2003 of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot also be considered to be
"suppression" by the respondents, much less material
suppression, which could have any bearing on the proceedings under
<a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_41">Section 391</a> - 394 of the Act initiated by the respondents in
the year 2006. It is submitted that the respondents are not party to
most of the said proceedings/litigations. It is submitted that in any
case nothing in any of the said proceedings would have any bearing on
the present proceedings, which were under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_42">Sections 391</a> - 394 of

<p id="p_49">[6.7]		It

behalf of respondent No.1 that in a scheme proceedings, the Company
Court is not concerned with the rights or liabilities of the Company
vis-à-vis third party and they are in no way affected by the
said proceedings. In support of his above submission, he has relied
upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Mafatlal

in (1997)

is submitted that the sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement, by this
Hon'ble Court's judgment and order dated 10.10.2006
cannot and shall not affect any of the said proceedings that might
have been pending on the date of sanction of the Scheme of
Arrangement or that may have been commenced thereafter

It is submitted that therefore, the so-called non-disclosure has no

<p id="p_50">[6.8]		It
is further submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No.1 that the judgment and order dated
10.10.2006 passed by this Court sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement
is sought to be modified and/or altered and/or reviewed also on the
ground that as on the date of proceedings under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_46">Sections 391-394</a> of
the Act, 1956, the ownership of the title "Dainik Bhaskar"
was not with the respondent No.1 - Writers and Publishers
Limited, but was in fact with M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp;
Brothers (relying upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
dated 07.07.2003).  It is submitted that at the outset, the
proceedings under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_47">Sections 391-394</a> of the Act, 1956 are not
proceedings for the purpose of determination of the rights and title
of the parties concerned.  It is submitted that while exercising
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_48">Sections 391-394</a> of the Act, 1956, the Court
cannot held an inquiry and go into the questions as to who is
entitled to the ownership of the brands, names, titles, etc. It is
submitted that it is totally outside the purview of <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_49">Section 391</a> of
the Act, 1956. It is submitted that as such any sanction accorded by
the Hon'ble Court to the Scheme of Arrangement could not be
construed as taking away the rights of the parties, if they had any,
and to that extent, such rights, if any, would stand protected. In
support of his submission he has relied upon the decision of the
Karnataka High Court in the case of  Kirloskar
Electric Company Limited reported
in (2003)
43 SEBI and
Corporate Laws 186 (Karnataka).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_51">[6.9]		It is
further submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No.1 that even as such the judgment and order
dated 07.07.2003 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has nowhere determined
the ownership of the title "Dainik Bhaskar" as sought to
be contended on behalf of the applicant.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_52">[6.10]	It is
further submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel that infact
after the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003,
there was a further order passed by the RNI which was in favour of
respondent No.1 and Ramesh Chandra Agarwal dated 18.06.2004.  It is
submitted that said order was challenged by one Mahesh Prasad Agarwal
by way of writ petition before the Delhi High Court and the said
challenge failed upto the Hon'ble Supreme Court.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_53">[6.11]	It is

subsequently filed a Civil Suit No.1663/2011 before the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court for a declaration that the firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal
and Brothers is the sole and exclusive owner of the title "Dainik
Bhaskar" all over India to the exclusion of any other person
and the said suit is pending.  It is, therefore, submitted that Smt.
Kishori Devi and M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers are not the
owners of title "Dainik Bhaskar" and infact the issue is
sub-judice at the instance of and in the proceedings initiated by
Smt. Kishori Devi herself.  Therefore, it is submitted that the
contention on behalf of the applicant / Smt. Kishori Devi relying
upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 that
M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers is the owner of the title
"Dainik Bhaskar" is absolutely baseless.  Therefore, it
is submitted that there cannot be any review / modification or
alteration of this Hon'ble Court's order dated 10.10.2006 sanctioning
the Scheme of Arrangement on the ground that respondent No.1 M/s.
Writers &amp; Publishers Limited was not the owner of the title
"Dainik Bhaskar".

<p id="p_54">[6.12]	It is
further submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No.1 that as such even neither the applicant
partnership firm nor Smt. Kishori Devi was the shareholder nor the
creditor of respondent No.1. It is further submitted that the case on
behalf of Smt. Kishori Devi based on the certificate dated 26.12.1987
that M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers hold 5000 redeemable
preference shares of respondent No.1 - Writers and Publishers
Limited, through its erstwhile partner Dwarka Prasad Agarwal, has no
substance.  It is submitted that the said Dwarka Prasad Agarwal has
never been a member of respondent No.1 - Writers and Publishers
Limited on behalf of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers.  It is
submitted that for an individual to hold shares on behalf of the
partnership firm, the filing of the necessary declaration, in terms
of <a href="/doc/134596/" id="a_50">Section 187-C(1)(2)(3)</a> of the Act, 1956, with respondent No.1

been filed and consequently respondent No.1 Company had no occasion
to file the form with the Registrar of Companies as per <a href="/doc/1024257/" id="a_51">Section 187-C</a>
(4) of the Act, 1956.  It is submitted that even in the register
maintained by respondent No.1 Company, nowhere M/s. Dwarka Prasad
Agarwal and Brothers is shown to be the shareholder.  Therefore, it
is submitted that when the Scheme of Arrangement was sanctioned,
neither Dwarka Prasad Agarwal nor the partnership firm was the

so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of S.K. Gupta and Anr. (Supra) on the locus
of the applicant, it is submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 that the said decision would
not be applicable to the facts of the present case.  It is submitted
that assuming that the locus of the applicant
i.e. either M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers or Smt. Kishori
Devi is not relevant, in that case also, no such relief which is
sought in the present application can be granted in an application
under <a href="/doc/929470/" id="a_60">Section 392(1)</a> of the Act, 1956.  It is submitted that
admittedly the present application is under <a href="/doc/929470/" id="a_61">Section 392(1)</a> of the
Act, 1956 seeking "modification" of the sanctioned Scheme
of Arrangement.  It is submitted that proposed modifications or
directions are not specified.  It is further submitted that as such
in addition to not specifying the modifications, there is no pleading
that the proposed modifications are necessary "for
the proper working of the sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement"
and simultaneously there is also no pleading to suggest that the
Scheme of Arrangement as sanctioned cannot properly work /
implemented.  It is submitted that 	infact the prayer for
modification of the sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement is because "it
causes material prejudice to the rights of the applicant." 
Therefore, it is submitted that the powers of this Court cannot be
invoked (even suo motu) under <a href="/doc/929470/" id="a_62">Section 392(1)</a> of the Act, 1956, for
giving directions or for making modifications in the sanctioned
Scheme of Arrangement because the same allegedly causes prejudice to
the alleged rights of the applicant/third parties.  It is submitted
that in absence of any pleading to even remotely suggest that the
sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement cannot be worked satisfactorily,
with or without modification, the present application cannot be
treated as an application under <a href="/doc/898238/" id="a_63">Section 392(2)</a> of the Act, 1956.  It
is further submitted that the powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_64">Section 392</a> of the Act,
1956 cannot be exercised to recall/modify the scheme sanctioned under
<a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_65">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956 for alleged violation of third party
rights.
</p><p id="p_64"> In support of his above submission, Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 has relied upon the decision
of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1903610/" id="a_66">Divya

<p id="p_65">[6.18]	Present
application is also opposed by respondents on the ground of delay and
laches.  It is submitted by Shri Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing
on behalf of respondent No.1 that the Scheme of Arrangement has been
sanctioned as far as back on 10.10.2006 and the same has been fully
implemented.  It is submitted that as such the sanctioned Scheme of
Arrangement has taken effect long back and third party rights are
also created.  
</p>
 


<p id="p_66">	By making above

Kishori Devi herself before the Delhi High Court.  Therefore, it is
submitted that Smt. Kishori Devi cannot represent the partnership
firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers as its partner.  It is
submitted that as such by the present application Smt. Kishori Devi
wants to take the advantage / benefit in the proceedings pending
before various Courts.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_69">[7.2]		It is
further submitted by Shri Soparkar, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No.2 that even after the order passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003, RNI passed a further order on
18.06.2004 by which M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers Limited, Bhopal is
considered to be the owner of "Dainik Bhaskar" and the
said copy was also send to Smt. Kishori Devi, still she did not
challenge the same.  It is submitted that as such the order dated

Madhya Pradesh, High Court dated 08.12.2003.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_70">[7.3]		It
is further submitted by Shri Soparkar, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No.2 that the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned
by this Court would be as such binding to its shareholders, creditors
etc. and it does not bind the third parties.  Relying upon decisions

<p id="p_75">[7.6]		Shri
Soparkar, learned counsel appearing appearing on behalf of respondent
No.2 has also opposed the present application on the ground of delay
and laches.  It is further submitted that the Scheme of Arrangement
has been sanctioned by this Court by order dated 10.10.2006 and the
present application has been preferred after a period of 5 years and
in the meantime the Scheme of Arrangement has been fully implemented
and the proportionate shares which were required to be allotted to
respective shareholders under the Scheme have already been allotted. 
Therefore, it is submitted that when the Scheme of Arrangement has
been fully implemented since last five years if the same is modified
and/or recalled, in that case, it is likely to create number of
complications.  Therefore, it is requested not to exercise powers
and/or modify the scheme.

<p id="p_76">	By making above

<p id="p_77">[7.7]		In reply

Devi, it is submitted by Shri Chandra, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the applicant that as such the rights and locus of Smt.
Kishori Devi had been approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
decision dated 07.07.2003.  It is submitted that in any case,
respondent No.1 was required to bring the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 to the notice of this Court.  It is
further submitted that as such subsequently respondent No.2 in its
prospectus issued in the year 2009 have disclosed the dispute with
respect to ownership.  Therefore, it is submitted that when
respondent No.2 has thought it fit to declare the same in the
prospectus, it was the duty of respondent No.1 to disclose the
dispute with respect to the ownership of the "Dainik Bhaskar".
 It is submitted that by not disclosing the same and obtaining the
order of sanctioning the scheme, respondent No.1 has committed fraud.

under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_76">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956, relying upon <a href="/doc/38626/" id="a_77">Section 2(29)</a> of the
Act, 1956, it is submitted that "modified" and
"modification" shall include the making of additions and
omissions.  It is submitted that therefore, even the order can be
passed in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/506042/" id="a_78">sections 393</a> and <a href="/doc/301194/" id="a_79">394</a> also.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_79">[7.9]		It is
further submitted that any order passed by RNI subsequent to the
order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 declaring
respondent No.1 as owner of the "Dainik Bhaskar" are
nullity as the same are just contrary to the direction of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the order dated 07.07.2003 and therefore, no
reliance can be placed upon the order passed by the RNI which is
contrary to the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.   It is
further submitted by Shri Chandra, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the applicant that it is not true to say that the scheme
sanctioned under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_80">Section 391</a> is not in rem and binding to the
Company, its shareholders and creditors etc. only.
</p> 


<p id="p_80">	Making above
submissions, it is requested to allow the present application and to
recall and modify the order dated 10.10.2006 passed by this Court

rights were not disclosed by this Court.

<p id="p_81">[8.0]		Heard
learned counsels appearing for respective parties at length.  At the
outset it is required to be noted that by way of present application,
the applicant herein M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers through
its partner Smt. Kishori Devi has prayed to recall and modify the
Scheme of Arrangement entered into between the "Demerged
Company" and the "Resulting Company" (respondent Nos.1
and 2) which has been sanctioned by this Court vide order dated
10.10.2006, alleging inter-alia
that
it causes material prejudice to the rights of the applicant and
restraining the D.B. Corp Limited (respondent No.2 herein -
"Resulting Company") from using the title of "Dainik
Bhaskar" Hindi Daily newspaper.  It is also required to be
noted at this stage and as recorded herein above that the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant has declared at the Bar
that the present application be treated under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_81">Section 392</a> of the Act,
1956 only.  It is to be noted that earlier it was not disclosed
and/or clarified under which provision of law the present application
has been submitted i.e. either under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_82">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 or
the review jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC.  It is also
to be noted that infact considering the present application as a
review application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC, the applicant
did submit application to condone the delay of 1790 days which came
to be dismissed as withdrawn as the correct facts were not disclosed
in the said application and thereafter no fresh application has been
filed and thereafter
it has been declared by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the applicant that the present application may not be treated as an
application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC and be treated as under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_83">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only.  Therefore, present application is
to be considered under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_84">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 and the present
application is required to be considered within the scope and ambit
of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_85">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 only.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_82">[8.1]		At the
outset it is required to be noted that vide order dated 10.10.2006
passed in Company Petition No.126 of 2006 connected with Company
Petition No.267 of 2006, this Court has sanctioned the Scheme of
Arrangement under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_86">Sections 391</a> - 394 of the Act, 1956, between
respondent No.1 M/s. Writers &amp; Publishers Limited ("Demerged
Company") and respondent No.2 D.B. Corp Limited ("Resulting
Company").  It is also required to be noted at this stage that
this Court sanctioned the scheme which was submitted by respondent
No.2 after following due procedure as required under the provisions
of the Act, 1956 i.e. after obtaining the consent of all the
shareholders, creditors etc. of the respective Companies and after
inviting the objections after issuing public notice inviting the
objections, if any, against the proposed Scheme of Arrangement.  As
all the shareholders and creditors etc. of both the Companies
approved the Scheme of Arrangement and nobody raised any objection
against the proposed Scheme of Arrangement, this Court has sanctioned
the scheme by order dated 10.10.2006 and the same has been fully
implemented and/or acted upon and is in operation since last five
years.  It is also required to be noted at this stage that under the
Scheme of Arrangement which is sanctioned, certain things are
required to be done i.e. transfer allotment of shares etc. to the
shareholders of the respective Companies proportionately as mentioned
in the Scheme of Arrangement which has been sanctioned and it is
reported that respective shares are already allotted under the Scheme
of Arrangement which has been sanctioned.   That after a period of
five years of sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement by this Court,
the applicant herein has preferred the present application under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_87">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 to modify the Scheme submitting that by
sanctioning of such a Scheme, the rights of the applicants have been
affected.  	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_83">[8.2]		It is the
case on behalf of the applicant relying upon the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme dated 07.07.2003 that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
approved and considered the rights of Smt. Kishori Devi in the
affairs of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers and as legal
heir of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and that the order passed by the RNI
dated 03.09.1992 declaring Ramesh Chandra Agarwal as owner /
declaring respondent No.1 M/s. Writers and Publishers Limited as
owner of "Dainik Bhaskar" came to be set aside by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and the position which was prevailing prior to
order dated 29.06.1992 came to be restored  by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court and prior to order dated  29.06.1992 the ownership of the
"Dainik Bhaskar" was with the partnership firm M/s.
Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers and the same was not disclosed
by respondent No.1 by submitting the Scheme of Arrangement and
therefore, respondent No.1 played a fraud and by not disclosing the
material facts and various litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the
application have played fraud and therefore, the order passed by this
Court dated 10.10.2006 sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement is
required to be modified. On the aspect that why at the relevant time
the applicant - Smt. Kishori Devi did not submit the objections
and/or she has submitted the present application after five years, it
is the case on behalf of the applicant Smt. Kishori Devi that at the
relevant time she was under "legal disability" as there
was a restraint order passed by Registrar of Firms, Societies and
Chits, Uttar Pradesh under which Smt. Kishori Devi was restrained
from acting as a partner of partnership firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad
Agarwal &amp; Brothers and the same came to be set aside by the
learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench in
the year 2011 by order dated 21.09.2011 and therefore, as the said
"legal disability" has been removed immediately
thereafter, the present application has been preferred.  The locus of
Smt. Kishori Devi to represent the applicant - partnership firm
</p><p id="p_84">- M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers and to act as partner
of the partnership firm has been seriously disputed by respondent
No.1.  It is also the case on behalf of the respondent No.1 that
still even as on today Smt. Kishori Devi is under the legal
disability and the order passed by the learned Single Judge quashing
and setting aside the restraint order passed by the Registrar of
Firms has been set aside by the Division Bench.  It is to be noted
that it is the case on behalf of Smt. Kishori Devi that earlier, she
was under "legal disability" pursuant to the restraint
order passed by Registrar of Firms, which has been set aside by the
learned Single Judge vide judgment and order dated 21.09.2011 and
therefore, there is no restraint order now and therefore, she is not
under "legal disability" now.  However, it is not in
dispute and it is an admitted position even by the applicant that the
order passed by the learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High
Court quashing and setting aside the order passed by the Registrar of
Firms restraining Smt. Kishori Devi from acting as a partner of
applicant partnership firm has been set aside by the Division Bench
vide judgment and order dated 15.11.2011 and the matter is remanded
to the learned Single Judge for passing a fresh order in accordance
with law and on merits and the petition before the Madhya Pradesh
High Court is still pending.  Therefore, as such Smt. Kishori Devi
would be still under "legal disability" and she is
restrained from acting as partner of the partnership firm M/s. Dwarka
Prasad Agarwal and Brothers.  Therefore, as such Smt. Kishori Devi
cannot represent the applicant partnership firm as its partner. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_85">[8.3]		Even
otherwise it is required to be noted that even the very Smt. Kishori
Devi in the year 2011 has filed a Civil Suit before the Delhi High
Court being Civil Suit No.1663/2011 for a declaration to declare that
she is partner of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal and Brothers.  Under the
circumstances, even the status of Smt. Kishori Devi as partner of
M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers is under cloud and as
stated herein above as such she is still under "legal
disability" to act as partner of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp;
Brothers. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_86">[8.4]		The
contention on behalf of the applicant relying upon the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has also approved the locus and the right of Smt. Kishori Devi
as heir and legal representative of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal is
concerned, considering the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
dated 07.07.2003 as a whole, the aforesaid has no substance.  In the
decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
not crystallized the rights of the parties and even status of Smt.
Kishori Devi either as heir of Dwarka Prasad Agarwal or the partner
of partnership M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers.  On the
contrary the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said decision has
specifically observed that the disputed question with respect to the
ownership of the newspapers are not decided.  In any case as stated
hereinabove, the very Smt. Kishori Devi has filed a Civil Suit in the
year 2011 before the Delhi High Court for a declaration to declare
that she is the partner of partnership firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad
Agarwal &amp; Brothers and the said suit is still pending.  Under the
circumstances, there is a serious dispute with respect to the locus
of Smt. Kishori Devi to represent the applicant partnership firm as
partner and in any case, as on today she is under "legal
disability" pursuant to the restraint order passed by the
Registrar of Firms and the writ petition before the Madhya Pradesh
High Court against the said order is still pending.  Therefore, it
appears that Smt. Kishori Devi has no locus to represent the
applicant partnership firm as its partner.  However, it is clarified
that the present finding may not be treated as the finding given by
this Court with respect to status of Smt. Kishori Devi as partner and
the present observation shall be confined to the present application
only as the other proceedings are pending before the Madhya Pradesh
High Court as well as Delhi High Court with respect to status of Smt.
Kishori Devi as partner of partnership firm and the same shall be
considered in accordance with law and on merits. 
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_87">[8.5]		Now,
so far as the contention on behalf of the applicant relying upon
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_88">Section 392</a> that even this Court can suo
motu exercise
powers and issue the direction and/or modify the Scheme is concerned,
the aforesaid seems to be attractive but has no substance.  On fair
reading of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_89">Section 392</a>, it confers power upon the
Tribunal and/or the Court who has passed an order under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_90">Section 391</a>
of the Act, 1956 to make an order of winding up of the Company if the
Tribunal or the Court is satisfied that a compromise or an
arrangement sanctioned under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_91">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956 cannot work
satisfactorily with or without modifications.  That is not the case
here.  It is not the case on behalf of the applicant that the Scheme
of Arrangement which has been sanctioned by this Court cannot work
satisfactorily with or without modifications and therefore, the
Company is required to be ordered to be wound up.  Therefore, even
the powers under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_92">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956
cannot be exercised for the relief sought in the present application.
</p> 

 


 


 


<p id="p_88">[8.6]		Now, the
next question which is required to be considered by this Court is
whether the relief which is sought in the present application to
modify the Scheme of Arrangement by this Court on the ground that the
same affects the alleged rights of the applicant, in an application
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_93">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 can be granted or not?  As stated
herein above, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
applicant has specifically stated at the Bar that the present
application be treated to have been filed under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_94">Section 392</a> of the
Act, 1956 only and not under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_89">[8.7]		While
considering the aforesaid issue, the scope and ambit of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_95">Section 392</a>
of the Act, 1956  and the jurisdiction of the Act, 1956 while
exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_96">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 is required to
be considered.  <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_97">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 reads as under: 	
</p> 


<p id="p_90">	392.	Power

(1) Where the Tribunal makes an order under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_98">Section 391</a> sanctioning a

the Tribunal aforesaid is satisfied that a compromise

satisfactorily with or without modifications, it may, either on its
own motion or on the application of any person interested in the

such an order shall be deemed to be an order made under <a href="/doc/1676812/" id="a_100">section 433</a>

</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_95">	Considering
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_102">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956, it appears that it confers power upon

a Company, (a) to supervise the carrying out of the compromise or an

consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or

powers upon such a Tribunal or Court to exercise powers either on his

<p id="p_96">[8.8]		Thus, on
fair reading of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_107">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956, it appears that the

Tribunal or the Court who sanctioned the Scheme either at the time of

of the Act, 1956 has jurisdiction to issue directions from time to

the Tribunal or the Court who sanctioned the Scheme under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_111">Section 391</a>

<p id="p_97">[8.9]		It is to be
noted that in the present application, the applicant has prayed to
modify the scheme of arrangement entered into between "Demerged
Company" and the "Resulting Company" (respondent Nos.1
and 2 herein) which has been sanctioned by this Court vide order
dated 10.10.2006 on the ground that it causes material prejudice to
the rights of the applicant.  It is not the case of the applicant
and/or it is not the prayer of the applicant to modify the scheme on
the ground that the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned as it is, is not
properly workable and/or properly working.  Therefore, the prayer of
the applicant to modify the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned by this
Court on the alleged violation of the right of the applicant, the
same is not required to be modified in exercise of powers under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_116">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956.  Under the circumstances, it appears
that the present application under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_117">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 for
the relief sought in the present application as such would not be
maintainable and/or no such relief can be granted to the applicant in
exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_118">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_98">[8.10]	Now, so far
as the case on behalf of the applicant and/or the prayer of the
applicant to modify the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned by this
Court on the ground that it causes material prejudice to the rights
of the applicant is concerned, at the outset it is required to be
noted that as such while sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement, this
Court has not considered the rights of any of the parties. 
Therefore, it cannot be said that by sanctioning the Scheme of
Arrangement, any of the alleged rights of the applicant has
been affected.  Otherwise also, as held in the cases reported in 
<a href="/doc/24807/" id="a_119">Punjab National Bank
Ltd. vs. Shri Vikram Cotton Mills Ltd. and Another</a> reported
in 40 Company Cases
927 and Mafatlal
Industries Ltd. reported
in 90 Company Cases
247, by sanctioning
the Scheme of Arrangement and/or compromise, the rights of the
applicant if any are not taken away and/or affected.  Even otherwise
as stated herein above the alleged rights of the applicant Smt.
Kishori Devi and/or of M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers in
the respondent Company and/or any other rights are yet to be
adjudicated upon.  The suit filed by Smt. Kishori Devi in the Delhi
High Court for declaration that she be declared as partner of the
partnership firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers is still
pending.  Under the circumstances, the prayer of the applicant to
modify the Scheme of Arrangement sanctioned between the "Demerged
Company" and the "Resulting Company" (respondent Nos.1
and 2 herein) on the ground that the same affects rights of the
applicant, cannot be granted in an application under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_120">Section 392</a> of
the Act, 1956.  Such a relief and prayer is beyond the scope and
ambit of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_121">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956.  Therefore, considering the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_122">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956, it appears that the
powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_123">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 can be exercised by the
Court only for the proper implementation of the Scheme and not
otherwise. The Court's power to modify the Scheme or Arrangement
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_124">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956, relates only to the
implementation and giving effect to the Scheme sanctioned by the
Court and any thing relating to the proper implementation of the
Scheme.  Under the circumstances, the prayer of the applicant to
modify the Scheme sanctioned by this Court cannot be granted under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_125">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 on the alleged violation of the alleged
rights of the applicant if any.  Under the circumstances, no relief
can be granted to the applicant as sought in the present application
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_126">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956.

<p id="p_99">[8.11]	In view of
the above as such this Court is not required to consider any other
submissions on merits.  However, as the learned counsel appearing for
respective parties have addressed the Court at length on other issues
i.e. non-disclosure of the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
dated 07.07.2003 and other litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the
application, while submitting the application for sanctioning the
Scheme of Arrangement between respondent Nos.1 and 2 and the effect
of non-disclosure of such material and the contention on behalf of
the applicant that by not disclosing the relevant materials,
respondent No.1 has played a fraud upon the Court and therefore, this
Court is considering the aforesaid issues also.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_100">[8.12]	It is the
case on behalf of the applicant that in view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003, the position which was
prevailing prior to 29.06.1992, was required to be restored.  Meaning
thereby the ownership of Dainik Bhaskar continued with the
partnership firm M/s. Dwarka Prasad Agarwal &amp; Brothers as the
order passed by the RNI dated 03.09.1992 came to be set aside and
therefore, the same was required to be disclosed by respondent No.1
while submitting the Scheme of Arrangement.  It is also the case on
behalf of the applicant that there were various litigations pending
between the parties as mentioned in para 4(a) of the applicant which
have also not been disclosed by respondent No.1 while submitting the
Scheme of Arrangement and thereby have committed the fraud and have
obtained the order by committing fraud upon the Court and therefore,
on the aforesaid ground it is requested to modify the scheme.  On the
other hand it is the case on behalf of respondent No.1 that whatever
the materials required while submitting the scheme under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_127">Section 391</a>
of the Act, 1956, as required under the law had been declared and
disclosed and therefore, as such there was no concealment of relevant
material which was required while submitting the application for
sanctioning the Scheme.  Therefore, this Court is required to
consider whether respondent No.1 had withheld and/or not disclosed
the relevant material as required while submitting the Scheme of
Arrangement under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_128">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956?  For the aforesaid,
the relevant provision for disclosure of relevant facts/materials

<p id="p_113">[8.13]	Considering

disclose in the Tribunal by affidavit or otherwise, all material
facts relating to the Company, such as latest financial position of

to various litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the applicant,
respondent No.1 has not disclosed the relevant facts / materials and

committing the fraud.  Therefore, it is required to be considered
whether for non-disclosure of any other materials and/or facts other
than the required under <a href="/doc/108996/" id="a_148">Section 391(2)</a> and/or 393(1) &amp; (2) of the

<p id="p_115">[8.15]	On

Court that while submitting the Scheme under <a href="/doc/1518484/" id="a_152">Section 391(1)</a> of the
Act, 1956, the only statutory requirement by the Company would be to
disclose the material facts relating to the companies latest

Company under <a href="/doc/1613691/" id="a_153">Sections 235</a> to <a href="/doc/788458/" id="a_154">351</a> and the like.  Therefore, while

Company who submits the Scheme is not obliged and/or required to

of the Act, 1956 or under <a href="/doc/682416/" id="a_157">Section 393(1)</a> &amp; (2) of the Act, 1956. 
Therefore, as such it cannot be said that by not disclosing the order
passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 or other
litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the application, while
submitting the Scheme of Arrangement, there has been any suppression,
much less material suppression and/or non-disclosure of the facts
which were statutorily required to be disclosed.  It is to be noted
that and it appears that most of the litigations mentioned in para
4(a) of the application as such were disposed of and/or withdrawn as
on the date of proceedings under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_158">Sections 391-394</a> of the Act, 1956. 
Be that as it may, it appears to the Court that when all the relevant
materials which were required to be disclosed statutorily have been
disclosed, by not disclosing the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court dated 07.07.2003 and/or the other litigations mentioned in para
4(a) of the application, there has been no suppression and/or
non-disclosure of the facts which are statutorily required to be

the same is not required to be recalled and/or modified as prayed by
the applicant.

the scope and ambit of jurisdiction of the Company Court, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has culled out following broad contours of such
jurisdiction:
</p> 


<p id="p_118">"(1)	The
sanctioning court has to see to it that all the requisite statutory
procedure for supporting such a scheme has been complied with and
that the requisite meetings as contemplated by <a href="/doc/637987/" id="a_172">section 391(1)(a)</a> have

<p id="p_120">(3)	That

to the class as a whole so as to legitimately bind even the
dissenting members of that class.

<p id="p_121">(4)	That
all necessary material indicated by <a href="/doc/118430/" id="a_174">section 393(1)(a)</a> is placed
before the voters at the concerned meetings as contemplated by
<a href="/doc/1518484/" id="a_175">section 391(1)</a>.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_122">(5)	That
all the requisite material contemplated by the proviso to sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_176">section 391</a> of the Act is placed before the court by the
concerned applicant seeking sanction for such a scheme and the court
gets satisfied about the same. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_123">(6)	That
the proposed scheme of compromise and arrangement is not found to be
violative of any provision of law and is not contrary to public
policy.  For ascertaining the real purpose underlying the scheme with
a view to be satisfied on this aspect, the court, if necessary, can
pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose underlying the scheme
and can judiciously x-ray the same.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_124">(7)	That
the company court has also to satisfy itself that members or class of
members or creditors or class of creditors, as the case may be, were
acting bona fide and in good faith and were not coercing the minority
in order to promote any interest adverse to that of the latter
comprising the same class whom they purported to represent. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_125">(8)	That
the scheme as a whole is also found to be just, fair and reasonable
from the point of view of prudent men of business taking a commercial
decision beneficial to the class represented by them for whom the
scheme is meant.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_126">(9)	Once
the aforesaid broad parameters about the requirements of a scheme for
getting sanction of the court are found to have been met, the court
will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the
commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with
their open eyes have given their approval to the scheme even if in
the view of the court there could be a better scheme for the company
and its members or creditors for whom the scheme is framed.  The
court cannot refuse to sanction such a scheme on that ground as it
would otherwise amount to the court exercising appellate jurisdiction
over the scheme rather than its supervisory jurisdiction."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_127"> Considering
the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the aforesaid decision, it
cannot be said that by not disclosing various litigations enumerated
in para 4(a) of the present application and/or non-disclosing the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003, there has
been a material suppression which will affect sanctioning of the
Scheme.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_128">[8.18]	The
another question will arise whether on the aforesaid ground the
Scheme can be modified in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_177">Section 392</a> of the
Act, 1956?  As discussed hereinabove, the powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_178">Section 392</a> of
the Act, 1956 can be exercised only for proper working of the Scheme
and the powers under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_179">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 cannot be said to
be akin to the review jurisdiction i.e. under Order 47 Rule 1 of the
CPC.  To modify the Scheme which is already sanctioned under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_180">Section
391</a> of the Act, 1956, for proper implementation and working and to
supervise the Scheme for implementation and working as provided under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_181">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 and to modify the Scheme meaning thereby
to recall
the order of sanctioning the Scheme on the ground of non-disclosure
meaning thereby to review the order of sanctioning the scheme would
be different.  It appears to the Court that even in a case it has
been found that particulars/materials which were statutorily required
under <a href="/doc/108996/" id="a_182">Section 391(2)</a> of the Act, 1956 were not disclosed and the
Scheme was got sanctioned, in that case also the same can be reviewed
and/or recalled only while exercising the review jurisdiction under
Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC and not while exercising powers under
<a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_183">Section 392</a> of the Act, 19546.  As stated hereinabove and at the cost
of repetition it is observed that as stated by the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the applicant, the present application is only
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_184">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 and not under Order 47 Rule 1 of
the CPC.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_129">[8.19]	Now,
so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of S.K. Gupta and Anr. (Supra) by
submitting that even the Tribunal / Court can exercise suo
motu powers
as provided under <a href="/doc/506042/" id="a_185">Section 393</a> of the Act, 1956 is concerned, on facts
and for the relief sought in the present application, the provisions
of <a href="/doc/898238/" id="a_186">Section 392(2)</a> of the Act, 1956 would not be applicable. Only in a
case where after an order passed by the Tribunal / Court under
<a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_187">Section 391</a> sanctioning the compromise or arrangement in respect of
company, the Tribunal is satisfied either on its own motion or on the
application of any person interested in the affairs of the company, 
that a compromise or an arrangement sanctioned cannot work
satisfactorily with or without modifications, the Tribunal/Court may
make an order of winding up of the Company.  That is not the case and
the prayer herein.  Therefore, the
aforesaid decision would not be of any assistance to the applicant. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_130">[8.20]	Now,
so far as the prayer of the applicant to modify the Scheme sanctioned
by this Court on the ground that the same has affected rights of the
applicant is concerned, first of all it is required to be noted that
by sanctioning the Scheme of Demerger between respondent Nos.1 and 2,
it cannot be said that rights of the applicant if any are in anyway
affected.  It is required to be noted that while sanctioning the
Scheme of Arrangement under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_188">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956, the
Tribunal or the Court is not required to adjudicate the rights of the
individuals.  Under the circumstances, by sanctioning the Scheme, it
cannot be said that any of the rights of the applicant are in anyway
affected.  Identical question came to be considered by the learned
Single Judge in the case of Divya Vasundhara Financiers Pvt. Ltd.
(Supra) and while considering the power of the Court under <a href="/doc/1639414/" id="a_189">Section
392(1)(b)</a> of the Act, 1956, it is observed and held as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_131">The
power of the court under s.392(1)(b) of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_190">Companies Act</a>, 1956,
is of wide amplitude.  But it cannot be said that it is a power
without any limitation.  There is an inbuilt limitation on the powre
of the court in the section itself.  The limitation is that it can be
invoked only for purposes of proper working of compromise or
arrangement.  The power is a power of superintendence which is to be
exercised by issuing appropriate directions or effecting necessary
modifications so as to ensure the proper working of such compromise
or arrangement.  This power cannot be invoked for purposes of
determination or adjudication of any right or interest claimed by a
company against persons who are not parties to the scheme of
compromise or arrangement, and who dispute such rights or interest in
fact or in law.  This is because, in the first place, the power under
s.392 is a supervisory power for enforcement of a compromise or
arrangement.  The enforcement can be only against
persons who are parties to it.  Secondly, the power of issuing
directions in the course of exercise of such a power of
superintendence in regard to any matter or for modification, as may
be necessary, is only for the proper working of the compromise or
arrangement.  The rights or claims of a company carrying on a scheme
of compromise or arrangement between itself and the creditors and/or
members, or any class of them, can only be enforced in the manner in
which such rights or claims can be enforced under the law.  Merely
because a scheme of compromise or arrangement has been made between a
company
and its creditors or members, it cannot claim that its disputed
rights or claims can be adjudicated upon by a company court which may
be supervising such scheme.  Thirdly, if the Legislature had intended
that the company court supervising the scheme of compromise or
arrangement between a company and its
creditors or members should have the power of an ordinary court to
hold trials for adjudication or determination of disputed rights or
claims of that company against third parties as if it is a court of
ordinary civil jurisdiction, it would have appropriately provided in
the section and invested the company court with the necessary powers.
 A mere comparison of s.392(1) with s.446(2) fortifies this view.  In
the fourth place, if the power invested in a company court under
s.392 is held to be one akin to one under s.446(2), the company court
will be required to assume jurisdiction which it does not possess of
adjudicating or determining the disputed rights between a company and
the persons who are not parties to the scheme of compromise and/or
arrangement as if it is a court of ordinary civil jurisdiction,
irrespective of the question of the court itself and/or the
territorial
jurisdiction in the matter. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_132">[8.21]	Even
as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/24807/" id="a_191">Punjab
National Bank Ltd. vs. Shri Vikram Cotton Mills Ltd</a>. reported
in (1970)
40 Company Cases 927 (SC),
the scheme sanctioned by the Court, as a statutory operation in the
scheme does not release other persons nor party to the scheme from
their obligations.  Under the circumstances, when by sanctioning of
the Scheme of Arrangement between respondent Nos.1 and 2, the rights
of the applicant, if any, are not affected and/or taken away, the
scheme sanctioned by this Court is not required to be modified as
prayed by the applicant in the prayer clause.  At this stage it is
required to be noted that in the prayer clause, the applicant has
sought to review / modify the scheme and that too under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_192">Section 392</a>
of the Act, 1956 on the ground that the same has affected the rights
of the applicant.  Under the circumstances, when by sanctioning the
scheme under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_193">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956 by this Court, the rights
of the applicant, if any, are not taken away and/or affected, the
applicant is not entitled to any relief as sought in the present
application.  Still it is observed that by sanctioning of the Scheme
vide order dated 10.10.2006 between respondent Nos.1 and 2, the right
of any parties inclusive of the applicant, if any, are not affected. 
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_133">[8.22]	Now,
the question would be whether any relief can be granted to the
applicant in the present application which has been filed after a
period of five years of sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement by this
Court.  It is required to be noted and it is not in dispute that the
Scheme of Arrangement between respondent Nos.1 and 2 has been
sanctioned by this Court as far as back on 10.10.2006 and the present
application has been preferred on 03.10.2011 i.e. approximately after
a period of five years.  It is also not in dispute that the Scheme of
Arrangement sanctioned by this Court has been fully implemented and
is in operation since last five years. Under the Scheme of
Arrangement, there are certain rights and obligations and the
transfer of shares etc.  Thus, on implementation of the sanctioned
Scheme of Arrangement, its effect has taken place long back and third
party rights are created.  Under
the circumstances, if the Scheme which has been sanctioned by this
Court as far as back on 10.10.2006 which has already been implemented
since then is modified as prayed for by the applicant, in that case,
number of complications are likely to arise.  It is also required to
be noted at this stage that the Scheme of Arrangement was sanctioned
by this Court at the relevant time after having been satisfied that
all the statutory requirements as provided under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_194">Sections 391</a> -
394 of the Act, 1956 have been complied with by the Company and all
the shareholders, creditors of the respective Companies have approved
the said Scheme and only thereafter the Scheme was sanctioned by this
Court.  It is also not in dispute that at the relevant time public
notice was also issued, however, nobody on behalf of the applicant
objected the Scheme.  The applicant has come out with a case that at
the relevant time she was under the "legal disability" to
represent the applicant partnership firm and therefore, she could not
raise objections at the relevant time and it is the case on behalf of
the applicant Smt. Kishori Devi that in view of the order passed by
the learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dated
29.06.1992, the said "legal disability" has been removed
and therefore, immediately thereafter present application has been
preferred.  However, it is required to be noted and as stated herein
above, the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court quashing and setting aside the restraint orders
dated 08.09.2003 and 07.01.2004 of the Registrar, Firms has been set
aside by the Division Bench and therefore, still the "legal
disability" injuncting Smt. Kishori Devi from acting as a
partner of the applicant partnership firm still exists. Even
otherwise as stated herein above, Smt. Kishori Devi herself
has filed the suit before the Delhi High Court for a declaration to
declare that she is the partner of applicant partnership firm and in
which even respondent No.2-M/s. D.B. Corp Limited is also made
a party.  It is also required to be noted at this stage that even the
applicant has failed to prove satisfactorily that the applicant was
the shareholder and/or the creditor of respondent No.1 Company.  It
appears that even in the Register of respondent No.1 Company, neither
the applicant partnership firm nor even Smt. Kishori Devi were shown
as shareholder and/or the creditors of respondent No.1 Company.  In
any case on the ground of delay and laches and as the present
applicant has been preferred after a period of five years of
sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement by this Court and when the
Scheme of Arrangement has already been implemented and is in
operation since last five years on that ground also the applicant is
not entitled to any relief as prayed in the present application.    
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_134">[8.23]	Now,
so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of MDS and Ors. (Supra) by the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant referred to hereinabove
and on the aspect of fraud on Court by respondent No.1 by not
disclosing various litigations mentioned in para 4(a) of the present
application as well as not disclosing the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court dated 07.07.2003 is concerned, considering the
aforesaid finding by this Court that while submitting the Scheme
under <a href="/doc/1562602/" id="a_195">Section 391</a> of the Act, 1956, respondent No.1 has disclosed all
the relevant materials statutorily required and therefore, there is
no suppression and/or material suppression which
will affect the sanctioning of the Scheme, the aforesaid decision
would not be of any assistance to the applicant.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_135">[8.24]	Now,
so far as reliance placed upon the decision of the Delhi High Court
in the case of Spice Communications Ltd &amp; Anr. (Supra) by which
the Delhi High Court entertained the application to recall the order
sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation filed after a delay of 13
months is concerned, it is required to be noted that even the Delhi
High Court did not recall the order of sanctioning the Scheme of
Amalgamation in its entirety.  Even in the said decision, the Delhi
High Court also considered the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/76762/" id="a_196">Central
Bank of India vs. Ambala Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd</a>. [(1999)3 Comp.
L.J. 98 (Guj)]
observing that due to passage of time it would not be equitable at a
belated stage to set aside the scheme in its entirety.  It is to be
noted that even in the case of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (Supra),
the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the decision of this Court.  It
appears to this Court in the decision of Delhi High Court in the case
of Spice Communications Ltd. (Supra) the Court also considered the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme setting aside the decision of this
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/76762/" id="a_197">Central Bank of India vs. Ambala Sarabhai
Enterprises</a> by which this Court set aside the Scheme of Arrangement
on the ground that the Company played a fraud by suppressing the
material fact and the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that due to
passage of time it would not be equitable at a belated stage to set
aside the Scheme in its entirety and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
said case decided to maintain the order sanctioning the Scheme with
some additional conditions.
</p><p id="p_136"> Therefore also, on the ground of delay and laches also and more
particularly when the Scheme has been implemented since last five
years, the prayer of the applicant to modify the Scheme of
Arrangement sanctioned by this Court as far as back on 10.10.2006
cannot be accepted and granted.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_137">[9.0]		In
view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the applicant is
not entitled to any relief which is sought in the present application
under <a href="/doc/1187271/" id="a_198">Section 392</a> of the Act, 1956 on any ground. Hence, the present
application fails and the same deserves to be dismissed and is,
accordingly, dismissed.  However, in the facts and circumstances of
the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
