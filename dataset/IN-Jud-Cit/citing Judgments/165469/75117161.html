deceptively similar mark thereto or colourable imitation thereof, whether by

using the expression by itself or as part of any other mark/name in respect of

</pre><p id="p_9">3.     According to the respondent, the marks ―Yo!‖ and ―Yo! China‖ have

become distinctive of the respondent and the word ―Yo‖ has acquired a

secondary meaning. Consequently, the respondent claims exclusive right to

use the marks ―Yo!‖ and ―Yo! China‖. The respondent is primarily in the

business of establishing and running Chinese food restaurants. The first ―Yo!

China‖ restaurant is said to have been setup by the respondent in May, 2003

in a Mall in Gurgaon. The respondent now claims to have a chain of about

40 such restaurants operating under the mark ―Yo! China‖, spread over 15

cities across India. Apart from these restaurants, it is alleged by the

respondent that there are a number of kiosks and take-away points where the

repondent's products are sold under the said trademark. According to the

respondent, besides being independently registered, the trademark "Yo!' also

forms an      essential feature of the trade mark, trade dress and product

descriptor of the     products and services offered as "Yo! China". The

trademark "Yo!" travels with the respondent in all its advertisements and

expanded forms of business viz. "Yo! Dimsum", "Yo! On the Go" etc. It is

also alleged that in the year 2005-2006, the respondent innovated its product

line to offer "Yo! on the Go", which was essentially chowmein served in

take-away boxes. Allegedly, the idea is a big hit with the consumers as they



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 3 of 36</span>
 are able to have quality Chinese food (particularly chowmein i.e., ready to

eat noodles) at reasonable prices. Recently this product offering has been

renamed as "Yo!Box".
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">4.     The Respondent claims to have coined and adopted the expression

"Yo! China" in the year 2002 in order to distinguish its business, trade identity

and products/services from those of others. It is contended by the respondent that

today "Yo! China" has become a brand name associated with quality "Chinese

Food at Chinese Prices" and that the target market for the Respondent has been

the market segment which comprises primarily of the youth, for reasons of

affordability. It is further contended that in the last financial year (2008-09)

the sales of the respondent were around Rs 30 crores. It is submitted on

behalf of the respondent that the word 'Yo' (without the exclamation mark) is

primarily American Slang used for calling attention and the trademark "Yo!" (Yo

with an exclamation mark) is coined and arbitrarily applied (not being

descriptive in nature) by the respondent to its goods and services making it

inherently distinctive.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">5.     The respondent is aggrieved by the fact that the appellant is

manufacturing and marketing, inter alia, noodles (chowmein) under the

name and style of ―Maggi Cuppa Mania‖ in two flavours ―Masala Yo!‖ and

―Chilly Chow Yo!‖. It is alleged that around April 2008, the appellant

launched a product under the name and style of "Maggi Cuppa Mania Instant

Noodles" in two flavours i.e., "Masala Yo!" and "Chilly Chow Yo!". The

packing of the appellant's product also displays the words "Open, Fill, Go!",



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                      Page No. 4 of 36</span>
 which, according to the respondent, makes the appellant's product a direct

take-off on the respondent's product "Yo! On the Go". It is alleged that the

concept of selling noodles in a takeaway tumbler leans heavily on the market

segment comprised mainly of young people, which is a time, price and taste

sensitive market and which is the prime market of the respondent for its

products -- "Yo! On the Go" or "Yo! Box".
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">6.     The respondent filed the said suit alleging that the use of the mark

"Yo!" by appellant in the same manner as the registered trade mark "Yo!" of

the respondent was a clear case of infringement. Moreover, it was alleged

that the products of the appellant resemble those of the respondent in many

ways:-- (i) the appellant is using the mark "Yo!' on the packaging of its

products; (ii) the respondent's product is named "Yo! on the Go", and the

appellant adopted a similar tagline on its product i.e., "Open, Fill, Go!";

</p><p id="p_16">(iii) both products are ready-to-eat noodles. According to the respondent,

these facts are not mere coincidences, but, clearly establish that the appellant

has infringed the mark of the respondent and is trying to pass off its products

as those of the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">7.     The appellant, on the other hand, alleges that it is engaged in the

business of manufacturing and selling packaged noodles, under the well

known and registered trade mark MAGGI, having an annual turnover of Rs.

493 crores and 91% of the market share in respect of packaged noodles. It is

alleged that the trade mark MAGGI is extensively used in India since 1974

for culinary products. The appellant introduced packaged instant noodles in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                    Page No. 5 of 36</span>
 a cup under the trade mark MAGGI in two flavours, namely "MASALA"

and "CHILLY CHOW". The appellant contended that in order to attract

attention and add excitement, the flavours were accompanied with the

exclamation "YO!", which has become customary in the trade as an

expression of "excitement and attention" identified with the youth. It was

submitted that the respondent had itself pleaded that "Yo" is an American

slang expression and is used for "calling attention/expressing excitement.‖


</p><p id="p_19">8.     The appellant claimed that ―Yo!‖ was commonly used by numerous

businesses. As examples of the usage of ―Yo!‖, the appellant has placed on

record printouts from various websites of businesses all over the world,

which use the said expression ―Yo‖ with or without an exclamation mark.

They are -- ―Yo! Youth Outlook‖ which has two further products/ services

―Yo! Radio‖ and ―Yo! Blogs‖. The said websites essentially cater to the

youth and provide news etc. concerning the youth.         Then, there is the

website www.yofun.net, which has a product ―Yo!Fun‖. Similarly, there are

products and services carrying the names -- ―Yo Mart‖, ―Yo la‖, ―Yo

Gabba Gabba‖ etc. There is also a site of software developers called ―Yo!

Creations‖. Another voice solution and software development site does

business under the name of ―Yo!‖.         Interestingly, there is a chain of

restaurants in the U.K, Ireland, Middle East and Malaysia, which carries on

business under the name and style -- ―Yo! Sushi.‖ Its takeaway service is

called ―Yo! To Go‖. It was suggested by the learned counsel appearing for

the appellant that ―Yo! China‖ and ―Yo! On the Go‖, which are allegedly




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 6 of 36</span>
 used by the respondent have, in fact, been ―more than inspired‖ by ―Yo!

Sushi‖ and ―Yo! To Go‖.
</p>
<p id="p_20">9.     Before the learned Single Judge, the appellant sought to defend its use

of the expression ―Yo!‖ in respect of its ‗Maggi Cuppa Mania' products,

primarily on the ground that there can be no infringement of the

respondent's registered trademarks because the appellant was not using

―Yo!‖ as a trademark at all, which is a condition precedent for constituting

infringement under Section 29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter

referred to as the ―said Act‖). It was also contended by the appellant that

―Yo!‖ was used merely as a flavour descriptor and, therefore, did not

constitute infringement in view of the provisions of Section 30(2)(a) of the

said Act. With regard to the allegation of passing off, the appellant had

contended that there was no likelihood of any confusion between the

trademarks of the appellant and the respondent.       The trademark of the

appellant was MAGGI and its packaging employed the distinctive red and

yellow combination, which it has been doing since 1974. The expressions

―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖ were only used as flavor descriptors

and not as trademarks. On the other hand, the trademark of the respondent

was ―Yo! China‖ and there was no question of there being any likelihood of

confusion between the two trademarks, namely, ―Yo! China‖ and

―MAGGI‖. It was also contended by the appellant that, in any event, ―Yo‖,

with or without the exclamation mark, is a common or popular expression

which is used worldwide and which originated as American slang and has

been used commonly not only by youngsters in their day-to-day



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 7 of 36</span>
 conversation but has also been used by businesses particularly to attract the

attention of the younger customers. Consequently, it was submitted that

―Yo!‖ cannot be monopolized by the respondent. It was also suggested that

―Yo!‖ could not have been registered in view of the provisions of Section

9(1)(a) of the said Act inasmuch as it was a mark which was incapable of

distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another

person. In other words, the mark ―Yo!‖ was devoid of any distinctive

character.     It was pointed out that the appellant had filed rectification

proceedings seeking cancellation of the respondent's registration before the

Intellectual Property Appellate Board on 19.07.2008 and the same are

pending. It was also contended that ―Yo‖ and ―Yo!‖ were commonly used

in the trade for the purposes of brand imaging so as to target the youth. The

general use of the expression ―Yo!‖, both in day-to-day conversation and in

the trade, clearly established that there was no question of the said

expression having lost his primary meaning and having acquired a secondary

meaning and, therefore, the respondent could not have any exclusive claim

for its use.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">10.    It was also contended that ―Yo!‖ had been registered in favour of the

respondent in respect of ‗restaurants' falling under Class 42, which was

essentially a service and did not relate to any goods. On the other hand, the

appellant's products were goods falling under Class 30 and were not services

falling under Class 42. It was also submitted that Section 17 of the said Act

clearly stipulated that when a trademark consists of several matters, its

registration would confer on the proprietor exclusive right to the use of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 8 of 36</span>
 trademark taken as a whole.        Thus, it was submitted that while the

respondent had registrations under Class 30 in respect of the mark ―Yo!

China‖, the said registrations were in respect of the whole mark ―Yo! China‖

and not just the mark -- ―Yo!‖. The registered mark -- ―Yo! China‖ would,

therefore, have to be taken as a whole and ―Yo!‖ cannot be considered to be

a registered trademark insofar as products falling under Class 30, which

include the subject noodles, are concerned. For all these reasons, it was

urged before the learned Single Judge that the application for ad interim

injunction be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">11.    However, the learned Single Judge returned several prima facie

findings which went against the appellant. It appears that the learned Single

Judge was quite concerned about the fact that there was no explanation

forthcoming from the appellant as to why it had used the exclamation mark

(!) along with the word ―Yo‖. The learned Single Judge also found, prima

facie, that ―Yo!‖ and ―Yo! China‖ were not descriptive of the respondent's

products but were arbitrary marks and that they had acquired distinctiveness

through usage since 2002. He observed that, prima facie it appeared that

these marks had acquired a secondary meaning insofar as chowmein

(noodles) were concerned.      A prima facie view was also taken by the

learned Single Judge that the respondent's registrations were not liable to be

cancelled. Further, that ―Yo!‖ was not generic in nature and that the goods

and services of the respondent and goods of the appellant were overlapping

and similar, both being noodles (chowmein). Rejecting the argument of the

appellant that there was no infringement because the appellant did not use

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 9 of 36</span>
 the expression ―Yo!‖ as a trademark or as a part of its trademark, the learned

Single Judge held that ―Yo!‖ was used in a similar manner and that the use

of the mark ―Yo!‖ by the appellant ―appears‖ to fall within Section 29(4)(b)

of the said Act. The learned Single Judge then relied on the case of <a href="/doc/128046/" id="a_1">Indian

Shaving Products v. Gift Pack and Another</a>: 1998 PTC (18) 698 where the

two marks in question were ―Duracell Ultra‖ and ―BPL Ultra‖. Reliance

was also placed on the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1741869/" id="a_2">Yahoo, Inc v. Akash Arora</a>:

1999 PTC (19) 201 where the dispute was between the names of two

websites, namely, ―Yahooindia.com‖ and ―Yahoo.com‖.              The learned

Single Judge also found, prima facie, that there was no merit in the

appellant's submissions that the use of ―Yo!‖ by it was not likely to lead to

any confusion as it was used in conjunction with the words ―Masala‖ and

―Chilly Chow‖ and the trademark ―Maggi‖.          The learned Single Judge

observed that ―Yo!‖ was distinctive of the goods and services of the

respondents and as such there was likelihood of confusion that the

appellant's products were connected with those of the respondents.

Referring to the decision in <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_3">Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd and Another

v. Sudhir Bhatia and Others</a>: 2004 PTC (28) 121 (SC), the learned Single

Judge, observing that clearly an injunction must follow when the adoption of

the mark was dishonest, allowed the application of ad interim injunction of

the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">12.    The impugned order is assailed before us by the appellant on all the

grounds urged before the learned Single Judge but, principally, on the

ground that the learned Single Judge failed to appreciate that an action for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 10 of 36</span>
 infringement under section 29(1) of the said Act could only be brought

where the defendant uses a mark ―as a trade mark‖.          According to the

learned counsel for the appellant, it is a condition precedent under Section

29(1) that, in order to constitute infringement, the mark complained of must

be "used as a trade mark" i.e., in a manner "indicative of trade origin" as per

the definition of trade mark under Section 2(i)(zb). Reliance was placed on

Mothercare U.K. Ltd. v. Penguin Books Ltd: 1988 R.P.C. 113. It was

submitted that the whole law of Trade Marks -- whether 'statutory law'

relating to infringement or 'common law' relating to passing off --            is

concerned with deception and confusion with regard to trade origin and the

use of marks indicating the same. The trade origin of the appellant's

packaged noodles is MAGGI which is boldly written on the packaging. It

was contended that the impugned judgment has created a monopoly in the

commonly used exclamation "Yo!" in favour of the Respondent which is

contrary to law.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">13.    Another ground urged before us concerned the scope of the right

conferred upon registration of a trademark. It was submitted that the right

conferred under Section 28 is infringed under Section 29 only if the

impugned trade mark is used for ―same or similar‖ goods or services that the

Plaintiff's trade mark is registered for. Hence, a registered trade mark for

services is infringed only when used for those services. Otherwise, there was

no need for the legislature to add classes 35 to 42 (SERVICES) to the Fourth

Schedule of the Trade Mark Rules. Reliance was placed on Asian Paints



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 11 of 36</span>
 Ltd. Vs. Home Solutions Retail (I) Ltd: 2007 (35) PTC 697(Bom) (para 5).

It was submitted that the mark "Yo!" per se is not registered for noodles

which falls in class 30 and that the learned Single Judge ignored this

distinction. "Yo!" is registered only for restaurant services in class 42. As

far as registration of the trade mark "Yo! China" in class 30 is concerned, the

same does not give an exclusive right of use to a part thereof, namely "Yo!",

on account of the prohibition laid down by Section 17 of the Act. Hence,

there is no infringement. Reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/147065063/" id="a_4">Three-N-Products P. Ltd

v. Emami Limited</a>: 2008 (4) CHN 608.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">14.    Then it was urged before us by the learned counsel for the appellant

that the learned Single Judge erred in holding that the provisions of section

29(4) and (5) applied inasmuch as this was not even a case pleaded in the

plaint. The suit is based on the pleadings that the goods of the appellant and

the respondent are the same/similar. A reference was made to paragraph

No.24 of the plaint:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       ―24. It is well settled principle of law that if the essential
       features of a registered Trade Mark are adopted by the
       Defendant, then the fact that other writings or marks on the
       goods or packaging in which the Defendant sells his goods are
       different are immaterial and the plaintiff has a statutory right to
       seek protection of his exclusive right to use his Trade Mark. A
       Trade Mark has only one source and no one other that the
       registered proprietor has the right to use the same. ―Yo!‖ is the
       most essential feature of the plaintiff's Trade Mark. The use by
       the defendant of a mark which is identical to the plaintiff's trade
       mark amounts to infringement and the plaintiff has a statutory
       remedy to protect his mark. Further, the fact that the

       the same consumer base and both dealing with noodles

<p id="p_31"> 15.    It was further submitted that even otherwise, Section 29(4) did not

apply as there was no trade mark usage of "Yo!" and that any other

interpretation would render Section 29(1) redundant, which, in turn, would

be against the permitted rules of interpretation. Reliance was placed on

Illachi Devi Vs. Jain Society: (2003) 8 SCC 413. It was contended that

what would not amount to infringement for "identical goods", cannot

amount to infringement for "different goods" and that the test of

infringement applicable to "different goods" cannot be wider than the test of

infringement for "identical/similar goods".
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">16.    It was also reiterated that "Yo!" is a popular exclamation commonly

used by the trade and is a generic expression. Consequently, it cannot be

considered as a distinctive or a well known trade mark, which is a condition

precedent for the applicability of Section 29(4). It was submitted that the

Respondent has allegedly used "Yo! CHINA" as a trade mark but, no

material has been produced by the respondent to show that "Yo!", by itself,

has been used as a trade mark by the respondent or that it has acquired the

status of a "well known" trade mark.

</p><p id="p_35">17.    The learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that, in any event,

infringement is not made out since use of "Yo!" by the appellant in

conjunction with ―masala‖ and ―chilly chow‖ cannot lead to any confusion

or deception inasmuch as the appellant's product is well distinguished by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 13 of 36</span>
 trade mark MAGGI and its packaging is entirely different and distinct from

that employed by the respondent. It was contended that the test of deceptive

similarity for the purposes of an infringement action and a passing off action

is the same where the trade marks are not identical. Reliance was placed on

<a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_5">Ruston &amp; Hornby Ltd. v. Z. Engineering Co</a>.: AIR 1970 SC 1649 (para).

The learned counsel contended that the Learned Single Judge disregarded

this test of deceptive similarity. He drew our attention to the appellant's

trade mark and packagings and those employed by the respondent to submit

that there is no similarity, what to speak of deceptive similarity, between

them.

</p><p id="p_38">18.    Continuing on this theme, the learned counsel submitted that, as there

is no similarity whatsoever between the competing trademarks and the

packaging, the question of passing off also would not arise. The appellant's

packaged noodles are well distinguished by the well known trade mark

MAGGI and its distinctive packaging. Furthermore, the appellant has a 91%

market share and Rs. 493 crores annual turnover as compared to

respondent's total turnover of Rs. 21 crores. Thus, the question of piggy-

backing or trading upon the goodwill of the respondent by the appellant

defies all logic. Reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_6">Durga Dutt Sharma v. N.P.

Laboratories</a>: AIR 1965 SC 980 (para 28).

<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">19.    Lastly, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the reliance

placed by the learned Single Judge on Indian Shaving Products Ltd (supra)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                 Page No. 15 of 36</span>
 and Yahoo Inc. (supra) was wholly misplaced inasmuch as both these were

cases of "trade mark usage", which is not the case here. It was therefore

submitted that the impugned order be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">20.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent fully

supported the impugned order and contended that no interference was called

for. First of all, it was submitted that the plea of the appellant with regard to

―Yo!‖ not being used by it as a trade mark was not tenable. According to the

learned counsel, section 29 of the said Act has various independent sub-

sections under which cases of infringement may fall. Each sub-section

provides for a different situation and each is independent of the other. It was

submitted that, by virtue of section 29(4), protection is provided to a

registered trade mark even if the impugned mark is used for goods and

services which are not similar to the goods and services in respect of which

the trade mark is registered. It was further submitted that section 29(4) does

not require that the impugned mark has to be used as a trademark. In this

context, the learned counsel took the plea that the respondent's mark "Yo!"

is registered in Class 42 (Restaurant) and the appellant, by using the

identical mark "Yo!" in the course of its trade, has made itself liable for an

action of infringement under section 29(4) of the said Act, independent of

the other provisions of section 29.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">21.    Secondly, it was contended that, similarly, section 29(2) (a) also does

not require that, to constitute infringement, the impugned mark must be

used as a trademark. It was submitted that the appellant is using the mark



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                    Page No. 16 of 36</span>
 "Yo!" in the course of its trade by affixing it to the packaging of its products

and advertising on all media. Furthermore, the mark "Yo!" is an essential

feature of the respondent's mark "Yo! China", meaning thereby that the

usage of "Yo!" by the appellant is identical to the registered trademark of the

respondent. It was contended that since the respondent's trademark "Yo!

China" is registered in class 30 and the appellant is also selling noodles

which are covered under class 30, there is similarity of goods and such usage

is deliberate with the intent to create confusion in the target market segment.

The plea is that, therefore, conditions of Section 29(2)(a) are satisfied and

the appellant is liable for infringement. Reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_7">Kaviraj

Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>:

AIR 1965 SC 980 (para 28) for the proposition that if the essential features

of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the

fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on

the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences or

indicate a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the

mark, would be immaterial.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">22.    Thirdly, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the

appellant, by using the mark ―Yo!‖ in the course of its trade is causing

serious injury by diluting the trademark of the respondent. Reliance was

placed on <a href="/doc/1068613/" id="a_8">Catterpillar Inc. v. Mehtab Ahmed &amp; Ors</a>.: 2002 VI AD (Delhi)

181 to submit that a trademark is like a property and no unauthorized person

can be permitted to commit trespass.

<p id="p_47">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                   Page No. 17 of 36</span>
</p><p id="p_48"> 23.    Fourthly, it was contended that the appellant has failed to show as to

how ―Yo!‖ could be regarded as a flavour descriptor when used in

conjunction with ―masala‖ and ―chilly chow‖ so as to enable the appellant to

seek protection under section 30(2)(a) of the said Act. It was submitted that

the appellant has been using ―Masala‖ as a flavour descriptor on its regular

packaging of "Maggi 2 minutes noodles" for many years. As such, there is

no justification for the appellant to use "Yo!". According to the learned

counsel for the respondent, from the above, it is abundantly clear that the

appellant was aware of the success of respondent's "Yo! On the Go" product

and the whole idea of adding the suffix "Yo!" to its aforesaid two flavours

"Masala" and "Chilly Chow" was to give an impression of commercial

connection between the two and thereby capitalize on the goodwill of the

respondent's product when targeting a new market segment.


</p><p id="p_49">24.    Fifthly, it was submitted that the trademark law does not make any

distinction between a larger market share holder and a smaller market

shareholder, thus, the plea of the appellant with regard to it having a 91%

market share is of no consequence. Further, whether "Yo!" is used in small

or big letters is immaterial as the use itself constitutes infringement.


</p><p id="p_50">25.    Sixthly, with regard to the appellant's contention that ―Yo!‖ is a

generic expression, it was submitted by the learned counsel for the

respondent that even generic, common and descriptive words can be

protected if they acquire a secondary meaning.          In this context, it was

submitted that the expressions "Yo!" and "Yo! China" due to continuous,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                     Page No. 18 of 36</span>
 extensive, substantial and open use for over six years, combined with the

excellence of the products and services offered by the respondent under the

said trademark/ trade name and backed by extensive sales and promotional

efforts have become distinctive of the respondent in the eyes of the

consumers. Reliance was placed on Indian Shaving Products Ltd (supra)

and <a href="/doc/920066/" id="a_9">Godfrey Philips India Ltd. v. Girnar Food &amp; Beverages (P) Ltd</a>:

(2004) 5 SCC 257 (para 4).
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">26.    Lastly, it was submitted that in addition to infringing the trademark of the

respondent, the appellant is also liable for passing off its products as that of the

respondent inasmuch as the trademark "Yo!" had become distinctive of the

services and goods offered by the respondent and use of such mark by the

appellant on its products was likely to lead to confusion and deception in the

minds of consumers that the product of the appellant has some connection with

the respondent's products and services.

be dismissed.

the following points need to be determined:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       1.     Whether the appellant uses the expression ―Yo‖ (with or
              without the exclamation mark ―!‖) on its Maggi Cuppa Mania

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       2.     If the answer to point 1 is in the negative, would the present

              learned Single Judge?

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                      Page No. 19 of 36</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        3.     Whether the expressions ―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖
              can be said to be flavour descriptors and hence eligible for
              protection under section 30(2)(a) of the said Act against an
              infringement action ?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">Point 1:
</p>
<p id="p_58">29.    The appellant has used the expression ―Yo‖ in conjunction with

―Masala‖ and ―Chilly Chow‖ which describe the two flavours of the

appellant's product Maggi Cuppa Mania. It has not used the said expression

―Yo!‖ independently or as part of its trade mark which remains ‗Maggi'.

Nor is the expression used as a part of its product name ―Cuppa Mania‖.

Section 2(1)(m) of the said Act defines ―mark‖ as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       ―(m) ‗‗mark'' includes a device, brand, heading, label, ticket,
       name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods,

Clearly, ―Yo‖ (with or without the exclamation mark), being a word, would

fall within this definition of ―mark‖. Section 2(1)(zb) defines ―trade mark‖

in the following manner:-

<p id="p_59"> From the manner in which ―Yo‖ is used in the expressions ―Masala Yo!‖

and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖ in the appellant's products displayed above it does

not appear that it has been used for the purpose of indicating a connection

between the appellant's products and the respondent. Consequently, the third

ingredient mentioned above is not satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">32.    At this juncture, it would be appropriate to also deal with the learned

Single Judge's observation that there was no explanation forthcoming from

the appellant as to why it had used the exclamation mark (!) along with the

word ―Yo‖.        First of all, the appellant did not use the word ―Yo‖

independently.     It was used in conjunction with ―Masala‖ and ―Chilly

Chow‖. Secondly, since the expressions used by the appellant are ―Masala

Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖, it cannot be said that the appellant used the

mark ―Yo!‖ (ie., ―Yo‖ with the exclamation mark ―!‖) or that the

exclamation mark ―!‖ simply ended the whole expressions ―Masala Yo‖ and

―Chilly Chow‖. The word ―Yo‖ is an interjection and is ―used especially to

 call attention, to indicate attentiveness, or to express affirmation‖ (see:

Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary). The words ―Masala‖ (spice or spicy)

and ―Chilly Chow‖ denote flavours. The word ―Yo‖ following these words

only calls attention of the customers to the flavours and expresses

affirmation of the flavour of the product. The exclamation mark ―!‖ ends the

expressions with a further emphasis.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">33.    Coming back to point no.1, we find that there is clear prima facie

indication that the mark ―Yo‖ (with or without the exclamation mark ―!‖)

was not used by the appellant as a trade mark. The consequence of this is

that infringement under section 29(1) is not made out. Let us explain how.

Section 29(1) stipulates that:-
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">         ―a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not
         being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of
         permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is
         identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in
         relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade
         mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of
         the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_65">34.    The key words are - ―and in such manner as to render the use of the

mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark‖. Thus, unless the

mark in question is used in such manner, the use of the mark by itself would

not amount to infringement under sub-section (1) of section 29 of the said

Act.    We have already seen that the mark ―Yo‖ (with or without the

exclamation mark ―!‖) has not be used as a trade mark nor is its use likely to

be taken as being used as a trade mark.         Consequently, this necessary

ingredient of section 29(1) is missing. This takes us to point no.2.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                   Page No. 23 of 36</span>
 Point 2:
</p>
<p id="p_66">35.    The prima facie finding of the learned Single Judge is that

infringement is made out under section 29(4) or (5) of the said Act. We

shall first consider the applicability of section 29(4). The said provision

reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                  ―(4) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person
                       who, not being a registered proprietor or a person

                       of trade, a mark which--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                        (a)   is identical with or similar to the registered

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                        (b)   is used in relation to goods or services which
                              are not similar to those for which the trade
                              mark is registered; and

                              India and the use of the mark without due
                              cause takes unfair advantage of or is
                              detrimental to, the distinctive character or
                              repute of the registered trade mark.‖
                                                         (emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_67">36.    We may recall that the learned Single Judge held that the use of the

mark ―Yo!‖ by the appellant ―appears‖ to fall within Section 29(4)(b) of the

said Act. And, in so concluding, the learned Single Judge, in our view, fell

into error. All the clauses (a) to (c) of sub-section (4) of section 29 are to be

cumulatively satisfied before a case of infringement can be established. It is

not as if the said clauses are disjunctive or are to be read independently. It is

not sufficient for making out a case of infringement under section 29(4) of

the said Act to say that the case falls under clause (a) or clause (b) or clause




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                      Page No. 24 of 36</span>
</p><p id="p_68"> (c). The conditions specified in all the three clauses have to be satisfied.

This is obvious from the word ―and‖ used in each of the said three clauses.


</p><p id="p_69">37.     We need to consider each clause. Clause (a) of section 29(4) requires

that the mark in question be identical with or similar to the registered trade

mark.     The mark used by the appellant is ―Yo‖ (with or without the

exclamation mark). The respondent's trade mark ―Yo!‖ is registered for T-

shirts etc., under class 25 and for restaurants under class 42.              The

respondent's trade mark ―Yo! China‖ is registered under classes 29 (meat,

fish, poultry etc.), 30 (which includes noodles) and 32 (Beer, ale, port etc.).

While the appellant's mark ―Yo‖ (with or without the exclamation mark)

could be regarded to be identical with or, at least, similar to the respondent's

registered trade mark ―Yo!‖, the same cannot be said in respect of the

respondent's trade mark ―Yo! China‖. We agree with the submission made

on behalf of the appellant that the trade mark as a whole is to be seen in view

of the provisions of section 17 of the said Act. Considered in this light, the

mark ―Yo‖ and the registered trade mark ―Yo! China‖, taken as a whole, are

neither identical nor similar. So, it is only when ―Yo‖ is compared with the

registered trade mark ―Yo!‖ that the condition specified in clause (a) of

section 29(4) is satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">38.     Clause (b) stipulates that the mark in question must be used in relation

to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark

is registered. The mark ―Yo‖ is used by the appellant in respect of noodles

which fall under class 30. Whereas, the registered trade mark ―Yo!‖ of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                   Page No. 25 of 36</span>
 respondent is in respect of T-shirts etc., under class 25 and restaurants under

class 42. Noodles are goods which are entirely different from T-shirts under

class 25 or the service of restaurants under class 42. So, when ―Yo‖ is

compared with ―Yo!‖, in the facts of this case, the condition specified in

clause (b) is also satisfied. But, this is not sufficient to constitute

infringement as the conditions prescribed in clause (c) must also be fulfilled.


</p><p id="p_72">39.    Clause (c) requires several conditions to be satisfied. They are:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                  1.   The registered trade mark must have a reputation
                       in India; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                  2.   The use of the mark in question must be without
                       due cause; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                  3.   Such use must take unfair advantage of or be
                       detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of
                       the registered trade mark.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_73">40.    The first question which arises is this - does ―Yo!‖ have a reputation

in India? While the respondent has placed material on record to prima facie

establish that it has continuously, and openly used the trade mark ―Yo!

China‖ for over six years in respect of its chain of restaurants, there is little,

if at all, to suggest that it has used so used the mark ―Yo!‖. We must

emphasize that we are not, for the purposes of clause (c), concerned with the

registered trade mark ―Yo! China‖ because that mark ―failed‖ the test of

clause (a). This distinction between the two separate marks ―Yo! China‖

and ―Yo!‖, in the context of their separate and independent reputations in

India, escaped the attention of the learned Single Judge. So, while the mark

―Yo‖ as used by the appellant may be regarded to be similar if not identical


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                      Page No. 26 of 36</span>
 to the respondent's registered trade mark ―Yo!‖, there is nothing on record to

establish, even prima facie, that the latter trade mark has been so

continuously or extensively used that it has developed a ―reputation‖ in

India.
</p>
<p id="p_74">

</p><p id="p_75">41.      The next question which requires to be considered in the context of

clause (c) is this - has the appellant used the mark ―Yo‖ without due cause?

In other words, is there a tenable explanation for the use of the mark ―Yo‖

by the appellant? It must be remembered that we have already concluded,

prima facie, that the mark ―Yo‖ has not been used by the appellant as a trade

mark. In fact, the word ―Yo‖ has been used as part of the expressions

―Masala Yo!‖ and Chilly Chow Yo!‖. The appellant has explained that the

word ―Yo‖ has been used in both expressions to invite the attention of the

customers (and, particularly the younger customers who are prone to use the

word ―Yo‖ in their day-to-day conversations) to the flavours ―masala‖ and

―chilly chow‖. This, to us, is a plausible explanation. Consequently, it

cannot be said that the mark ―Yo‖ was used without due cause. Mere use of

the mark ―Yo‖ would not bring it within the mischief of clause (c) of section

29(4). Because if that was the intention of parliament then the expression

―without due cause‖ would not have been used.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">42.      The third and last question which could have arisen in the context of

clause (c) is - does the use of the mark ―Yo‖ by the appellants take unfair

advantage of or is detrimental to the ―distinctive character‖ or repute of the

registered trade mark? But such a question does not arise in the facts of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 27 of 36</span>
 present case because the other necessary conditions of ―reputation in India‖

and ―without due cause‖, as pointed out above, have not been fulfilled.


</p><p id="p_78">43.    From the foregoing discussion, it is obvious that section 29(4) would

not apply and the learned Single Judge erred in holding otherwise.


</p><p id="p_79">44.    We shall now consider the applicability of section 29(5) of the said

Act, which reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       ―(5) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person if he uses
       such registered trade mark, as his trade name or part of his trade
       name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of
       his business concern dealing in goods or services in respect of
       which the trade mark is registered.‖


Infringement of the kind referred to in the above provision can only occur if

the ‗infringer' uses another's registered trade mark as his trade name or part

of his trade name or name of his business concern or part of the name of his

business concern, dealing in the goods or services in respect of which the

trade mark is registered. The appellant has not used ―Yo!‖ as its trade name

(or part of its trade name). Nor has the appellant used the said marks as the

name of its business concern (or part of such name of its business concern).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_81">Thus, infringement of the kind referred to in section 29(5) is also not made

out.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">45.    The answer to Point No.2 is that a case of infringement is not made

out against the appellant under section 29(4) or (5) of the said Act.


Point 3:
</p>
<p id="p_84">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                   Page No. 28 of 36</span>
</p><p id="p_85"> 46.    The question is whether the expressions ―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly

Chow Yo!‖ can be said to be flavour descriptors and hence eligible for

protection under section 30(2)(a) of the said Act against an infringement

action? Section 30(2)(a) is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">                  ―(2) A registered trade mark is not infringed where--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">                        (a)   the use in relation to goods or services
                              indicates the kind, quality, quantity,
                              intended purpose, value, geographical
                              origin, the time of production of goods or of
                              rendering of services or other characteristics
                              of goods or services;‖


</blockquote><p id="p_86">47.    The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent is that ―Yo‖

cannot be regarded as a flavour descriptor as sought to be alleged by the

appellant. But, it must be kept in mind that the word ―Yo‖ has not been used

in isolation. Had it been used alone, independent of any other word, phrase

or expression, there might have been merit in what was contended on behalf

of the respondent. Here, ―Yo‖ is used as an integral part of the expressions

―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖. The said expressions do describe the

characteristics of the goods in the sense that they refer to the flavours of the

noodles. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that ―Yo‖ by itself does

not describe any flavour and that it has been added ‗mischievously'. But, it

may be argued with equal vigour that the use of the word ―Yo‖ is not mere

surplusage or mischievous as it has been used to provide emphasis to the

flavours ―Masala‖ and ―Chilly Chow‖ in a manner which appeals to the

customers and, especially, to the younger customers. If the latter argument

were to be accepted then the defence under section 30(2)(a) of the said Act

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                      Page No. 29 of 36</span>
 would be available to the appellant. That , of course, would have to await a

final determination in the suit. But, at this interlocutory stage the least that

can be said is that the appellant's submission that the mark ―Yo‖ has been

used as a part of a flavour descriptor is at least an arguable one and cannot

be shut out at the threshold.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">48.    In this context it would be necessary to re-state the principles

governing the grant of an interlocutory injunction, particularly, in trade mark

cases. The grant of an interlocutory injunction is a matter of discretion of

the court. However, as pointed out in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_10">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd v. Coca

Cola Co</a>.: (1995) 5 SCC 545 (at page 574), while exercising this discretion

the court applies the following tests:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">                  ―(i)    whether the plaintiff has a prima facie case;

                  (ii)    whether the balance of convenience is in favour of
                          the plaintiff; and

</pre><p id="p_89">                  (iii)   whether the plaintiff would suffer an irreparable
                          injury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is
                          disallowed.‖

</p><p id="p_90">49.    Of the three tests, the requirement of the plaintiff demonstrating a

prima facie case has witnessed several changes through time. The first

change came as a result of the English decision (House of Lords) in the case

of American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd: (1975) 1 All ER 504 (HL)

wherein it was held (at page 510):-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">       ―Your Lordships should in my view take this opportunity of
       declaring that there is no such rule. The use of such expressions
       as ‗a probability', ‗a prima facie case', or ‗a strong prima facie
       case' in the context of the exercise of a discretionary power to
       grant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion as to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                           Page No. 30 of 36</span>
        object sought to be achieved by this form of temporary relief.</blockquote><p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">       The court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not
       frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious
       question to be tried.‖


This meant that the stricter regime of establishing a ‗strong' prima facie case

was replaced by the more liberal requirement of the plaintiff showing that

his claim was not frivolous or vexatious in the sense that there was a serious

question to be tried or a triable issue to be decided.       The principle of

sufficiency of a ―triable issue‖ as a condition for grant of an interlocutory

injunction was recognised in India as well (see: <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_11">Wander Ltd v. Antox India

(P) Ltd</a>: (1990) Supp SCC 727; <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_12">Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet

Machines (P) Ltd</a>: (1994) 2 SCC 448). However, as pointed out in <a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_13">S.M.

Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd</a>.: (2000) 5 SCC 573 (at page 590), the

Supreme Court, through its decision in Gujarat Bottling (supra), ―again

adverted to the prima facie principle while granting temporary injunction‖.

In Dyechem (supra), the Supreme Court clarified that the decision in

American Cyanamid (supra) was looked at from a fresh perspective in

Series 5 Software Ltd. v. Clarke: (1996) 1 All ER 853 (ChD) inasmuch as

it was observed in the latter case that American Cyanamid (supra) could not

be understood as having laid down anything inconsistent with the old

practice and that it did not lay down that the relative strengths of the case of

each party need not be gone into. The Supreme Court also noted that ‗now'

the courts in England go into the question of comparative strength of the

cases of rival parties, apart from the other requirements of balance of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                   Page No. 31 of 36</span>
 convenience and irreparable injury which cannot be compensated in money.

The Supreme Court, after noting the said development in the law, held:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">       ―Therefore, in trademark matters, it is now necessary to go into
       the question of ―comparable strength‖ of the cases of either
       party, apart from balance of convenience.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_93">50.    This was re-affirmed by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_14">Cadila Health Care

Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>: (2001) 5 SCC 73 (at page 87):-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                  ―One of the questions which this Court considered was
                  that for grant of temporary injunction, should the court
                  go by the principle of prima facie case, apart from
                  balance of convenience, or comparative strength of the
                  case of either parties or by finding out if the plaintiff has
                  raised a ―triable issue‖? While considering various
                  decisions on the point in issue, this Court rightly
                  concluded at p. 591 as follows: (SCC para 21)
                         ‗Therefore, in trade mark matters, it is now
                         necessary to go into the question of
                         ‗comparable strength' of the cases of either
                         party, apart from balance of convenience.'‖


</blockquote><p id="p_94">51.    So, the test of prima facie case as traditionally understood has been

replaced, at least in trade mark matters, by the test of comparative strengths

of the rival cases. This is also in keeping with the requirements of the said

Act inasmuch as it not only describes what amounts to infringement (see:

section 29) but it also makes provision for what does not amount to

infringement (see: section 30).
</p>
<p id="p_95">

</p><p id="p_96">52.    Thus, apart from examining the case in the context of section 29 of

the said Act only from the standpoint of the respondent/plaintiff, it was also

incumbent upon the learned Single Judge to consider the relative or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                         Page No. 32 of 36</span>
 comparative strength of the appellant's/defendant's case both under section

29 and section 30(2)(a) of the said Act.       The contention raised by the

appellant that ―Yo‖ was not used independent of the expressions ―Masala‖

and ―Chilly Chow‖, which clearly indicate flavours, but, as part of the

complete expressions ―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖ and was,

therefore, entitled to the protection under section 30(2)(a), was ‗strong'

enough in the balance of comparative strengths to deny the respondent an

interlocutory injunction.     This vital consideration of the comparative

strengths of the rival cases is missing in the impugned decision.


</p><p id="p_97">53.    We are also of the view that the reliance placed by the learned Single

Judge on Indian Shaving Products          (supra), where the two marks in

question were ―Duracell Ultra‖ and ―BPL Ultra‖ and on Yahoo Inc (supra),

where the dispute was between the names of two websites, namely,

―Yahooindia.com‖ and ―Yahoo.com‖, was misplaced. This is so because in

both the said decisions the rival marks were used as trade marks, whereas in

the present case the appellant's use of the mark ―Yo‖ is not as a trade mark.


</p><p id="p_98">54.    The learned Single Judge, as mentioned above, found, prima facie,

that ―Yo!‖ and ―Yo! China‖ had acquired distinctiveness through usage

since 2002. He also observed that, prima facie, it appeared that these marks

had acquired a ‗secondary' meaning insofar as chowmein (noodles) were

concerned. We shall briefly dwell on these prima facie conclusions of the

learned Single Judge.       We have already indicated that though there is

material to show continuous use of the mark ―Yo! China‖ by the respondent



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                     Page No. 33 of 36</span>
 in respect of its restaurant business, there was no material before the learned

Single Judge with regard to the use, by the respondent, of the mark ―Yo!‖ It

must also be remembered that the dispute here is with the use of the mark

―Yo‖ (with or without the exclamation mark) and, therefore, the comparison

has to be made with the repondent's registered trade mark ―Yo!‖ and not

―Yo! China‖ which, taken as a whole, cannot be confused with ―Yo‖. There

was no material before the learned Single Judge to conclude, prima facie of

course, that ―Yo!‖ had acquired distinctiveness through usage since 2002. A

trade mark acquires distinctiveness when, in the eyes of the public, it

distinguishes the goods or services connected with the proprietor of the mark

from those connected with others. Does ―Yo!‖ pass this test? On the basis

of the material before us and upon a prima facie look, the answer is - No.

Distinctiveness of a mark may arise in two ways: (1) it may be inherently

distinctive; (2) it may acquire distinctiveness by developing a secondary

meaning. A secondary meaning results when, "in the minds of the public,

the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of the product

rather than the product itself." (see: Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives

Laboratories, Inc.: 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11, 72 L. Ed. 2d 606). On the

basis of the material on record it cannot be said that the dictionary and

popular meaning of the word ―Yo‖ as an exclamation or as an expression

calling attention is lost and whenever the word ―Yo‖ (with or without the

exclamation mark) appears on a product or in relation to a service (even if

used as a trade mark) the minds of the public are straightaway directed to the

source of the product or service. At this interlocutory stage, there is nothing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">FAO (OS) 255/09                                                  Page No. 34 of 36</span>
 to suggest that the word ―Yo‖ in ―Masala Yo!‖ and ―Chilly Chow Yo!‖

would create a connection in the minds of the customers with the respondent

as being the source of the product. On the contrary, the use of the mark

―Yo‖, retains its primary meaning of inviting attention or as an exclamation.

This is all the more so because the appellant's distinctive trade mark

―MAGGI‖ is prominently displayed on the appellant's ―Cuppa Mania‖

products.

ought to be slow in interfering with the discretionary jurisdiction of the trial

court in the grant of interlocutory injunctions. However, it was also pointed

out in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_15">Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel</a>,(2006)
