 30/06/1979 when he retired as a drama producer (Marathi).  It 

 is the petitioner's case that when he was serving, the staff artists 

 of All India Radio were not treated as government servants and 

 were not entitled to the pension but to contributory provident 

 fund   which   the   petitioner   received   when   he   retired.     By 

 communication dated 26/11/1991 addressed by the Ministry of 

 Information   and   Broadcasting,   Government   of   India   to   the 

 Director General, All India Radio, New Delhi, it was informed 

 that staff artists of All India Radio were entitled to pensionary 

 benefits subject to the terms and conditions set out in the letter. 

 The benefit of pension was extended with retrospective effect for 

 those staff artists who had retired on or after 06/03/1982.

 claim   pension   although   he   had   retired   earlier   and   therefore, 

 made a representation on 07/03/2000 for grant of pensionary 

 benefits   in   accordance   with   the   communication   dated 

 26/11/1991.     On   31/03/2000   the   Administrative   Officer   -

 from 06/03/1982 to the employees who have retired on or after

 otherwise   homogeneous   class,   fixing   of   the   cutoff   date   of

 hand  invited our attention to the order passed by the Tribunal. 

 In his submission, at the relevant time when petitioner retired 

 from the service, he was governed by the contributory provident 

 fund scheme and was not entitled to pension.  The petitioner has 

 received benefits under contributory provident fund scheme on 

 his   retirement   and   thus   he   is   governed   by   the   terms   and 

 conditions   which   existed   between   the   petitioner   and   the 

 respondent at the time of his retirement.  There was no pension 

 scheme in existence when the petitioner retired.    New pension 

 scheme has been made effective to those employees who have 

 retired   on   or   after   06/03/1982.     In   the   submission   of   the 

 learned Counsel for the respondents, the employees who retired 

 on or after 06/03/1982 form a separate class and those like the 

 petitioner   who   already   stood   retired   cannot   claim   that   they 

 belong   to   one   homogeneous   class.     In   the   submission   of   the

                           consideration   before   this   Court   was   whether   on   the 
                           basis   of   date   of   retirement   the   retirees   can   be 
                           classified   into   different   groups   and   thereupon   make 
                           provision granting some benefits to one group denying 
                           the   others.   In   the   aforesaid   case,   the   provisions   for 
                           pension were applicable to all retirees and, therefore, 
                           pensioners   form   a   class   as   a   whole.   But   when   the 
                           Liberalised Pension Scheme was introduced, the said 
                           Scheme was made applicable to a group of pensioners 
                           and not to all and, therefore, it was held by this Court 
                           that pensioners form a class as a whole and cannot be 
                           micro-classified   by   an   arbitrary,   in   unprincipled   and 
                           unreasonable eligibility criterion. It is to be noted that 
                           the aforesaid judgment was considered by this Court 
                           in   the   subsequent   Constitution   Bench   judgment   of 
                           <a href="/doc/1624536/" id="a_9">Krishena   Kumar   v.   Union   of   India</a>   where   in   the 
                           decision of Nakara was explained and it was held that 
                           the pension retirees and provident fund retirees do not 
                           form one homogeneous class and on the other hand, 
                           the   Rules   governing   the   provident   fund   and   its 
                           contribution   are   entirely   different   from   the   Rules 
                           governing   pension   and,   therefore,   it   would   not   be 
                           reasonable to argue what is applicable to the pension 
                           retirees must also equally be applicable to provident 
                           fund retirees. It was further held in the aforesaid case 
                           that   the   rights   of   each   individual   retiree   finally 
                           crystallised   on   his   retirement   whereafter   no 
                           continuing obligation remained in case of those who 
                           are governed by Provident Fund Rules whereas in case 
                           of   pension   retirees,   the   obligation   continues   till   the 
                           death of the employee. This Court categorically held 
                           that Nakara cannot be an authority for the decision in 
                           Krishena   Kumar.  <a href="/doc/1212844/" id="a_10">In   Union   of   India   v.   P.N.   Menon</a>   a 
                           similar   question   came   up   for   consideration   and 
                           distinguishing Nakara and following Krishena Kumar 
                           and other similar cases, the Court held that whenever 
                           the Government or an authority, which can be held to 
                           be   a   State   within   the   meaning   of   <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_11">Article   12</a>   of   the 
                           Constitution, frames a scheme for persons who have 
                           superannuated from service, due to many constraints, 
                           it is not always possible to extend the same benefits to 
                           one   and   all,   irrespective   of   the   dates   of 
                           superannuation.   As   such,   any   revised   scheme   in

<blockquote id="blockquote_11"> 9.               In this view of the matter, we find that the petitioner

 06/03/1982 as a date for introducing the pension scheme.   In 

 the light of the law laid down by the Apex Court, we are of the 

 view   that   the   employees   like   the   petitioner   who   had   retired 

 before 06/03/1982 and those who were in employment on the 

 said date or retired thereafter cannot be treated alike as they do 

 not belong to one class.   The employees who had retired after 

 receiving   all   the   benefits   available   under   the   contributory

 form a separate class.

 the ruling of the Apex Court above noted, we are of the opinion 

 that the respondents have not acted illegally or contrary to law

 employees   who   had   retired   on   or   after   06/03/1982.     The 

 petitioner   who   had  retired before   06/03/1982  cannot   compel
