<p id="p_4">                      PLAINTIFF‟S ARGUMENTS

</p><p id="p_5">3.     Mr. Mudit Sharma, learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the
present suit is a suit for infringement of registered trade mark as well as for
passing off.
</p><p id="p_6">4.     He contended that as on 13th June, 2016, the plaintiff‟s TM
Applications Nos. 1733503, 2738947, 2738949, 2746230 and 2746229 were
allowed and the plaintiff became the registered proprietor of the marks ZEN
and ZENMOBILE under Classes 09, 21 and 36 of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>,
1999.He submitted that the trademarks ZEN and ZEN MOBILE are
arbitrary and coined words which have no relation to the business of mobile
phones and accordingly are not descriptive marks.
</p><p id="p_7">5.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff further stated that the plaintiff was
prior user and had been continuously and extensively using the marks ZEN
and ZEN MOBILE for feature phones, smart phones, tablets and accessories
since 2008. He contended that the defendants had subsequently adopted an
identical trade mark ZENFONE to that of the plaintiff‟s mark ZEN and
ZENMOBILE for selling identical goods i.e. mobile phones. He pointed out
that the essential feature of the defendants‟ trademark was ZEN and the
addition of the word FONE as a suffix was immaterial.
</p><p id="p_8">6.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the sale turnover of the
plaintiff in 2015-2016was Rs.6,17,35,00,000/- and the plaintiff incurred an
advertisement expenditure of Rs. 10,19,00,000/- in 2016-2017. He pointed
out that while Mr. Amitabh Bachchan had been the plaintiff‟s brand
ambassador since 27th May, 2010, the defendants‟ first advertisement had
been published four years later in the newspapers on 10 th July, 2014. A




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                         Page 3 of 27</span>
 pictorial representation of the plaintiff‟s and defendants‟ advertisements is
reproduced hereinbelow:-

                         Defendants‟ Advertisement




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                       Page 4 of 27</span>
</p><p id="p_10"> 7.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that while the
price range of the plaintiff‟s products was approximately Rs.900/- to
Rs.12,000/-, the price of the defendants‟ products began from Rs. 2,000/-.
He therefore stated that the defendants had launched their products under the
impugned identical mark ZENFONE within a similar price range and were
targeting the same class of customers as the plaintiff. He contended that
defendants‟ mark was likely to cause confusion in the minds of the public
that the defendants‟ goods were somehow associated with the plaintiff‟s. In
support of his submission, learned counsel for plaintiff relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Heinz Italia &amp;Anr. Vs. Dabur India
Ltd., (2007) 6 SCC 1. The relevant portion of the said judgment is
reproduced hereinbelow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "15. We have also considered the arguments with regard to the
      prior user of the trade mark "Glucon-D" and the specific
      packaging. It is the admitted case that the term "Glucose-D" has
      been used by the respondent from the year 1989 and that the
      packaging which is the subject-matter of dispute in the present
      suit has been in use from the year 2000. In Century Traders [AIR
      1978 Del 250] it has been held that in an action for passing off,
      the plaintiff has to establish prior user to secure an injunction
      and that the registration of the mark or similar mark in point of
      time, is irrelevant. This Court in Cadila Health Care
      case [(2001) 5 SCC 73 : 2001 PTC 300] also laid down the tests
      in the case of passing off and observed as under: (SCC p. 80,
      para 10)
         "In other words in the case of unregistered trade marks, a
         passing-off action is maintainable. The passing-off action
         depends upon the principle that nobody has a right to
         represent his goods as the goods of somebody. In other words
         a man is not to sell his goods or services under the pretence
         that they are those of another person. As per Lord Diplock
         in <a href="/doc/149821556/" id="a_2">Erven Warnink BV v. J. Townend &amp; Sons</a> [1979 AC 731 :
         (1979) 3 WLR 68 : (1979) 2 All ER 927] the modern tort of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                       Page 5 of 27</span>
          passing off has five elements i.e. (1) a misrepresentation, (2)
         made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective
         customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services
         supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business
         or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a
         reasonably foreseeable consequence), and (5) which causes
         actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom
         the action is brought or (in a quiatimet action) will probably
         do so."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      16. Likewise, it has been repeatedly held that before the use of a
      particular mark can be appropriated it is for the plaintiff to
      prove that the product that he is representing had earned a
      reputation in the market and that this reputation had been sought
      to be violated by the opposite party. In Corn Products case [AIR
      1960 SC 142] it was observed that the principle of similarity
      could not to be very rigidly applied and that if it could be prima
      facie shown that there was a dishonest intention on the part of
      the defendant in passing off goods, an injunction should
      ordinarily follow and the mere delay in bringing the matter to
      court was not a ground to defeat the case of the plaintiff. It bears
      reiteration that the word "Glucon-D" and its packaging had
      been used by Glaxo since 1940 whereas the word "Glucose-D"
      had been used for the first time in the year 1989.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      17. In Cadila Health Care case it has also been held that in the
      case of a passing-off action the similarities rather than the
      dissimilarities have to be taken note of by the court and the
      principle of phonetic "similarity" cannot be ignored and the test
      is as to whether a particular mark has obtained acceptability in
      the market so as to confuse a buyer as to the nature of product he
      was purchasing. We observe that both Glucon-D and Glucose-D
      are items containing glucose and to us it appears that there is
      remarkable phonetic similarity in these two words."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">8.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff lastly stated that in view of the
aforesaid facts, the defendants‟ adoption of the mark ZEN was with mala
fide intent to ride upon the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                          Page 6 of 27</span>
<p id="p_12">                        DEFENDANTS‟ ARGUMENTS

</p><p id="p_13">9.     Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel for the defendants stated
that the defendant no. 2 corporation was spearheaded by Mr. Jonney Shih
who was a staunch believer of the ancient "Zen Philosophy". He further
stated that the defendant no. 2 had been using the Zen Design Concept,
namely the concentric circles (giving the effect of ripples in water) on its
gadgets outer surfaces since long. He contended that in 2011, the defendant
no. 2 launched the Ultra thin laptops named as ZENBOOK to reflect its
belief in Zen Philosophy. He also contended that the success of the Zenbook
led to the launch of ASUS Zenpad tablets, ASUS ZenUI (user interface
system), Asus ZenAiO (a home entertainment system), Asus Zenear (for
earphone kits), Asus ZenPower (for batteries, power chargers), Asus
ZenFlash (camera flash lights).
</p><p id="p_14">10.    Learned senior counsel for the defendants contended that the
defendants have already filed an application for cancellation of the
plaintiff‟s registered trademark under Application no. 733503 in Class 09
under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 before the Intellectual Property Appellate
Board, New Delhi and the same is pending adjudication.
</p><p id="p_15">11.    Learned senior counsel for the defendants submitted that the plaintiff
had deliberately and mala fidely made an incorrect statement that it had
applied for registration of the mark ZEN under applications no. 2943137
and 3052532. He submitted that the perusal of the records of the Trade
Marks Registry clearly reflected that the marks registered in favour of the
plaintiff were not word marks but device/label marks.
</p><p id="p_16">12.    Learned senior counsel for the defendants submitted that in view of
<a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_4">Section 17(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the plaintiff was disentitled




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                        Page 7 of 27</span>
 from claiming exclusivity/monopoly over a part of the label/device. In
support of his submission he relied upon the judgment of the Division
Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/298706/" id="a_5">Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Ltd. vs. Parul
Food Specialties Pvt. Ltd</a>. (2012) 186 DLT 234 (DB) wherein it has been
held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "18. Since the stage is of forming a prima facie view, we refrain
      from delving deep into the matter as evidence has yet to be led,
      but would simply highlight that the registration obtained by the
      appellant is not per-se to the word „KRISHNA‟ but is to the word
      „KRISHNA‟ written in a distinctive form: akin to a label. The
      distinctiveness in which the word „KRISHNA‟ is written by the
      appellant is as noted by us in para 2 above.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      19. The distinctiveness to which the appellant can lay a claim is
      to what it has got registered as a whole and such registration
      cannot possibly give an exclusive statutory right to the appellant
      qua a particular word of common origin. The ratio of law in the
      decision reported as AIR 1955 SC 558 <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_6">The Registrar of Trade
      Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd</a>. is squarely attracted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">13.    Learned senior counsel for the defendants further contended that the
mark ZEN was common to trade and generic in nature and there were
various third-party manufacturers who had got the mark ZEN registered. He
pointed out that a search report conducted on the Trade Marks Registry‟s
website revealed that there were more than 100 ZEN/ZEN formative marks
registered by third parties under Class 9 of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 for
mobile phones, mobile handsets etc. and there were numerous other marks
registered in various other Classes. In support of his statement, learned
senior counsel for the defendants pointed out the registration of the mark
ZENTA McCoy under Class 09 of the Trade Marks in favour of Zenta
McCoy Techno International. In support of the submission that the mark




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                       Page 8 of 27</span>
 was generic, learned senior counsel for defendants relied upon the
judgments in <a href="/doc/1514512/" id="a_8">Skyline Education Institute (Pvt.) Ltd. vs. S. L. Vaswani
&amp;Ors</a>. AIR 2010 <a href="/doc/215095/" id="a_9">SC3221 and Novelty Emporium vs. Novelty Creation
Private Limited</a>, 96 (2002) DLT 68. The relevant portion of the aforesaid
judgments is reproduced hereinbelow:-
</p><p id="p_18">A)     Skyline Education Institute (Pvt.) Ltd. (supra) :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "18. In our opinion, the findings recorded by the learned Single
     Judge and the Division Bench on the crucial factors like prima
     facie case, balance of convenience and equity are based on a
     correct and balanced consideration of various facets of the case
     and it is not possible to find any fault with the conclusions
     recorded by them that it is not a fit case for restraining the
     respondents from using the word "Skyline" in the name of the
     institute established by them. It has not been disputed on behalf
     of the appellant that the word "Skyline" is being used as trade
     name by various companies/organisations/business concerns and
     also for describing different types of institutes/institutions. The
     voluminous record produced by the respondents before this
     Court shows that in India as many as 117 companies including
     computer and software companies and institutions are operating
     by using the word "Skyline" as part of their name/nomenclature.
     In the United States of America, at least 10 educational/training
     institutions are operating with different names using "Skyline"
     as the first word. In the United Kingdom also two such
     institutions are operating. In view of this, it is not possible to
     agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that Skyline is
     not a generic word but is a specific word and his client has right
     to use that word to the exclusion of others."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">B)     Novelty Emporium (supra) :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     "15. In the present case the word Novelty must be taken to be a
     generic name. It is not a name coined by the plaintiff, so that it
     could take advantage of the decision in the case of Montari
     Industries Ltd. (supra). Once it is a generic name, necessarily,
     the Court has to travel to find out as to whether an ordinary
     customer by virtue of the name, adopted by the defendant, would



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                         Page 9 of 27</span>
       be mistaken and could take it to be the business of the plaintiff or
      its extension. Herein the plaintiff is using the name M/s. Novelty
      Emporium. The defendant is using the name and carrying on the
      business under the name and style of M/s. Novelty Creations
      Private Limited. Merely use of the word "Novelty" by itself will
      not indeed imply that action for passing off would be
      maintainable. Because the added words "Creations Private
      Limited" clearly distinguish its goods from those of the plaintiff.
      This is for the reason that the defendant has specifically pleaded
      that there are many other Saree Shops, using the word
      "NOVELTY" within the city of Delhi. In addition to that, the
      cartons, labels and wrappers of the defendant have also been
      stated to be different than that of the plaintiff. Once the word
      Novelty, which is a generic name is being used widely in the city
      and the further words that have been added to the word Novelty,
      makes it clear that the goods of the plaintiff can be distinguished
      from that of the plaintiff. It must follow that the plaintiff cannot
      be termed to have a prima-facie case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">14.    Learned senior counsel for defendants pointed out that in fact, the
plaintiff in its response to the examination report dated 01 st May, 2010 for
Application No.1733503 had categorically admitted that the word ZEN was
generic in nature and no one party could claim exclusivity over the same.
The relevant portion of the examination report of the plaintiff‟s trade mark
as well as the plaintiff‟s reply to the examination report is reproduced
hereinbelow:-

<p id="p_20">A)     Examination Report :
</p><p id="p_21">      "...1. The trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive

      or services of the one person from those of another person.
      "ZEN" is an approach to religion, arising from Buddhism.
</p><p id="p_22">      2.      The Trade Mark application is open to objection on
      relative grounds of refusal under <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_10">Section 11</a> of the Act because

<p id="p_23"> B)     Reply to Examination Report :
</p><p id="p_24">      "The Trade Mark‟s Law is based on the premise that one goods
      can have only one origin just as one man has one mother. The
      Trademark serves as an identification of origin and distinguishes
      the product from those of competitors. The product of the
      applicant herein has used the mark in conjunction with the logo
      in a distinct and invented manner and hence the objection raised
      under Section 9(1) of the Trade Mark Act, 1999 is not
      substantial. In reply to the objection in regards to the religions
      sentiments, it is stated that the Word ZEN is a common general
      word denoting a person practicing meditation in spite of any
      religious reading or writing.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      Further in reply to the objection for relative grounds it is stated
      that your good self has granted registration to many different
      proprietors. The mark has become generic making applicant to

</p>
<p id="p_26">15.    He contended that the said admission had been deliberately
suppressed and concealed by the plaintiff from this Court, thereby
disentitling it from claiming any relief/injunction. Learned senior counsel

       no one proprietor can claim exclusive rights on the mark „SHRI

       peacefully co-existing on the register of trademark. Thirdly, the
      appellants have prima facie shown that there were several
      schools in existence using the name „SHRI RAM‟ in existence
      even prior to the adoption of the mark by the respondents.
      Fourthly, the respondents are guilty of concealment and
      misrepresentation and, lastly, discretion should not be exercised

     "27. Finally, so far as prayer of passing off is concerned, we
     reiterate that the similarity of label/trade dress was with respect to
     the Plaintiffs' ROYAL STAG and the Defendants' Imperial Gold.
     Substantial changes have been agreed upon by the Appellants
     which upon implementation removes any likelihood of deception
     even concerning the cognitive faculties of an average customer, if
     not in an inebriated stupor. It may still be pleaded by the Plaintiffs
     that the Defendants are guilty of passing off because of the
     adoption of the word IMPERIAL. To this we may clarify that
     neither party has any exclusive right for the use of the word
     IMPERIAL. The two labels, that is IMPERIAL BLUE and
     RHIZOME Imperial Gold are totally dissimilar and if a flat amber
     bottle is used by the Defendants/Appellants, no deception is likely
     to arise. It is also relevant to mention that the word IMPERIAL is
     used by several other manufacturers of alcohol such as
     IMPERIAL TRIBUTE, IMPERIAL FAMOUS, TETLEY'S
     IMPERIAL, IMPERIAL'S HERO FIVE WHSKY, CAREW'S
     IMPERIAL WHINE WHISKY, OLD IMPERIAL, SUMMERHILL
     IMPERIAL, XO IMPERIAL, DON FULANO IMPERIAL, RON
     BARCELO IMPERIAL ETC. All these parties will have to co-exist.
     In view of the widespread use of the word IMPERIAL, especially
     in the alcohol business, it is not possible to accept the contention
     of Mr. Chandra that the word IMPERIAL has attained a
     secondary meaning which would justify exclusivity. Moreover,

       secondary meaning would evolve over a number of years; in the
      present case, the Plaintiffs started marketing its product in 1997
      and that is too short a period to make such an extreme claim. In
      this regard, it is also relevant that both the parties have received
      registration under the TM Act for their competing brands."

<p id="p_30">16.    Learned senior counsel for the defendants further contended that the
mark of the plaintiff had not acquired any secondary significance. In support
of his submission, he relied upon the judgment of Bigtree Entertainment

the judgment of Sunil Mittal &amp;Anr. Vs. Darzi On Call, (2017) 242 DLT 62,
wherein it has been held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "26. In this context, no merit is also found in the contention of
      the defendant of the mark being label marks and not word marks.
      The essential feature of both marks is the word „DARZI‟ and
      there is barely anything else on the labels to serve the purpose of
      a trade mark i.e. of recall. A consumer of tailoring services
      would remember the service availed of on an earlier occasion,
      whether it be of the plaintiffs or of defendant as „DARZI‟ only
      and would not remember the defendant as different from the
      plaintiffs owing to the words "ON CALL" in the label of the
      defendant. Conversely, a customer of the plaintiffs, on coming
      across the defendant is likely to understand the service of the
      defendant, as an extension of the service of plaintiffs „ON CALL‟.
      Also, the goodwill of a business as of tailoring is by word of
      mouth. A person for whom either the plaintiffs or the defendant
      have customised or tailored, when asked of the reference of his
      tailor is unlikely to mention the defendant as „DARZI ON CALL‟
      as distinct from plaintiffs as „THE DARZI‟; even if he were to so
      mention, the person seeking reference is unlikely to remember
      the words "ON CALL" and what is likely to stick to his memory
      is the word „DARZI‟....

      on the goodwill of the plaintiffs, to steal the market created by
      the plaintiffs, to have a headstart from the place to which the
      plaintiffs have built the business, to pass off his/her/its goods or

      the     plaintiffs    and     amounting       to     cheating     the

       injunction in a case as this is that it, embroiled in its legalese and
      technicalities of law as the defendant here has raised, is
      encouraging such deception in society and allowing hijacking of
      businesses which another has toiled to build. Such a message
      going out from the Court will kill entrepreneurship in the
      country, thereby spelling the doom for development. Even laws
      relating to tangible properties, as distinct from intellectual
      property have, have been interpreted to protect titles in property,
      as long as acquired honestly and for consideration, even if
      imperfect.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      33. The entire argument of the defendant of „generic‟ and
      „publici juris‟ and of the word „DARZI‟ being descriptive is
      nothing but an argument of technicality. The defendant itself has
      used the word „DARZI‟, not as descriptive of its trade identified
      by another name but as distinctive of it amongst the class of
      businesses which the defendant is carrying i.e. of tailoring. Such
      an argument would have been understandable if Md. Ali Raza,
      Ms. Nazia Nabi and Sh. Avinash Kumar who set up the business
      of defendant had commenced business of tailoring, say in the
      name of „M/s Raza, Nabi &amp; Kumar‟ and described the business
      carried on under the said name as "Darzis on Call". It could
      then have been said that the plaintiff No. 1 Sunil Mittal, by
      adopting the name of his tailoring business as „THE DARZI‟ is
      not entitled to restrain other tailors, catering to section of society
      not familiar with the word „TAILOR‟, is not entitled to restrain
      „M/s Raza, Nabi &amp; Kumar‟ from informing their prospective
      customers the services of „DARZI‟ provided by them. The act of
      the defendant of having itself chosen the word „DARZI‟, not as
      descriptive of its business but as a trade name, as the plaintiffs
      had done two decades before the defendant, is nothing but an act
      of dishonesty with which the Court is not only required to but
      bound to interdict. It is also not as if the defendant is writing the
      word „DARZI‟ in Urdu or Hindi language, to cater to the section
      of the society which is unfamiliar with the word „TAILOR‟. The
      defendant also, as the plaintiffs, has chosen to write the word
      „DARZI‟ in English script. The defendant is targeting the same
      customer base as the plaintiffs. I may in this regard also notice a
      shift in the society in the last few decades. Earlier, owing to
      limited availability of readymade garments in the country, only



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                          Page 15 of 27</span>
       the rich were buying the same from foreign markets with the
      economically weak section of the society buying cloth and getting
      it tailored. Now, readymade garments are tailored in factories,
      mechanically with limited human skills and are available in
      volumes at much less price than the cost, if the cloth was to be
      purchased      and    tailoring     charges     given.    Today,
      customised/bespoke tailoring, which both, plaintiffs and
      defendant are providing, is affordable only by the rich and high-
      heeled, who are generally literate and understand the word
      „TAILOR‟ and find the word „DARZI‟ „exotic‟ and hence with
      high recall value, thereby serving very well the purpose of a
      trademark.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">      39. The plaintiffs thus have made out a prima facie case. The
      balance of convenience also is in favour of the plaintiffs and
      against the defendant in as much as use by the plaintiffs of the
      trademark according to the defendant also is for at least 20 years
      prior to that by the defendant. The defendant already since the
      last about six months has been using a different trademark and I
      am of the view that the prejudice from the interim injunction to
      the defendant will be negligible in comparison to that to the
      plaintiffs from non-grant thereof. Needless to state that a prima
      facie case having been found in favour of the plaintiffs, the
      plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury from continued use by the
      defendant of the mark. A customer of a tailor, once lost, is
      unlikely to come back."

<p id="p_36">                            COURT‟S REASONING

       A TRADEMARK IS A SOURCE IDENTIFIER
</p><p id="p_37">21.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this Court is of the view
that it is necessary to first appreciate that the rationale behind grant of
recognition and protection of trademarks and trade names is to ensure that
people don‟t get confused about the source of goods and services. To put it
tersely, a trademarkis a source identifier. In fact, a Coordinate Bench of this
Court in <a href="/doc/107853771/" id="a_11">Mattel, Inc. &amp;Ors. vs. Mr. Jayant Agarwala&amp;Ors</a>., 2008 SCC
OnLine Del 1059 has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "II The Trademark claim
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      32. The object of trademark law is to prevent an injury to the
      goodwill and reputation of the enterprise which owns the
      trademark; as well as ensuring that consumers are not misled as
      to the product, services or their sources. Marks help buyers to
      identify their source, and assure them of the constancy of quality
      from a particular producer. The essence of a trade mark has
      always been that it is "a badge of origin" (Ref Scandecor
      Developments AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB 4 April 2001,
      UK.HL 21 of 2001). It indicates trade source: a connection in the
      course of trade between the goods and the proprietor of the
      mark. Trademarks are thus, a valuable medium of advertisement,
      vital for marketing of products. If the consumers understand the
      trademark in the context of its source, the manufacturer is
      inseparably associated with it. The drawback here could be that
      trademarks are misused if they serve to limit competition in the
      manufacture and sales of a product."

<p id="p_38">THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF TRADEMARKS. „GENERIC‟MARKS

NOT A GENERIC MARK WITH REGARD TO MOBILE PHONES.
</p><p id="p_39">22.    There are various types of trademarks.Initially four categories of
trademarks i.e. (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                         Page 17 of 27</span>
 or fanciful were set out in <a href="/doc/20958680/" id="a_12">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. vs. Hunting World,
Inc</a>., 537F.2d4, 9 (2nd Cir. 1976). Subsequently inTwo Pesos, Inc. v. Taco
Cabana, Inc., 505 US 763,it was held that there are five categories of
trademarks. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced
hereinbelow:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">      "... Marks are often classified in categories of generally
      increasing distinctiveness; following the classic formulation set
      out by Judge Friendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive;
      (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. ...The latter three
      categories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves to
      identify a particular source of a product, are deemed inherently
      distinctive and are entitled to protection. In contrast, generic
      marks-those that "refe[r] to the genus of which the particular
      product is a species," Park „N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly,
      Inc., 469 U.S 189, 194 (1985), citing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, supra,
      at 9-are not registrable as trademarks. Park „N Fly, supra, at 194.
      Marks which are merely descriptive of a product are not
      inherently distinctive. When used to describe a product, they do
      not inherently identify a particular source, and hence cannot be
      protected. However, descriptive marks may acquire the
      distinctiveness which will allow them to be protected under the
      Act. Section 2 of the Lanham Act provides that a descriptive mark
      that otherwise could not be registered under the Act may be
      registered if it "has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in
      commerce.". ...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      The general rule regarding distinctiveness is clear: An identifying
      mark is distinctive and capable of being protected if it either (1) is
      inherently distinctive or (2) has acquired distinctiveness through
      secondary meaning. ..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">22.    The said categorisation of trademarks has been accepted by a
Coordinate Bench of this Court in Evergreen Sweet House v. Ever Green,
2008 (38) PTC 325 (Del) (paragraph 14), wherein it was held that the mark
„Evergreen‟ in its application to sweets and confections is an arbitrary one
and accordingly is entitled to protection.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                           Page 18 of 27</span>
<p id="p_41"> 23.    The term „generic‟ refers to the „genus‟ to which a particular product
or service is a species of.
</p><p id="p_42">24.    The term „descriptive‟ refers to a word/mark which describes an
article/service, its qualities, ingredients or characteristics.
</p><p id="p_43">25.    However, often the lines differentiating different categories of marks
are blurred. Often, distinctions between suggestive, fanciful and arbitrary
marks may seem artificial.
</p><p id="p_44">26.    For instance, in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (supra) it was explained
that "Deep Bowl" when used for an article which is a deep bowl, does not
only describe the article, but also identifies it. Therefore, "Deep Bowl" is
generic when used for a deep bowl. Similarly the term "spoon" is not merely
descriptive of the article i.e. spoon, but identifies the article and therefore, is
generic.
</p><p id="p_45">27.    However, the mark "Deep Bowl Spoon" for a spoon merely describes
the significant characteristic of being able to reach deep in a bowl. It is not
descriptive of the article i.e. spoon, since the article is not a deep bowl, but a
spoon.
</p><p id="p_46">28.    In common law, neither the generic nor merely descriptive terms are
valid trademarks and the exclusive use of such terms is not entitled to legal
protection. However, protection is awarded to descriptive marks which have
acquired secondary significance.
</p><p id="p_47">29.    The category of suggestive marks refers to those marks which are
neither exactly descriptive on the one hand, nor truly fanciful on the other. A
term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach
a conclusion as to the nature of the goods. If a term is suggestive, it is
entitled to registration without proof of secondary meaning. For instance, as
pointed out in Abercrombie&amp; Fitch Co. (supra) the word "Ideal" when used



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                                Page 19 of 27</span>
 for hair brushes, is in no sense indicative or descriptive of the qualities or
characteristics or merits of a brush. It is therefore not descriptive. However,
the word "Ideal" for hairbrushes does suggest that the product meets the
very highest ideal mental conception of what a hair brush should be and is
therefore suggestive.
</p><p id="p_48">30.    The term „fanciful‟ refers to a mark which is an invented word solely
for use as trademarks. When a common word is applied in an unfamiliar
way, it is called an „arbitrary‟ mark. For instance, "Ivory" would be generic
when used to describe a product made from the tusks of elephants but would
be arbitrary when applied to a soap.
</p><p id="p_49">31.    Fanciful and arbitrary terms enjoy all rights accorded to suggestive
marks and are also entitled to registration without proof of secondary
meanings.
</p><p id="p_50">32.    Keeping in view the aforesaid mandate of law, this Court is of the
view that a word may be generic qua a specific business or trade or industry
but not across the board for all business or trades or industries. For instance,
the word "Arrow" is a generic word qua archery business, but is an arbitrary
word qua shoes.
</p><p id="p_51">33.    Consequently, though ZEN is a generic word qua a school
ofBuddhism, yet it is not a generic mark with regard to mobile phones and
tablets as the said word has no connection or correlation with mobile phones
or tablets.

      Copying of a prominent part of a trademark leads to deceptive

      same. The expression "Deer" was arbitrarily adopted by the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">              "17. The series of marks containing the common element
            or elements therefore only assist the applicant when those
            marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of
            proving such user is of course on the applicant, who wants
            to rely on those marks. Now in the present case the
            applicant, the respondent before us, led no evidence as to
            the user of marks with the common element. What had
            happened was that Deputy Registrar looked into his
            register and found there a large number of marks which
            had either 'Gluco' or 'Vita' as prefix or suffix in it. Now of
            course the presence of a mark in the register does not
            prove its user all. It is possible that the mark may have
            been registered but not used. It is not permissible to draw
            any inference as to their user from the presence of the
            marks on the register."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32"> 37.    Though the present suit is a commercial suit, yet the defendants have
not placed on record any instance of use of the mark ZEN by third parties.
</blockquote><p id="p_55">38.    This Court is of the opinion that the defendants having themselves
applied for registration of the mark ZENFONE on 12th March, 2014, on a
proposed to be used basis, cannot now be permitted to approbate and
reprobate. Accordingly, they are estopped from contending that the mark
ZEN is common to trade or generic.
</p><p id="p_56">39.    Further, just because defendants‟ application for cancellation of
plaintiff‟s registered trade mark is pending consideration, does not mean that
this Court is denuded of the power either to decide this application or grant
an injunction. (See: Patel Field Marshal Agencies Vs. P.M. Diesels Limited
&amp;Ors, (2018) 2 SCC 112).

<p id="p_57">POST GRANT OF REGISTRATION OF THE MARK NEITHER THE
EXAMINATION REPORT NOR THE REPLY TO THE SAME ARE
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS. FURTHER THERE IS NO ESTOPPEL
AGAINST STATUTE
</p><p id="p_58">40.    Once a mark is registered, the certificate of registration has to be seen
as it is. Post grant of registration of the mark ZEN, neither the Examination
Report dated 01st May, 2010 nor the plaintiff‟s reply are relevant documents.
In H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB &amp;Anr. Vs. HM Megabrands Pvt. Ltd
&amp;Ors. (2018) 251 DLT 651 it has been held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">      "15. The plea of the defendants, of the plaintiffs, at the time of
      seeking registration and when confronted with „HMT‟, „HMV‟,
      „HMW‟, „H.M. Tex Kamal‟ and „H.M.C.‟, having taken a stand
      that the mark has to be considered in entirety, may be considered
      at this stage. The question to be adjudicated is, whether the
      plaintiffs, having taken such a stand, is estopped from suing for
      infringement. The question, in my opinion, cannot be answered in
      abstract and has to be answered on facts. None of the businesses,
      marks whereof as aforesaid the plaintiffs were confronted with,

         were in any business even remotely connected to business of the
        plaintiffs. In fact the marks HMT &amp; HMV were abbreviations of
        their earlier names Hindustan Machine Tools and His Masters
        Voice respectively and which businesses, over the years had
        come to be referred by their abbreviation. Merely because the
        plaintiffs at the stage of seeking registration took a stand as
        aforesaid, cannot stop the plaintiff from exercising its statutory
        and natural rights. There is no estoppel against statute."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">41.     In any event, as there is no estoppel against statute, the stand taken by
plaintiff in reply to the examination report is not relevant.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">THERE IS NO SUPRESSION OR MISREPRESENTATION THAT
REGISTERED MARKS ZEN AND ZENMOBILE ARE WORD MARKS AS
THE PLAINTIFFS HAD PLACED ON RECORD THE REGISTRATION
CERTIFICATES. FURTHERMORE, THE PLAINTIFF HAD NOT
SUPPRESSED ITS REPLY TO THE EXAMINATION REPORT DATED 01st
MAY, 2010 AS THE SAME IS AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
</p>
<p id="p_60">42.     This Court is also of the view that there is no misrepresentation or
suppression that the plaintiffs‟ registered marks ZEN and ZENMOBILE are
word marks as it had placed on record the registration certificates for the
same.
</p>
<p id="p_61">43.     This Court is also of the view that the judgment of S.K. Sachdeva
(supra) is of no relevance to the present case as the said judgment is
regarding wilful and deliberate concealment, which is absent in the present
case.
</p>
<p id="p_62">44.     Furthermore, the plaintiff had not suppressed its reply to the
examination report dated 01st May, 2010 as the same is available in the
public domain.

<p id="p_63"> A SUBSEQUENT USER CANNOT TAKE SHELTER UNDER SECTION
17(2) AND ARGUE THAT THE STATUTE PERMITS IT TO COMMIT
PASSING OFF. PLAINTIFF IS THE PRIOR USER OF THE MARK ZEN,
SINCE 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_64">45.    This Court is also of the opinion that <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_17">Section 17(2)</a> of the Trade Marks
Act, 1999 relates to a composite registered trademark and the circumstances
under which exclusive rights can be claimed in part of a registered mark.
The Supreme Court in Registrar of Trademarks Vs. Ashok Chandra Rakhit
Ltd., AIR 1955 SC 558 and <a href="/doc/298706/" id="a_18">Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Ltd. vs.
Parul Food Specialties Pvt. Ltd</a>. (supra) has held that registration of a label
mark does not entitle a proprietor to protection of a specific part of the label.
</p>
<p id="p_65">46.    However, this Court is of the view that a party can overcome the bar
under <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_19">Section 17(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, by filing an action for
passing off to claim exclusivity of a part or whole of the registered
trademark. <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_20">Section 17(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 cannot be used as a
license to commit an act of passing off. A subsequent dishonest user cannot
take shelter under <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_21">Section 17(2)</a> and argue that the statute permits it to
commit passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_66">47.    Consequently, the present suit for the purpose of the present
application is treated as a suit for passing off and not for infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_67">PLAINTIFF IS THE PRIOR USER OF THE MARK ZEN, SINCE 2008.
INGREDIENTS OF PASSING OF ARE SATISFIED IN THE PRESENT
CASE.
</p><p id="p_68">48.    In the present case, the plaintiff has placed on record documents
showing that the plaintiff is the prior usersince 2008 of the mark ZEN in
comparison to the defendant who began using an identical/deceptively
similar mark ZENFONE in 2014.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS (COMM) 731/2017                                           Page 25 of 27</span>
<p id="p_69"> 49.    The plaintiff‟s annual sales figures of Rs.6,17,35,00,000/- for the year
2015-16 and advertisement expenses of Rs.10,19,00,000/- for the year 2016-
17 show that the plaintiff has expended large sums of money in promotion of
its products. Furthermore, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan being the brand
ambassador of the plaintiff vide agreement dated 27th May, 2010, while the
defendants‟ first advertisement was in 2014 shows that the plaintiff had
acquired significant goodwill and reputation with regard toits products sold
under the mark ZEN prior to the defendants entering the market.
</p>
<p id="p_70">50.    This Court is of the view that the defendants‟ adoption of the mark
ZEN is in bad faith as it applied for the plaintiff‟s mark subsequently in
2014.Further, in the opinion of this Court, the triple identity test is satisfied
as the defendants have made use of a deceptively similar/identical
trademark(ZENFONE) in relation to identical goods (mobile phones) having
identical trade channels.
</p>
<p id="p_71">51.    Consequently, the defendants having adopted a deceptively similar
mark wherein the dominant part of the defendants‟ mark ZENFONE is the
plaintiff‟s mark ZEN, for the same product i.e. mobile phones, shows prima
faciethat there is a likelihood of confusion and damage to the plaintiff‟s
goodwill. The test of passing off as stipulated in Heinz (supra) is satisfied.
</p><p id="p_72">52.    Accordingly, after eight weeks, the defendants, their partners,
principal officers, servants, agents and representativesshall stand restrained
from directly or indirectly selling, offering and advertising for sale mobile
phones and/or mobile accessories and/or any other related products or any
other goods under the trademark ZEN, ZENFONE and/or any other
trademark identical and/or deceptively similar to the trademark ZEN and
ZEN Mobile, in any manner whatsoever.
