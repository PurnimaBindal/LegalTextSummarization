HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT

S.RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.     These proceedings emanate from an order of reference dated
09.06.2014 ("Reference Order") made by the Learned Single Judge in
CS(OS) No. 411/2010 ("Suit"), formulating the following questions of law
for adjudication by this Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "(i) Whether the High Court while exercising the Original Civil
       Jurisdiction is deemed to be a District Court within the meaning of
       Section 2(4) of CPC in the context of <a href="/doc/1187059/" id="a_1">Section 7(1)(a)</a> of the Family
       Courts Act, 1984?
</blockquote>



<blockquote id="blockquote_2">CS (OS) 411/2010                                                       Page 1
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (ii) Whether the original civil jurisdiction of the High Court excluded
       (sic) for any suit or petition by virtue of <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_2">Sections 7</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_3">8</a> of the Family
       Courts Act, 1984?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">2.     This Court notices that the second question would necessarily involve
a determination on the first. Accordingly, we proceed to examine as to
whether this Court‟s original civil jurisdiction in respect of matters outlined
in the Explanation to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_4">Section 7</a> of the Family Courts Act,
1984 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") is ousted by virtue of the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_5">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_6">8</a> of the Act. Having examined this issue of
statutory interpretation from both a literal as well as a purposive lens, we
answer the question in the affirmative. Since this reference involves a pure
question of law, we do not delve into the specific facts of the case.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The reference to parties herein is the same as their status in the Suit.
Submissions of Parties before the Learned Single Judge:
</p>


<p id="p_4">4.     The first defendant had submitted that since the Suit has arisen out of
the marital relationships between the plaintiff and defendant no. 1, this
Court‟s original civil jurisdiction is barred by virtue of the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_7">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_8">8</a> of the Act. For this purpose, reliance was placed upon the
Full Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1915775/" id="a_9">Romila Jaidev Shroff v.
Jaidev Rajnikant Shroff</a>, AIR 2000 Bom 356 and the Supreme Court‟s ruling
in <a href="/doc/539740/" id="a_10">Raja Soap Factory v. S.P. Shantharaj</a>, AIR 1965 SC 1449. Learned
counsel submitted that the term „District Court‟ in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_11">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_12">8</a> of the
Act would include the High Court exercising its ordinary original civil
jurisdiction, and therefore, its jurisdiction would stand transferred to the




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                            Page 2
 Family Courts. In support of this interpretation, reliance was placed upon
<a href="/doc/1852048/" id="a_13">Section 2(e)</a> of the Act read with Section 2(4) of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as "CPC").
</p><p id="p_5">5.     Contesting these submissions, the Plaintiff argued before the Learned
Single Judge that there exist differences between the Delhi High Court and
other Presidency High Courts. While the other Presidency Courts are the
principal Civil Courts of original jurisdiction for their territory, the Delhi
High Court is for the State of Delhi and has below it District Courts as the
principal courts of original jurisdiction. Thus, there is no separate territory
governed by the Delhi High Court as a principal civil court of original
jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_6">6.     In <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_14">Section 3(17)</a> of the General Clauses Act, which defines "District
Court", High Court is excluded from that definition. On the other hand,
Section 2(4) of the CPC defines only a "District" and then includes the High
Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction as the principal Court in a
District. The said expressions are used in relation to a different context and
it implies a limit to territorial jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_7">7.     The Plaintiff relied upon a few decisions in which it was clarified that
the High Court cannot be called as District Court. It was submitted that
<a href="/doc/1028712/" id="a_15">Section 4</a> of the Delhi High Court Act and Section 6 of CPC bar other
Courts from entertaining a matter if it is above the pecuniary limits. The
Plaintiff submitted that <a href="/doc/624514/" id="a_16">Section 21</a> of the Act makes a specific reference to
the High Court with no qualification as to its meaning anything other than
the High Court. Thus, <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_17">Section 8</a> of the Act does not exclude jurisdiction of
the High Court. Further, there was no notification or amendment to the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_18">High
Court Act</a> or Rules that release the Family Court from its pecuniary




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                         Page 3
 jurisdiction limit. Since the pecuniary jurisdiction limit of the present case is
more than `20 lakhs, this Court has got the jurisdiction to entertain and try
the present suit, which is a civil suit. Plaintiff also submitted that since the
subject matter of the suit involves assets of the defendant no. 1‟s family,
Family Courts cannot exercise jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_19">Section 7</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     Based on the aforesaid submissions, the plaintiff contended that
<a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_20">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_21">8</a> of the Act do not oust this Court‟s ordinary original civil
jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_9">Findings of Learned Single Judge

</p><p id="p_10">9.     The Learned Single Judge noted the existing precedents on the
question of law referred to herein, including the decisions in <a href="/doc/1787567/" id="a_22">Bakshi Lochan
Singh v. Jathedar Santokh Singh</a>, AIR 1971 Del 277, Raja Soap Factory
(supra), Romila Jaidev Shroff (supra), Kamal V.M. Allaudin v. Raja Shaikh,
AIR 1990 Bom 299, <a href="/doc/339696/" id="a_23">Mary Thomas v. Dr. K.E. Thomas</a>, AIR 1990 Mad 100,
<a href="/doc/535324/" id="a_24">Kanak Vinod Mehta v. Vinod Dulerai Mehta</a>, AIR 1991 Bom 337, <a href="/doc/26873/" id="a_25">N.
Kanageswary v. T. Shrikandarah Rubindranathan</a>, 2013(1) CTC 165. The
Learned Single Judge held that in the absence of an "express exclusion of
jurisdiction under the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_26">Family Court Act</a> that no High Court referred to in
sub-<a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_27">section 7</a> shall exercise any jurisdiction in respect of any suit and
proceeding of nature referred to in the explanation of that sub-section", the
High Court‟s ordinary original jurisdiction (being a civil court) cannot be
inferred to have been ousted. The Learned Single Judge relied upon the
Supreme Court‟s dictum in <a href="/doc/1996908/" id="a_28">Dhulabhai v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, AIR
1969 SC 78 in this regard. It was held that given the hierarchy of courts
created under Section 3 of the CPC, this Court‟s ordinary original civil
jurisdiction would not be included in the phrase "jurisdiction exercisable by




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                           Page 4
 any district Court or any subordinate Civil Court" in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_29">Section 7</a> of the Act.
Further, the Learned Single Judge relied upon this Court‟s ruling in <a href="/doc/153575719/" id="a_30">Manita
Khurana v. Indra Khurana</a>, AIR 2010 Del 69 and held that the plaintiff is
claiming rights in the assets of the defendants‟ family (HUF) and
consequently, third party interests were involved. This would also render it
appropriate for the High Court to exercise its ordinary original jurisdiction,
instead of the Family Court. These observations, however were tentative and
inconclusive because the single judge was of opinion that given the
importance of the issues involved, it would be appropriate that the question
of this court‟s jurisdiction were ruled by a Division Bench. Therefore, this
reference.
</p><p id="p_11">Submissions Made on Behalf of Plaintiff

</p><p id="p_12">10.    Ms. Malavika Rajkotia, learned counsel for the Plaintiff, supported
the observations and tentative conclusions of the Learned Single Judge and
reiterated the submissions made before him. In addition, counsel relied upon
excerpts from Benion‟s Statutory Interpretation to contend that: (a) the High
Court should not abdicate its duty to rule upon crucial family law issues; (b)
the earlier specific legislation (the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_31">Delhi High Court Act</a>) should prevail
over the later general legislation <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_32">(Family Courts Act</a>); (c) powers conferred
under the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_33">Delhi High Court Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_34">Family Courts Act</a> must be
exercised concurrently.
</p><p id="p_13">11.    Ms. Rajkotia submitted that the Statement of Objects and Reasons of
the Act should not be used as an interpretive tool. Reliance was placed on
the Supreme Court‟s decision in <a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_35">Aswini Kumar Ghose v. Arabinda Bose</a>,
AIR 1952 SC 369 for this purpose.
</p>



<p id="p_14">CS (OS) 411/2010                                                         Page 5
</p><p id="p_15"> 12.    The Delhi High Court in R.P. Sachdeva v. State, AIR 1986 Del 178
has held that the High Court cannot be equated with a Court of District
Judge, and that <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_36">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High Court Act would not make
the Delhi High Court the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in
Delhi. Reliance was also placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1425992/" id="a_37">Bakshi Lochan Singh
and Mary A. Trinidade v. Vincent Manuel Trinidade</a>, 1976 Rajdhani LR 112.
</p><p id="p_16">13.    The Plaintiff also relied upon a recent decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/82895350/" id="a_38">Goyal
MG Gases Pvt. Ltd. v. Messer Grieshim Gmbh(EFA OS</a> 3/2014, decided on
01.07.2014) - where it was held that "District Court" would not include the
High Court for the purposes of Section 44A of the CPC. While reiterating its
submission that the Family Court does not have jurisdiction as the subject
matter of the suit involves claims against the assets of the defendant No. 1‟s
family held as HUF, Plaintiff relies on the definition of „family‟ in Order
32A, Rule 6 of CPC.
</p>

<p id="p_17">Submissions Made on Behalf of the first Defendant

</p><p id="p_18">14.    Mr. Dinesh Garg, learned counsel for the first Defendant questioned
the Learned Single Judge‟s conclusion on several grounds. Relying on the
Preamble, Mr. Garg submitted that the Act is a special Act and provides for
a special procedure for speedy settlement of disputes. Further, he urged that
the object of the Act is to adopt an approach, which is radically different
from that procedure and process of civil courts in ordinary civil proceedings.
In fact, it is submitted, the Act itself envisages that the powers of civil courts
can be exercised by the Family Courts so as to enable the latter to deliver
justice. Reliance is placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1490050/" id="a_39">K.A. Abdul Jaleel v. T.A</a>.
</p>



<p id="p_19">CS (OS) 411/2010                                                            Page 6
 Shahida, AIR 2003 SC 2525 and Romila Jaidev Shroff (supra).The object of
the Act could not have been to distinguish and discriminate cases on the
basis of their pecuniary value and to subject the litigants to two sets of
procedure - one before the High Court and the other before Family Courts,
merely on the basis of the amount of claim.
</p><p id="p_20">15.    Mr. Garg further urged that the Act has an overriding effect by virtue
of <a href="/doc/1231073/" id="a_40">Section 20</a> of the Act, and this has been affirmed by the Bombay High
Court in Romila Jaidev Shroff (supra) and <a href="/doc/283310/" id="a_41">Shabana Bano v. Imran Khan</a>,
(2010) 1 SCC 666. Further, the Act does not confine or distinguish matters
on the basis of their pecuniary value, rather it is on the basis of
area/population. The non-inclusion of a pecuniary jurisdiction clause in the
Act endeavours to promote an unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction. It was
submitted that the Act seeks to provide for exclusivity of jurisdiction to
Family Courts with respect to matters provided therein. Such exclusive
jurisdiction has been provided to the Family Courts under the Preamble and
<a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_42">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_43">8</a> of the Act. On the interpretation of the term „District Court‟
in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_44">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_45">8</a>, it is submitted that it cannot be given a universal
meaning. Since the Act does not define „District Court‟; regard may be had
to the definition in CPC by virtue of <a href="/doc/1852048/" id="a_46">Section 2(e)</a> of the Act. Although the
CPC does not define „District Court‟, Section 2(4) of the CPC defines
„District‟ to include „the local limits of the ordinary original jurisdiction of a
„High Court‟.
</p><p id="p_21">16.    Responding to the Plaintiff‟s reliance on the definition of „District
Judge‟ in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_47">Section 3(17)</a> of the General Clauses Act, the first defendant
submits that the Act does not equate a Family Court Judge with a District
Judge and that the Act prescribes the retirement age of a Family Court Judge




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                            Page 7
 as 62 years - the same as that of a High Court Judge. Therefore, there is no
anomaly in the Family Court exercising jurisdiction over matters prescribed
in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_48">Section 7</a>, which were hitherto exercised by the High Court.
</p><p id="p_22">17.    Lastly, it is submitted that the term „High Court‟ is used in the Act as
a court of appeal -evident from the fact that an appeal from a decision of the
Family Court lies to the High Court, comprising of a bench of two or more
judges (<a href="/doc/1411868/" id="a_49">Section 19</a>). Thus, the procedure of appeal from the Family Court is
the same as that from the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original
jurisdiction; thereby meaning that the matters covered by the Act and dealt
with by the High Court on its original side were meant to be included within
the purview of Family Courts. To support his submissions, Mr. Garg heavily
relied on the Full Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in Romila
Jaidev Shroff (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_23">Analysis and Conclusions:
</p>
<p id="p_24">18.    <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_50">The Act</a> was enacted by the Parliament with the objective of
establishing a separate procedural mechanism for adjudication of family
disputes. <a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_51">Section 3</a> of the Act provides for the setting up of Family Courts.
<a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_52">Section 7</a> of the Act vests jurisdiction in respect of certain matters
(enumerated in the Explanation to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_53">Section 7</a>; and sub-
section (2) of <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_54">Section 7</a>) which were hitherto exercised by a "district court
or any subordinate civil court" in Family Courts set up under <a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_55">Section 3</a>.
Crucially, <a href="/doc/787960/" id="a_56">Section 8(a)</a> provides that to the extent that the jurisdiction a
"district court or any subordinate civil court" would have exercised in
respect of matters enumerated in the Explanation to <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_57">Section 7</a> (1), stands




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                         Page 8
 ousted if a Family Court has been set up for the corresponding area.
Similarly, <a href="/doc/1491014/" id="a_58">Section 8(b)</a> ousts the jurisdiction of a Magistrate in respect of
matters outlined in <a href="/doc/1900785/" id="a_59">Section 7(2)</a>. <a href="/doc/1664096/" id="a_60">Section 8(c)</a> provides for, inter alia, the
transfer of all pending proceedings from the concerned court to the Family
Court. Further, <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_61">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 provides that
the High Court of Delhi shall have ordinary original civil jurisdiction in
every suit where the pecuniary value exceeds `20 lakhs (which has since
been amended after conclusion of hearing in this reference).It is in light of
the aforesaid provisions that the issue of ouster of this Court‟s original civil
jurisdiction arises, which we proceed to examine below. Here, it is necessary
to clarify the scope of reference made in the Reference Order. Plaintiff has
contended, both before the Learned Single Judge and in these proceedings
that the subject matter of the suit involves claims against the assets of the
first defendant‟s family and since third party claims cannot be adjudicated
by Family Courts under <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_62">Section 7</a> of the Act, it is this Court which would
have jurisdiction. However, the questions framed in the reference do not
concern this issue, and therefore, this Court is not competent to address it in
these proceedings. Indeed, in the absence of a question having been framed
to this effect in the reference order, this Court would be acting in its capacity
as an appellate court were it to adjudicate upon this issue, without any
appeal having been preferred by the defendant no. 1 on the same. Therefore,
the only issue to be determined is whether this Court‟s ordinary original
civil jurisdiction is ousted to the extent provided in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_63">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_64">8</a> of the
Act.
</p><p id="p_25">19.    At the outset, it would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant
statutory provisions. <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_65">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_66">8</a> read as follows:

</p><p id="p_40"> 21.    The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) too does not define the phrase

follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "district" means the local limits of the jurisdiction of a principal Civil

<p id="p_41">22.    Thus, <a href="/doc/171421/" id="a_72">Section 2(4)</a> defines a „district‟ to include the territorial limits
of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a High Court. Learned counsel
for the defendant in the suit, contesting the original civil jurisdiction of this
Court, has submitted that the term „District Court‟ must be interpreted in
light of the definition of „district‟ in Section 2(4) of the CPC and must
include a High Court exercising original civil jurisdiction. Learned counsel
for the plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that given the absence of a
definition of „District Court‟ in the CPC, the definition of „District Judge‟ in
<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_73">Section 3(17)</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897 should be applicable.
<a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_74">Section 3(17)</a> reads as follows:

<p id="p_42">23.    This Court agrees with the submissions made on behalf of defendant
no. 1. Section 2(4) of the CPC conclusively settles this issue. Although
<a href="/doc/171421/" id="a_75">Section 2(4)</a> does not expressly seek to define the term "District Court", the
meaning that emerges therefrom also includes the definition of "District
Court". This is because the term "District Court" is defined (in parenthesis)

 to mean the principal civil court of original jurisdiction that exercises such
jurisdiction over a defined territory. Now, <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_76">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High
Court Act provides that the High Court shall exercise ordinary original civil
jurisdiction in every suit where the value of the suit exceeds a certain limit
(presently rupees 2 crores). Therefore, the court of ordinary original
jurisdiction in Delhi for the purposes of suits exceeding such pecuniary
value would be the High Court, and for all other purposes, it would be the
District Court. This would be the result of a combined reading of <a href="/doc/320618/" id="a_77">Section
5(2)</a> with Section 24 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1918, which provides that the
court of District Judge shall be the District Court or the principal Civil Court
of original jurisdiction in the District. Therefore, when it is clarified in
<a href="/doc/171421/" id="a_78">Section 2(4)</a> that „district‟ would include the local limits of a High Court
exercising original civil jurisdiction, axiomatically, such High Court would
be a „District Court‟ to the limited extent that it is exercising ordinary
original civil jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_43">24.    This is supported by this Court‟s ruling in Bakshi Lochan Singh
(supra). In Bakshi Lochan Singh, a Division Bench of this Court had to
decide whether for the purposes of Section 92 of the CPC, the High Court
would be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction where the value of
the suit exceeded `50,000/- (the pecuniary limit of this Court‟s ordinary
original jurisdiction at the relevant time was `50,000/-). The Court noted:

       respect of the territory of Delhi ordinary original civil jurisdiction in

<p id="p_44">       suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees. This being a suit
       the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees would be covered by
       this sub-section. The argument of Mr. Vohra is that there could be two
       principal Civil Courts of original jurisdiction within the meaning of
       Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is difficult to accept this
       contention. After the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_81">Delhi High Court Act</a>,
       1966, as amended, this Court has become the principal Civil Court of
       original jurisdiction with respect to every suit the value of which
       exceeds fifty thousand rupees. In view of the non obstante clause
       contained in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/2256/" id="a_82">Section 5</a> of the Delhi High Court Act,
       1966, the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, has ceased to remain the
       principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction with respect to any suit
       value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees. Full effect has to be
       given to the language employed in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/320618/" id="a_83">Section 5</a>
       "notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in
       force" and that can be done only by saying that for purposes of
       Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court of the District
       Judge, Delhi, will be the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction
       in every suit the value of which does not exceed fifty thousand rupees
       but in other suits the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees, this
       High Court will be the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction. It
       cannot be disputed that if original jurisdiction had been completely
       taken away from the Court of the District Judge, Delhi and conferred
       upon this High Court, then notwithstanding Section 24 of the Punjab
       Courts Act, this High Court will be the principal Civil Court of
       original jurisdiction irrespective of the valuation of the suit as in the
       case of what are called the Presidency High Courts. Reference in this
       connection may be made to AIR 1955 Bom 55 in re: <a href="/doc/641435/" id="a_84">Fazlehussein
       Haiderbhoy Buxamusa v. Yusufally Adamji</a>, where it has been held

        that the Bombay High Court in the City of Bombay is the principal
       Civil Court of original jurisdiction. The original jurisdiction value of
       this High Court is in every suit the value of which exceeds fifty
       thousand rupees and therefore, this High Court is the principal Court
       of original civil jurisdiction in every such suit. A jurisdiction of the
       Court of the District Judge, Delhi has been conferred upon this High
       Court and, Therefore, with respect to such part, this High Court will
       be the principal Court of ordinary original civil jurisdiction
       notwithstanding Section 24 of the Punjab Courts Act. We, Therefore,
       agree with the learned Single Judge that for the purpose of this suit
       the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees, the High Court is the
       principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction as contemplated by
       Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure."
</p>
<p id="p_45">25.    Therefore, the Court expressly recognized that the principal civil court
of original jurisdiction would be either the High Court (if the pecuniary
value exceeded `50,000/-) or the District Court (where such value was
below `50,000/-).The Plaintiff‟s reliance on the decision in R.P. Sachdeva
(supra) and Mary Trinidade to contend that the Delhi High Court is not the
principal civil court of original jurisdiction is misplaced. In both R.P.
Sachdeva and Mary Trinidade, this Court was dealing with testamentary
proceedings, and not civil suits, and it is in this context that the Court
refused to recognize itself as the principal civil court of original jurisdiction.
In Mary Trinidade, this Court expressly recognized that <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_85">Section 5(2)</a> of the
Delhi High Court Act confers ordinary original jurisdiction upon the High
Court in every suit exceeding the prescribed pecuniary limit. Therefore, as
held in Bakshi Lochan Singh, this Court to that limited extent becomes the
principal civil court of original jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_47"> 26.      Although this Court in its recent decision in Goyal MG Gases Pvt.
Ltd. (supra), did not follow the decision in Bakshi Lochan Singh (supra) and
held that the term „District Court‟ does not include the High Court
exercising ordinary original jurisdiction notwithstanding the mandate of
<a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_86">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, 1996, it was on the ground that
execution of a foreign decree under <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_87">Section 44A</a> (with which the Court in
Goyal MG Gases was concerned) is different from trial of civil suits, and the
reasoning in Bakshi Lochan Singh cannot be followed for the former. Since
in the present case, this Court is concerned with the question of the High
Court exercising its ordinary original jurisdiction in the context of trial of
civil suits, the decision in Bakshi Lochan Singh would continue to be good
law. The Court in Goyal MG Gases expressly noted that "the non-obstante
clause comprised under <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_88">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966
applies only to suits and not any other proceedings such as execution of
foreign decrees in terms of Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908".This Court is of the opinion that the decision in Goyal MG Gases
affects interpretation of the term „District Court‟ for the further reason that
the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1762940/" id="a_89">M.V. Al Quamar v. Tsavliris Salvage (International)
Ltd</a>., (2000) 8 SCC 278, held that the High Court, when acting as the

a „District Court‟ for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_90">Section 44A</a> read with Section 2(4) of
the CPC, since it does not exercise appellate or revisional powers in such
cases.

decision in Raja Soap Factory (supra). The Supreme Court held - in that

 District Court within the meaning of <a href="/doc/164038/" id="a_91">Section 2(4)</a>. In that case, the issue was
whether a suit for infringement of trade- marks could be instituted in the
High Court of Mysore under <a href="/doc/1114012/" id="a_92">Section 105</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_93">Merchandise
Marks Act</a>, 1958. <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_94">Section 105</a> of the said Act provided that such a suit could
be instituted only in a court not inferior to the District Court. Further,
<a href="/doc/164038/" id="a_95">Section 2(e)</a> of the said Act provided that the term „District Court‟ in that
Act had the same meaning as under the CPC. The Supreme Court held that a
suit under <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_96">Section 105</a> could be instituted in the High Court if the High
Court was vested with ordinary original civil jurisdiction as in such
circumstances, the High Court would be the „District Court‟ under the CPC.
Admittedly, the aforesaid ruling of the Supreme Court was not in the context
of the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_97">Family Courts Act</a>. However, we do not see any justification in
departing from the said interpretation in the context of the Act.
</p><p id="p_49">28.    This Court also holds that the Plaintiff‟s reliance on <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_98">Section 3(17)</a> of
the General Clauses Act, 1897 - which defines „District Judge‟ - is flawed
for two reasons. First, when the Act specifically provides for resort to the
definitions in CPC for the undefined terms in the Act, it would not be
appropriate to ignore the definition of „district‟ and „District Court‟ in
Section 2(4) of the CPC and adopt the definition of „District Judge‟ given in
<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_99">Section 3(17)</a> of the General Clauses Act. Secondly, <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_100">Section 3</a> of the General
Clauses Act itself provides that the definitions given there would not apply
if they are repugnant to the subject and context of the concerned legislation,
i.e. the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_101">Family Courts Act</a> herein (reiterated by the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/1508583/" id="a_102">Karnataka Bank Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, (2008) 2 SCC 254). In the
context of the Act, it would be inappropriate to restrict the jurisdiction of
Family Courts on pecuniary limits basis, as it is not visualized in the Act.

 The only limitation on jurisdiction is based on subject matter and territorial
grounds. Therefore, the definition of „District Judge‟ in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_103">Section 3(17)</a> of the
General Clauses Act is inapplicable. Similarly, Plaintiff‟s reliance on the
definition of „District Court‟ in other legislations on family law is also
immaterial, as the legislative mandate is to examine the definition of
„District Court‟ under the CPC.
</p><p id="p_51">29.    This Court fully endorses the reasoning of the Full Bench of the
Bombay High Court in Romila Jaidev Shroff (supra), where that Court has
sufficiently explained as to why the term „District Court‟ used in <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_104">Sections 7</a>
and <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_105">8</a> of the Act includes a High Court exercising ordinary original civil
jurisdiction. The Court in Romila Jaidev Shroff (supra) noted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "14. Whether it comes to include the expression 'District Court' or not
       is the crux of the dispute. If that definition is closely read, it appears
       that what has been defined is not only the concept of a District but
       what is the area of operation of the Principal Civil Court of Original
       Jurisdiction of that District. In parenthesis, there is also an indication
       to the said Principal Civil Court of the Original Jurisdiction herein
       called a 'District Court'. Once this explanation in the parenthesis is
       understood in its proper perspective, the entire area over which the
       Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction of a District exercises
       its jurisdiction is the District Court for that District. Understood in
       that light section 2(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure can well be
       taken to define concept of a District Court itself. Apart from the
       jurisdiction in a Court either vested or divested by operation of a
       Statute, once a jurisdiction given to the Court, it has to be with
       reference to a territory and most of the time it also has to hold a
       reference to a pecuniary limits. There may be a Court with unlimited
       pecuniary jurisdiction but its territorial jurisdiction will always be
       confined to the clearly demarcated distinct identity which will have to
       be referred to as a District. Understood in that light, the aforesaid




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                          Page 19
        sub-section (4) of section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure clearly
       indicates that the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction is to
       be confined to the area of operation to District for which it is a Court
       viz. District Court. If it is not understood in that light, the words
       appearing in the parenthesis would become redundant.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">30.    The submission that interpreting „District Court‟ to include a High
Court exercising original civil jurisdiction, would be contrary to the other
provisions of the CPC which subordinate District Courts to High Court, is
fallacious and has no merit. Such construction does not in any manner
disturb    the     hierarchy   of   courts   insofar   as   the   High   Court‟s
appellate/extraordinary jurisdiction over District Courts is concerned.
Indeed, subordination of District Courts to High Courts over a class of
matters is possible only if the District Courts had jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon such class of matters to begin with. In instances where the High Court
exercises original civil jurisdiction, the District Court‟s jurisdiction to that
effect is ousted and the question of subordination does not arise at all. The
reasoning of the Bombay High Court in Romila Jaidev Shroff in this regard
is also instructive:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "16. ...As per the aforesaid <a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_106">section 3</a>, no doubt, District Court is
       subordinate to the High Court. This provision of <a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_107">section 3</a> had
       prompted the learned Judges of the Division Bench of this Court in
       Kanak Mehta's case, which is one of the reasons, to hold that the High
       Court cannot be considered as District Court for the purpose of
       <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_108">Family Courts Act</a>. The Family Court does not contemplate the High
       Court to be considered as such. It refers to the District Court or any
       subordinate Civil Court, both, in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_109">section 7</a> as well as <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_110">section 8</a>.</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">       <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_111">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_112">8</a> show that the jurisdiction of the District Court as
       well as subordinate Court is ousted in respect of the matters which




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                          Page 20
        can be entertained by the Family Court. If therefore in exercise of its
       Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction within the local limits, this High
       Court is taking up those very matters which are covered by the Family
       Court Cases, and if it is acting as a District Court, it certainty would
       lose the jurisdiction. It is nobody's case that it is a subordinate Court.
       All that has been urged on behalf of the defendant is that whenever it
       exercises Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction as per Clause 12 for
       the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure, it is a District Court for the
       District of Mumbai which is the local limits. If that be so, it would
       lose the jurisdiction.

<p id="p_54">31.    The Plaintiff‟s reliance on Dhulabhai (supra) to hold that „High
Court‟ is excluded from the purview of „District Courts‟ in <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_113">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_114">8</a>
of the Act is erroneous. <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_115">The Act</a>, specifically in <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_116">Section 8</a>, expressly
excludes the jurisdiction of civil courts („District Courts‟ and all courts
subordinate thereto) to the extent provided in <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_117">Section 7</a> of the Act.
Therefore, the intention of the Parliament is clear - to provide for a separate
mechanism for adjudication of family disputes. Further, the Supreme Court
in Abdul Jaleel (supra) has held that a restrictive interpretation of <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_118">Section 7</a>
of the Act would defeat the objective behind its enactment. A restrictive
interpretation in the instant case, excluding the exercise of this Court‟s
ordinary original civil jurisdiction, would mean that the jurisdiction of a
given class of civil courts is ousted - based solely on the pecuniary value of
the claim. This peculiarity, in the opinion of this Court, does not follow from
Dhulabhaior any subsequent decision on this aspect.

CS (OS) 411/2010                                                          Page 21
 <a href="/doc/160740668/" id="a_119">Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2013) 13 SCC 1. <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_120">Both the Delhi
High Court Act</a> (<a href="/doc/2256/" id="a_121">Section 5</a>) and the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_122">Family Courts Act</a> (<a href="/doc/1105646/" id="a_123">Section 20</a>) contain
non-obstante provisions. In Yakub Memon‟s case, the Court held that where
two statutes provide non-obstante clauses, the principle that the later
legislation would override the earlier one is subject to the principle of
„generaliaspecialibus non derogant‟. A determination as to whether a statute
is a general or a specific one requires an examination of its subject matter
and the purpose for which it was enacted. Plaintiff urges that the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_124">Delhi High
Court Act</a>, 1966 is a special enactment and therefore, it ought to prevail over
the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_125">Family Courts Act</a>, 1984. However, this Court is of the opinion that it is
the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_126">Family Courts Act</a>, instead, which is specific in nature, as it seeks to
constitute a special mechanism for adjudication of disputes of the nature
enumerated in <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_127">Section 7</a> of the Act (details of the distinct nature of the
procedure created under the Act have been discussed above).On the other
hand, the Delhi High Court merely provides for original civil jurisdiction of
this Court based on a prescribed pecuniary limit, which is applicable to all
civil suits. The following observations of the Supreme Court in Abdul
Jaleel‟s case (supra) support this Court‟s conclusion that the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_128">Family Courts
Act</a> is specific in nature:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       "<a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_129">The Family Courts Act</a> was enacted to provide for the establishment

       speedy settlement of, disputes relating to marriage and family affairs
       and for matters connected therewith. From a perusal of the Statement
       of Object and Reasons, it appears that the said Act, inter alia, seeks to
       exclusively provide within the jurisdiction of the Family Courts the
       matters relating to the property of the spouses or either of them...

<p id="p_56">33.    The distinction made out by the Plaintiff between the Delhi High
Court‟s ordinary original jurisdiction and that of High Courts of Bombay,
Madras and Calcutta is inconsequential. The Plaintiff contends that the Delhi
High Court has eleven District Courts subordinate to it, which are the
principal civil courts of original jurisdiction for the concerned districts,
whereas the High Courts of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta are principal civil
courts of original jurisdiction for a defined territory. However, this Court
does not have to address itself to the issue whether this Court, exercising its
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1943756/" id="a_130">Section 5(2)</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, acts as the
principal civil court of original jurisdiction. Indeed, given the phraseology of
<a href="/doc/320618/" id="a_131">Section 5(2)</a> ("the High Court of Delhi shall also have in respect of the said
territories ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which
exceeds rupees two crores"), it cannot be disputed that this Court exercises
„ordinary original civil jurisdiction‟. Section 2(4) of the CPC, while
defining a „district‟ and also „District Court‟, only requires the High Court to
be exercising „ordinary original civil jurisdiction‟ for it to be included in the
definition of „district‟ and „District Court‟, and does not impose any
additional condition for the High Court to be acting as the „principal civil
court of original jurisdiction‟. In other words, the pecuniary limits of
jurisdictions of courts in the NCT of Delhi- structured through the




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                          Page 23
 provisions of the Punjab Civil Courts Act, the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_132">Delhi High Court Act</a> and the
CPC, is such that this court has jurisdiction to entertain and try civil causes
which are in excess of the prescribed pecuniary limits, not otherwise. The
inescapable inference therefore, is that this court is not the principal civil
court of original jurisdiction; it is a civil court of original jurisdiction for all
matters above ` 2 crores (after the amendment to the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_133">Delhi High Court Act</a>,
effective from October, 2015) and for all commercial matters (so defined by
the Commercial Courts Act, again effective October 2015) above ` 1 crore.
The Plaintiff‟s submission in this regard is rejected.
</p><p id="p_57">34.    Counsel for the Plaintiff had argued that the absence of any
qualification in the usage of the term „High Court‟ in the Act, specifically
<a href="/doc/425887/" id="a_134">Section 21</a>, implies that it is used in contradistinction to the term „District
Court‟ and therefore, the High Court‟s ordinary original civil jurisdiction
cannot be ousted. The omission to qualify the term „High Court‟ used in
<a href="/doc/425887/" id="a_135">Section 21</a> does not imply that the phrase „District Court‟ necessarily
excludes the High Court exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction.
Courts, while construing statutory provisions strictly, can, and rightly so,
read the provisions of a statute contextually (<a href="/doc/130620915/" id="a_136">Delhi Airtech Services (P) Ltd.
v. State of U.P</a>., (2011) 9 SCC 354).Therefore, the term „High Court‟ as used
in <a href="/doc/425887/" id="a_137">Section 21</a> cannot include the High Court exercising its ordinary original
civil jurisdiction. On the other hand, <a href="/doc/425887/" id="a_138">Section 21</a> provides for the power of
the High Court to make rules in its administrative capacity. To that extent,
„High Court‟ in <a href="/doc/425887/" id="a_139">Section 21</a> cannot even be interpreted to include instances
where it is exercising its appellate jurisdiction. On the other hand, „High
Court‟ in <a href="/doc/1028712/" id="a_140">Section 4(3)(b)</a> of the Act would include instances where it is
exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, because there is no material




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                             Page 24
 difference as far as the practice of law by advocates in the original side and
appellate side of the High Court is concerned. Indeed, the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/514376/" id="a_141">Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority v. Gobinda Chandra Makal</a>,
(2011) 9 SCC 207 has held that the same words can carry different meanings
in different parts of the same statute, depending upon the context. The Court
noted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">         "36. The same words used in different parts of a statute should
         normally bear the same meaning. But depending upon the context, the
         same words used in different places of a statue may also have
         different meaning. [See: Justice G.P. Singh's Principles of Statutory
         Interpretation - 12th Edition -Pages 356-358]. The use of the words
         'publication of the notification' in <a href="/doc/1802546/" id="a_142">Sections 4(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/332261/" id="a_143">6</a> on the one hand
         and in <a href="/doc/369138/" id="a_144">Section 23(1)</a> on the other, in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_145">LA Act</a>, is a classic example,
         where the same words have different meanings in different provisions
         of the same enactment. The words 'publication of the notification
         under Section 4 Sub-section (1), are used in <a href="/doc/369138/" id="a_146">Section 23(1)</a> for fixing
         the relevant date for determination of market value. The words "the
         last of the date of such publication and giving of such public notice
         being hereinafter referred to as the publication of the date of
         notification" in <a href="/doc/1802546/" id="a_147">Section 4(1)</a> and the words 'one year from the date of
         the publication of the notification" in the first proviso to <a href="/doc/332261/" id="a_148">Section 6</a>,
         refer to the special deeming definition of the said words, for
         determining the period of one year for issuing the declaration under
         <a href="/doc/332261/" id="a_149">Section 6</a>, which is counted from the date of 'publication of the
         notification'. Therefore the context in which the words are used in
         <a href="/doc/1802546/" id="a_150">Sections 4(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/332261/" id="a_151">6</a>, and the context in which the same words are used
         in <a href="/doc/369138/" id="a_152">Section 23(1)</a> are completely different. In <a href="/doc/369138/" id="a_153">Section 23(1)</a>, the words
         "the date of publication of the notification under <a href="/doc/1802546/" id="a_154">Section 4(1)</a>`" would
         refer to the date of publication of the notification in the gazette.
         Therefore, '13.9.2000' will be the relevant date for the purpose of
         determination of compensation and not 16.11.2000."

 Therefore, the plaintiff‟s submission that the unqualified usage of the term
„High Court‟ in the Act must imply that the original civil jurisdiction of the
High Court is not ousted under <a href="/doc/1261278/" id="a_155">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/642406/" id="a_156">8</a> of the Act is rejected.
</blockquote><p id="p_58">35.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff had submitted that there is nothing to
indicate that Family Courts in Delhi have been released from the pecuniary
jurisdiction limit. However, this Court is of the opinion that no such formal
notification extending the Family Courts‟ pecuniary jurisdiction is required.
Once it has been held that „District Court‟ includes the High Court
exercising its original civil jurisdiction, and in the absence of a bar limiting
the pecuniary jurisdiction of Family Courts to any pecuniary limit, they
would assume jurisdiction exclusively regardless of pecuniary values.
</p><p id="p_59">36.    This Court does not agree with the decision of the Full Bench of
Madras High Court in Mary Thomas (supra) in light of the reasons given by
us for the interpretation of „District Court‟ in <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_157">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_158">8</a> of the Act.
Additionally, it appears that the Madras High Court‟s decision was based on
the apprehension (if we may term it so) that a High Court exercising its
ordinary original civil jurisdiction cannot be equated with a District Court.
However, in our opinion, the following observations of the Bombay High
Court in Romila Jaidev Shroff adequately address this concern:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">         "22. ...Everyone accepts the fact that the Original Civil Jurisdiction
         of the High Court is confined to a limit and, therefore, that would be
         a District Court for the purpose of High Court in exercise of that
         jurisdiction. However, at the same time with equal striking
         uniformity, everywhere the learned Judges balk at an idea of treating
         the High Court as a District Court for all purposes of the Civil
         Procedure Code. In our opinion, this hesitation is uncalled for. The
         submission is not and could not be that once the High Court is
         understood to be a District Court, it would become a District Court




CS (OS) 411/2010                                                          Page 26
          for all purposes of the Code. It just cannot be. Apart from the
         Constitutional Scheme, even during pre-constitution days, the High
         Court is at the Apex and predominates Three Tier System operating
         in any States of the Country during Pre-independent Era and Post-
         independent Era. After onset of constitution, it is clearly enshrined in
         it as such. There can therefore be no doubt that the High Court is the
         Higher Court. It can never be a District Court.

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">         23. At the same time when of the several High Courts of this Country
         some of them happen to have Original Civil Jurisdiction by very
         compulsion of logic as and when it exercises its jurisdiction, the
         High Court has to be a District Court for that limited purpose and if
         as a result of its inclusion in that concept if the High Court on its
         Original Side lose its jurisdiction, it does. It needs to be clarified
         that the loss of the jurisdiction will be confined only to that part of
         the Original Civil Jurisdiction as, like in the instant case, is relating

<p id="p_60">37.    This Court‟s interpretation is also in consonance with the object and
purpose of the Act, as gauged from the „Statement of Objects and Reasons‟
and the provisions of the Act. Before we proceed to discuss this aspect, it
would be appropriate to deal with the Plaintiff‟s submission that the
Statement of Objects and Reasons may not be relied upon to construe the
Act. In support of this submission, Plaintiff has relied upon the decision in
Aswini Kumar Ghose (supra). However, subsequently the Supreme Court in
a plethora of decisions has relied upon the statement of objects and reasons
of statutes for the purposes of interpretation. Pertinently, in <a href="/doc/145216099/" id="a_160">Utkal
Contractors and Joinery Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Orissa</a>, (1987) 3 SCC 279,

        "A statute is best understood if we know the reason for it. The reason
       for a statute is the safest guide to its interpretation. The words of a
       statute take their colour from the reason for it. How do we discover
       the reason for a statute? There are external and internal aids. The
       external aids are statement of Objects and Reasons when the Bill is
       presented to Parliament, the reports of committees which preceded
       the Bill and the reports of Parliamentary Committees."

<p id="p_62">Subsequently, the Supreme Court itself noted that the rule laid down in

       the Bill cannot be used or relied upon for the purpose of construction
       of the statute, this rule has not been strictly followed in the subsequent
       judgments. <a href="/doc/407809/" id="a_162">In A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar v. M. Venkatachalam Potti</a>

       Central Bank of India v. Workmen</a> [1960] 1 SCR 200, it was held that

create a separate procedure for resolution of disputes of the nature provided
therein, such that ordinary rules of procedure would not always apply to
such proceedings. The rationale behind this is the endeavor to amicable
resolve disputes concerning family. Accordingly, the procedure prescribed
under the Act, specifically Chapter IV, applies to the exclusion of any
contrary provision in the CPC (<a href="/doc/1617497/" id="a_167">Section 10</a>). In the event that the term
„District Court‟ in <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_168">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1063118/" id="a_169">8</a> was to be interpreted to exclude this
Court‟s exercise of ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the benefits of the
procedure prescribed under the Act would not be available to parties
contesting the suit for the sole reason that the pecuniary value of the suit
exceeds `20 lakhs (or now, in excess of `2 crores). Indeed, this would be
contrary to the object and purpose of the Act.

<p id="p_69"><a href="/doc/1648498/" id="a_172">Section 19</a> clearly establishes the role of the High Court as an appellate and
revisional forum. Unlike provisions of the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_173">Delhi High Court Act</a>, which

the creation of a revisional power and its vesting it in the High Court - from

"...order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Family Court to the High
Court both on facts and on law." Lastly, revisional and appellate power is
conferred in respect of both criminal jurisdiction exercised by the Family
Court (i.e. under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_175">Section 125</a> Code of Criminal Procedure) and civil matters.
Here, it is noteworthy that the Family Court under <a href="/doc/613216/" id="a_176">Section 7</a> (2) exercises
