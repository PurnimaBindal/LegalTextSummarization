JUDGMENT : [PER T.V. NALAWADE, J.]

</p><p id="p_2">1)             The appeal is filed to challenge the decision given by the

learned Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No. 4203/2001.

The said writ petition was filed by the appellants to challenge the

decision of Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal, ('M.R.T.' for short)

Aurangabad given in case bearing No. 59/B/2000/TNC. The said

revision was filed by present appellants to challenge the decision

given by Deputy Collector Aurangabad in Appeal bearing No. TNC

App.116-1973. This appeal was filed by the present appellants to

challenge the decision of Tahsildar in a proceeding which was filed by

Vishwanath Morale, respondent No. 1 under the provision of section

37 of the Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950

(hereinafter referred to as 'Hyderabad Tenancy Act' for short). Both

the sides are heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2)             The learned counsel for respondent No. 1 submitted that

the appeal itself is not maintainable in view of clause 15 of Letters

Patent and in view of the fact that the writ petition was filed by the

present appellants against the decision of M.R.T., Tribunal, over

which this Court has power of superintendence. The learned counsel

for respondent placed reliance on the observations made by this

Court (Division Bench) in the case reported as 1965 Mh.L.J. 426

[Jagannath Vs. Gulabrao] and also subsequent orders made by

this Court in various matters. The learned counsel for respondent

submitted that right from the year 1965, this Court has consistently

held that writ petition filed against the order of M.R.T. needs to be

treated as petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of Constitution of India and

when learned Single Judge decides such petition, it needs to be

presumed that the order was made by the learned Single Judge in

exercise of power of superintendence and so, letters patent appeal

does not lie. The learned counsel for appellants placed reliance on

the observations made by full bench of this Court in two cases

reported as AIR 1994 BOMBAY 141 [Jagdish Balwantrao

Abhyankar and Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.] and

2011 (2) Mh.L.J. 916 [Advani Oerlikon Ltd. Vs. Machindra

Govind Makasare and Ors.].

supra has laid down that when a proceeding is filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India against the order of Court or Tribunal,

this Court cannot treat it as one under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a>, merely because

Court or Tribunal, whose order is assailed, is subject to the power of

superintendence of this Court. It is laid down that in some cases

           the petition; (iii) the reliefs sought; and (iv) the true
           nature of the principal order passed by the Single
           Judge. The true nature of the order passed by the
           Single Judge has to be determined on the basis of the
           principal character of the relief granted. The fact that
           an ancillary direction has been issued under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_16">Article

           has to be ascertained is the true nature of the order

            the     Single      Judge   invokes   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_29">Article    227</a>       of    the

            before the Division Bench in appeal that the nature of
            the controversy, the averments contained in the
            petition, the reliefs sought and the principal character
            of the order of the learned Single Judge would support
            the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that
            the facts justify the invocation of both Articles 226 and
            227 of the Constitution Whether that is so will be
            determined          by   the    Division   Bench         on      the

<p id="p_7">4)             In view of the answers given by the Full Bench of this

Court quoted above and also law laid down by Apex Court which is

referred by the Full Bench, this Court is expected to ascertain the

nature of controversy, the averments in petition which was pending

before the learned Single Judge of this Court. The proceeding before

M.R.T. was filed under section 91 of Hyderabad Tendency Act. The

provision of section 91 which is about the availability of revision runs

as under :-

<p id="p_9">In this regard provision of section 92 of Hyderabad Tenancy Act can

also be seen which runs as under :-

            jurisdiction under this Act shall pass such order

Tahsildar and then against the decision of Tahsildar, there is appeal

available which can be filed before Collector. The decision of the

Collector can be challenged in revision under section 91 of the Act.

The learned counsel for appellants argued that the appeal was

decided by Sub Divisional Officer and not by Deputy Collector and

this point ought to have been considered by M.R.T. There is no force

in this submission as the Deputy Collector was working as Sub

Divisional Officer and to him on the request made by the present

appellants, the matter was transferred. In section 2 (cd), the

definition of 'Collector' is given and Deputy Collector performing the

duty and exercising the powers of the Collector under Hyderabad

Land Revenue Code is included in the definition of 'Collector'. The

record also shows that Deputy Collector decided the appeal. There is

no need to discuss this point more.

<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">6)             The provisions of Hyderabad Tenancy Act show that the

revisional jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 91 is limited by

the section itself. The finding of the fact of the authorities like

Tahsildar and Collector is not expected to be interfered with. It can

be said that if some material was not considered, error is committed

in law, if there was error on the face of the record, then the M.R.T.

could have interfered in the decision of the Collector given in the

appeal.

</p><p id="p_15">7)             The learned counsel for appellants submitted that when

the appellant was declared as protected tenant and appellant had

become deemed purchaser under Hyderabad Tenancy Act, it was not

open to the authority like Tahsildar to reopen the matter and to take

the decision by using the provision of section 37 of Hyderabad

Tenancy Act. This Court has carefully gone through the relevant

record. The record shows that in the year 1956 itself the application

was filed by Vishwanath Morale before Tahsildar after attaining

majority and prayer was made to declare that present appellant was

not protected tenant. The provisions of Hyderabad Tenancy Act show

that for getting the benefit of the provisions and particularly for

getting declaration as protected tenant, the conditions laid down in

section 34 of that Act need to be fulfilled. Those conditions cannot

be fulfilled by the present appellants as there is no record

whatsoever with the appellants to satisfy those conditions. The

persons, who are not covered by section 34 can make an application

under section 37 of the same Act and that application needs to be

made after one year from the date of commencement of the Act and

it should be made within one year from the date of attaining

majority by the minor if minor is the land holder. After that Tahsildar

is expected to make inquiry and decide the matter. Admittedly, no

such proceeding was filed by tenant. It is not disputed that Civil

                                                                 LPA 40/2003
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                  14</span>


Court has declared that Vishwanath was adopted by Laxibai, widow

of original owner Bhaurao in or about year 1942 and when

Hyderabad Tenancy Act came in force, Vishwanath was minor.

Though this circumstance was there, there was declaration made in

favour of appellant that appellant was protected tenant. It appears

that some record was created in or about year 1955 when Amended

Act of 1955 came in to force by the present appellant with the help

of other two widows of Bhaurao like Prayagbai and Sitabai. They

lost their battle in Civil Court where they had contended that

Vishwanath was not legally adopted by Laxmibai. It appears that for

some time the names of Prayagbai and Sitabai were on revenue

record as persons in possession and on that basis they created some

record in favour of appellants. Due to that the appellants could get

the declaration of aforesaid nature. In view of the provisions of

Hyderabad Tenancy Act already quoted, the declaration made in

favour of the appellants was not legal and it was void. On the basis

of facts and aforesaid circumstances, Tahsildar gave decision that

appellants' predecessor was not tenant under Hyderabad Tenancy

Act, there was no question of giving declaration in his favour as

protected tenant and certificate issued in their favour in the year

1992 is void. Thus, on merits, the appellants have no case.

supervision of the Government for some time and only due to some

interim orders made by this Court, the lands were given in

possession of the appellants. The suit was filed for relief of

possession by Vishwanath and the said suit is also decreed in his

favour. A Civil Court has also held that as the successor of Bhaurao,

Vishwanath is entitled to get the possession of the lands. When the

appellants have failed to prove that they were protected tenants

under Hyderabad Tenancy Act and as the two widows of Bhaurao had

no authority to induct the appellants as tenant, the appellants

cannot protect the possession which is given due to order made by

this Court.

<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">9)             The aforesaid factual aspect and position of law are

considered by Tahsildar, the first inquiring authority and also by

Collector, the appellate authority and there are concurrent findings

of these authorities in favour of Vishwanath. There is also decision of

Civil Court in favour of Vishwanath. These circumstances are

considered by M.R.T. The M.R.T. was exercising only revisional power

which is mentioned in section 91 of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act and

after considering the aforesaid record, the orders made by the

authorities are conformed by M.R.T. and the revision is dismissed.

learned Single Judge of this Court the decision of M.R.T. was

challenged and the decision was given within the scope of provision

of section 91 of Hyderabad Tenancy Act. There was no jurisdictional

error and there is nothing on the record to show that some material

was not considered either by the Tahsildar or by the first appellate

authority. Thus, the facts do not justify invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of

Constitution of India. In view of these circumstances, in the present

matter, it needs to be presumed that the learned Single Judge has

considered the matter under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_31">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India,

though in the petition appellants had mentioned Articles 226 also of

Constitution of India. For these reasons, this Court holds that L.P.A.

itself is not tenable. In the result, the appeal stands dismissed.
