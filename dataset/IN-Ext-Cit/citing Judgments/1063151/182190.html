ACT:
Religious  Endowment- Whether absolute or partial-Tests	 for
determining



HEADNOTE:
In  1882,  there  was a partition  of  ancestral  properties
amongst 5 brothers by means of a partition deed Three of the
5  brothers  took the properties mentioned in  the  relevant
schedules  for enjoyment severally, and	 certain  properties
were  kept  for enjoyment in common.  Two brothers K  and  V
were  enjoying	their shares jointly, Clause 1 of  the	deed
excluded from partition the properties specified in  certain
clauses.   One	of  the clauses is  cl.	 8  which  describes
certain	 charity purposes and provides that  the  properties
mentioned in the 8th schedule and allotted for charity shall
be administered by K. Clause 9 makes a special provision  in
connection  with three religious charities in relation to  a
temple.	 The clause mentions that a sum of Rs 45/- had	been
spent  annually for these three purposes, that	arrangement,
had been made for contribution of sums amounting to Rs	13/-
by  three brothers that the dry lands mentioned in  the	 9th
schedule  shall	 be administered by K and from	out  of	 the
income	of  the said properties and from out  of  their	 own
funds  K  and  V shall perform the  aforesaid  charities  by
spending  the balance of Rs 32/without fail.   The  property
mentioned in cl. 9 was not excluded from partition.  At	 the
time  of the partition the income from the property  in	 the
9th schedule was in fact not sufficient to meet the expenses
of  the	 three	charities directed  to	be  performed.	 The
property having been alienated, the respondents filed a suit
for  a declaration that there was an absolute  endowment  of
the property for the performance of the religious  charities
and that the alienation was invalid.
The trial Court decreed the suit.  The first appellate Court
held  that  there was no absolute dedication  and  the	High
Court,	in second appeal, restored the decree of  the  trial
Court.
Allowing the appeal to this Court
HELD  :	 Whether  an  endowment	 is  absolute  or   partial,
primarily depends on the terms of the grant.  If there is an
express	 endowment, there is no difficulty, but if there  is
only an implied endowment, the intention has to be  gathered
on  the	 construction of the document.as a  whole.   If	 the
words  of  the	document  are  clear  and  unambiguous,	 the
question  of  interpretation would not arise.  If  there  be
ambiguity. the intention of the founders has to be carefully
gathered  from the scheme and language of the  grant.	Even
surrounding  circumstances,  subsequent	 dealing  with	 the
property,  the	conduct of the parties to the  document	 and
long  'usage of the property and other relevant factors	 may
have to be considered in an appropriate case. 1607D-F]
In the present case, it is clear from the terms of cl.9	 and
other  material	 provisions of the deed that  there  was  no
absolute endowment of the property to the temple or a trust.
The  property, however, is impressed with the obligation  or
charge	of performing the religious charities  mentioned  in
cl.9 of the partition deed in the manner indicated  therein.
The alienation is therefore, not invalid and the  obligation
to perform the charity follows the property. [607F-G;  608A-
C]
(1)  While  cl. 8 recites that 'the properties mentioned  in
the  8th  schedule  and	 allotted  for	charities  shall  be
administered by K'. cl. 9 recites that dry land mentioned in
the  9th Schedule shall be administered by K.' There  is  no
reference in cl. 9 that the land was allotted for  charity'.
[602D]
(2)  If the property was absolutely dedicated to the  temple
for the performance of the religious charities the intention
of  the	 founders would have been defeated the	income	from
the, property being little or nothing.	A construction of  a
document which would frustrate the intention of the founders
should	be  avoided.  To gather such intention at  the	time
when  the document came into existence the Present value  of
or  present income from, the property is irrelevant.  [602H-
603B]
595
(3)  It	 is  because of the obligation to keep alive  the  3
charities that the property was not allotted to the  temple,
but  was  allotted  to K and V, so that they  may  get	some
recompense out of its income some day. [602G-H]
(4)  The  present case is far from a case where	 the  entire
income	of  the	 property has been endowed  to	a  trust  to
sustain	 a conclusion that the entire corpus belongs to	 the
trust. [608 A]
(5)  This  conclusion drawn from the intrinsic	evidence  of
the document itself, is reinforced by the subsequent conduct
of  the parties and the various transactions  effected	from
time to time with respect to the property. [603 E-F; 607H]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GOSWAMI,  J. In this. appeal we have to go back to a  period
close  upon a passing century to divine what a	Hindu  Joint
Family	that  had separated at that distant  date,  thought,
contemplated,  did and above all intended not only then	 but
also for the future.  It was the year 1882 and precisely  on
13th May of at year an instrument of partition was  executed
and  registered	 amongst  five	brothers,  namely,  Sivarama
krishna	 Pillai,  Kailasam  Pillai,  Venkatachalam   Pillai,
Chidambaram Pillai and Namasivayam Pillai sons of Subramania
Pillai.	  The family appears to be religiously disposed	 and
was keen to perpetuate the pious
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">596</span>
ancestral  ideology, A genealogy given in the  statement  of
case by the appellants gives the appropriate picture for the

To  start  with	 the  deed of  partition,  it  appears,	 the
properties of the family were ancestral and were partitioned
amongst	 the five brothers reserving some to be	 enjoyed  in
common	and allotting certain properties to charities to  be
administered  by  one of their	brothers,  Kailasam  Pillai.
Reading the entire. document it appears that even after	 the
partition  Kailasam Pillai and Venkatachalam Pillai  desired
to  enjoy their shares of the property jointly and were,  in
great  cordiality while the other three brothers  lived	 and
enjoyed	 their properties separately.  It also appears	that
the   second   and   the  third	  brothers,   Kailasam	 and
Venkatachalam  were  given to piety or, at  any	 rate,	were
perhaps	 considered as responsible and solvent persons,	 who
could be entrusted to administer the charities indicated  in
the deed.  There is also reference to family debts and other
amicable  adjustments  amongst	the  brothers  and  also  to
voluntary  relinquishment  of  a  share	 by  Sivaramakrishna
Pillai.	  With this brief synopsis we may now  extract	some
material  provisions of the partition deed (Ext.  Al)  which
was written in Tamil and has been officially translated:

It  appears that Kailasam Pillai in the meantime died as  is
apparent  from	the  partition	deed  (Ext.   A-3)  executed
between Venkatachalam Pillai and Thirumalai Vadvammal  widow
of  Kailasam Pillai on 21-1-87.	 Clause 19 of this deed	 may

</blockquote><p id="p_14">In  this partition deed, the properties of  Kailasam  Pillai
and  Venkatachalam  Pillai were	 divided  and  Venkatachalam
Pillai	took the responsibility of performing the  charities
entrusted  to  Kailasam Pillai under clause 9 of  the  first
partition  deed	 of 1882.  It appears from Ext.	  B-1  dated
8-9-1937,  which  is a sale deed in favour of  S.  Srinivasa
Iyengar, that on 8th November, 1921, the suit properties had
been "usufructually mortgaged for Rs. 11,000/- in favour  of
one  Maragathammal  by	Gomathi Ammal  for  the	 purpose  of
discharging  the  family debts for a period of	five  years.
The  period was extended by a further usufructuary  mortgage
of  the	 properties for a sum of Rs. 7350/- on	26th  April,
1923.	It  also  appears  that the  rights  under  the	 two
usufructuary  mortgage deeds were assigned to  S.  Srinivasa
Iyengar by a deed of' assignment in November, 1962, executed
by  the	 said  Maragathammal  for  a  consideration  of	 Rs.
18,350/-.  Since S. Srinivasa Iyengar made repeated  demands
for  clearing  up  the	debts  due  under  the	usufructuary
mortgages  the	said properties along with some	 other	land
were  sold  to him by Kailasam Pillai  (Jr.),  Venkatachalam
Pillai (Jr.), Gopalakrishna Pillai (defendant 6, briefly  D-
</p><p id="p_15">6) and Perianyagam Pillai
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">600</span>
(defendant  7.	briefly	 D-7) for  a  consideration  of	 Rs.
18,350/-.   So this sale in favour of Srinivasa Iyengar	 was
in  "discharge	of  the said  othi  (usufructuary  mortgage)
debts"	and  the  properties  which  had  already  been	  in
possession  of Srinivasa Iyengar continued to remain in	 his
possession  now	 as owner of the properties with  "power  of
alienation   by	  way  of  gift,  exchanges,   sales,	etc.
absolutely".
</p><p id="p_16">A  third  partition deed (Ext.	A-10) had been	executed  on
19th   October,	  1936,	 amongst  Kaliasam   Pillai   (Jr.),
Venkatachalam  Pillai (Jr.), Gopalakrishna Pillai (D-6,	 and
Prianayagam  Pillai  (D-7)  in	order  to  later  facilitate
absolute  sale of the properties in favour of  S.  Srinivasa
Iyengar	 in 1937.  It was stated in this deed  (Ext.   A-10)
that  "from the property endowed to the temple	of  Sepparai
Algiakootha we shall keep the eternal lamps burning, collect
the  sums which our grandfather endowed for our	 family	 and
use  special efforts to perform the charities".	  In  clause
14(1) of this deed it was stated as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "In  as such as sharer No. 1, Kailasam  Pillai
	      (reference to Kailasam Junior) has voluntarily
	      relinquished in favour of the other 3  sharers
	      the right to perform and administer the family
	      charities	 and the properties endowed for	 the
	      same; sharer No. 1 shall not have at any	time
	      any    right    to    said    charities	  or
	      endowments. . . . "
</blockquote><p id="p_17">Thus  on  8th  September, 1937, a sale	deed  for  the	suit
property and other lands (Ext.	B-1) was executed in  favour
of  S. Srinivasa Iyengar Avergal by Kailasam  Pillai  (Jr.),
Venkatachalam  Pillai (Jr.),Gopalakrishna Pillai  (D-6)	 and
Perianayagam  Pillai  (D-7)  for  a  consideration  of	 Rs.
18350/-.   Srinivasa Iyengar also got his name	recorded  in
the patta.  On 10th June, 1943, S. Srinivasa Iyengar sold by
Ext.  B-2 the suit property, etc. to Sappani Ahmad Mohideen,
father of the two appellants herein, for a consideration  of
Rs.  22600/-.  Sappani Ahmed Mohideen got his name  recorded
in  the patta in due course.  The second appellant,  who  is
the brother of the first appellant, sold some portion of the
suit property to Defendants 3 to 5 on 7th April, 1960.
This  appears  to  be  the history  and	 background  of	 the
litigation.
</p><p id="p_18">The  plaintiffs (the first two respondents) herein  are	 the
great  grandsons of Venkatachalam Pillai son  of  Subramania
Pillai.	  They	instituted  a suit in the  court  of  munsif
Tirunelveli   on   5th	September,  1960,   impleading	 the
purchasers  of	the suit property as Defendants 1 to  5	 and
Gopalakrishna	Pillai,	  uncle	 of   the   plaintiffs	 and
Perianayagam  Pillai,  father of the 2nd plaintiff,  as	 the
defendants  6  and 7 respectively, praying  for	 declaration
that  the suit properties belong to the trust and  that	 all
alienations in respect of them are not binding on the  trust
and for possession of the suit properties from defendants  1
to  5 to "the lawful trustees".	 One written  statement	 was
submitted  on behalf ,of the defendants 1 to 5 and the	suit
proceeded ex-parte against defendants 6 and 7, who were	 not
even examined as witnesses in the trial.
</p><p id="p_19">Two points were in dispute during the trial, namely, whether
the suit was barred by limitation (issue No. 2) and  whether
the   deed  dated  13th	 May,  1882,  creates  an   absolute
dedication of the suit property
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">601</span>
or  only a charge on the income of the said property  (issue
No.  3).  The 1st plaintiff Who was a young man of 28  years
on the date of his giving evidence, examined himself and two
other  witnesses.   The defendants examined only  the  first
defendant.   The trial court answered both the above  issues
in favour of the plaintiffs and decreed the suit.  On appeal
the Subordinate Judge, Tirunelveli, affirmed the finding  of
the  Munsif on the question of limitation but reversed	that
relating  to issue No. 2. He held that the entire income  of
the  suit property was not sufficient even to meet a  minute
fraction  of the expenses and, therefore, the	question  of
absolute  dedication of the property did not arise.  It	 may
be  noted  here	 that  the  trial  court  as  well  as	 the
Subordinate Judge held that the income from the property was
not  sufficient	 to meet all the expenses of  the  charities
directed  to  be performed.  The value of the suit  land  in
1882  was  found by the Subordinate Judge to  be  only	40/-
after  elaborate discussion of the value of the	 neighboring
properties which were subject matters of different sales  at
the relevant time.  When the matter was taken to the  Madras
High  Court in second appeal, the High Court held  that	 the
family	had  divested itself of the ownership  of  the	suit
property and that the deed of partition created an  absolute
endowment of the suit property for the purpose of performing
the  charities mentioned therein.  It further held that	 the
suit  property was not allotted to Kailasam  Pillai's  share
and  he was only made a trustee of the properties.   In	 the
view the High Court took, the second appeal was allowed	 and
the  trial court's decree was restored.	 Hence	this  appeal
with special leave.
</p><p id="p_20">The  only  question that has been canvassed in	this  appeal
before us by the learned counsel for the appellants is	that
the deed of partition (Ext.  A-1) did not create an absolute
endowment  of the suit properties for performing  the  three
kattalis  (endowment  for  religious  charities)   mentioned
therein,  This takes us to the construction of the  document
as a whole with particular reference to the clauses which we
have  set  out earlier therefrom.  The	deed  of  partition
discloses  a  scheme of partial division  of  the  ancestral
properties amongst the brothers.  Three of the five brothers
have  taken properties mentioned in the	 relevant  schedules
for enjoyment severally and certain properties were kept for
enjoyment in common.  Two brothers, Kailasam Pillai and Ven-
katachalam   Pillai  were  enjoying  their  shares  of	 the
properties  jointly.   Provision was made for  discharge  of
family debts and different mutual adjustments have also been
recorded.   Clause  I  of the deed, which we  have  set	 out
earlier,  is  very significant. it excludes  from  partition
properties  specified  in  certain  clauses  including	 the
charity	 properties as detailed in para 8 and  mentioned  in
the eighth schedule.  Property mentioned in clause 9 is	 not
excluded  from partition.  When we look to clause 8 in	this
context, we find that the properties mentioned in the eighth
schedule   are	 "allotted  for	 charity"  and	 "shall	  be
administered	    in	     person	  by Kailasam
Pillai"(emphasissupplied).Inthisclause	 four	objects	  of
charity	 have been mentioned, the expenses of which have  to
be  met	 from  four items of  property	allotted  for  them.
Besides clause 8 refers to mid-day offering of Thirumanjanam
expenses  in the Siva Temple in Rasavallipuram, and also  to
the evening pooja of the said temple.  There is reference in
this clause also to the expenses for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">602</span>
pooja of Lord Siva at Sepparai on "Ani" Uttiram day and also
for feeding four brahmins in the Siva Temple Sepparai during
Dwadashi  days.	  What is, therefore, excluded	for  charity
purposes in clause I is clearly described in clause 8 of the
partition deed.	 Having provided for all these ,charities in
clause	8, clause 9 makes a special provision in  connection
with the same Sepparai Siva Temple "for meeting all expenses
of  lamp burning for ever and one measure of rice for  daily
offering to God and Archana expenses. . . ". Clause 9  takes
note  that  a sum of Rs. 45/- has been	spent  annually	 for
these  kattalais'.   Arrangement has been made	therein	 for
contribution  by two brothers of Rs. 51 each per year and  a
sum of Rs. 3/- per year by another brother, totalling a	 sum
of  Rs.	 13/-  which has to be given  by  them	to  Kailasam
Pillai.	 it  may  be  noted  that  these  two  brothers	 are
unconnected with the suit property after partition.   Clause
9  thereafter recites that "for the balance of Rs. 32/-	 the
dry  land  mentioned  in the ninth  schedule  shall  be	 ad-
ministered  in person by Kailasam Pillai and spent from	 out
of  the income of the said properties and from out of  their
own  funds  Kailasam Pillai and Venkatachalam  Pillai  shall
perform	 the aforesaid	charity	 without  fail". (emphasis
supplied).  The draftsman, who prepared this deed, had	good
reasons	 to  mention  in  clause  8  that  "the	  properties
mentioned in the eighth schedule and allotted for  charities
shall be administered in person by Kailasam" while in clause
9  he chose to record that "dry land. mentioned in  the	 9th
schedule  shall	 be  administered  in  person  by   Kailasam
Pillai".   There is no reference in clause 9 that this	land
shall be "allotted for charity" whereas those words  clearly
appear in clause 8 of the deed.	 In the entire scheme of the
deed  there  must  be a	 legitimate  justification  for	 not
allotting  the	lands mentioned in the	ninth  schedule	 for
charity.  Besides, it is clear on the findings of the courts
below  that  the  value	 of the property  in  1882  was	 in-
considerable and the income out of it was not sufficient  to
meet  tile  expenses  for  the	charities.   A	device	had,
therefore,  to	be made to keep alive the sacred  memory  of
their  parents who were keen to continue these charites	 out
of the ancestral property.  Having divided the properties in
the manner done in the partition deed, each of the  brothers
contributed   according	 to  his  capacity  and	 by   mutual
adjustment  a very substantial share of the expenses was  to
be  borne by Kailasam Pillai and Venkatachalam	Pillai,	 who
were  entrusted	 to perform the charities without  fail,  if
necessary,  which  was even inevitable at the time,  out  of
their  own  funds.   Since it is a common  ground  that	 the
charities  have been performed for years, the burden of	 the
liability must have fallen on kailasam Pillai and thereafter
on  Venkatachalam Pillai, It is because of this	 feature  in
keeping alive the three charities mentioned in clause 9 that
the  lands in the ninth schedule were allotted	to  Kailasam
Pillai	and Venkataclaalam Pillai so that they may get	some
recompense  out	 of  the income of the property	 if  it	 may
somehow or some day be forthcoming.  The entire income	from
the  property  was  little or nil  and	was  not  absolutely
dedicated  to the Temple for the charities.  We have got  to
look  at the matter from what the founders intended  in	 the
year 1882 and no construction. can be given to the  document
which would frustrate the intention of the founders to	keep
alive  the charities by appropriate performance.   If  these
dry  and then barren properties of the ninth schedule  were
absolutely dedicated to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">603</span>
the  Temple  for  performance of  the  three  kattalais	 the
intention  of  the founders would have	been  defeated.	  It
would  have been nobody's business, income being  little  or
nil.  We are, therefore, clearly of opinion that there is no
ambiguity  about  any of the provisions of this	 deed  which
clearly go to show that there was no intendment to create an
absolute endowment of the suit property to the Temple or the
trust.
</p><p id="p_21">The  present  value of the property and the  present  income
therefrom will, in our view, not be relevant nor a safe	 aid
to  gather  the intention of the parties in  1882.   We	 are
unable	to agree with the High Court that "the	wording"  of
the  deed  makes it 'clear beyond doubt' that  there  is  an
absolute  endowment of the property.  We are also unable  to
hold,  as  the	High Court has done, that  "the	 family	 has
divested  itself  of. the ownership and	 Kailasam  has	been
created	 trustee  therefore".  Ext.  A-3 on which  the	High
Court  relied  to  reach its conclusion	 does  not,  in	 our
opinion,   make	 any  departure	 from  the  nature  of	 the
transaction nor from the original intention of the  parties,
particularly  in  view of clause 19 thereof  already  quoted
above.	 Similarly Ext.	 A-10 executed in 1936 on which	 the
High Court relied does not unerringly point to any different
intention  even	 of the succeeding  generation.	  The  first
extract	 quoted	 earlier from Ext.  A-10 does  not,  in	 our
opinion,  relate  to the ninth schedule	 property  when	 the
charity has been specifically endowed in the eighth schedule
to  Ext.  A-1.	Again ,the second extract from Ex  t.  A-10,
namely,	 clause.  14(1), earlier set out, does not,  in	 our
view,  run  counter  to	 the  original	intention  of  their
ancestors.   The  initial intention to be gathered  from  an
ancient	 document when the provisions are  reasonably  clear
cannot	be readily altered to suit changing conditions	over
the  ears.  Even so, if somehow it is possible to hold	that
the subsequent dealing with the property is consistent	with
the  intention of the original	parties to the document,  as
interpreted  by us on the terms of the original	 deed,	that
course	has  to	 be preferred by  the  court.	Besides,  in
interpreting ancient documents courts have to be cautious to
guard	against	 warping  of  the  issue  by  reference	  to
subsequent conduct of parties or their representatives which
may vary for imponderable reasons, bona-fide or otherwise.
Clause 3 of the partition deed mentions only such properties
as have- been allotted to the brothers in full ownership. it
could not mention the property specified in clause 9 because
it is burdended with a charge in favour or kattalais.
We may now refer to some decisions cited at the bar.

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">	      the  donee  may be subjected to  loss  by	 the
	      performance of that condition, are  sufficient
	      to  raise the presumption that in case of	 the
	      increase	of the fund, the donor	intended  to
	      give   to	 the  donee  the  benefit  of	that
	      increase".
</blockquote><p id="p_43">It  was held by the House of Lords in that case	 "that	this
was  a grant upon condition, and not a mere trust, and	that
the Principal and Processors were entitled, after satisfying
the  conditions	 of  the deed of  gift,	 to  appropriate  to
themselves any surplus arising from the lands thus given".
Argument was addressed at the bar with regard to the surplus
income	from the suit property since with progress  of	time
the value of the property has increased and necessarily	 its
income.	  We are, however, of the view that for the  reasons
already	 discussed  in this particular case we will  not  be
required to examine the rule of surplus income in  charities
for the purpose of discovering the intention of the  parties
at the time of initial partition.
</p><p id="p_44">The  principles that emerge from the above decisions so	 far
as. appropriate to the case at hand may briefly be stated.
Whether	 the  endowment is absolute 'or	 partial,  primarily
depends	 on the terms of the grant.  If there is an  express
endowment,  there  is no difficulty.  If there	is  only  an
implied	 endowment, the intention has to be gathered on	 the
construction  of the document as a whole.  If the  words  of
the  document  are clear and unambiguous,  the	question  of
interpretation would not arise.	 If there be ambiguity,	 the
intention of the founders has to be carefully gathered	from
the  scheme  and language of the  grant.   Even	 surrounding
circumstances,	subsequent  dealing with the  property,	 the
conduct of the parties to the document and long usage of the
property   and	other  relevant	 factors  may  have  to	  be
considered in an appropriate case.  'As pointed out earlier,
we  have  a document in the instant case where there  is  an
express endowment of certain specified properties as recited
in-clause  8 of the deed.  Significantly, there is  complete
omission to create an absolute endowment of the property  in
the  ninth  schedule  although the same is  referred  to  in
clause	9  of  the deed and has been dealt with	 in  a	very
special manner therein.	 There is absolutely no doubt on the
terms of clause 9 read with the other material provisions of
the  deed  that there is no absolute endowment of  the	suit
property  in  favour of the temple or for the  charities  as
claimed by the planitiffs/respondents.	We may, however, add
that  the  conclusion  we have reached	from  the  intrinsic
evidence  of  the  document  itself  is	 reinforced  by	 the
subsequent   conduct   of  the	parties	 and   the   various
transactions  effected from time to time with regard to	 the
suit properties.  To boot, it is far from a case where the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">608</span>
entire income of the property has been endowed to the  trust
to  sustain a conclusion that the entire corpus	 belongs  to
the trust.
</p><p id="p_45">Having	regard to the principles set out above, it is  clear
that in the present case there was no absolute endowment  of
the suit property to the temple or the trust.  The property,
however,  is  impressed	 with the obligation  or  charge  of
performing the three kattalais mentioned in clause 9 of	 the
partition  deed	 in  the  manner  indicated  therein.	 The
alienation  of the property is, therefore, not	invalid	 and
the  obligation	 to perform the	 above	mentioned  charities
follow with the property.
</p><p id="p_46">In the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment of	 the
High Court is set aside and that of the Subordinate Judge is
restored  subject  to the direction that the  suit  property
will  be  impressed  with  the	obligation  to	perform	 the
charities  mentioned  in clause 9 of the partition  deed  of
1882 and the plaintiffs' suit stands dismissed.	 The parties
will bear their own costs in this Court.
