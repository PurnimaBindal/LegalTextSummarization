</p><p id="p_4">                          3.    SUN had filed the suit, inter alia, alleging infringement of its
                          trademark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27; and passing off and seeking a decree of

                          manufacturing pharmaceutical companies in the world. Amongst other
                          pharmaceutical products, it also manufactures a generic drug for
                          second line treatment of advanced breast cancer containing an active
                          ingredient &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27; under the trademark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;. Sun
                          claims that it is doing so since 01.09.2001.
</p><p id="p_6">                          5.    SUN applied for registration of the trademark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;
                          falling under Class 5 on 16.04.2001. The said application was
                          objected/opposed by Novartis AG on the ground that &#x27;LETROZ&#x27; is
                          deceptively similar to the international non-proprietary name (INN)
                          &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;. SUN secured              registration of the trademark

</p><p id="p_9">                           7.     It is not disputed by the parties that the drug being sold by SUN
                          and HETERO is the same generic drug derived from the active
                          ingredient &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_10">                          8.     SUN claims that due to the superior quality and high efficacy of
                          the product, its sales increased to ₹8.34 crores in the year 2016-17. It
                          also claims that it had incurred huge expenses towards the publicity of
                          its product &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;. It acquired immense reputation and goodwill
                          in the said trademark and the goods sold thereunder.
</p><p id="p_11">                          9.     SUN further claims that on account of registration, it has a
                          statutory right to exclusively use the registered trademark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;.
                          And, it is entitled to an order restraining HETERO from using the
                          trademark &#x27;LETERO&#x27; as it is deceptively similar to its registered
                          trademark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_12">                          10.    It is alleged that HETERO has started using the impugned mark
                          &#x27;LETERO&#x27; in the year 2017 in order to pass off their goods as those of
                          SUN and is trying to ride on the goodwill and reputation earned by
                          SUN.
</p><p id="p_13">                          11.    The injunction was, thus, sought alleging not only infringement
                          of the trademark but also passing off the goods by HETERO as those
                          of SUN.
</p><p id="p_14">                          12.    HETERO contests the claims made by SUN. It contends that the
                          word LETROZ is derived from the word &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;, which is an
                          international non-proprietary name (INN) of a salt; therefore, SUN
                          cannot claim monopoly in use of the said word. The word / mark
                          LETROZ, is the first six letters of the said INN and its registration
                          does not entitle SUN to claim exclusive rights in respect of the word

</p><p id="p_15">                          13.   HETERO contends that it is common practice in the
                          pharmaceutical industry to use trademarks derived from the active
                          pharmaceutical ingredient (API). It further argued that the mark
                          &#x27;LETERO&#x27; is a registered trademark of HETERO and is coined by
                          combining the first two letters of the salt &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27; with the last
                          four letters of HETERO, that is, &#x27;TERO&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_16">                          14.   It further claimed that HETERO has trademarks registered for
                          various other products, where it has been using the mark by combining
                          the last four letters of its name that is &#x27;TERO&#x27; with other letters,
                          making it a distinctive and coined mark.
</p><p id="p_17">                          15.   HETERO further claims that even otherwise SUN, being aware
                          of the use of the mark by HETERO since the year 2007, is not entitled
                          for any injunction in terms of <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_1">Section 33</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999
                          having acquiesced for use of the mark by HETERO.
</p><p id="p_18">                          16.   In addition, it is contended that the mark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27; and the
                          mark &#x27;LETERO&#x27; are not phonetically or in any manner identical so as
                          to lead to any confusion in the mind of the consumers. It is argued
                          that the drug in question is for the treatment of advanced breast cancer
                          and is a Schedule H drug. The said drug is not available without a
                          prescription by a doctor. The drug is prescribed by an oncologist, who
                          has specialised in the treatment of cancer and therefore, there is little
                          possibility of confusion.
</p><p id="p_19">                          17.   HETERO further relies upon the replies given by SUN to the
                          examination reports, in relation to the registration of its mark
                          &#x27;LETROSUN&#x27;,          wherein   SUN   argued   that   &#x27;LETROSUN&#x27;           is

                          submissions, did not find any case for grant of interim injunction and
                          dismissed the application under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 of the CPC. The
                          relevant extract of the impugned order reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                        &quot;So, when we compare the trade mark of the plaintiff
                                  LETROZ and that of the defendant LETERO, it is clear that
                                  there is no deceptive similarity which can confuse the doctor
                                  or the chemist. Admittedly, there is huge difference in the
                                  prices of the medicines. The composition are totally similar as
                                  reflected clearly on the boxes. However, the maximum retail
                                  price over the medicine of the plaintiff is reflected as
                                  Rs.187.80/-, whereas the medicine of the defendant, costs
                                  Rs.60/- which is more than thrice of the defendant. Meaning
                                  thereby, the plaintiff intends to get enrichment at the cost of
                                  general public. The pronunciation of the trade mark i.e.
                                  LETERO and that of LETROZ is totally different. The names
                                  of both are also different.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                        It is beyond understanding as to how the plaintiff can
                                  stop the defendant from using Ist two alphabets when he
                                  himself is using all the 6 alphabets LETERO of the generic
                                  name i.e LETEROZOLE.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                        Hence, on the basis of the pleadings and also the
                                  documents placed on record by the parties, no prima-facie
                                  case is made out in favour of the plaintiff and against the
                                  defendants. The balance of convenience also does not lie in

                          prima facie conclusion that both marks were identical and the
                          defendant had merely deleted the last letter &#x27;E&#x27; from the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          trademark &#x27;GATE&#x27; and that the mark &#x27;GATE&#x27; was not deceptively

                          2009 SCC OnLine Del 3886, a Coordinate Bench of this Court upheld
                          the order passed by the learned Single Judge declining to grant an
                          injunction to the plaintiff, who had filed a suit for infringement of its
                          marks     &#x27;TEMODAL&#x27;        and   &#x27;TEMODAR&#x27;,       in   relation    to     its
                          pharmaceutical products containing &#x27;TEMOZOLOMIDE&#x27; as the API.
                          The drug in question is used for the treatment of brain cancer. The
                          plaintiff alleged that the defendant&#x27;s marks, &#x27;TEMOKEM&#x27; and
                          &#x27;TEMOGET&#x27; were deceptively similar to its trademarks and therefore,
                          the defendant was required to be interdicted from using the said
                          trademarks. The said contention was not accepted. It was held that the
                          marks were not identical and there was no phonetic or visual similarity
                          between them. The trademarks were derived from the drug
                          &#x27;TEMOZOLOMIDE&#x27; and the suffix, &quot;KEM&quot; and &quot;GET&quot;, are entirely
                          different and distinct from the suffix &quot;DAL&quot; and &quot;DAR&quot;. Both were
                          Schedule H drugs and could be sold in retail but only on the
                          prescription of a registered medical practitioner. The Court observed
                          the fact that the product in question is a highly specialized drug and
                          used for specific treatment of brain cancer was an important factor in

                          cause confusion. The Court also took note of the fact that there was
                          an immense price difference between the products of the appellant and

                          word &quot;TEM/TEMO&quot; is publici juris and also generic for and
                          descriptive of the chemical component &#x27;TEMOZOLOMIDE&#x27; and,
                          therefore, the appellant cannot claim an exclusive right to use thereof.
                          The relevant extract from the said decision is set out below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                &quot;108. These may be some of the grounds for the appellants to fail
                                in their action against the respondents, but these are not the only
                                grounds why the Court would deny interim relief of injunction in
                                cases like these. For the appellants to succeed, they must also
                                establish that the respondents have no right to use the generic
                                name/abbreviation of the compound &#x27;TEMOZOLOMIDE&#x27; in their
                                drugs, and that the appellants have an exclusive right in this
                                regard. This, unfortunately for the appellants, they have failed to
                                show. In our view, for the appellants to fail it is enough that the
                                appellants&#x27; trademark have been coined by combining the publici
                                juris abbreviation TEM/TEMO for TEMOZOLOMIDE with the
                                suffix &#x27;DAL&#x27; in one case and &#x27;DAR&#x27; in the other case, the marks
                                of the appellants are descriptive, and the marks of the
                                respondents do not bear phonetic or visual similarity which could
                                be said to be deceptive or confusing for the purchasers of the
                                drugs in question.

                           squarely applies to the facts of the present case. The appellant, in the
                          present   case,      cannot   be   allowed   to   monopolize   the    INN
                          &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;.           The mark, &#x27;LETROZ&#x27;, is not similar to the
                          trademark &#x27;LETERO&#x27; merely because both the parties have adopted
                          the initial letters (SUN adopted the first six and HETERO adopted the
                          first three) of the INN &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;. It is apparent that both SUN
                          and HETERO are using their marks, which are derived from the INN
                          &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;, which is descriptive of the active ingredient of the
                          drug, that is, &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_44">                          36.   In the present case, there is also a marked difference in the price
                          of both the products being sold by SUN and HETERO. SUN is selling
                          its product at ₹187.80/- and HETERO is selling it for ₹60/-.
</p><p id="p_45">                          37.   The learned Commercial Court found that the trademarks in
                          question were not similar. We concur with the prima facie view of the
                          learned Commercial Court. Prima facie, there is little possibility of
                          confusion or deception in the mind of the purchaser of the drug.

                          OnLine Del 508, the plaintiff was using the trademark &#x27;NIMULID&#x27;
                          and had filed a suit for injunction against the defendant for using the
                          mark &#x27;REMULIDE&#x27; in relation to the same medicine with the API
                          being &#x27;NIMESULIDE. This Court held that when the name is derived
                          or coined from the name of the principal ingredient being used in the
                          manufacture of the drug, no distinctiveness or exclusiveness can be
                          claimed by the manufacturer. The said decision is applicable to the
                          facts of this case as well; the mark &#x27;LETROZ&#x27; is nothing but a short
                          name of the active ingredient &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;.

                          similar marks, that are, &#x27;FALCITAB&#x27; and &#x27;FALCIGO&#x27;. Both parties
                          in the said case were using the name &#x27;CADILA&#x27;, as a corporate name
                          and were selling the drug for the treatment of falciparum malaria
                          under the respective trademarks.

                          fact whether there is a likelihood of deception or causing confusion.
                          The Supreme Court, in the facts of the case, held that the products
                          being sold by the parties will be purchased by both villagers and
                          townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate, and the question has to be

                          their observations with completely different side effects and therefore,
                          the test should be applied strictly as the possibility of harm resulting
                          from any kind of confusion by the consumer can have disastrous
                          results. The Court further held that the confusion is more likely in

                          registered medical practitioner, especially, for the treatment of an
                          ailment as serious as breast cancer, it is difficult to accept that the said
                          medical practitioner is likely to be confused because the initial three

                          likely to get confused because the two drugs are being sold with a
                          mark containing the same first three letters, that are, &#x27;LET&#x27; when the
                          same are admittedly derived from the INN &#x27;LETROZOLE&#x27;; more so,

                          also by many other companies, a majority of which selling the said

                          being sold since the year 2007. SUN has not filed any document or

                                exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the
                                appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of
                                the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except
                                where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised
                                arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had
                                ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of
                                interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion
                                is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not
                                reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from
                                the one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court
                                was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court
                                would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of
                                discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had
                                considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a
                                contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the
                                trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the
                                appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify
                                interference with the trial court&#x27;s exercise of discretion. After

                                     established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to
