taken as from 22.06.1979 to 28.10.1995. The accused retired

from service in May 2004 and the charge-sheet came to filed in

May 2004.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

Police, Lokayuktha, Bangalore. Thereafter, obtaining the search

warrant from the Special Judge, the house of the AGO and also

his office was raided on 27.10.1995. It is the charge against the

accused that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his

known source of income to an extent of 240% more than his

source. The Investigating Officer had taken the income of the

accused considering Schedule 1 of Part II, which is as follows:

<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">     6.    The   Investigating   Officer   after   considering   the

income, assets and also the amount spent by the AGO, comes to

the conclusion that a sum of Rs.18,75,064.52/- is his assets and

expenditure during the check period was Rs.4,33,521/-. Totally

it comes to Rs.23,08,585.52/- and after deducting his income of

Rs.5,62,374/-, the assets and expenditure of AGO during the

cheque period in excess of his known source of income is

Rs.17,46,211.52/- and contend that extent of excess of assets

and expenditure in percentage comes to 310.50%.


</p><p id="p_43">     7.    The accused was secured and he denied the charges

levelled against him. The prosecution in order to prove the case,

examined nine witnesses and relied upon the documents at

Exs.P.1 to 27. The defence also got marked Ex.D.1 and Ex.C.1.

The Trial Court after considering both oral and documentary

evidence placed on record, convicted the accused in coming to

the conclusion that the accused has committed an offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_2">Section 13(1)(e)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_3">Section 13(2)</a> of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      6</span>



Act   and    sentenced    the   accused    to   undergo   rigorous

imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay fine of

Rs.18,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine, rigorous

imprisonment for a period of six months. Hence, the present

appeal is filed before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">      8.    The main contention in this appeal is that the

prosecution has failed to establish that the accused was required

to file his assets and liabilities every year. The Corporation has

not taken any action for having not filed the annual property

returns as per the Karnataka Civil Services (Conduct Rules). Rule

23 is applicable to the Government Servants as per the Conduct

Rules. The Government Servant means any person appointed to

any civil service or post in connection with the affairs of the

State of Karnataka. The accused was working in the Corporation,

which is a public undertaking. It is also contended that the

Corporation by notification dated        20.08.1993   directed the

employees to furnish the assets and liabilities statement on an

annual basis as is done by the civil servants of the State. The

same was challenged by the employees before the Assistant

Labour Officer and stay was granted and the same was

challenged before this Court and this Court did not interfere with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>



the order of the Assistant Labour Officer in terms of Ex.C.1. The

prosecution has not made out how the provisions of KCSR is

applicable to the appellant. The finding of the Trial Court that

KCSR is applicable is not on the basis of any records. The Trial

Judge has committed an error that Government notification

dated 29.10.1981 is applicable. The said notification is not

applicable to the accused, as he is not a Government servant.

The subsequent notification dated 20.08.1993 was stayed and

hence he was not required to submit the same. The Trial Judge

has come to an erroneous conclusion that the accused is not a

workman. The observation that said fact cannot be considered

and all the income which were not disclosed to the Department

has to be considered as disproportionate to the known source of

income. The said finding suffers from non-application of mind.


</p><p id="p_46">     9.    The learned counsel would also submit that the

witness who was examined before the Court has specifically

admitted that Conduct Rules are not applicable to them and the

Circular was stayed. When such being the case, the Special

Judge ought not to have come to the conclusion that the

Conduct Rules are applicable to the accused and he was bound

to submit the assets and liabilities statement. The very approach
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     8</span>



of the Trial Court with regard to the filing of the assets and

liabilities is erroneous. The learned counsel would also submit

that in the source report itself, it is specifically mentioned that

the employees of the said Corporation were not filing the assets

and liabilities. When such being the case, the Trial Court has

committed an error.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">      10.   The other contention is that the accused was asked

to submit Schedule 1 to 10 and accordingly he has submitted the

details supporting the documents. The Police Inspector Sri

B.B.Patil, who registered the case and conducted the raid of the

house and office of AGO. Thereafter, the case was transferred to

Sri A.N.Swami - P.W.7. He conducted further investigation and

verified the source of the accused based on the schedule

furnished by the accused. The prosecution has not examined the

person, who registered the case and conducted the raid. The

subsequent Investigating Officer Sri A.N.Swami, who conducted

the investigation between 1996 to 1999 in his evidence

categorically   says   that   his   predecessor   has   received   the

particulars as per Exs.P.16 and 17. He has verified the

statements filed by the accused. The statements collected by

him are found to be correct and the accused has furnished his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   9</span>



known source of income and assets and liabilities. Hence, it is

clear that the source furnished by the accused is correct and

there was no scope for filing the charge-sheet and this aspect

was ignored by the Trial Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">      11.   The other contention is that four officers have

conducted the investigation for a period of eight years and Sri

B.B.Patil was authorized to investigate and the same was

transferred to P.W.7 - Swami and thereafter one Jayaram then

to P.W.8 - H.K. Ramesh Kumar and in turn to P.W.9 -

N.V.Sakhri, who filed the charge-sheet. Under <a href="/doc/1275133/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the

Act, the offence involving <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_5">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Act shall not be

investigated without the order of the Police Officer not below the

rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. The learned counsel

would submit that in this regard, specific question was put to

P.W.7 and he categorically admits that no special authorization

was received, but on account of him posting to the post of Police

inspector, he took up the further investigation. Hence, he had no

authorization.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">      12.   The learned counsel in support of his contentions

relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span>



of VISHAKAPATNAM v. SURYA SHANKARAN KARRI reported

in 2006(7) SCC 172 and brought to my notice paragraph

Nos.13, 18 and 19 and contended that illegal investigation

amounts to miscarriage of justice. The learned counsel would

also submit that, P.W.7 has categorically admitted that he has

verified the source report and the same was found correct and

the only option for him was to submit "closure report" and the

same has not been done.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">      13.   The learned counsel would contend that the entire

prosecution is founded on incorrect proposition of law. The

assets at the beginning of the check period are not taken into

consideration. The accused has submitted Schedule II, the

statement of inherited properties, movables and immovables

including jewelry. The accused has produced several RTCs and

other documents to establish his assets at the beginning of the

check period. When the accused joined the service, in terms of

statement 2 of the accused, his family had owned 6 acres 15

guntas of agricultural land. The accused also claimed agricultural

income of Rs.2,68,450/- during the check period. It is also his

contention that his father was managing the property till his

death i.e., in the year 1983 and after the death of his father on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    11</span>



24.7.1985, he received Rs.18,450/- from his brother and the

same was credited to S.B. Account No.9266/26, Canara Bank,

Kumara Park, Bangalore. Thereafter, a family meeting was held

and his elder brother Shivalingaiah has continued the agricultural

operations and he has to give Rs.25,000/- per year to the

accused. He received D.Ds in this regard and the accused has

totally received an amount Rs.2,68,450/- from his agricultural

income. The Special Judge has considered entire agricultural

income and only taken 1/4th instead of 1/3rd and the said finding

of the Special Judge is erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">     14.      The other contention of the accused is that he had

purchased the property which is valued at Rs.1,000/- measuring

1.3 guntas of land. The accused in his explanation has stated

that the said land was purchased on 18.12.1980 and the same

was purchased with the savings and proceeds of the agricultural

income. The Special Judge though made reference in paragraph

No.46 of the judgment, the defence of the accused has not been

considered.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">     15.      In   respect   of   item   No.2   property   situated   in

Yellakunte Village, its value is only Rs.20,000/- and the accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                12</span>



has explained the source that the same was acquired on

22.12.1989 out of the agricultural income and savings. The

explanation of the accused has not been considered and also not

accepted the same.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">     16.   In respect of item No.3, site No.791 situated at 4th

Stage, Vijayanagar, Mysore, the value is Rs.1,50,000/-. The said

site was purchased on 08.09.1994 from MUDA, Mysore, out of

the income received by way of rent and advance received in the

property inherited by this wife situated at Kuvempu Nagar,

Mysore. The said property was yielding rent of Rs.3,300/- and

advance of Rs.30,000/- was received. Out of this amount, item

No.3 was purchased. The Trial Judge has committed an error

that the said property also belongs to the accused.


</p><p id="p_61">     17.   The accused has produced sufficient material to

prove that property in item No.14 belongs to his wife and she

has acquired the same from her father. In this regard, the

accused has produced along with Schedule 1 to 10, the affidavit

of his father-in-law along with the RTCs of his holdings and the

Trial Judge has not considered the same.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               13</span><p id="p_62">



</p><p id="p_63">     18.   In respect of item No.4, the accused took the house

when he was working at Tumkur and during the said period after

taking the loan from EPF account, he has secured a house on

lease to avoid monthly rental. The said lease period expired on

30.06.1995 and the owner though paid the amount by issuing

the cheque, the same was dishonoured and hence the lease was

extended on 25.08.1995 for a further period of two years.

Hence, the accused leased out the premises on a monthly rent of

Rs.2,100/- and received an advance of Rs.30,000/-. Hence, the

balance available was only Rs.40,000/-. However, the asset is

shown as Rs.70,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">     19.   In respect of item No.5 Maruti car, which was

standing in the name of his wife, the accused has explained the

source stating that he has received a loan of Rs.1,00,000/- from

Pundarika Gandhi of Chunchankatte and Ex.P.22 supports the

said claim. The Trial Judge has given the finding that the same

cannot be treated as income as the same has to be returned.

The loans received are the receipts during check period and the

same will have to be treated as income from known sources.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               14</span>



</p><p id="p_66">     20.   The learned counsel would submit that in respect of

item Nos.6 and 7 - vehicle luna and scooter, the value of the

scooter is Rs.15,000/- and the same was sold for Rs.13,000/-.

The difference is only Rs.2,000/-. However, the Trial Court has

considered the entire value as the asset of the accused. In

respect of item No.8, the prosecution has valued Rs.3,300/- in

respect of two bicycles. The accused was having only one bicycle

i.e., value of Rs.1,800/-. The Trial Court has erroneous taken

Rs.3,300/- and the same has to be deducted.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">     21.   The learned counsel would submit that the Special

Judge has taken the bank deposit to the tune of Rs.4,78,340/-.

Actually it was Rs.4,28,256/-. The amount of Rs.1,00,000/-,

which was kept in deposit belongs to his elder sister who was an

illiterate, out of the retirement benefit of her husband and the

said amount was returned with an acknowledgment. The same

shall not be taken into account and the same was added. It is

the case of the accused that an amount of Rs.41,961/- belongs

to his sister Manohara, who underwent treatment for cardiac

problem which was deposited in his account for her treatment.

In support of his claim, the accused also produced the

documents proof regarding retirement of the husband of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  15</span>



sister of the accused and the proof regarding payment made to

the sister of the accused and also the receipts obtained from his

sister Smt. Gowramma. The Trial Judge without verifying the

documents has erroneously come to the conclusion that the

deposits are to the tune of Rs.4,78,340/-. The total shall be

Rs.2,86,292/- and not Rs.4,28,256/-.
</p>
<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">     22.   In respect of cash found to the tune of Rs.7,281/-,

the accused has explained the same. In respect of item No.13

regarding gold jewelry and silver articles, the Special Judge has

committed an error in not taking note of the gold and silver

articles inherited by his wife and taken only an amount of

Rs.1,67,093/- and comes to an erroneous conclusion that

Rs.1,00,000/- was invested by the accused during the cheque

period, without any basis. The learned counsel would also submit

that the witness P.W.4 who has been examined before the Trial

Court categorically admitted that the valuation was done by the

police themselves and not by any appraiser.
</p>

accused that the said property was inherited by his wife from her

father Sri K.T.Lakshm Gowda and her father was having 40 acres

of dry land, 20 acres of wet land, 7 acres of coconut farm and

areca nut garden. The documents are produced before the Court

that his father-in-law constructed the house. Inspite of the

same, the Trial Judge has committed an error in coming to the

conclusion that the said property is also the asset of the

accused.

the prosecution has claimed deductions from the salary of

Rs.83,522/- as assets. The amount deducted in the salary are

LIC, EPF, EDSF, Professional Tax and NSC's, all these items are

included in item No.10 in Annexure-3, the prosecution could not

have shown this deduction as assets which would inflate the

assets and amounts to double entry of assets. The Trial Judge

without looking at this aspect and also without verifying the

account has included this as asset.

<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">     25.   The learned counsel in his arguments referring the

aspects in respect of each item of the property over all

contended that the trial Judge has committed an error in coming
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                17</span>



to the conclusion that the accused has not declared his assets

and liabilities. The learned counsel also vehemently contended

that the sworn affidavit of the father of the AGO's wife with

regard to obtaining the property in the name of his daughter and

construction has not been taken into consideration. The learned

counsel would contend that the said affidavit was found in the

house itself at the time of conducting the raid and the affidavit

came into existence prior to the raid and not conducted any

investigation on this aspect. In spite of this, the AGO has in his

statement while submitting schedule 1 to 10, categorically

claimed the same. The trial Judge also failed to take note of the

fact that the wife is an Income Tax Assessee and she was

declaring her income in respect of the house in which she was

getting the rent.

<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">      26.   The value has not been appraised by the appraiser of

gold. It is elicited in the cross-examination that the value has

been assessed by the police themselves. The entire investigation

conducted by the Police is biased and the same is also not done

by the persons, who have been authorised. The learned counsel

also brought to the notice of this Court that the trial Judge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                   18</span>



carried   away    and   ordered   to   further   investigation   after

conclusion of the trial and the same was challenged before this

Court and this Court set aside the same. Hence, the trial Judge

has prejudiced in forming an opinion that the case of the

prosecution has been proved.

P.W.7,    who    has   been   examined   as   conducted   only   part

conducted the further investigation for the period from 2002 to

2005 and his evidence, is also not helpful to the prosecution. The

Investigation Officer, who conducted the investigation from

1999 to 2002, has not been examined. Further contended that

the Investigation Officer, who registered the FIR and conducted

the Mahazar also, has not been examined.

authorized to investigate the matter in terms of Ex.P24. But the

fact is that he has not conducted any further investigation. There

was no authorization to the Investigating Officer - Swamy, who

had filed the final report and Jayaram, who had also filed the

final report and only charge sheet is filed by P.W.9 - N.B.Sakri

and he has not conducted any investigation. The very approach

of the Trial Court is that the mother-in-law and father-in-law

were not examined, is erroneous. When the affidavit was found

in the house of the AGO at the time of the raid, the Investigating

Officer ought to have investigated the matter with regard to the

said affidavit and the same has not been done. The Trial Court

also committed an error relying upon the Government Order of

1981   and   subsequent    Notification   was   stayed.     P.W.4

categorically says that the jewel appraiser was not present at the

time of conducting the Mahazar and the source report also does

not disclose that the income of the AGO beginning of the check

period was not considered. The learned counsel referring the

averments both in the appeal memo as well as in oral arguments

vehemently contended that the trial Judge has committed an

error in convicting the accused.

that even if the Investigation Officer has not been authorized,

the same would not vitiate the investigation if no prejudice is

caused.     The accused has not made out any case of prejudice

given by the accused and the same found correct.

by the ALO is in respect of the Labour and the accused is an

Engineer and the subsequent Circular, which was stayed by the

ALO will not come to the aid of the accused.      Hence, the trial

expenditure of agriculture and has taken the amount from the

agricultural head and not discarded the material placed by the

The learned counsel would submit that the burden on the

accused shifts only on the prosecution proves the case and the

details of children of the AGO regarding education expenses and

so also the sericulture as well as horticulture details as per

Ex.P.10 to 13. The valuation of the building as per Ex.P.2. This

witness was subjected to cross-examination.

predecessor had received the particulars in respect of Annexures

1 to 10 with regard to known sources of income as per Exs.P.16

and 17. It is elicited that he has verified the statements filed by

the accused and found to be correct. He also admits that the

accused has furnished the known sources of income and Assets

and Liabilities Statement. It is elicited that he does not

remember    whether    he   had   formed    an   opinion   after   the

investigation to refer it to 'B' summary. He admits that only 80%

of the investigation was complete, so he cannot say the final

opinion of formation of the opinion of the case. It is elicited that

he cannot say whether the father-in-law of the AGO was

inherently rich though he has donated a place for the veterinary

hospital. However, he admits that RTCs may disclose that his

father-in-law was having sufficient lands. He also admits that

affidavit received by his predecessor which was already marked

as Ex.P.4. He admits the declaration filed by the wife of the AGO

in regard to the payment of income tax in terms of Ex.P.18. A

site was allotted in the name of Nalinakshi by MUDA and

identifies the related papers as Ex.P.19. The witness also

identifies the approval of plan for construction issued by MUDA

as per Ex.P.20 and he also identifies the income tax returns of

the wife of the AGO and tax paid receipt seized at the time of

raid as per Ex.P.21. The family of the accused was essentially an

agricultural family. The food grains were being grown, in the

land according to the entries in the RTCs. If the food grains are

grown in the house, it is far less than if the person goes for

purchase. He has not seized the gold articles, hence he cannot

say whether gold seized are roll-gold articles. He also admits

that he has not recorded the statement of Nalinakshi, so he

cannot say whether she has claimed that gold articles are

presented by some others. He also admits that he has not done

any property investigation, so he cannot comment on it.       He

does not know personally whether the father-in-law of the AGO

has constructed the house under the supervision of his son. He

admits that he has investigated till January 1999. He took up the

authorization is received, but on account of his posting to the

post of PI, he took up the further investigation. He admits that

he has almost completed the investigation but volunteers that

completed 60%. He admits that he cannot say whether he has

formed an opinion that it is not a fit case for filing the charge-

sheet but a case for filing 'B' report.

was subjected to cross-examination. In the cross-examination,

he admits that prior to taking up the investigation, Swami and

Jayaraj had conducted the investigation. He admits that as per

investigation on 19.03.2004 and verified the documents and has

corrected some of the gaps in the investigation and thereafter

filed the charge-sheet. In the cross-examination, he admits that

he has not recorded the statements of any witnesses and also

not seized any records. The accused has filed schedule form

Nos.1 to 10 and he verified the same. The wife of the accused

was income assessee and records are produced in that regard.

As per Ex.P.19, the site at Mysore was allotted by CITB in the

name of the wife of the accused. RTC extracts of the accused,

his father-in-law are also collected in this case. The father-in-law

of the accused has given the affidavit as per Ex.P.4. He also

admits that father-in-law of the accused has stated in the

affidavit that he has 67 acres of agricultural land in his name.

CITB has executed the sale deed in favour of the wife as per

Ex.P.26. He also admits that father-in-law of the accused has got

constructed the house in the name of the wife of the accused. He

also admits that in terms of Ex.P.27 there is a FD in the name of

his wife of the accused. The accused has not furnished the

particulars of assets acquired by him in the Annual Assets and

Karnataka State Constructions Corporation is an autonomous

body. They have their own set of service rules for employees.

of the accused. He also admits that the accused was getting

agricultural food grains income from agricultural crops. He also

<p id="p_140">
</p><p id="p_141">      62.   Having perused both oral and documentary evidence

available on record, this Court has to re-appreciate the material

available on record as to whether the accused has amassed the

wealth and not satisfactorily explained his known source of

income to acquire the said property. The case of the prosecution

is that in terms of the source report prior to conducting the raid,

the amassing of the wealth is 240%. After conducting the raid, it

was increased to 310%. In order to come to such a conclusion,

the prosecution relied upon the known source of income of

Rs.5,62,374/-. The case of the prosecution is that the total

assets is Rs.18,75,064/- and the expenditure is Rs.4,33,521/-.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                39</span>



In all it comes to Rs.23,08,582/- and after deducting the income

of the accused, according to the prosecution including the assets

and expenditure, an the amount of Rs.17,46,211.52/- is his total

extent of excess of assets and expenditure i.e., 310.50%.


</p><p id="p_142">     63.   The prosecution in order to bring home the guilt of

the accused, examined P.Ws.1 to 9 and also got marked the

documents. Admittedly, the accused has not led any evidence.

There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the accused had

joined the service in the year 1979 and also no dispute that raid

was conducted on 27.10.1995 and mahazar was drawn in terms

of Ex.P.1. The valuation in respect of the house is Ex.P.2. P.W.4

was present at the time of conducting the raid in respect of

rented house of AGO at Kuvempunagar, Mysore vide Ex.P.3.

P.W.5 speaks with regard to issuing of a cheque for Rs.65,000/-

to the AGO from GPA account of the accused. P.W.6 speaks with

regard to the salary details of the AGO. The prosecution mainly

relied upon the evidence of P.W.7, who conducted the major

investigation. P.Ws.8 and 9 are the other Investigating Officers

who took up the further investigation and P.W.8 admitted that

he has not done any investigation. P.W.9 filed the charge-sheet.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                 40</span>



</p><p id="p_143">      64.    Having perused both oral and documentary evidence

placed on record, this Court has to examine the first aspect of

the main contention of the accused that the Investigating

Officers    who    have   conducted    the   further   investigation,

A.N.Swami,        H.K.Ramesh   Kumar     and     N.V.Sakhri    have

authorization to conduct the investigation. It has to be noted

that the records reveals that the Investigating Officer one

B.B.Patil prepared the source report and obtained the permission

from the SP to conduct the raid. On perusal of the source report,

it discloses that an allegation was made that the accused has

amassed the wealth disproportionate to his income to an extent

of 240%. It is important to note that the prosecution mainly

relies upon the documents Exs.P.1 to 3 regarding conducting of

raid and seizure of the articles from the house of the accused.

The Investigating Officer, who obtained the permission from the

SP, conducted the raid and drawn the mahazar, has not been

examined before the Trial Court. The prosecution examined

P.Ws.7 to 9 as Investigating Officers. It is important to note that

the main contention of the learned counsel for the accused is

that except the Investigating Officer P.Ws.8 and 9, others were

not having authorization to conduct the investigation.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                41</span>



</p><p id="p_144">      65.   The learned counsel for the appellant/accused mainly

contend that Ex.P.24 clearly discloses that the Investigating

Officer A.N.Swami and Jayaraj were not having the authorization

to investigate the matter. Hence, P.W.8 was appointed to

investigate the same. The learned counsel also mainly brought

to my notice Ex.P.24 to support his contention. On perusal of

Ex.P.24, no doubt the name of A.N.Swami and Jayaraj are

found. But on reading of Ex.P.24, it is clear that in view of the

judgment of the Apex Court with regard to authorization, P.W.8

has been appointed to conduct the investigation. I do not find

any reference in Ex.P.24 in order to come to a conclusion that

A.N.Swami was not having any authorization. Though both the

names are referred, on perusal of Ex.P.24 it is specific that

Jayaraj was not having the authorization to conduct the

investigation. Hence, in terms of Ex.P.24, P.W.8 was appointed

as Investigating Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_145">
</p><p id="p_146">      66.   It is also pertinent to note that on 27.10.1995

B.B.Patil   was   authorized   to   conduct   the   investigation.

Consequent on his transfer, A.N.Swami took the charge of PI of

Lokayuktha to continue the investigation vide order dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                42</span>



05.06.1996. The Trial Judge also referred the same in paragraph

No.16 of the judgment with regard to appointing A.N.Swami to

investigate the matter. No doubt P.W.7 who has been examined,

in cross-examination he categorically admits that there is no

special authorization for him but documents dated 05.06.1996 is

clear that A.N.Swami was appointed and while appointing him, it

is specifically mentioned that he had completed 27 years of

service and also he is trained in investigation particularly

disproportionate of assets cases. He is an abled and experienced

officer and capable of conducting the investigation. Hence, the

very contention of the learned counsel for the accused that

A.N.Swami was also not authorized to conduct the investigation,

cannot be accepted. However, it is clear that Jayaraj was not

having any authorization to conduct the investigation. This Court

has to examine as to who has conducted the major investigation.

The records discloses that from 1996 to 1999 major portion of

investigation was conducted by A.N.Swami. Though P.W.8

Ramesh Kumar was appointed, in his evidence he categorically

admits that he has not done anything except taking up the

further investigation from A.N.Swami. It is also important to

note that subsequent to Ramesh Kumar, P.W.9 N.V.Sakhri was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                 43</span>



appointed vide Ex.P.25 dated 19.03.2004 and his experience is

also mentioned in the order. On perusal of his evidence before

the Court, it is clear that he only filed the charge-sheet by

verifying the records and nothing he has done anything about

the investigation. Hence, the major investigation is done by

B.B.Patil as well as A.N.Swami. Both B.B.Patil and A.N.Swami

were authorized to conduct the further investigation. Hence, the

very contention of the learned counsel for the accused that

A.N.Swami was also not authorized to hold the investigation,

cannot be accepted. No doubt in the cross-examination of P.W.7,

A.N.Swami has admitted that there was no special authorization.

That does not mean that he was not having any authorization.

The documentary evidence prevails over the oral evidence. The

order dated 05.06.1996 is clear with regard to appointing

A.N.Swami    as   the   Investigating   Officer.   Hence,   the   first

contention that persons who have conducted the investigation

were not having authorization, cannot be accepted.


</p><p id="p_147">     67.    The second contention of the learned counsel for the

accused is that the accused was not in need of filing the Assets

and Liabilities Statement. The learned counsel in order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                  44</span>



substantiate his contention, brought to my notice the source

report and drawn the attention of this Court to page No.4 of the

source    report.    Having   perused    the    source    report,      the

Investigating Officer B.B.Patil himself has stated that the

accused has not filed any Assets and Liabilities Statement. On

perusal of the source report at page No.4, it is categorically

mentioned that on enquiries at Karnataka State Constructions

Corporation revealed that the employees are not submitting the

annual property returns and they have brought a stay in Labour

Court for submitting the annual property returns. Thus, he has

not    intimated    the   Department    the    purchase   of   sites    in

Kanakapura Town and purchase of site and construction of the

house in Mysore city. It is further mentioned that on ascertaining

from     General    Manager    and    Company     Secretary     of     the

Corporation that there is a provision in the Company to avail

subsidy of 4% of interest for the house building loan taken by an

employee from any recognized institution. Mahadevaiah has not

availed such facility, which indicate that he has not taken any

loan to construct the house.
</p>
<p id="p_148">
</p><p id="p_149">       68.   Having perused the source report, it is clear that the

accused has not filed any Assets and Liabilities Statement. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                 45</span>



also categorically mentioned that stay was granted. The accused

also relied upon Ex.D.1 dated 17.11.1993 with regard to a

direction given by the Assistant Labour Officer to the Managing

Director of the Corporation not to insist for filing of the Assets

and Liabilities Statement till the final decision is taken. This

order    has    been   challenged    before   the   High   Court   in

W.P.No.1736/1994 and the documents is marked as Ex.C1,

when the Court itself put the Court question to the witness. On

perusal of the order passed by this Court, it is clear that this

Court has observed that Annexure-E is in the nature of interim

order during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings and

also is advisory in nature. Hence, the writ petition was

dismissed. Hence, it is clear that consequent upon the issuance

of the notification by the Department, the employees have

approached the Labour Commissioner and there was an interim

order of stay and the same is confirmed by the High Court.


</p><p id="p_150">        69.    The Trial Judge while considering this aspect has

made an observation in paragraph No.25 of the judgment

coming to the conclusion that as per the Government notification

dated 29.10.1981 all the government servants are required to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                 46</span>



file their Annual Assets and Liabilities Statement. The Trial Judge

also considered the notification dated 20.08.1993 issued by the

Karnataka State Constructions Corporation for filing the Assets

and Liabilities Statement. The Trial Judge also discussed with

regard to the defence taken by the accused and stay granted by

the Assistant Labour Officer and also confirming the order of the

Assistant Labour Commissioner by the High Court. The Trial

Judge comes to a conclusion that the accused is not a workman

within the purview of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_16">Section 2</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act and

therefore it is difficult for the accused to take shelter under this

order. The Trial Judge also observed that on the basis of the

interpretation, the Investigating Officer has not computed the

income which have been received from the sources made known

to the higher ups. Hence, comes to the conclusion that income

which were not disclosed to the Department while filing the

Assets and Liabilities Statement have not been considered to be

the known source of income of the accused. The very conclusion

of the Trial Judge that he is not a workman within the purview of

<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_17">Section 2</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act is nothing but erroneous

finding of the Trial Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                 47</span><p id="p_151">



</p><p id="p_152">      70.    It is not the case of the prosecution that the accused

cannot take such a defence and the accused has not filed the

Assets and Liabilities Statement. It has to be noted that none of

the employees of the Corporation are filing Assets and Liabilities

Statements. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the

State that he is not a workman. If that is the case, why the

Corporation has not implemented the notification of the year

1981 and subsequent notification, which has been challenged

issued in 1993 were not given any effect to other than the

labourers. It is not the case of the prosecution that only the

accused has not filed Assets and Liabilities Statement. It is

elicited from the mouth of the witnesses that none of the

employees of the Corporation are filing the Assets and Liabilities

Statement.
</p>
<p id="p_153">
</p><p id="p_154">      71.    P.W.9, in the cross-examination categorically admits

that the Karnataka State Constructions Corporation is an

autonomous body. They have their own set of service rules for

employees. The very source report discloses that none of the

employees are filing the Assets and Liabilities Statement.

Subsequently, they have approached the Assistant Labour
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                 48</span>



Commissioner and the order was passed in terms of Ex.D1 and

the same was challenged before the High Court and the High

Court dismissed the writ petition. The Trial Judge has not

discussed anything about Exs.D.1 and C.1 and erroneously

comes to a conclusion that he is bound to file the Assets and

Liabilities Statement and he is not a workman within the purview

of Section 2 of the Industrial Dispute Act when there is a

categorical admission that it is an autonomous body and they

are having their own rules and regulations. It is important to

note that the witness also speaks before the Court that the

accused who has given the details of the sources made known to

him were not considered by the Investigating Officer and hence

the very approach of the Trial Judge is erroneous.


</p><p id="p_155">     72.   Now    coming   to   the   disproportionate   asset   is

concerned, the trial Judge had come to the conclusion that the

disproportionate asset is Rs.8,92,293.70 paise i.e., 74% in

excess of the known sources of income.      The trial Judge also

come to the conclusion that total source of the accused is

Rs.10,64,008.30 paise. On perusal of the table, the trial Judge

had taken the gross salary, rent from house No.1431, Mysuru,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                49</span>



rent from house No.41 at Tumakuru, dividend from shares,

proceeds of Scooter, withdrawal from GPF, LIC policy claim,

interest from SB account and interest on Fixed Deposits and also

the agricultural income.
</p>
<p id="p_156">
</p><p id="p_157">      73.   While calculating the assets     in coming to the

conclusion, the trial Judge had taken the acquisition of the

properties and also taking the house for mortgage, purchasing of

new Car, purchasing of two wheelers, Fixed Deposits, Gold and

Silver ornaments, amount invested in Indira Vikasa Patra, cash

recovered at the time of raid, valuation of the house at

Kuvempunagar, Mysuru and also the deduction made from the

salary of AGO.   Taking all these factors into consideration, the

trial Judge has arrived an amount of Rs.16,48,118/- as assets.


</p><p id="p_158">      74.   Now I would like to take up the material with regard

to the assets and also the sources of income.         The main

contention of the accused counsel is that while mortgaging a

house at Tumakuru paid an amount of Rs.70,000/-. Out of that,

he claims the same has to be taken only Rs.40,000/- and not as

Rs.70,000/- as the accused has re-let out the premises when the

owner did not repay the amount and he has received the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                   50</span>



advance amount of Rs.30,000/-. Hence, there is a force in the

contention of the accused counsel and the accused counsel also

relied upon the document letting out the mortgage premise to

the tenant, the same is evident on record. Hence, the same has

to be taken as Rs.40,000/- and receipt of Rs.30,000/- has to be

taken note of.
</p>
<p id="p_159">
</p><p id="p_160">       75.   The other contention of the accused counsel is that

the gold and silver ornaments. The trial Judge has considered an

amount of Rs.1 lakh asset was taken for purchase of gold

ornaments. It has to be noted that the trial Judge while

considering the aspect of gold ornaments, which are assessed at

Rs.2,69,793/- at the best an amount of Rs.1,69,793/- could be

considered as the value of gold jewels and the silver articles

possessed by the wife and while arriving the same discussed

with   regard    to   the   customs    prevailing   in   practice   while

celebrating the marriage giving of gold ornaments.            However,

the trial Judge has taken Rs.1 lakh will have to be considered as

acquisition by the accused during the check period and this has

to be considered as asset of the AGO.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                51</span><p id="p_161">



</p><p id="p_162">     76.   On perusal of the averments made in paragraph

No.49 discussed in length that, Exs.P16 and 17 are the

statements given by the accused in respect of gold ornaments

and claimed that the said gold ornaments are received at the

time of marriage and subsequently at the time of birthday

celebration of son and daughter. Though the trial Judge has

discussed in paragraph Nos.49 to 52 on hypothetical basis come

to a conclusion that the gold worth of Rs.1,69,793/- belongs to

the wife and Rs.1 lakh as asset. In order to come to such a

conclusion, there is no discussion except the hypothesis.


</p><p id="p_163">     77.   On perusal of the gold ornaments seized, it was to

the extent of 150 grams. It is also important to note that the

witness - P.W.4, who was present at the time of preparing the

Mahazar-Ex.P3, in her evidence, she claims that when she

accompanied the police and house of the accused was searched,

they found some of the items.       In the cross-examination, she

categorically admits that the police have given dictation for

writing the Mahazar. The valuation given to the items is

estimated by the Police. Hence, it is clear that there was no

person having skill to appraise the value of the gold ornaments
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                52</span>



was present.   P.W.4 categorically admits that the wife of the

accused said that the gold ornaments belong to her as they were

given at the time of her marriage. When such an admission is

elicited from the mouth of P.W.4 and when the wife has claimed

that those gold ornaments received at the time of marriage, the

very conclusion of the trial Judge was that an amount of Rs.1

lakh was considered as asset of the AGO, cannot be accepted.

The observations of the trial Judge is that it is not uncommon

amongst rich people to give presents in the form of gold

ornaments and silver articles to their daughters at the time of

their marriage. Further, the trial Judge was observed that one

cannot believe that such huge presentation was given at the

time of marriage worth of Rs.1 lakh during the year 1982. This

is also an imagination and nothing on record and furthermore,

the weight of gold articles is 150 grams worth and in normal

marriage giving of 150 grams of gold cannot be contended that

it is on higher side and without any basis, the trial Judge has

assessed Rs.1 lakh as asset of the accused investing the amount

for gold without any material. The fact is that the father-in-law

was having 67 acres of land is also not in dispute. Hence, an

amount of Rs.1 lakh which was taken in respect of the gold
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                 53</span>



jewels as asset of the accused is illogical and in order to break

up, the amount has taken as Rs.1,69,793/- as the presentation

of the gold articles and taking of Rs.1 lakh as asset of the

accused is also not on any basis.
</p>
<p id="p_164">
</p><p id="p_165">      78.   The other contention of the accused is that the trial

Judge has taken the valuation of the house at Kuvempunagar,

Mysuru for an amount of Rs.5,88,037/-. It has to be noted that

this property is standing in the name of his wife. It is the claim

of the accused that her father-in-law only had purchased the site

and constructed the house on their own supervision. The

accused also claimed the same and placed some of the bills with

regard to purchasing of the material for construction of the

house by the father-in-law and his son and some receipts does

not bears anybody's name.

<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">      79.   Learned counsel for the accused would vehemently

contend that Ex.P4 was found in the house of the accused at the

time of conducting the raid and the said affidavit was filed before

the Income Tax Officer when the Income Tax Returns was filed

by the wife of the accused. Here there is no dispute with regard

to the fact that the wife is also an Income Tax Assessee and in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                  54</span>



statements while answering Schedule 1 to 10, the same is

claimed. It is also important to note that the said affidavit-Ex.P4

was found at the time of conducting the raid itself. No doubt,

the Court cannot accept such nature of the affidavit and the

officers, who are indulged in corrupt practice keeps such

affidavits, if it is recognized. But in the case on hand, it is the

specific case, the said affidavit was filed before the Income Tax

Officer   and   the   document   was   came   into   existence   on

21.06.1995 and the raid was conducted on 28.10.1995. The

document was in existence prior to the raid. When the accused

wife claimed that the same was filed before the Income Tax

Officer and when the document Ex.P18-copy of the assessment

filed by the wife showing her gross income as Rs.39,600/- being

the rent received from the house at Rs.3,300/- per month when

the accused wife also placed the Income Tax Returns for the

year 1994-95. The Investigating officer ought to have enquired

with regard to whether such an affidavit is filed or not before the

Income Tax Officer. No such attempt has been made by the

Investigating Officer instead discarded the statement given by

the accused in toto only on the ground that the assets and

liabilities are not declared.

</p><p id="p_169">        80.   P.W.9 in the cross-examination categorically admits

that, the wife of the accused was an Income Tax Assessee and

records are produced in that regard. He further admits that as

per Ex.P19, the site at Mysuru was allowed by CITB in the name

of the wife of the accused. In order to substantiate the claim of

the accused that the father-in-law of the accused was rich, he

admits that the RTC extracts of the father-in-law are also

collected in this case. P.W.9 also admits that the father-in-law

of the accused has given the affidavit as per Ex.P4. The father-

in-law of the accused has stated in the affidavit that, he has 67

acres of agricultural land in his name.      CITB has executed the

Sale Deed in favour of the wife as per Ex.P26. He further admits

that the father-in-law of the accused has got constructed the

house in the name of the wife of the accused. When P.W.9, who

filed   the   charge   sheet   after   verifying   the   material,   he

categorically admits that father-in-law of the accused has got

constructed the house in the name of the wife of the accused.

The very contention of the prosecution is that the same is also

the assets of the accused and the trial Judge instead of this

admission was given by P.W.9 coming to the conclusion that the

same could be the assets of the accused is nothing but perverse.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                  56</span>



The Trial Judge did not consider the admission of P.W.9 with

regard to the construction of the house by father-in-law.          The

material Ex.P26 discloses that the site was allotted and the sale

deed was executed in favour of the wife. It is the claim of the

accused that the father-in-law only obtained the site in favour of

his wife and constructed the house and when there is a

categorical admission by the Investigating Officer, who filed the

charge   sheet   that   the   father-in-law   of   the   accused   has

constructed the house, the trial Judge ought not to have come to

the conclusion that the said property is the assets of the

accused. It is also important to note that P.W.3, who is the

Executive Engineer, PWD, in his cross-examination also, he

categorically admits that at the time of inspection he was

informed that the building belongs to the wife of the accused and

he does not know who has supervised the construction of the

building. When the claim was made by the accused throughout

that it was the house of the wife and the wife also declared the

same and filing the Income Tax Returns, the trial judge ought

not to have come to such a conclusion. The finding of the trial

Court is against the material available on record, particularly, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                57</span>



evidence available before the Court and the admission has not

been culled out in the Judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171">     81.   The other evidence of the accused is that the Fixed

Deposits kept in the Bank to the tune of Rs.4,15,614/- is

erroneous. The accused has claimed an amount of Rs.2,35,550/-

only the Fixed Deposits belongs to him. He claims that he kept

the amount of Rs.1 lakh in the name of his sister Gowramma

and immediately after the raid though the said Fixed Deposit

was maturable in the year 1997, his sister become panic and

insisted to withdraw the said amount and accordingly he has

withdrawn the amount and handed over the same to his sister-

Gowramma. In this regard, the document is also placed for

acknowledging the amount by his sister Gowramma.


</p><p id="p_172">     82.   It is also the evidence of the accused that the

brother-in-law of the accused was a Head Master of Shivanalli at

Kanakapura   Taluk,   who    expired   in   February   1995.   After

retirement, his retirement benefits were received during August

1994 and his sister is an illiterate and she has approached him

to keep the amount in Fixed Deposit.        Hence, the said amount

was kept in Fixed Deposit.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                  58</span><p id="p_173">



</p><p id="p_174">      83.   The trial judge while considering this material come

to a conclusion that no material is placed to that effect by the

accused to probabilise the same. It is also rightly pointed out by

the Trial Court that the said Gowramma has not been examined

before the Court. The theory put-forth by the accused has to be

substantiated either by placing any documentary proof or ought

to have been examined his sister and the same was not done.

He would have kept the amount in Fixed Deposit in the name of

his sister only and there is no explanation to that effect. Hence, I

do not find any error committed by the trial Judge in coming to

such a conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_175">
</p><p id="p_176">      84.   However,    taking   into   note   of   the   amount   of

Rs.30,000/- on the head of mortgage, which he has received

after letting out the premises, the trial Judge ought to have

taken the income of the accused as Rs.30,000/- and also taking

into note of gold and silver ornaments for an amount of Rs.1

lakh and also an amount of Rs.5,88,037/- as assets of the

accused in respect of the house. These are the amounts which

have to be added, it comes to Rs.7,18,037/-. If the said amount

is deducted from the assets of the accused and an amount of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                        59</span>



Rs.30,000/-      taken   as    his    receipt,   the   difference     is   only

Rs.1,74,256/-. The trial Judge also while calculating the amount

in Fixed Deposits, taken note of the interest part also and ought

to have taken keeping the amount in fixed Deposit, the principal

amount and not the interest and the interest is accrued on Fixed

Deposits. When such being the case, the difference amount is a

marginal one. The trial judge also taken the agricultural income

by deducting 1/3rd, it comes to Rs.2,02,675/- as agricultural

income. The witnesses, who have been examined before the

Trial Court i.e., the Investigating Officer-P.W.9, he categorically

admits that the accused comes essentially from an agricultural

family and he was getting agricultural food grains income from

agricultural crops. It was further elicited that it may be true to

say if there is a self production the domestic expenditure will be

less.
</p>
<p id="p_177">
</p><p id="p_178">        85.    P.W.7, who conducted the major investigation also

categorically     admits      in     the    cross-examination       that   the

statements collected by him from the accused are found to be

correct.      He further admits that his predecessor have received

the particulars in Annexures 1 to 10 with regard to known
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                     60</span>



sources of income of the accused. He categorically admits that

he has verified the statements filed by the accused. When he

admits that the statements collected by him are found to be

correct, the prosecution cannot find fault with the accused. The

very admission of P.W.7, takes away the case of the prosecution.

P.W.7, in one breadth says that only 80% of the investigation

was completed, so he cannot say the final opinion of filing the 'B'

report. He also admits that he had seen Ex.P4, which was the

affidavit filed by the father-in-law of the accused. He also admits

that the family of the accused was essentially an agricultural

family. Food grains were being grown in the land according to

the entries in the RTCs.      If the food grains are grown in the

house it is far less than if the person goes for purchase.         The

trial   Judge   ought   to   have   consider   this   admission   while

calculating the household expenses of the accused and also

ought to have taken note of the own cultivation, instead of

erroneously deducted 1/3rd towards the agricultural expenses.

The accused also placed the document before the Court that

immediately after the death of the father, who was managing

the property prior to 1983, an amount of Rs.18,450/- was

received from his brother in the year 1985. Thereafter, there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                     61</span>



was an arrangement between the brother and the accused every

year to pay an amount of Rs.25,000/- in respect of agricultural

income and the same is paid by way of Demand Draft.                   When

such being the case, the trial Judge ought to have considered

the agricultural income as claimed by the accused.                    In the

entirety,   taken   an    amount        of    Rs.2,02,675/-    instead    of

Rs.2,65,000/-. Hence, the very approach of the Trial Court is

against the admissions and also the records. It is also important

to note that in a case of disproportionate asset, the Court can

take note of margin of 10%, if any, if anything is on higher side,

if it is taken 10% of marginal assets, the trial judge ought not to

have come to a conclusion that the accused has amassed the

wealth to the tune of 74%. When these are all the amounts are

taken out from the assets, the finding of the Trial Court is

nothing but perverse and capricious and not considered the

material    available    on   record.        The   very   admission    given

particularly   by   PWs.7     and   9,       who   conducted   the    major

investigation and       their evidence is clear that the statement

furnished by the accused found to be correct and also P.W.9

categorically admits that the house, site and building was

constructed by the father-in-law and witnesses, who have been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                   62</span>



examined before the Trial Court also have given a categorical

admission and these are the admissions are not considered by

the Trial Court while appreciating the material available on

record.

<p id="p_179">

in State of Tamil Nadu's case (supra), the defense of the

accused cannot be accepted and the said judgment is not

applicable to the facts of the case on hand and the Apex Court

dealt   with    the   matter   while   considering   the   accused   in

entertaining the discharge application in the case on hand full-

fledged trial has been conducted and the finding was given.

H.N. Rishbud's case (supra), with regard to illegality in

investigation and if irregularity if it is curable, if any non-

compliance of the provisions will not take away the case. This

Judgment is also not applicable to the case on hand. This Court

is not coming to the conclusion that there was an irregularity. No

doubt, Jayaram, who conducted the investigation was not having

any authorization and no dispute with regard to the principles

laid down in the Judgment.

the case of <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_18">K. Veeraswami v. Union of India</a> and other

reported in (1991) 3 Supreme Court Cases 655, and referring

to this Judgment would contend that the Investigating Officer is

only required to collect material to find out whether the offence

alleged appears to have been committed. In the course of the

investigation, he may examine the accused. He may seek his

clarification and if necessary he may cross check with him about

his known sources of income and assets possessed by him. This

Judgment is also not applicable to the case on hand since P.W.7,

who conducted the investigation admits that 80% of the

investigation was completed. He categorically admits that the

statements given by the accused was found to be correct. When

such being the case, the Investigating Officer ought to have

been filed the final report that no material to proceed against the

accused and instead of that the charge sheet was filed by P.W.9.

P.W.9 also categorically admits that the major assets of the

accused i.e., house and building to the tune of Rs.5,88,037/-

was constructed by the father-in-law of the accused. He ought

to have proposed for filing the 'B' report as contended by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                   64</span>



accused and instead of that he filed the charge sheet. P.W.9 has

not done any investigation except filing the charge sheet.


</p><p id="p_184">      89.    Having   discussed    with      regard   to   the    material

available on record and also the defense available before the

Court, the accused has made out the probable case for

acquitting the accused and the very approach of the Trial Court

is erroneous and not considered the material available on record

in toto, particularly, the admission of PWs.7 and 9 regarding

amassing of wealth disproportionate to known sources of income

and   when    these   admissions       are   considered    with    proper

perspective, the trial Judge ought not to have convicted the

accused. Instead these are the admissions are not discussed in

the judgment of the Trial Court and instead of it appears carried

away with the case of the prosecution and erroneously come to

the conclusion that the accused has amassed the wealth to the

tune of 74%. It is important to note that while taking the

permission to conduct the raid, it is the case of the prosecution

that the disproportionate income is 240% and while filing the

charge sheet it was 310% and after the trial, the trial Judge

come to the conclusion that it was 74% and failed to take note
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                65</span>



of the admission in respect of the worth of gold and jewels and

also the value of the house property, which belongs to the

accused - wife and there is a categorical admission that father-

in-law had constructed the said house. When the categorical

admission available, the trial Judge ought not to have proceeded

to convict the accused. Hence, the Judgment of the trial Court is

perverse and not based on the material available on record and

also the admissions elicited from the mouth of the witnesses,

particularly, PWs.4, 7 and 9. The admission given by PWs.4, 7

and 9 takes away the case of prosecution and the same is fatal

to the case of the prosecution. When such being the case, the

Trial Judge ought not to have convicted the accused. Hence, it is

a fit case to reverse the findings of the Trial Court in coming to

the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove the case

against the accused.
