<p id="p_2">2.     The Prosecution story in a nutshell is that in the year 1977, the Indian
       Army requisitioned 2253 kanals and 12 marlas of land situate at Birpur,
       Tehsil Samba for defence purposes. An order in this regard was passed
       under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_4">Section 3(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1074294/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> of the Jammu and Kashmir Requisition
       and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1960. The aforesaid land
       was handed over to the Army Authorities on 31.07.1977 by the then



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008           Page 1 of 9</span>

       Naib-Tehsildar, Bari Brahmana. Out of the aforesaid land so
       requisitioned, 433 Kanals, 2 marlas was Government land whereas 1813
       kanals and 10 marlas was Class-III land and remainder calculated 7
       kanals of land was Class-II land and was also Government land. Out of
       the aforesaid land, 1600 kanals of land belonged to the Forest Department
       and rest of the land measuring 213 kanals and 10 marlas defined as Class-
       III land, 175 kanals was in the ownership of different persons and
       whereas 37 kanals 15 marlas was Shamlat land.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     In the year 1980, the army authorities decided to have the aforesaid chunk
       of land acquired for the use of the army on permanent basis and
       accordingly the competent authority under J&amp;K Requisition and
       Acquisition of Immovable Property Act initiated the acquisition
       proceeding. The Deputy Commissioner started the proceeding and
       recommended the government for acquiring the piece of land for Ministry
       of Defence, Government of India and the compensation was fixed in
       accordance with the norms. The Defence Estates Officer, Jammu who
       dealt with the requisition of the land for defense forces worked out the
       compensation on ad hoc basis at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per kanal for
       Class-II private land and Rs.5000/- per kanal for Class-II State land and
       Rs.25000/- for Class-III State land and Rs.7005/- as cost of the trees.
       Accordingly, the compensation was quantified at Rs.1,92,59,755/-. The
       Defence Estates Officer was subsequently advised to pay compensation
       for 1600 kanals of forest land used as Kacharai at par with private land
       whereafter he worked out the compensation of 1813 kanals and 10 marlas
       defined as Class-II land and also of private land. The Defence Estates
       Officer released Rs.1,54,07,804/- i.e. eighty per cent of the assessed
       amount of compensation and forwarded the same to the Deputy
       Commissioner, Jammu on 07.12.1990 along with bankers cheque issued
       by State Bank of India in favour of the Deputy Commissioner. The
       aforesaid cheque was received by accused No.1, Late Khazan Chand
       Rana, the then Additional Deputy Commissioner, Jammu on 07.12.1990
       itself. It is the case of the prosecution that Late Khazan Chand for ulterior
       motive retained the cheque and subsequently sent to J &amp; K Bank, Link
       Road, Jammu for crediting it in his account after getting the word
       additional inserted in the said cheque through accused No.9, Keshav
       Chandra, the then clerk in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Jammu
       and account was opened on 12.12.1990 with J&amp;K Bank Branch, Link



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008         Page 2 of 9</span>

       Road, Jammu for the reasons that he did not have any account in the State
       Bank of India as he was not required to deal with financial matters.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     It was stated in the charge sheet that Late Khazan Chand has no
       competence to open a separate account in the bank because opening of
       the account for Government transactions requires approval of the
       government. Therefore, account was opened in violation. Thereafter the
       cheque was deposited on 07.12.1990 and was credited in account on
       12.12.1990.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     In the year 1976, J&amp;K Agrarian Reforms Act came into force and entry of
       the year Kharif 1971 as effected in the revenue record with regard to the
       possession was considered as correct. However, before law was made
       applicable to the revenue records for the year Rabi 1976 were complete
       and Kharif 1976 were to be prepared and by that time the army had taken
       over the land and were in physical possession thereof although on papers,
       the requisitioning of the said land became operative from 13.07.1977 and
       first attempt to interpolate the records were made in the register when in
       1976 Khasra entries were to be made in the concerned records to show
       possession of accused No.11 and 12 namely Rachpal Singh and Ravail
       Singh with regard to Khasra No.1035. In the register of Khasra Girdwari
       for the year 1976 between first and second column, an entry in respect of
       81 kanals and 4 marlas of land in favour of Ravail Singh and Rachpal
       Singh, co-sharers has been made which is in different ink and in different
       hand and after manipulation of these entries in Khasra Girdwari register
       for the year Kharif 1976 to Rabi 1981, this position continued in the
       revenue record up to Rabi 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     As per the aforesaid entry, land to the tune of 81 kanals and 4 marlas was
       reflected in the name of accused Nos. 11 and 12, Rachpal Singh and
       Ravail Singh but contrary to this, the same land has been shown under the
       occupation of Army in Form J and khasra wise statement dated
       21.12.1988 prepared by accused No.4, Uttam Chand Dingra, the then
       Settlement Tehsildar, Jammu and in the Acquisition Rolls. The accused
       nos. 11 and 12 filed a suit in respect of the land, which in fact belong to
       the Forest Department, before the Deputy Commissioner under Section
       32 of the J &amp; K Land Revenue Act, which was transferred to the
       appellant. The appellant who was vested the powers of the Collector
       under the Act, thereupon, after spot inspection and after recording the
       statement of the witnesses passed an order by which it was held that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008        Page 3 of 9</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           4</span>




       accused nos.11 and 12, namely, Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh, are the
       owners of the land in question. Admittedly, the aforesaid order was
       upheld in appeal by the appellate authority under the Act. The police filed
       charge sheet inter alia against amongst other accused, the appellant who
       at the relevant time was posted at Assistant Commissioner and was vested
       with the powers of Collector under the provisions of the J &amp; K Land
       Revenue Act. The police after completion of the investigation filed the
       charge sheet against the appellant and other co-accused for the offence as
       aforesaid. The trial Court vide impugned judgment has convicted the
       appellant as aforesaid and imposed the sentence as well as fine which has
       been stated supra.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial court
       ought to have appreciated that the appellant in his capacity as a quasi
       judicial authority was exercising quasi judicial powers under the
       provisions of J&amp;K Land Revenue Act and the appeal which was filed
       against the order which was passed by the appellant was dismissed by the
       appellate authority and the order passed by appellant was upheld. It is
       further submitted that the appellant had visited the spot and had recorded
       the statement of five witnesses. Even assuming the fact that the order
       passed by the appellant was without jurisdiction, its validity could have
       been examined only by the authority under the Act. It is submitted that
       issue whether or not the appellant had jurisdiction to pass the impugned
       order could not be examined by the trial Court especially in the absence
       of any allegation that the appellant had passed the impugned order in
       favour of the accused Nos. 11 and 12 for any extraneous consideration,
       that is, by accepting bribe. Learned Senior Counsel has also invited the
       attention of this Court to Section 77 of the RPC which deals with
       protection afforded to a judge and the expression judge which is defined
       under <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_6">Section 19</a> of the Penal Code defines a Judge as a person who
       decides a case which attains finality unless an appeal is filed and unless it
       is set aside in an appeal. It is further submitted that in view of the
       provisions of the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_7">Judicial Officers Protection Act</a>, 1971, even a civil suit
       cannot be filed against the appellant. Lastly, it is urged that the trial court
       has acquitted accused No.3 who was the Assistant Settlement Officer and
       who had submitted the report that the accused Nos. 11 and 12 are in
       possession of the land in question. However, the trial Court in respect of
       accused No.3 has held that accused No.3 was doing his official duty and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008          Page 4 of 9</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                          5</span>




       no loss has been caused to the public exchequer. Therefore, in any case,
       the appellant was entitled to parity with accused No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     On the other hand, learned Dy. AG has submitted that the appellant had
       initiated the proceeding under the Land Revenue Act even though he was
       transferred and had no power to initiate the proceeding under the Act and
       to adjudicate the rights of the accused Nos. 11 and 12 which vested with
       Assistant Commissioner, Revenue Jammu. It is further submitted that the
       appellant had exercised the power in hot haste and had thrown the
       procedure prescribed in law to winds. It is further submitted that under
       the provisions of Big Landed Estates Abolition Act, 1950, the appellant
       had no power to initiate the proceeding. However, it is submitted that the
       trial Court also committed an error in acquitting the accused No.3 on the
       ground that no loss was caused to the public exchequer and the
       respondent No.3 was dealing with a separate piece of land. Lastly, it is
       urged that the area in question was under settlement and the appellant had
       no jurisdiction to deal with the land in question.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the
       parties and have scanned the record carefully. The Trial Court in the
       impugned judgment has dealt with the case of the appellant from internal
       page 192 onwards and has held that the appellant with a view to transfer
       the ownership and possession of the land admeasuring 1500 kanals in
       favour of the accused namely Rachpal Singh and Rabail Singh has acted
       in conspiracy with the other co-accused persons and the action is
       motivated obviously by act of such magnitude that it sent shivers down
       the spine of everyone. It has been further held that the appellant had acted
       in hot haste and has by-passed all the procedure. It has also been held that
       he had no jurisdiction to pass the impugned order under Section 32 of the
       Land Revenue Act. It has also been held that the impugned judgment has
       been passed with a view to confer undue benefit to accused Nos. 11 and
</p><p id="p_10">       12. It has also been held that merely because the appellate court has been
       remiss, callous or indifferent in deciding the appeal, it would not mean
       that the appellant under the garb of the order passed by the appellate
       authority which is without jurisdiction and wherein the procedure for trial
       and suit has not been followed and which has caused huge loss to the
       state exchequer can ever be justified. It has been further held that
       proceeding has been concluded by the appellant within a period of eleven




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008         Page 5 of 9</span>

       days from the date of its institution and from the statement of the
       Division Forest Officer, it is evident that he was not summoned.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.    At this stage, before proceeding further, we deem it appropriate to take
       note of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_8">Section 19</a> as well as Section 77 of the Ranbir Penal Code,
       Svt.1989 which reads as:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   "19. Judge.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   The word "Judge" denotes not only every person who is
                   officially designated as a Judge, but also every person
                   who is empowered by law to give, in any legal
                   proceeding, civil or criminal, a definitive judgment, or a
                   judgment which, if not appealed against, would be
                   definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed by some
                   other authority, would be definitive, or who is one of a
                   body of persons, which body of persons is empowered by
                   law to give such a judgment."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   "77.        Act of Judge when acting judicially

                   Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when
                   acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or
                   which is good faith he believes to be, given to him by
                   law."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">11.    From a perusal of <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_9">Section 19</a> of the Code, it is evident that the definition
       of the expression judge is an inclusive definition and would include
       within its ambit even a person who is not officially designated as a Judge
       but also a person who is empowered by law to give any legal proceeding
       civil or criminal in definite judgment which if not appealed against would
       be definitive or a judgment which if confirmed by the same other
       authority would be definitive. <a href="/doc/306489/" id="a_10">Section 77</a> of the Code provides that
       nothing is an offence which is done by a judge when acting judicially in
       the exercise of any power which is or which is good faith he believes to
       be given by law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.    In the backdrop of the aforesaid legal provisions, facts of the case may be
       seen. In the instant case, admittedly, there is no allegation against the
       appellant that he had passed the order for any extraneous consideration,
       that is, by accepting the bribe. The only allegation which is levelled by
       the prosecution against the appellant is that he had no jurisdiction to pass


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008            Page 6 of 9</span>

       the impugned order and in a hot haste, the appellant concluded the
       proceeding. From perusal of the record, we find that appellant had
       directed Naib Tehsildar, Bari Brahmana to submit the report who after
       recording the statement of seven witnesses had submitted a report that
       accused persons namely Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh were in
       possession. Thereafter the appellant visited the spot on 27.10.1990 and
       found the accused persons namely Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh to be
       in possession of the land in question. The appellant had also taken into
       account the report prepared by Mohan Lal, the Settlement Officer who
       has been acquitted by the Trial Court. It is also pertinent to mention here
       that the order passed by the appellant in exercise of quasi judicial powers
       under the J&amp;K Land Revenue Act which was upheld by the appellate
       authority and the validity of the order passed by the appellant as well as
       by the appellate authority under the Act could not have been examined by
       the Trial Court. The appellant, in our considered opinion, is entitled to
       benefit of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_11">Section 19</a> as well as Section 77 of the RPC. The Supreme
       Court in the case of <a href="/doc/650916/" id="a_12">P C Joshi v. State of U.P. and others</a>, AIR 2001 SC
       2788 while referring to the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1164504/" id="a_13">Ishwar Chand Jain
       vs. High</a> Court of Punjab and Haryana, AIR 1988 SC 1395 has held
       that the Judicial Officers are under constant threat of complaints and
       enquiries on trivial matters and the action should be taken to protect the
       honest judicial officers by ignoring ill-conceived or motivated
       complaints. Besides that, Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of
       <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_14">State of M.P. v. Rajeev Jain</a>, 2002 (1) Crimes 113 M.P. (HC) has held
       that if Collector passed an illegal order which is grossly mistaken, while
       acting as a judicial or quasi judicial authority, it cannot always form the
       basis for initiating criminal proceeding. In the case of P. Sujanpal v.
       State of Kerala and Ors., the Division Bench of Kerala High Court has
       held that the judge may become liable to be proceeded against if he
       misuses his judicial power for personal gains or where erroneous use of
       judicial power is shown to be dishonest or mala fide except for these
       exceptional circumstances, a judicial officer is protected from legal action
       of whatever nature for wrong order rendered by him. Thus, when a
       judicial officer is acting judicially, even if he commits an error and passes
       an erroneous order, he would be protected from legal action. In the instant
       case, as stated supra, there is no allegation against the appellant that he
       passed the order for any extraneous consideration, that is, by accepting
       bribe. The order has been passed by the appellant in exercise of quasi



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Cr.Appeal No.5-A/2004, MP No.20/2008         Page 7 of 9</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                          8</span>




       judicial powers under the provisions of J &amp;K Land Revenue Act which
       has been upheld even by the appellate authority. However, the aforesaid
       aspect of the matter has neither been appreciated nor taken into account
       by the trial Court while convicting the appellant in respect of the offences
       aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.    <a href="/doc/66139260/" id="a_15">In Balya V. State of M.P</a>., (2012) 9 SCC 696, It has been held by the
       Supreme Court that common intention and conspiracy are matters of
       inference and if while drawing an inference, any benefit of doubt creeps
       in, it must go to the accused. Similar view was taken in the case of Raju
       alias <a href="/doc/75243301/" id="a_16">Devendra Choubey v. State of Chhatisgarh</a>, (20014) 9 SCC 299.
       It is equally well settled in law that in absence of evidence of any
       conspiracy or common object being established, the accused are liable for
       their individual acts only. (See. Vijay Pandurang Thakre and others. v.
       State of Maharashtra, (2017) 4 SCC 377). In the instant case, the Trial
       Court has stated that the appellant entered into criminal conspiracy with
       the accused namely Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh and passed an order
       setting aside the mutation in favour of the land which had escheated in
       favour of the State Government. It was further held that the order was
       passed in hot haste within a period of eleven days.

       which was prepared by accused Uttam Chand Dingra in which the land
       admeasuring 81 kanals and 4 marlas was shown to be in possession of
       accused Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh has been acquitted by the Trial
       Court. It is also pertinent to mention here that appellant while passing the
       order had also taken into account the report submitted by Naib Tehsildar
       Bari Brahmana who prepared the report after recording statement of
       seven witnesses. Thereafter, the appellant visited the spot on 27.10.1990
       and found the accused persons namely Rashpal Singh and Ravail Singh to
       be in possession of the land. It is also pertinent to note that proceedings
       were concluded by the appellant before his transfer. The appellant was
       transferred vide order dated 31.10.1990 and he had pronounced the
       judgment on 01.11.1990. There is no material on record especially in

       erred in convicting the appellant in respect of an offence under Section
       120-B of the RPC.

<p id="p_16">15.    In view of preceding analysis, we are inclined to quash and set aside the
       judgment dated 31.01.2004, in so far as it pertains to the appellant. In the
       result, the appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed.
