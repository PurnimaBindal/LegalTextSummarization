<p id="p_1">1.     The    plaintiff   has   filed   the   suit   for   permanent   injunction
restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, damage, delivery
up against four defendants, namely, Deepak Mangal, Sandeep Verma,
M/s Prius Auto Industries, and M/s Prius Auto Accessories Pvt. Ltd. in
order to protect the plaintiff's well-known trademark TOYOTA, the
Toyota Device mark, TOYOTA INNOVA and for passing off of the mark
PRIUS used by the aforesaid defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The plaintiff is a corporation duly organised and existing under
the laws of Japan having its registered office at 1, Toyota-Cho, Toyota-
Shi, Aichi-Ken, Japan. It is claimed that the plaintiff is the 10th largest
industrial corporation in the world dealing in the manufacture and sale
of automobiles and parts thereof according to the Fortune magazine



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                Page 1 of 121</span>
 dated July 2009 titled "Fortune Global 500" which was established in
1937 and developed its business around the world by marketing its
products in different countries including in India under the trademark
TOYOTA.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     It is mentioned in the plaint that the plaintiff had revenues of
over US $220 billion and its products are widely marketed in India as
also in over 80 other countries throughout the world. There is an
enviable range of vehicles in the TOYOTA stable including models like
the COROLLA, CAMRY, INNOVA, ALTIS, FORTUNER, LAND CRUISER
PRADO, etc. in India. International car models of the plaintiff like the
PRIUS, YARIS, HIGHLANDER, MATRIX, AVALON and VENZA sold in
overseas markets are also very well known among the relevant class
of consumers and the trade in India. The trademark TOYOTA was first
used in India in the year 1957 in relation to vehicles, parts and
fittings. It has acquired an enviable reputation and goodwill in India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     It is averred in the plaint that in the late 1994, the plaintiff's
team designed a concept car with a hybrid engine for the 1995 Tokyo
Motor Show. The vehicle was named "PRIUS" derived from the Latin
word meaning 'prior' or 'before'. The first PRIUS, model NHW10, went
on sale in December 1997 in Japan. It was later imported privately to
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. In the year 2000
PRIUS was marketed in United States followed by sales in Europe the
same year. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) classified the
car as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. The official launch of the
PRIUS in Australia occurred in 2001 after the Sydney Motor Show.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     It is also claimed that the mark PRIUS being a well-known
trademark of one of the most reputed and trusted names in the
automobile sector is entitled to protection across classes of goods as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                          Page 2 of 121</span>
 any misuse of the same is not only likely to cause confusion and
deception, but also be contrary to the interest of public and trade and
to their belief in the reputation of their chosen brand. Additionally, the
use of such a well-known trademark as PRIUS in any other relation to
goods by a third party would dilute the distinctiveness of the
trademark and tarnish the reputation and goodwill that has been so
diligently created and maintained by the plaintiff over the past many
years.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     With regard to cause of action for filing the present suit, it is
alleged by the plaintiff that in the month of October 2009, the plaintiff
was made aware of citations of the defendants' marks on the
trademark register in the results of a trademark search for its mark
PRIUS. On further inquiry the plaintiff learnt that defendant No.1 and
defendant No.2 were trading in the name and style of "M/s Prius Auto
Industries", defendant No.3, and had wrongly obtained registrations
for the mark "PRIUS" under Nos.1163594 and 1086682 in Class 12 for
"all types of auto parts and accessories. There is also a pending
application bearing No.1160353 in the name of defendant No.3 in
Class 12 for the mark PRIUS. Extracts from the Trademark journals
have been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       Upon learning about registrations for the trademark PRIUS, the
plaintiff   filed     rectification   petitions   to   seek   cancellation   of    the
impugned marks registered under Nos.1163594 and 1086682 in Class
12 before the Trademark Registry, New Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     The plaintiff states that from the product brochure and the
impugned product of the defendants they are using the plaintiff's
registered TOYOTA trademarks as set out in paragraph 5 of the plaint
as well as the unregistered but well known trademark PRIUS. Such use


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                    Page 3 of 121</span>
 by the defendants is without authorization, license or permission of
any manner and amounts to infringement of the registered trademarks
of the plaintiff and passing off of the well known trademark PRIUS.
The defendants are using marks in the course of trade, not being by
way of permitted use, that are identical to the plaintiff's reputed and
registered trademarks TOYOTA, the Toyota Device, INNOVA and PRIUS
in relation to sub-standard goods which are identical in description to
those of the plaintiff's manufacture and without due cause taking
unfair advantage of and in a manner detrimental to the distinctive
character and repute of the registered trademark. The trademark
PRIUS is additionally being used in the trading name and style of
defendants No.3 and 4.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.     The defendants are using the mark "PRIUS" as an essential and
leading portion of their trading name and the same appears on its
products as well. Such use of the mark PRIUS by the defendants is
unauthorized and unlawful and amounts to passing off and dilution of
plaintiff's trademark PRIUS which was adopted by the plaintiff in the
year 1990 which is evident from the date of filing of applications as
stated in para 9 of the plaint and the same has been in continuous use
since 1995 internationally.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.     It is alleged that by using the trademark PRIUS in relation to
auto spare parts, the defendants are guilty of duping innocent
consumers and by claiming that these products are meant for use in
TOYOTA        automobiles,    the   defendants   are   making     serious
misrepresentations as to the quality and provenance of their products.
Such unauthorized use by the defendants of the plaintiff's well-known
trademarks in respect of automobile parts and accessories would also
debase the reputation of the plaintiff's trademarks. Apart from passing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                        Page 4 of 121</span>
 off their goods and business under the trademark PRIUS of the
plaintiff, the defendants are adversely affecting the plaintiff's goodwill
by diluting its well-known trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.     The defendants have adopted the trademark/name PRIUS in
relation to their products with the sole intention of enjoying the
benefits that flow from the tremendous reputation and goodwill that
exists in favour of the plaintiff's identical trademark. The defendants
are obviously well aware of the tremendous international reputation
and goodwill acquired by the plaintiff in the trademark PRIUS and have
no apparent justification for adopting the said mark, having adopted
the same solely with a view to trade upon the vast repute of the
plaintiff's trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        The unauthorised and unlawful trade activities of the defendants
are bound to cause incalculable harm and injury to the business,
goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is likely to suffer
dilution and debasement of the goodwill, reputation and positive
associations linked to the plaintiff's trademarks occasioned by the loss
of distinctiveness, uniqueness and exclusivity attached thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.     Two separate written statements on behalf of defendant Nos.1 to
3 and defendant No.4 have been filed. The main defences which are
raised by the defendants are mentioned below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (i)   The suit of the plaintiff is barred by delay, barred by the
            principle       of   estoppel,   waiver     and   acquiescence.        The
            defendants have been in the business of manufacturing all
            types of auto accessories under the name and style of 'M/s
            PRIUS AUTO INDUSTRIES' since April 2001 and they have
            got       the   trademark    'PRIUS'      registered   by   registration



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                     Page 5 of 121</span>
            certification No.1086682 dated 13th March, 2002 and 'PRIUS
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           -    the    name         you      can    Trust'    registration   certification
           No.1163594 dated 2nd January, 2003. The defendants have
           obtained the trademark registration under class 12 for auto
           parts and accessories under the trademark PRIUS, and they
           have       been     manufacturing            and     dealing   only   in     auto
           accessories. The plaintiff despite being aware of the business
           activities of the defendants since 2001 and the registration of
           the trademark 'PRIUS' in the name of the defendants since
           2002, never raised any objection about the user of the said
           trademark PRIUS by the defendants for auto accessories. The
           plaintiff    did     not        file   any    objection/opposition      to    the
           registration of the said trademark in the name of the
           defendants.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    (ii)   The plaintiff is also guilty of misleading this Court by stating
           that the defendants are using the trademark TOYOTA,
           TOYOTA Device and INNOVA. In fact, the defendants have
           never used the trademark/trade name TOYOTA, TOYOTA
           Device and INNOVA either in past, or the defendants have
           any such intention to use the same in future. The plaintiff has
           concealed that the defendants are in the business of making
           car accessories. The mark 'Toyota' or 'Toyota Corolla' or
           Toyota INNOVA' are used by the defendants not as a
           trademark          but     to      describe    the     defendants'    bonafide
           description of the character or quality of the defendants'
           goods.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">   (iii)   The defendant No.3 is a partnership firm with defendants
           No.1 and 2 as its partners. The answering defendants have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                          Page 6 of 121</span>
            been using the said trademark PRIUS since 2001 for
           manufacturing and marketing item used for decorating cars.
           Thus, the defendants after doing research found one word in
           the dictionary 'PRIUS', meaning 'to come first'.
</p>
<p id="p_15">   (iv)    The business transactions of the defendants with numerous
           reputed automobile companies in India namely Mahindra and
           Mahindra, General Motors India Ltd. Hyundai Motors India
           Ltd., etc. to whom, the defendants have been supplying auto
           accessories and enjoying wide reputation. The defendants
           have been advertising themselves in different magazines like
           'OVER DRIVE', and 'AUTO CAR' since 2002. The defendant
           No.1 had also participated in Auto Expo 2004 and Auto Expo
           2006 and got defendant No.3 advertised in these magazines.
           The plaintiff had also advertised itself in the same magazine
           in 2004 which makes it abundantly clear that it was well
           aware of and had knowledge/constructive knowledge of the
           trademark/trade name 'PRIUS' in favour of the defendants as
           it is simply impossible for the plaintiff to ignore the user of
           the trademark, when it was published in the same issue
           namely, AUTO CAR MAGAZINE, Volume 6 No.4 for December
           2004 advertised by the plaintiff for TOYOTA car on the front
           cover and advertisement by the defendants No. 1 to 3. Thus,
           it is submitted that the plaintiff was aware about the user of
           the trademark PRIUS by the defendants No. 1 to 3 since the
           year 2002 onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_16">    (v)    The rectification petition filed by the plaintiff for cancellation
           of the trademarks under Nos. 1163594 and 1086682 in Class
           12 before the Trademark Registry, New Delhi, is not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                             Page 7 of 121</span>
            maintainable inasmuch as, the said trademarks have been
           duly registered in favour of the defendants and the plaintiff is
           not at all entitled to the said trademarks in India in view of
           the fact that no application for registration of the said
           trademark was made by the plaintiff as per the provision
           contained in Section 154 of the Trademarks Act, 1999
           (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') and therefore the
           plaintiff is not at all entitled to file the rectification petition for
           cancellation of the said trademarks registered in favour of
           the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_17">   (vi)    The defendants have been raising the bills in Company's
           name since 2001 and have built up reputation and goodwill.
           The trademark 'PRIUS' has become distinctive with the
           defendants because of the supreme quality and performance
           of their products and the defendants' company enjoys
           uniqueness in their field in the Indian market since 2001
           which is reflected from the fact that General Motors of India,
           Hyundai Motors Ltd., Mahindra &amp; Mahindra are some of its
           valued customers.
</p>
<p id="p_18">  (vii)    The use of the trademark 'PRIUS' by the defendants is not
           unauthorized rather the said trademark is duly registered in
           favour of the defendants in India, and on the other hand the
           trademark 'PRIUS' is not registered in India in favour of the
           plaintiff either for any PRIUS car or for any other product or
           for that matter the auto accessories manufactured and being
           sold by the defendants. So there is no question of debasing
           the reputation of the plaintiff's trademarks rather it is the
           defendants who are enjoying reputation and goodwill for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                 Page 8 of 121</span>
            their auto accessories under the trademark 'PRIUS' in Indian
           markets.
</p>
<p id="p_19">  (viii)   It is submitted with respect that the plaintiff has no
           registration of the trademark 'PRIUS' in India, nor has been
           marketing any product under the trade name 'PRIUS' or for
           that matter the 'PRIUS CAR' and therefore there is no
           question of enjoying any reputation and goodwill in India.
           Further, even as admitted by the plaintiff, it went globally in
           respect of the 'PRIUS CAR' only in the year 2000- 2001 and
           therefore there is no question of enjoying any international
           reputation and goodwill much less tremendous international
           reputation and goodwill in the trademark 'PRIUS'. Further,
           the plaintiff has not produced any document to show that the
           plaintiff   was   enjoying   any   reputation   and    goodwill
           internationally in the trademark 'PRIUS' at the relevant time
           i.e. 2001-2002 when the plaintiff started the use of the
           trademark 'PRIUS' for its auto accessories and got the
           registration thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.    In the written statement on behalf of defendant No.4, it is stated
that the defendant No.4 is is a duly incorporated company having its
registered office at 65, First Floor, Sandesh Vihar, Pitampura, Delhi-
110034. It commenced its business in the year 2006 under the trade
name M/s Prius Auto Accessories Pvt. Ltd. The products are being
supplied directly to different car manufacturers such as Mahindra and
Mahindra, General Motors and Hyundai for their cars as per their
specification. Thus, unlike the defendant No.4 it is not supplying any of
its products in the open market.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                          Page 9 of 121</span>
<p id="p_21">    (a)     The defendant No.4 has made sales of Rs.4,867,121.43/- for
           the year ending 31st March, 2007, Rs.6,542,898.68/- for the
           year ending 31st March, 2008, Rs.9,387,382.50/- for the year
           ending 31st March, 2009, and Rs. 1,20,45,450/- from 1st
           April, 2009 to 25th December, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_22">   (b)     The defendant No.4 has never used the trademark Toyota,
           TOYOTA Device and INNOVA, as the said defendant is
           manufacturing    the   auto   accessories   for   different     car
           manufactures as per their specifications and requirements
           and supplying it directly to them to be fitted in their cars.
           Since the said defendant is not manufacturing and supplying
           any of its Auto Accessories to TOYOTA, thus there is no
           question it using the trademark/trade name TOYOTA, TOYOTA
           DEVICE, and INNOVA and so the allegation of passing off
           against the defendant No.4 is not tenable inasmuch as the
           defendant No.4 is not making any representation that it is in
           any manner connected with the plaintiff or is selling the
           goods of the plaintiff or that there is any association between
           the said defendant and the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_23">   (c)     Being a sister concern of the defendant No.3 which is the
           rightful and registered owner of the trademark PRIUS, the
           defendant No.4 has rightly been using the trade name M/s
           Prius Auto Accessories Private Limited and the plaintiff which
           is not registered in India for the trademark PRIUS for any of
           its products much less the products manufactured by the
           defendant No.4 and for that matter, the defendants No.1 to 3
           have no right whatsoever to claim infringement or passing
           off.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                           Page 10 of 121</span>
<p id="p_24">    (d)     The defendants have never used the trademark Toyota,
           Toyota Device and Innova, as alleged, at any time in the
           past, nor the defendants have any such intention to use the
           same in future. The plaintiff is trying to twist the material
           facts.
</p>
<p id="p_25">13.    The plaintiff has filed two separate replications, i.e. replication to
the written statement filed by the defendants No.1 to 3 and the
second is to the written statement filed on behalf of defendant No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       It was denied in the replication that the suit is barred by latches,
acquiescence and delay. As soon as the plaintiff became aware of the
impugned registrations under Nos.1086682 and 1163594, without any
delay initiated and filed rectification petitions for the impugned marks
and filed the present suit. It is stated that the defendants have made
false averments in the proceedings alleging that the defendants have
neither used nor have any intentions to use the marks TOYOTA,
Toyota Device or TOYOTA INNOVA but have at the same time relied
upon documents which prima facie show that they have been using
the trademarks belonging to the plaintiff. The aforesaid conduct
amounts to perjury and contempt of Court for which the plaintiff has
filed separate applications which are pending.
</p>
<p id="p_27">       The defendants had at one stage applied for registrations of
trademark PRIUS in relation to automobile parts in addition to
accessories, claiming itself to be the proprietor. While now, it is being
stated that the defendants do not manufacture or sell auto parts which
forms a part of its specification of registrations. This amounts to an
admission on the part of the defendants and on this ground alone the
impugned registrations should be expunged from the register as they
have mischievously and wrongly procured the impugned registrations


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                            Page 11 of 121</span>
 for PRIUS by misleading the Registrar of Trademarks. Even in case of
accessories for automobiles, it is a trade practice that proprietors of
the mark may permit supplier of accessories to do so, provided the
terms so allowed to be manufactured are all according to the quality,
strength as well as applying the aero dynamic principles. It is further
submitted that as per trade practice, manufacturers of high standard
fittings and accessories use their own brand while assuring high
quality.

<p id="p_28">14.    It is submitted by the plaintiff that the adoption and use by third
parties (defendants) of the manufacturer's (plaintiff's) name and mark
is not permitted because they cannot carry any warranty from the
automobile manufacturers. In the present case, the same has been
done in such a manner so as to give the impression that there is a
commercial connection between the defendants and the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_29">       It was also clarified by the plaintiff that <a href="/doc/1635363/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Act is
applicable only at the opposition stage, it is not so in the present case.
As regards <a href="/doc/1872451/" id="a_2">Section 33</a>, the plaintiff submits that the provision with
regard to acquiescence does not apply in the present proceedings
since the plaintiff as soon as it became aware, filed rectification and
instituted the present suit. The defendants' claim to supply 'genuine
accessories' for the plaintiff's cars INNOVA and QUALIS without any
authorization from the plaintiff, this amounts to a punishable act under
<a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_3">Sections 103</a> and <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_4">104</a> of the Act for application and selling of goods
bearing false trademark and trade description.

 PRIUS by the plaintiff dates back in the year 1990 and its commercial
use commenced in the year 1997. The trademark PRIUS of the plaintiff
has acquired an excellent global reputation and goodwill on account of
the high quality of the plaintiff's products and the said reputation spills
over to India partly due to the plaintiff's, direct sales in India and
partly due to the advertising campaign carried out globally including
India through various printed media. It is submitted that the
defendants despite having full knowledge of the plaintiff's mark PRIUS
have      dishonestly     adopted   the   same   and   obtained   impugned
registrations. As soon as the plaintiff came to know of this impugned
use, the plaintiff filed rectification petition and immediately initiated
the Court proceedings. Thus, the present suit is not barred by the
principles of acquiescence, delay and estoppel, etc.

       With regard to the reference to the defendants No.1 and 3 that
the use of the word Toyota, Innova on their products is only for
bonafide description of the character of the defendants' goods and for
the purpose of identification, is false. The use of the trademark
Toyota, Toyota Innova and Device by the defendants on their
products/catalogue/brochure does not amount to fair use within the
provisions of Trademark Act and thus amounts to infringement. As
regards the mark PRIUS, the defendants have malafidely obtained two
impugned registrations for which the plaintiff has filed rectification
petitions which are pending before the Trademark Registry, New Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_31">16.    This Court on 22nd December, 2009 issued an ex parte ad
interim      injunction     restraining   the    defendants   from      using
trademark/trading style TOYOTA, the Toyota Device, INNOVA and
PRIUS in respect of auto parts and accessories or any other allied
goods or to do anything which may cause confusion and deception

said order was vacated by order dated 19th March, 2010 by another
bench.

<p id="p_32">17.    The plaintiff thereafter had challenged the above said order by
way of an appeal being FAO (OS) No.248 of 2010. After hearing, the
Division Bench by order dated 10th August, 2010 disposed of the
appeal and           ordered for the imposition of an interim arrangement
along the following conditions:

common law rights vested in the trademarks TOYOTA, INNOVA and

registered TOYOTA trademarks as well as the unregistered trademark
PRIUS as per the case of plaintiff who also states that such use by the
defendants is without authorization, license or permission of any
manner and amounts to infringement of the registered trademarks of
the plaintiff and passing off the well-known trademark PRIUS. The

 defendants are using marks in the course of trade which are identical
to the plaintiffs' reputed and registered trademarks TOYOTA, the
Toyota Device.
</p>
<p id="p_176">41.    It is the case of the plaintiff that it is also apparent from the
product brochure and the impugned product of the defendants that
they are using the plaintiff's registered TOYOTA trademarks. Such use
by the defendants is un-authorized, license or permission and amounts
to infringement of the registered trademarks of the plaintiff and
passing off the mark PRIUS. The defendants are using as trademarks
in the course of trade which are identical to the plaintiffs' reputed and
registered trademarks TOYOTA, the Toyota Device, INNOVA and PRIUS
in relation to goods which are same to those of the plaintiff's
manufacture and without due authorization.         The defendants are
therefore taking unfair advantage of the distinctive character and
repute of the registered trademarks of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_177">42.    The defendants have contended that they are entitled to
manufacture spare parts for automobiles and that they are entitled to
indicate the cars for which the spare parts are so made on the
packaging of their products.
</p>
<p id="p_178">43.    The defendants claim that the use of the trademarks TOYOTA,
INNOVA, QUALIS and TOYOTA DEVICE was in accordance with honest
industrial practices under <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_7">Section 30</a> of the Act and therefore, no claim
for infringement is maintainable against them. However, the stand of
the defendants is totally contrary when the samples of the defendants
are examined by the Court during the course of argument.           It was
found that the said trademarks are not used in order to describe the
bonafide description but the same have also been used as trademarks
and in the similar manner, script and device.

justification given by the defendants is not sustainable in view of
evidence placed on record which speaks for itself. It is pertinent to
mention here that the Division Bench of this Court by order dated 10th
August, 2010 had given the following directions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       (i)   The defendants were required to ensure that TOYOTA and

             were also prohibited from being used.

<p id="p_183">47.    The Division Bench in an appeal by order dated 10th August,
2010 had stipulated the manner in which the defendants must indicate
that their products were meant for particular automobiles. The
conditions imposed by the Court are already mentioned to be used as
for identification only.
</p>
<p id="p_184">48.    The new packaging filed by the plaintiff would reveal that the
defendants have not been in compliance with the abovementioned
conditions imposed upon them by this Court. The defendants'
packaging rather shows and denotes the trademarks TOYOTA and
INNOVA which admittedly belong to the plaintiff.         The expression
'vehicle name is used for item identification only' is also not used
prominently by the defendants. The other condition, i.e. inclusion of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 36 of 121</span>
 the expression 'Genuine Accessories of PRIUS Auto Industries Limited'
also does not find mention anywhere on the packaging of the
defendants' products.
</p>
<p id="p_185">49.    It is evident that the defendants have not fully complied with the
orders passed by the Division Bench. When it was pointed out to the
defendants, firstly there was denial and when document were
confronted the statement was made on behalf of defendants that they
would change the packaging material and undertake to fully comply
with the order passed by the Division Bench on 10th August, 2010 in
future. However, hardly any justification was given as to why there
were not fully complying with the orders.
</p>
<p id="p_186">50.    This Court laid down principles about the manner of use of a
trademark in a bonafide manner while denoting the quality or
characteristics of a particular good or service in the case of Hawkins
Cookers Limited v. Murugan Enterprises, RFA (OS) No.09/2008 by
judgment dated 13th April, 2012 wherein it has stated that "...It also
needs to be highlighted that it has escaped the attention of the
Learned Single Judge that while writing /Suitable for Hawkins Pressure
Cookers', the Respondent has given undue prominence to the word
'Hawkins' by printing it in a distinct red colour and the remaining
words of the sentence are printed in black."
</p>
<p id="p_187">51.    The defendants in addition to being in violation of this Court's
directions contained in order dated 10th August, 2010 have also
mentioned the trademarks INNOVA of the plaintiff in a prominent
manner, having a distinct red and white color scheme, while other
words such as 'vehicle name is used for item identification only'
appear in plain black colour and their size and shape is not as
prominent as that of the mark INNOVA.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 37 of 121</span>
<p id="p_188"> 52.    I am of the considered opinion that such use by the defendants
as appeared from the packaging cannot be treated as being bonafide
as per the provisions of the Act and as a matter of fact, the
defendants have calculated their actions aimed to encash upon the
goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the plaintiff in its respective
trademarks. The defendants, in fact, were/have been using the marks
as trademarks in a prominent manner which were never allowed by
the orders of Division Bench to be used in this manner nor there was
any intention by the Bench while issuing the directions.
</p>
<p id="p_189">53.    The Division Bench had directed the defendants to take such
steps in order to dispel any confusion in the minds of consumers
regarding the source of the products of the defendants. However, it is
evident that the defendants did not respect the orders of the Division
Bench and continued to breach the orders as per evidence available on
record. By such use, they were claiming that they are using the same
as trademarks and not merely giving the description.
</p>
<p id="p_190">54.    In fact, the defendants failed to act and to take even a single
step to comply the orders, rather it appears to the Court that the
defendants willfully disobeyed the directions.   A mere perusal of the
packaging of the products of the defendants does not lead any
consumer to form an impression that the plaintiff's trademarks have
been used solely to describe the nature and working of accessories
and spare parts as being indigenously developed and only as being
compatible with the plaintiff's automobiles.
</p>
<p id="p_191">55.    The defendants' use of these trademarks is malafide, as it takes
unfair advantage of such huge goodwill and reputation and aims to
encash upon this vast reputation and goodwill. The plaintiff through
dedicated and unparalleled efforts over the last eight decades has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                        Page 38 of 121</span>
 painstakingly built such immense reputation. The plaintiff, through
consistent and tireless efforts has maintained such reputation in the
eyes of consumers and members of the trade alike. The defendants'
intentions     and    actions   are   malafide,   without   authorization    and
constituted unfair competition vis-à-vis the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_192">56.    Moreover, the defendants' continuous actions and over all
conduct are bound to lead to the gradual whittling away and eventual
erosion of the exclusivity that is associated with the plaintiff's
trademarks. The defendants' actions constitute a strong threat to the
high degree of uniqueness and exclusivity that is associated with these
trademarks, and risk the plaintiff's trademarks from failing to serve
their basic purpose, i.e. identifying the goods and services bearing the
trademarks TOYOTA, INNOVA and the TOYOTA DEVICE as emanating
from the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_193">57.    <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_8">Section 29(1)</a> of the Act defines the act of infringement of
trademark as being that when a registered trademark is infringed by a
person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by
way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is
identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trademark in relation to
goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered and
in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as
being used in the course of trade.
</p>
<p id="p_194">58.    Further, <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_9">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act states that a trademark is
infringed by a person, who not being a registered proprietor, uses in
the course of trade, a mark which because of its identity with the
registered trademark and the similarity of the goods and services
covered by such registered trademark; is likely to cause confusion on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                              Page 39 of 121</span>
 part of the public, or which is likely to have an association with the
registered trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_195">59.    From the above, it is clear that the defendants have used the
plaintiff's trademarks on the goods, packaging as well as on brochures
(advertising material) and that the goods bearing such trademarks
have been actively sold by the defendants at least from the year 2002,
thus violating <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_10">Section 29(6)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_196">60.    The defendants are not the registered proprietors of the
trademarks TOYOTA, INNOVA and the TOYOTA DEVICE. They have
used the trademarks TOYOTA, INNOVA and the TOYOTA DEVICE,
which are identical to the plaintiff's trademarks, in the course of trade
and such as that their use is likely to be taken as being used as
trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_197">61.    The use of the plaintiff's trademarks by the defendants on their
product packaging, samples, brochures etc. is bound to mislead
consumers into believing that the products actually emanate from the
plaintiff itself thereby establishing a false association between both the
parties.
</p>
<p id="p_198">62.    In fact, the defendants under such circumstances giving the
impression to the entire trade and purchasers that the products
manufactured and sold by the defendants are actually genuine spare
parts manufactured by the plaintiff and sold by the defendants through
the plaintiff's consent.   Clearly, this impression in the minds of the
consumer will be a false one as the defendants manufacture and sell
spare parts (which are not genuine products of the plaintiff) and claim
that they are compatible with those of the plaintiff's cars. Therefore,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 40 of 121</span>
 the actions of the defendants are in violation of the provisions of
<a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_11">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_199">63.    Furthermore,   the   Act   also   provides   another    criteria        for
determining infringement in <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_12">Section 29(8)</a> of the Act which stipulates
that a registered trademark is infringed by any advertising of that
trademark if such advertising takes unfair advantage of and is contrary
to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters; or is
detrimental to its distinctive character; or is against the reputation of
that trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_200">64.    Therefore, the actions of the defendants' amount to infringement
of the plaintiff's trademark TOYOTA INNOVA and the TOYOTA DEVICE
as provided under the ambit of <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_13">Section 29</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_201">65.    The plaintiff under these reasons has been able to discharge its
burden on this issue No.2 and on the other hand, the defendants failed
to discharge their burden on issue No.6, as they have been using the
marks in question as trademarks and not in the manner of bonafide
description.
</p>
<p id="p_202">66.    On the other hand, the defendants have failed to establish that
their use is merely bonafide description and they are not using the
same merely for identification purposes. Once both set of trademarks
used by the parties are identical with, strong case of infringement is
made out. No further evidence is necessary. Reliance is placed upon
the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_14">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna
Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, AIR 1965 SC 980, at page 989, para
28 wherein it was held that once the defendant's mark is similar and
the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                           Page 41 of 121</span>
<p id="p_203"> 67.    In case the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Kaviraj
Pandit (supra) and the provision of Order XII Rule 6 and Order XV of
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are read conjointly, I am of the opinion
that the view taken by the Supreme Court is absolutely correct when it
is held once the Court reaches to the conclusion that the defendants'
mark is similar and there is an imitation, no further <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_15">Evidence Act</a> is
required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. As in view
of the extensive amendments in the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_16">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,
1958 which has been repealed with the object of mass scale of
developments in trade and commercial practices with increasing
globalisation of trade and industries. Admittedly, the Act is a <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_17">Special
Act</a> now after amendment; it is covered within the definition of the
Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate
Division of High Courts. If the scheme of the entire Act and judgments
rendered by the Supreme Court and High Courts are considered, one
thing is clear that it is for the Court to decide as to whether the
defendants' mark is similar or not, otherwise obviously witnesses on
behalf of the plaintiff always depose that the marks are similar and
witnesses of the opposite side give testimonies that those are not
similar and at the end of the day despite of two different version of the
parties, still the Courts are deciding about similarity of the marks used
by the parties, it has been noticed many times that the main purpose
of recording the evidence becomes futile exercise because two
contrary sets of statements of the witnesses are available on record.
Therefore, this Court is of the view that being a <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_18">Special Act</a> and of
being commercial disputes, in order to save the time of the Court and
save the costs of the parties, it would always be appropriate to ignore
the lengthy procedure of evidence except on limited issues (if



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 42 of 121</span>
 necessary) in the cases of counterfeiting and in the cases of
infringement where the marks on the face of record are either identical
with or there is close similarity of the marks. Thus, the approach taken
by the Supreme Court more than 40 years earlier in the case of
Kaviraj (supra) was correct with valid logic.
</p>
<p id="p_204">68.    In view of the above said reasons, the plaintiff has been able to
establish the case of infringement against the defendants who, on the
other hand, failed to discharge their burden on issue No.6. The same
is accordingly decided against the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_205">69.    Before dealing with the matter on issues No.3 and 9, it is
imperative to first deal with issue No.5, as the result of findings of this
issue would be dependent with the above said issues No.3 and 9.
</p>
<p id="p_206">70.    ISSUE NO.5 reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "Whether the Plaintiff's trademark PRIUS enjoys a status of
       well-known mark and whether it has spill over reputation
       in India?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_207">71.    It is to be determined on this issue as to whether the plaintiff
has acquired any goodwill and reputation of PRIUS and whether the
said mark by virtue thereof becomes a well-known mark and its
goodwill has travelled in India by virtue of evidence adduced by the
plaintiff or not.

</blockquote><p id="p_209">73.    It is stated in the plaint and it has also come in evidence that
the plaintiff's car under the trademark PRIUS is sold in many countries
and regions, with its largest markets being those of Japan and North
America. In May 2008, global cumulative sales for the car PRIUS
reached the one million vehicle mark, and by 31st August, 2008, it
reached worldwide cumulative sales of 1.43 million units. As a top
seller of PRIUS cars, the US market made up more than half of the 1.2
million by early 2009. The plaintiff's car under the trademark PRIUS
was on display at the 18th International Engineering and Technology
Fair (IETF) in February 2009 in Bangalore and at Fourth International
Environmentally Friendly Vehicle Conference (lEFVC) in November
2009 in New Delhi, India and was also launched in India in early 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_210">74.    The plaintiff has claimed to have filed over 1000 patents during
the development of the latest version of the PRIUS car. The plaintiff's
global target for the year 2010 was to sell about 400,000 units. In May
2009 the production of the PRIUS car was increased to 50,000 units
per month or 600,000 annual units to meet higher than projected
demand.

the trademark PRIUS throughout the world as appeared from the
documents filed.

<p id="p_212">76.    From the material available on record, it appears that trademark
PRIUS has acquired an excellent global goodwill and reputation in

 advertising campaign carried out globally including India in various
printed media. It is evident that consumers and the trade in India
identify, recognize and associate the trademark PRIUS with the
products of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_213">77.    The goodwill and reputation of the trademark PRIUS is travelled
in    India     from     the     plaintiff's    website    www.toyota.com           and
www.toyotabharat.com. The said websites can be accessed from
anywhere in the world and are visited regularly by millions including
Indian internet users. Printouts of the web pages have been filed.
Advertisements         and     articles   in   trade    magazines,    write   ups       in
newspapers and in other media about the plaintiff and the new cars
which it launches from time to time, including PRIUS which was
launched around 1997, have also spread the awareness, knowledge
and information amongst the Indian viewers. The plaintiff has filed
the affidavit under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_19">Section 65B</a> of the Evidence Act, in support
thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_214">78.    It also appears from the plaint and the evidence produced and
also proved that the plaintiff has taken many steps towards promoting
its automobile under the trademark PRIUS across the world. The
plaintiff     has     huge   amount       towards      promoting     and   increasing
awareness of its automobiles across the world. The promotional and
advertising activities undertaken by plaintiff across several platforms
such as newspapers, print media, online advertisements, physical

the Toyota PRIUS and the fact that it was the world's first hybrid car is
a matter of public history and is an undeniable fact. The plaintiff has
also filed numerous books and articles in this regard.      <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_20">Section 57</a> of
the Indian Evidence Act provides that such evidence if placed on
record by way of books and other documentary evidence, the Court
can take judicial notice.     The plaintiff's hybrid car, no doubt, has a
stellar reputation and path-breaking engineering that had taken the
world by storm in the form of the plaintiff's launch of the Toyota PRIUS
in and around 1997. As per settled law on the subject, it is immaterial
if the mark PRIUS has been physically used in India by a party
subsequent to the use on behalf of the defendants, as from the said
documents, it is established that the plaintiff has adopted and used the
mark in international market positively prior in time than the
defendants. It is a matter of fact that as per record by evidence that

 these magazines, books and printouts were easily available and
accessible in India and one could find out that PRIUS mark is belonging
to the plaintiff.

<p id="p_249">90.    As already mentioned, the Courts can take judicial notice of the
goodwill and reputation of a trademark on the basis of documentary
evidence filed by the plaintiff which was evidenced in the case of

       indicate that the defendants themselves had knowledge of
       the prior existence of Tiger Balm, the documents at
       Exhs.P109 and 132 referred to the said product Tiger Balm
       in the said books relating to International Marketing
       Strategy and the different products. In this regard certain
       other books and magazines at Ex.P142, 143, 159, 160 and
       174 to 177 were also relied on. The said books and
       magazines refer to the history of the product and also the
       product itself which gives a lot of insight with regard to the
       existence of the product much earlier to the period from
       which the defendant claims right. The learned senior
       counsel for the appellant no doubt contended that the said
       books cannot be relied on since the authors have not been
       examined and the magazines were not published in India
       and as such, the same can be considered only as hearsay
       evidence. On this aspect in addition to the fact that it
       would attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/973062/" id="a_22">Section 56</a> and <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_23">57</a> of the
       Evidence Act as noticed by the Court below, in my view
       while taking judicial notice what cannot be lost sight of is,
       in the said books and magazines the same is not confined
       only to the product Tiger Balm. Though the book relates to
       Tiger Balm, the same was published at an undisputed
       period and the magazines referred to several other popular
       products and each of them have been analysed among
       which the product Tiger Balm is also one among them and
       as such the reference and discussion would ensure to the
       benefit of the plaintiffs to establish that it is a pre-existing
       product and had its reputation even at places where the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                            Page 53 of 121</span>
        same was not manufactured or marketed as travelling
       people would have access to such magazines. It is no
       doubt true that the evidence ofPW3 may not make much
       headway for the plaintiffs, but the documentary evidence
       tendered on behalf of the plaintiff and the very fact that
       the defendants have adopted the mark knowing well about
       the existence of a product with a similar mark cannot
       succeed only on the contention that they are the first in
       India. When the defendants were aware of the existence of
       the plaintiffs' predecessor, they could not have assumed
       that they would not enter the Indian market when in fact
       the sale was made in 1974 and application was filed in
       1976 and that too in the background that there was trade
       restrictions for some time. In fact on the other hand DW-3
       who is the distributor of the defendants' product in his
       evidence has stated that he had heard of Tiger Balm at the
       time when the defendants had approached them in 1968-
       67 for distribution of their product. Therefore, considering
       all the aspects, to the said extent, it can be stated that the
       plaintiffs had established that the said product had trans-
       border reputation."

<p id="p_250">91.    Therefore, it is clear from the evidence produced that the mark
'PRIUS' initiation as the world's first hybrid car in 1995 at the Tokyo
Motor Show, its subsequent commercial launch in 1997 and hold that
the PRIUS does enjoy trans-border reputation in India, from a period
much prior to the year 2001. The launch of the first hybrid car in the
world under the trademark PRIUS was a significant not only in the
automobile industry in general, but also for environmentalists across
the world. Thus, the launch of the first hybrid car in the world under
the trademark PRIUS is an undeniable and a well-established fact. The
cognizance of this fact by persons across the world need not be
required to be established through documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_251">92.    On the basis of the above, it is evident that the immense
goodwill and reputation of the Toyota PRIUS, as it is enjoyed in
several countries across the world, could have validly spilled over into

 India in 2001, irrespective of the fact that its physical use in India
commenced only in the year 2010 as well as the documentary
evidence available on record in relation to its PRIUS is sufficient to
establish that the immense reputation and goodwill that it enjoyed
globally, had also spilled over into India.

<p id="p_254">95.    It cannot be denied by defendants that the plaintiff's automobile
PRIUS was the world's first concept car with a hybrid engine
engineered and developed at a time when the world was gearing up to
face the challenges of global pollution, the plaintiff gave the world a
fitting answer through its environment friendly PRIUS even being a
first car introduced by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_255">96.    The plaintiff's PRIUS is famous and well revered not only
amongst members of the automobile industry alone, but also amongst
members of the purchasing public. Thus, the trademark PRIUS has
become exclusively associated with the plaintiff, as is evidenced from
the following:

             Group and it has the additional advantage of direct
             use in India inter alia of its PRIUS automobile. This is

 denied. The plaintiff under any circumstances cannot manipulate the
said dates as it is a clinching evidence of adoption of the mark
internationally. The plaintiff, therefore, has coined the trademark 26
years as of today.     It is difficult to accept the contention of the
defendants that they were unaware about the mark PRIUS at the time
of adoption and user of the mark by the defendants. There is also no
force in the submissions of the defendants that as PRIUS is not an
invented word, thus, the status of well-known mark cannot be given.
Firstly, the mark at the time of adoption was not commonly used and
secondly, as per definition of the mark, any word becomes a mark and
the mark can become a well-known mark, once the conditions of
<a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_27">Section 2(1)(zg)</a> are fulfilled.   Most of the well-known trademarks in
the world are not invented words; they were adopted from common
parlance, still those have become well-known marks for example
Whirlpool, Yahoo, Phillips, Reliance, TATA, etc.

</p><p id="p_260">101. Upon adopting the mark in the year 1990, the plaintiff
introduced the world's first concept car with a hybrid engine called
PRIUS in 1995 at the Tokyo Motor Show. The first commercial sale of
the PRIUS model NHW10 went on sale in December 1997 in Japan.
Subsequently, it was imported to United Kingdom, Australia and New
Zealand. It made its debut in the United States as well as Europe in
the year 2000, while it was launched on Australian soil in 2001 after
the Sydney Motor Show. The said record is a Government record
which cannot be managed or manipulated by anyone. As a matter of
fact, it is conclusive, cogent and clear evidence. Thus, the plaintiff has
been using the trademark PRIUS continuously and extensively on a
commercial scale since the year 1995, i.e. over a period of twenty
years.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 58 of 121</span>
<p id="p_261"> 102. From the overall facts and evidence, it appears to Court that the
plaintiff's trademark PRIUS has attained the status of being a well-
known trademark in accordance with the provisions with <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_28">Sections 2(1)</a>
(zg) read with <a href="/doc/1067003/" id="a_29">Sections 11(6)</a> and <a href="/doc/1067003/" id="a_30">11(9)</a> of the Act respectively and
the plaintiff has been able to satisfy the Court that all the conditions
are fulfilled in the present case by the plaintiff who has discharged its
burden of proof of issue No.5.            The same is accordingly decided in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_262">103. Now, I shall take up issue No.7 which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">       Whether    the    Defendants  are   the registered
       proprietors of the trademark PRIUS? OPD

       It is the admitted position that the defendants have obtained
registrations for the mark PRIUS under class 12 bearing registration
Nos.1163954           and   1086682.     The   plaintiff   has     filed    rectification
proceedings against the defendants' such registrations and the
supporting documents have been filed by the Plaintiffs in the present
suit. The case of the plaintiff is that the defendants' adoption of the
mark PRIUS itself was dishonest, tainted and malafide. The factum of
registrations     secured     by   the    defendants       is    irrelevant      for    the
determination of the action of passing off initiated by the plaintiff
against the defendants in the present suit in relation to their
trademark PRIUS.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_263">104. I agree with the submissions of the plaintiff that in an action of
passing off, the registration of the same mark by the other rival party
is immaterial.        The plaintiff can succeed in an action of passing off
against the registered proprietor if a case of earlier user, goodwill and
reputation is made out. But the fact remains in the matter that as of
today the defendants are the registered proprietors of trademark

 PRIUS. The effect of registrations obtained by them is being discussed
while deciding issue No.7.     As far as issue No.7 is concerned, the
plaintiff cannot deny the fact that as on today the defendants No.1 to
3 are the registered proprietors of trademarks. The rectification filed
by the plaintiff is still pending and unless the mark(s) are cancelled,
the defendants have to be treated as registered proprietors of PRIUS
in relation to goods in which the registrations are obtained. Thus, this
issue is accordingly disposed of by holding that the defendants are the
registered proprietors of the trademark PRIUS. The defendants have
discharged their burden on this issue.

plaintiff is able to establish that the plaintiff is the owner of the mark
by virtue of prior adoption and user in overseas countries where under
those circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled for relief or not.       This
Court has already given its findings that the plaintiff's mark PRIUS has
acquired unique reputation and goodwill in relation to goods and the
mark PRIUS owned by the plaintiff is well-known mark within the

       more persons are registered proprietors of the trademarks
       which are identical with or nearly resemble each other. It,
       thus, postulates a situation where same or similar
       trademark can be registered in favour of more than one
       person. On a plain stand-alone reading of this Section, it is
       clear that the exclusive right to use of any of those
       trademarks shall not be deemed to have been acquired by
       one registrant as against other registered owner of the
       trademark (though at the same time they have the same
       rights as against third person). Thus, between the two
       persons who are the registered owners of the trademarks,

        there is no exclusive right to use the said trademark
       against each other, which means this provision gives
       concurrent right to both the persons to use the registered
       trademark in their favour. Otherwise also, it is a matter of
       common sense that the plaintiff cannot say that its
       registered trademark is infringed when the defendant is
       also enjoying registration in the trademark and such
       registration gives the defendant as well right to use the
       same, as provided in <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_37">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">       28. However, what is stated above is the reflection of
       <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_38">Section 28</a> of the Act when that provision is seen and
       examined without reference to the other provisions of the
       Act. It is stated at the cost of repetition that as per this
       Section owner of registered trademark cannot sue for
       infringement of his registered trademark if the appellant
       also has the trademark which is registered. Having said so,
       a very important question arises for consideration at this
       stage, namely, whether such a respondent can bring an
       action against the appellant for passing off invoking the
       provisions of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_39">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act. In other words,
       what would be the interplay of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_40">Section 27(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_41">Section
       28(3)</a> of the Act is the issue that arises for consideration in
       the instant case. As already noticed above, the trial court
       as well as the High Court have granted the injunction in
       favour of the respondent on the basis of prior user as well
       as on the ground that the trademark of the appellant, even
       if it is registered, would cause deception in the mind of the
       public at large and the appellant is trying to encash upon,
       exploit and ride upon on the goodwill of the respondent
       herein. Therefore, the issue to be determined is as to
       whether in such a scenario, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_42">Section 27(2)</a>
       would still be available even when the appellant is having
       registration of the trademark of which he is using.

       reasons for arriving at this conclusion are the following.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">       30. Firstly, the answer to this proposition can be seen by
       carefully looking at the provisions of the Trademarks Act,
       1999 (the Act). Collective reading of the provisions
       especially Sections 27, 28, 29 and 34 of the Trademarks

        Act, 1999 would show that the rights conferred by
       registration are subject to the rights of the prior user of
       the trademark. We have already reproduced <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_43">Section 27</a>
       and <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_44">Section 29</a> of the Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">       30.1 From the reading of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_45">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act, it is
       clear that the right of action of any person for passing off
       the goods/services of another person and remedies thereof
       are not affected by the provisions of the Act. Thus, the
       rights in passing off are emanating from the common law
       and not from the provisions of the Act and they are
       independent from the rights conferred by the Act. This is
       evident from the reading of the opening words of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_46">Section
       27(2)</a> which are "Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to
       affect rights...."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">       30.2 Likewise, the registration of the mark shall give
       exclusive rights to the use of the trademark subject to the
       other provisions of this Act. Thus, the rights granted by the
       registration in the form of exclusivity are not absolute but
       are subject to the provisions of the Act.
       30.3 <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_47">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act provides that the rights of
       two registered proprietors of identical or nearly resembling
       trademarks shall not be enforced against each other.
       However, they shall be same against the third parties.
       <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_48">Section 28(3)</a> merely provides that there shall be no rights
       of one registered proprietor vis-à-vis another but only for
       the purpose of registration. The said provision 28(3)
       nowhere comments about the rights of passing off which
       shall remain unaffected due to overriding effect of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_49">Section
       27(2)</a> of the Act and thus the rights emanating from the
       common law shall remain undisturbed by the enactment of
       <a href="/doc/189581/" id="a_50">Section 28(3)</a> which clearly states that the rights of one
       registered proprietor shall not be enforced against the

       the field of the trademarks that the registration merely
       recognises the rights which are already pre-existing in
       common law and does not create any rights. This has been
       explained by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court

       OnLine Del para 10)
           "10. '16. ...First is the question of use of the
           trademark. Use plays an all-important part. A trader
           acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark
           merely by using it upon or in connection with his
           goods irrespective of the length of such user and the
           extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a
           mark is entitled to protection directly the article
           having assumed a vendible character is launched
           upon the market. Registration under the statute does
           not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any
           greater rights than what already existed at common
           law and at equity without registration. It does,
           however, facilitate a remedy which may be enforced
           and obtained throughout 'the State and it established
           the record of facts affecting the right to the mark.
           Registration itself does not create a trademark. The
           trademark exists independently of the registration
           which merely affords further protection under the
           statute. Common law rights are left wholly
           unaffected.' [Ed.: As observed in <a href="/doc/524113/" id="a_51">L.D. Malhotra

       33.1. The same view is expressed by the Bombay High
       Court in Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India)
       Ltd. [Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India) Ltd.,
       1965 SCC OnLine Bom 151 : AIR 1969 Bom 24] in which it

           "1. A proprietary right in a mark can be ['Iruttukadai

           be originated by a person, or it can be subsequently
           acquired    by   him     from   somebody     else. Our
           Trademarks law is based on the English Trademarks
           law and the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_52">English Act</a>s. The first Trademarks Act in
           England was passed in 1875. Even prior thereto, it
           was firmly established in England that a trader

            acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark
           merely by using it upon or in connection with goods
           irrespective of the length of such user and the extent
           of his trade, and that he was entitled to protect such
           right of property by appropriate proceedings by way
           of injunction in a court of law. Then came the English
           Trademarks Act of 1875, which was substituted later
           by later Acts. <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_53">The English Act</a>s enabled registration of
           a new mark not till then used with the like
           consequences which a distinctive mark had prior to
           the passing of the Acts. The effect of the relevant
           provision of the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_54">English Act</a>s was that registration of
           a trademark would be deemed to be equivalent to
           public user of such mark. Prior to the Acts, one could
           become a proprietor of a trademark only by user, but
           after the passing of the Act of 1875, one could
           become a proprietor either by user or by registering
           the mark even prior to its user. He could do the latter
           after complying with the other requirements of the
           Act, including the filing of a declaration of his
           intention to use such mark. See observations of
           Llyod Jacob, J. in Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In
           re [Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In re, (1956) 1 WLR

           and particularly the following: (WLR p. 10)

                 '... A proprietary right in a mark sought to be
                 registered can be obtained in a number of ways.
                 The mark can be originated by a person or can
                 be acquired, but in all cases it is necessary that
                 the person putting forward the application
                 should be in possession of some proprietary
                 right which, if questioned, can be substantiated.'

proprietor's trademark would not be protected under the provisions of

<p id="p_268">110. Passing Off

       In the present case, I have held that as far as the trademarks
TOYOTA, TOYOTA device as well as INNOVA is concerned, the
defendants are guilty of infringement of trademarks. With regard to
PRIUS mark, it has been established by the plaintiff on record that the
plaintiff is the prior adopter of the mark in question. As far as prior
user is concerned, it is proved by the plaintiff that the plaintiff has
been using the mark in many countries of the world (except) in India
prior to the defendants. In India, it is to be examined as to whether
the plaintiff is entitled to benefit of spill over its goodwill and
reputation in relation to goods as per the law established.
</p>
<p id="p_269">111. It is also to consider as to whether the defendants are passing
off the trademark PRIUS of the plaintiff. <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_55">Section 27</a> also provides that
nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect rights of action against
person for passing off goods or services as goods of another person or
as services provided by another person, or the remedies in respect
thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_270">       The    plaintiff   has   instituted   the    present   suit   against      the
defendants to restrain them from passing off their goods and services
as those emanating from the plaintiff.             The plaintiff's such claim for
passing off pertains to the trademark PRIUS, which is used in relation

 to the world's first hybrid engine car developed by the plaintiff in the
earlier part of the 1990's.
</p>
<p id="p_271">112. A claim for passing off, in order to succeed, must establish three
pertinent criteria, as defined in the landmark judgment of Reckitt &amp;
Colman Ltd v Borden Inc., [1990] 1 All E.R. 873 (also known as the
Jiff Lemon case), namely:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">       (i)      Goods and services of the plaintiff must enjoy reputation
                and goodwill, such that they are distinguished from others
                in the market;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">       (ii)     Misrepresentation of the goods and services from the
                defendant, either intentional or unintentional, causing
                consumers to be confused into drawing an association
                between such goods and those of the defendant; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">       (iii)    The plaintiff must suffer damage to such goodwill as a
                result of the misrepresentation of the plaintiff and the
                defendants.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_272">113. The plaintiff's claim for passing off essentially hinges upon
establishing that the mark PRIUS enjoyed significant goodwill and
reputation in India, in addition to establishing that the defendants had
misappropriated such goodwill.
</p>
<p id="p_273">114. It is the case of the plaintiff that the mark PRIUS was adopted in
1990 and in the year 1994, the plaintiff's team designed a concept car
with a hybrid engine for the year 1995 Tokyo Motor Show. The vehicle
was named "PRIUS", derived from the Latin word meaning 'prior' or
'before'.      The first PRIUS model NHW10 went on sale in December
1997 in Japan.

<p id="p_274"> 115. It was later imported privately to the United Kingdom, Australia
and New Zealand. In the year 2000 PRIUS was marketed in United
States followed by sales in Europe the same year. The California Air
Resources Board (CARB) classified the car as a Super Ultra Low
Emission Vehicle. The official launch of the PRIUS in Australia occurred
in 2001 after the Sydney Motor Show.

<p id="p_275">116. The plaintiff's car under the trademark PRIUS is sold in more
than 40 countries and regions, with its largest markets being those of
Japan and North America. In May 2008, global cumulative sales for the
car PRIUS reached the 1 million vehicle mark, and by August 31,
2008, it reached worldwide cumulative sales of 1.43 million units. As a
top seller of PRIUS cars, the US market made up more than half of the
1.2 million sales of the PRIUS cars by early 2009. The detail for sales
units by annually is shown in the paragraph 77.

defendants' products, which clearly bore the plaintiff's trademarks
TOYOTA, INNOVA, QUALIS, PRIUS and TOYOTA DEVICE. It is stated
that when the plaintiff came to know about the defendants use of such
trademarks by the defendants in relation to their products and their
packaging, the plaintiff filed the present suit seeking permanent
injunction restraining inter alia infringement of the marks TOYOTA,
INNOVA and the TOYOTA Device and passing off in relation to the
plaintiffs' mark PRIUS.
</p>
<p id="p_286">127. As far as the trademark TOYOTA, its device and INNOVA are
concerned, I have already given my finding to the effect that the
defendants are guilty of infringement as they are using the identical
trademark in the same script. In fact, they were breaching the orders
of the Division Bench. Learned counsel for the defendants during


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                                  Page 71 of 121</span>
 arguments has made the statement that the defendants undertake to
strictly comply with the orders of the Division Bench. Learned counsel
for the plaintiff submits that if the defendants would comply with the
same, then the plaintiff may not have any objection, however, for the
last more than five years, they are not complying with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_287">128. The defendants in the present suit have contended that the
trademark PRIUS cannot be held to have acquired trans-border
reputation in India, especially at the time the defendants adopted the
mark PRIUS as their trading style and trademark in India. However,
the defendants' contentions are untenable and the plaintiff has
established the immense trans-border reputation acquired by it in the
following paragraphs.
</p>
<p id="p_288">129. Although the PRIUS car was actually launched in India in the
year 2010 and was first exhibited in 2009, its reputation had long
before travelled into Indian borders and it was very well known
amongst      consumers     and    especially   amongst   members         of    the
automobile industry.
</p>
<p id="p_289">130. The principles of trans-border reputation were recognized by the
Supreme       Court   in   the   case   of   <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_56">N.R.   Dongre   v.     Whirlpool
Corporation</a>, (1996) 5 SCC 714, wherein it was stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">       "10. Even advertisement of trademark without existence
       of goods in the market is also to be considered as use of
       the trademark. It is also not necessary however that the
       association of the plaintiff's marks with his goods should be
       known all over the country or to every person in the area
       where it is known best."

AIR 1978 Delhi 250, the Court held as under :

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">       "14. Thus, the law is pretty well-settled that in order to
       succeed at this stage the appellant had to establish user of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                               Page 72 of 121</span>
        the aforesaid mark prior in point of time than the
       impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the
       said mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user by
       the appellant is irrelevant in an action passing off and the
       mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by
       the trademark registry did not prove its user by the
       persons in whose names the mark was registered and was
       irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for
       interim injunction unless evidence had been led or was
       available of user of the registered trademarks. In our
       opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by
       the learned Single Judge and led him to commit an error."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_291">132. It is the admitted position that the Supreme Court has clearly
held that the real test for establishing prior use is to determine who is
first in the world market. In the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_58">Milmet Oftho Industries &amp;
Ors. v. Allergan Inc</a>.,(2004) 12 SCC 624, the Supreme Court has
held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">       "The Court has to keep in mind the possibility that with the
       passage of time, some conflict may occur between the use
       of the mark by the Applicant in India and the user by the
       overseas company. The Court must ensure that public
       interest is in no way imperiled. It must also be
       remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised in
       newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media which
       is available in the country. This results in a product
       acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark in
       respect of a drug is associated with the Respondents
       worldwide it would lead to an anomalous situation if an
       identical Mark in respect of a similar drug is allowed to be
       sold in India. However one note of caution must be
       expressed. Multinational corporations, who have no
       intention of coming to India or introducing their product in
       India should not be allowed to throttle an Indian Company
       by not permitting it to sell a product in India, if the Indian
       Company has genuinely adopted the mark and developed
       the product and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate
       test should be who is first in the market." (para 8)

            "In the present case, the marks are the same. They are
           in respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact
           that the Respondents have not been using the mark in
           India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world
           market." (para 9)

</blockquote><p id="p_292">133. The position of law up to Milment (supra) has been followed in
many Courts in India by placing reliance on the said decision and the
Courts have proceeded to grant interim orders and prevented the
misuse of the said brands by protecting trans-border reputation
subject to fulfilling of essential characteristics necessary to prove
trans-border reputation. The decision in the case of Milment (supra)
was rendered in the year 2004 when the impact of internet, e-
commerce, social media was yet to be seen and realized.

<p id="p_293">134. In the case of <a href="/doc/93036610/" id="a_59">Cadbury U.K. Limited &amp; Anr v. Lotte India
Corporation Ltd</a>., reported in 2014 (57) PTC 422 (Delhi) speaking
through my respected brother Dr. Justice S. Muralidhar wherein the
decision of law relating to trans-border reputation has been further
strengthened and has been taken to another level wherein the court
has not merely relied upon the decision of Milment (supra) and
Whirlpool (supra) but has also extended the principle of trans-border
reputation by observing that the existence of a merchant on web
pages which are of foreign origin and social media are sufficient to
show the trans-border nature of reputation without having any activity
in India at the relevant time. Though it is very broad extension of the
concept of trans-border reputation, but it is a question of fact in each
case as to how the internet documents are sufficient to show the
global character of the trademark and the reputation attached to the
same. The impact of the said decision which has been given very
recently is yet to be seen and analyzed by the other Courts in India in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 74 of 121</span>
 the upcoming times. Effectively, the concept of trans-border reputation
and goodwill is interesting in academic sense. However, due to advent
of internet media, international travel, the insistence on the localized
business as well as trans-border reputation is nowadays more or less
dealt with in a kind of presumptive approach rather than by actual
establishment of the same. As the international businesses grow and
proximity between the markets would increase, over the time this
concept will become weaker and on one good day world will be treated
as one market and injunction order could be passed against the
registered proprietor on the basis of unregistered trademark in an
action of passing off as held in the case of Whirlpool (supra).

the following principles have been summarized:

           above case law is:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">           (a) The concept of goodwill is derived from reputation
           but the reputation need not be necessarily a local
           reputation. It can even be a spill over in India of the
           international reputation enjoyed by the Plaintiff's mark.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">           (b) It is not necessary for the Plaintiff to actually show
           the presence of or sale of its products in India as long
           as it is able to establish that it enjoys a spill over
           reputation in India. In other words, the reputation of a
           product may precede its introduction and may exist
           without trade of the product in the country.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">           (c) The proof of reputation can be in the form of
           advertisements in the media and general awareness
           which in the modern day context would include
           advertisements or display on the internet and social
           media. The reputation must be shown to exist at the
           time the Defendant enters the market.

<p id="p_295">136. The plaintiff has sales in India and spent millions of dollars on
Research and development of its products in India. However, sales of
a mark have no relevance when there has been dishonest adoption of
a mark. This Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1789155/" id="a_62">Jolen Inc. v. Doctor &amp; Company</a>,

<p id="p_296">       As far as prior adoption and user is concerned, in the judgment

Ltd. v. Medical Technologies Ltd. and Ors</a>., 2015(64) PTC 225
(SC), the same aspect has been dealt with wherein by referring its
another decision in S. Syed Mohideen (supra) prior to the Neon's
case (supra), the Supreme Court held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">       "The 'first in the market' test has always enjoyed pre-
       eminence. We shall not burden this judgment by referring
       to the several precedents that can be found apposite to the
       subject. In the interest of prolixity we may mention only
       <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_64">N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a> (1996) 5 SCC 714 :
       1996(16) PTC 583 (<a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_65">SC) and Milmet Oftho Industries v.
       Allergan Inc</a>. (2004) 12 SCC 624. In Whirlpool, the
       worldwide prior user was given preference nay
       predominance over the registered trademark in India of
       the defendant. In Milmet, the marks of pharmaceutical
       preparation were similar but the prior user worldwide had
       not registered its mark in India whereas its adversary had
       done so. This Court approved the grant of an injunction in
       favour of the prior user. Additionally, in the recent decision
       in <a href="/doc/127697258/" id="a_66">S. Syed Mohiden v. P. Sulochana Bai</a> (2015) 7 SCALE
       136, this Court has pithily underscored that the rights in a
       passing-off action emanate from common law and not from
       statutory provisions, nevertheless the prior user's rights
       will override those of a subsequent user even though it had
       been accorded registration of its trademark. Learned
       Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant has endeavoured to
       minimize the relevance of Whirlpool as well as Milmet by
       drawing the distinction that those trademarks had attained
       worldwide reputation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_73">             However, we think that as world shrinks almost to

        have ever increasing importance. At the present stage, the
       argument in favour of the Defendant-Appellant that we find
       holds more water is that in both Milmet and Whirlpool, as
       distinct from the case before us, the prior user of the
       successful party predated the date of application for
       registration of the competing party.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">             The question to examine, then, would be whether
       prior user would have to be anterior to the date of
       application or prior to the user by the Defendant-Appellant.
       In other words, the question before the Court would
       remain whether the situation on the date of application for
       registration alone would be relevant, or whether the
       developments in the period between this date and the date
       of grant of registration would have any bearing on the
       rights of the parties. All these considerations will be cast
       into a curial cauldron to be appreciated by the Court before
       which the suit is being contested. In these premises, we
       cannot conclude that a prima facie case has not been
       disclosed by the Plaintiff-Respondents."

its advertisement in the newspapers, media circulation, expatriate
reputation due to cultural akinness and all other relevant factors which
connect one country's business with that of another. It has been
explained by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_67">N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, AIR 1995 Delhi 300 wherein
the concept of trans-border reputation was approved in the following

       The knowledge and the awareness of the goods of a
       foreign trade and its trademark can be available at a place
       where goods are not being marketed and consequently not

reconsidered in the case of <a href="/doc/1913188/" id="a_69">Allergan Inc. v. Milment Oftho
Industries</a>, 1999 PTC (19) (DB) 160 wherein Ruma Pal, J. has
carefully analyzed the interplay between the goodwill and reputation in
a case of passing off action and has laid down that the Courts in India
have followed the third approach which is a middle path wherein strict
insistence of localized business is not necessary. However, reputation
which is sought to be protected has to be substantial one having
global character. The observation made by the Hon'ble Judge is as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">       "13. Reputation is the connection that the public makes
       between a particular product or service and a particular
       source which may or may not be known. Some Courts
       have held that reputation which is built up on the basis of
       trade within the country is entitled to protection from
       passing off. Others Court have made some concession to
       the communication explosion and held that if the plaintiff
       has a reputation in another country, his right to the mark
       will be protected if it is coupled with some actual or
       proposed business activity within the country (See Alain
       Beniardin et Cie v. Pavilion Properties, (1967) RFC 581;
       Amway Corporation. v. Eurway Int. Ltd. (1974) RFC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_77">       82."Still other Courts have held that with the increase in
       international commerce, mass media communications and
       the frequency of the foreign travel, political and geographic
       boundaries do not stem the exchange of ideas and instant
       information. Local business is not an essential ingredient of
       a passing off action. However, the reputation must be well
       established or a known one See : Panhard et Levassor v.
       Panhard Motor Co. Ltd., (1901) 18 RPC 405; Sheraton


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 79 of 121</span>

       Canadian Patent Reporter 433; Vitamins L. D.'s Application
       for Trademark, 1956 (1) RPC 1. The decisions which reflect
       the first and second view have so held for reasons which
       are partly historic, partly geographic and partly because
       reputation was equated with goodwill. Goodwill has been
       defined as the benefit derived from reputation. It is not the
       reputation required to found a passing off action. The law
       of passing off is not trammelled by definitions of goodwill
       developed in the field of revenue law [per <a href="/doc/1831577/" id="a_70">Hockhart J.,
       Conagra Inc. v. McCain Foods (Aust) P. Ltd</a>., 1993 (23) IPR
       193 231]. It is an asset of a business assessable in terms
       of money and transferable (See IRC v. Muller, (1901) AC
       217, Trego v. Hunt (1896) AC 7; ITC v. B.C. Srinivas
       Shetty. In my opinion reputation framing the basis of a
       passing off action need not be so localised. Whatever the
       compulsion for the Courts taking the first or second view in
       other countries, as far as this country is concerned, Courts
       in India prescribe to the third view and have held that a
       plaintiff  with    a   reputation    which     is  established
       internationally can sue to protect it in this country even if it
       does not have any business activity here. In other words
       reputation of a product may precede its introduction and
       may exist without trade in such product in the country. <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_71">See

decisions over the years such as in Milmet Oftho Industries (supra)

 PRIUS had already attained global fame since its display in Tokyo
Motor Show in 1995 and subsequent launch in Japan in the year 1997.

       countries is sufficient if the trademark has established its
       reputation and goodwill in the country of its origin and
       countries where it is registered."

<p id="p_302">142. In the case of Daimler Benzaktiegesellschaft and Anr. v
Eagle Flask Industries Ltd., AIR 1994 Delhi 239, this Court has held
as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">      "15. The Trademark Law is not intended to protect a
       person who deliberately sets out to take the benefit of
       somebody else's reputation with reference to goods,
       especially when the reputation extends world-wide. By no
       stretch of imagination can it be said that use for any length
       of time of the name "Benz" should be not objected to."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_303">143. This Court, while recognizing the principles of trans-border
reputation in India, gave another criteria by which such reputation can
be held to have been successfully established in the case of <a href="/doc/178357243/" id="a_74">Kiran

        designers. It is this which seems to have awakened the
       appellants-defendants to think of utilizing the trademark
       BUDDHA-BAR as it has failed to give any other justification
       as to how it deciphered the mark BUDDHA-BAR."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_304">144. At the time of final arguments advanced in the present case, the
defendants contended that the documents filed by the plaintiffs were
insufficient to establish trans-border reputation, the plaintiff has only
very few documents prior to the year 2001 (the year of adoption of
the mark PRIUS) by the defendants which were filed by the
defendants. The said documents being newspaper articles were
insufficient to establish trans-border reputation.
</p>
<p id="p_305">145. The said argument of the defendants has no force and is not
tenable as the plaintiff has filed sufficient documents in the present
proceedings to establish trans-border reputation on account of prior
adoption and use of the marks.
</p>
<p id="p_306">146. Upon learning of the defendants' two registrations for the PRIUS
trademark, the plaintiff proceeded to file rectification petitions against
such trademarks. The following documents have been filed by the
plaintiff, in support of the rectification proceedings initiated against the
defendants' trademarks.

 147. The      defendants have    given contradictory   justifications for
adopting the trademark PRIUS in relation to their business.       On the
</pre><p id="p_307">one hand, the written statement attributes the adoption of PRIUS as
the defendants were the first to manufacture 'Add on Chrome Plated
Accessories'.     However, on the other hand, the evidence affidavit of
Mr.Deepak Mangal attributes the adoption of the trademark PRIUS to
an additional reason of the defendant No. 3 firm being his 'first joint
venture' with Mr.Prem Kumar Verma.
</p>
<p id="p_308">148. The explanation given for not choosing to adopt 'Pehla Prayas'
as the trademark of the defendants was that it was not stylish and
catchy enough.        The following are the answers given by DW-1 to

       having chosen Pehle Prayas. Why did you not chose
       the expression Pehla Prayas as your trademark?
       A. 117 Since this was our first effort or Pehla Prayaas in
       the field of manufacturing and the idea of manufacturing
       add-on chrome plated accessories was well ahead of that
       time as nobody else was manufacturing these types of
       accessories for the After Market so we looked for a word

</blockquote><p id="p_310">149. The defendants' choice of choosing the Latin word PRIUS came
only after the defendants sought to look for an English equivalent of
the term 'Pehla Prayas' coined in Hindi as evident from the response
given by DW-1 to Questions 121 -126:
</p><p id="p_311">Cross - Examination of Defendant's witness DW 1 on March 29,

to be mere afterthoughts.

<p id="p_313">       DW-1 denied having sued the plaintiff or to file the counter-claim

www.priusauto.com was also registered for the first time in 2011, i.e.
two years after the institution of the present suit. DW-1 has replied
the following questions in his cross-examination:-

<p id="p_315">152. Mr. Deepak Mangal had further stated that the accessories
manufactured by the defendant are made in such a manner that they
are bound to match with genuine parts as appears from Question 105,
of deposition of DW - 1:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_317">153. However, upon being asked as to how did Mr. Mangal determine
whether the parts he purchases are genuine parts of an automobile,
Mr. Mangal answered that such knowledge is sourced from the fact
that the defendants are situated in Kashmiri Gate, which is also called
the 'After Market'.

<p id="p_319">154. When he was confronted with documents pertaining to the
frequent Police Raids that occur in Kashmere Gate market on account
of the numerous spurious and counterfeit automobile parts sold
therein. Ex.DW-1/P9 to Ex.DW-1/P12 contain the extracts showing
frequent raids at Kashmere Gate, Delhi for counterfeit auto parts.
</p>
<p id="p_320">155. He was also confronted with a presentation from Mahindra and
Mahindra (with whom the defendants have an active business
relationship)     highlighting   the   large   number   of   raids   regarding
counterfeit auto parts at Kashmere Gate. Ex.DW-1/P9 extracts from
the website of Mahindra and Mahindra disclosed the same.
</p>
<p id="p_321">156. However, upon being inquired as to his knowledge regarding the
frequent raids conducted at Kashmere Gate, Delhi; Mr. Mangal stated
that he had no awareness of any such raids. Mr. Mangal's lack of
knowledge regarding such raids is more shocking especially as the
defendants claim to supply accessories to Mahindra and Mahindra.
</p>
<p id="p_322">157. It is also evident that the defendants were aware of the
plaintiff's trademarks as Mr.Sandeep Verma's (defendant No.2) Father
(Mr.Prem Kumar Verma) was in the auto trade since the early 1990s
and helped the defendants set up their business under the mark
PRIUS. (Qs. 23, 33 to 37 of DW-1's deposition)

        Q 34: Please go back to the answer you gave in

</p><p id="p_329">       A. 37: He helped us financially also."
</p>
<p id="p_330">158. The defendants are trying to justify their adoption of the
trademark 'PRIUS' on account of them being first in India to
manufacture 'Add on Chrome Plated Accessories'.        The defendants
contend that they first conceptualized this attempt as PRAYAS and
while researching found the word "Prius" meaning "to come first".
Actually, the defendants have taken different stand about the adoption
of the mark PRIUS.      It appears to the Court clearly that since the
defendants are in the same trade and knowledge of foreign mark can
be gathered in a short span of time, thus, it is difficult to accept the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                        Page 89 of 121</span>
 justification given by the defendants that they were not aware about
the plaintiff's mark PRIUS in overseas countries and more particularly,
the defendants and father of defendant No.1 prior to adoption and
user were dealing with the other trademarks of the plaintiff. Thus, the
reason for adoption by the defendants is merely an after-thought on
part of the defendants and the justification is farfetched and in
defiance of common sense.
</p>
<p id="p_331">159. The defendants, in fact, have totally failed to justify about the
adoption of the mark. Thus, their adoption and user was not bonafide
and they must be aware about the mark PRIUS of the plaintiff at the
time of adoption. Therefore, the entire user is not honest and it has to
be treated as in bad faith.
</p>
<p id="p_332">160. In light of the above, it is clear that Mr. Mangal's testimony that
his experience in the trade coupled with Kashmere Gate being the
'After Market' gives him enough expertise to tell the difference
between a spurious and a genuine auto-part is untenable on account
of the fact that there are frequent police raids against counterfeiting of
auto-parts at the Kashmere Gate market.
</p>
<p id="p_333">161. Further, second witness DW-2 Mr. Sunil Kumar in spite of having
worked previously with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (with whom the
defendants have an active business relationship), claims to have no
knowledge about PRIUS despite the Reva Car (acquired by Mahindra &amp;
Mahindra)being exhibited alongside the PRIUS car globally at various
conferences as far as back in 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_334">162. The defendants' third witness DW-3 Mr. Inderjit Singh also filed
his evidence affidavit without conducting any market survey or
investigation studies in the automobile industry or even collect data
from different institutes/government bodies on industry perspectives.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 90 of 121</span>
<p id="p_335"> Without having conducted any research and without any basis he
states that 'nobody is ever confused' between original and counterfeit
parts. In fact, he admitted to signing the affidavit in the Counsel's
office and not in the presence of a notary public.
</p><p id="p_336">163. PW-1 has not denied the fact in his cross-examination that
PRIUS car was launched in India in January, 2010 and prior to that in
2009, the plaintiff decided to register the trademark in India and on
the basis of a search report, the plaintiff came across the defendants'
mark in class-12 and first time discovered the same. But at the same
time in his cross-examination, he denied that the defendants are the
prior users for the reason that in 1997, PRIUS as the first hybrid
vehicle in the world was launched and it was highly appreciated
through different     magazines and    newspapers     and other      media
attracting attention of all different sources. The defendants during the
cross-examination tried to point out that complete text of article is not
filed, however, he referred the TOYOTA website and other documents
including trademarks registration certificates of other countries in
order to establish that the mark PRIUS was adopted and used by the
plaintiff prior to the defendants and as a matter of fact, it has been
proved.     He also refused and denied the factum of having seen the
advertisements of the defendants from the year 2004. He specially
gave the answer to question No.85 that he did not know.
</p>
<p id="p_337">164. It appears from the statement of witnesses, particularly, the
testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 that various objections were raised at
the time of exhibiting the documents. Firstly, the plaintiff has filed the
affidavit in the prescribed manner under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_75">Section 65B</a> of the Evidence
Act. Even if the said documents are ignored for the sake of arguments
as objected by the defendants, still this Court is of the opinion that

 there is other clear and cogent evidence available to establish that the
plaintiff has been able to prove that the plaintiff is the prior adopter
and user of the mark PRIUS in various countries of the world and from
the documents filed it has been proved in evidence, that the case of
trans-border goodwill and reputation is established beyond any doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_338">165. As far as common fields of activities of business of two parties
are concerned, though it is not argued on behalf of the defendants
that there could not be any confusion and deception, rather the
defendants' claim is that they are the first user and prior adopter and
user of the mark in question.          Even otherwise, law in this regard is
quite settled.

<p id="p_339">     (i)   In the case of <a href="/doc/446828/" id="a_76">Essel Packaging Ltd. v. Essel Tea Exports
           Ltd</a>., 1999 PTC (19) 521, the High Court of Bombay held
           that common field of activity is not conclusive for deciding
           whether there can be passing off action, although at one
           point of time the said test was treated as conclusive. It was
           held that with the passage of time the law of requirement of
           common field of activity in a passing off action has
           undergone a radical change and as such there was no
           requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim
           on passing off action, because the real question in each of
           such       cases   is,   whether   there   is,   as   a   result       of
           misrepresentation, a real likelihood of confusion or deception
           of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiff is likely
           to be caused and if that is taken to be the test then the focus
           is shifted from the external objective test of making
           comparison of activities of the parties, to the state of mind of
           public, in deciding whether it will be confused.

               cases the two competing trademarks were absolutely
               identical which is not the case here. But that in our
               opinion makes no difference. The absolute identity of
               the two competing marks or their close resemblance
               is only one of the tests for determining the question
               of likelihood of deception or confusion. Trade
               connection between different goods is another such
               test. Ex hypothesis, this latter test applies only when
               the goods are different. These tests are independent
               tests. There is no reason why the test of trade
               connection between different goods should not apply
               where the competing marks closely resemble each
               other just as much as it applies, as held in the "Black
               Magic" and "Panda" cases, where the competing

               House of Lords because Lord Denning had also
               observed that the defendants would have no defence

               honest and that conclusion of Lord Denning is also
               approved by Lord Devlin who was in minority. Mr.
               Tulzapurkar submitted that in the present case, there
               is a specific evidence on record that the word "Bajaj"
               was used by the defendants dishonestly and

               reputation earned by the plaintiffs. The learned

                counsel referred to us to a passage at p. 408 in
               Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names, Twelfth
               Edition, and submitted that once intent to deceive is
               established, then the defendants could not claim that
               they were entitled to use word "Bajaj" as a trading
               sign. In support of the submission, the learned
               counsel invited our attention to the brochure (Ex. 'G'
               annexed to the plaint) wherein the defendants have
               claimed that Bajaj quality is well accepted and
               appreciated internationally. Mr. Tulzapurkar points
               out and it is not in dispute that the defendants have
               never marketed their goods abroad, nor have they
               even claimed that their goods are sold all over the
               country. Mr. Tulzapurkar is right and we agree with
               the learned trial Judge that the brochure published in
               the year 1987 is issued with a view to cause
               deception or confusion in the mind of the customers.
               The word 'Bajaj' has quite a great reputation in the
               country and abroad and the publication of the
               brochure in year 1987 clearly indicates that the
               defendants were not honest in the use of the word
               "Bajaj" and an attempt was made to pass off their
               goods with the mark "Bajaj" with the intention to
               secure advantage of the reputation earned by the
               plaintiffs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_108">                      The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar was
               controverted by Mr. Cooper by urging that the goods
               manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants
               are totally different and, therefore, there is no cause
               or apprehension that the use of the word "Bajaj" is
               likely to cause deception or confusion in the mind of
               the public. Mr. Cooper submitted that the articles
               manufactured by the defendants are utensils and
               those marketed by the plaintiffs are electrical goods
               or appliances and, therefore, it is unlikely that the
               purchasers of utensils would be confused by the use
               of the word "Bajaj" on the articles of the defendants.
               The learned counsel submitted that the plaintiffs'
               goods are sold under registered mark under Class
               11, while the goods manufactured by the defendants
               fall under Class 21. Class 11 refers to installations for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                             Page 94 of 121</span>
                lighting, heating, steam generating, cooking,
               refrigerating, drying, ventilating, and other purposes,
               while Class 21 refers to small domestic utensils and
               containers (not of precious metal nor coated
               therewith). The submission of Mr. Cooper is that as
               the articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the
               defendants are different, the question of deception
               would not arise. It is not possible to accept the
               submission. The articles manufactured by the
               plaintiffs and the defendants are kitchen wares and
               are commonly used in almost every kitchen in this
               country.      The   mere    fact    that   the   articles
               manufactured by the contesting parties are different
               in nature is no answer to the claim that the
               defendants are guilty of passing off. We entirely
               agree with the conclusion recorded by the learned
               trial Judge that there is identity of the goods, the
               mark and the consumer and the goods manufactures
               by both the plaintiffs and the defendants are sold
               under one shop. Mr. Cooper complained that the
               electric goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the
               stainless steel utensils manufactured by the
               defendants are not sold in one shop. The submission
               is not accurate because it is common experience that
               kitchen ware or kitchen appliances like mixers,
               grinders, pressure cookers, and stainless steel
               utensils are sold in the same shop. At this interim
               stage, we are not prepared to accept the submission
               of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no reason to
               take      different  view     from      that   of     the
               learned single Judge on this aspect. In our judgment,
               prima facie, it is clear that the defendants have
               intentionally and dishonestly tried to pass off their
               goods by use of name "Bajaj"."

<p id="p_342">166. The confusion caused between the plaintiff and the defendants is
inevitable    because    the   defendants    makes    use   of   an    identical
trademark and name (PRIUS) in relation to identical and related
products (accessories and spare parts for automobiles) having the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                              Page 95 of 121</span>
 identical market (car-owners wanting to purchase spare parts and
accessories).
</p>
<p id="p_343">167. The plaintiff also advertises its products and services under the
trademark PRIUS in leading automobile magazines and journals of
India. Interestingly, the plaintiff itself advertises its automobiles and
other products under the trademark TOYOTA in the same journals in
India. This was also recognized by this Court in its order dated 19th
March,       2010.    Therefore,   any   person   upon   viewing       such
advertisements of the defendants using the marks TOYOTA, PRIUS,
INNOVA and TOYOTA DEVICE is bound to be misled into believing that
</p><p id="p_344">       (i)   The goods and services of the defendants actually emanate
             from the plaintiff instead; or

</p><p id="p_345">       (ii) A nexus exists between the plaintiff or the defendants; or
</p><p id="p_346">       (iii) The plaintiff has licensed the use of its trademarks to the
             defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_347">168. In light of the fact that the plaintiff is the true and first
proprietor of the well-known mark PRIUS all across the world, as well
as in India and that the defendants' adoption of the mark PRIUS is
blatantly dishonest, the defendants are guilty of passing off their
goods and services as those of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_348">169. If the entire object of the Trademark Law is examined, it is
obvious that the date of adoption of the mark by a party is the
relevant date. In case, on the date of adoption, it is found that he was
aware about the mark of the rightful owner, the using of the said mark
and filing of the application in the Trademarks office is fraudulent. As
dishonesty starts from the beginning itself, the subsequent user is to
be considered as tainted, as the party was aware that the mark
actually belongs to other party and he is not the owner of the same.
It is totally immaterial if the registration is objected to a copied mark


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 96 of 121</span>
 of a party who adopted and used the mark at earlier point of time.
There is not much difference, if the registration is obtained on the
basis of non-filing of opposition. The main reason is that it is for the
Court to decide the common law remedy wherein the interim order can
be passed. The Trademarks Registry or the Appellate Board are not
empowered to pass an interim order against the party who has
appropriated the mark deliberately.
</p>
<p id="p_349">170. In the matter of an application brought by J.R. Parkingnon and
Co. Ltd., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at page 181 that "in my judgment, the
circumstances which attend the adoption of a trademark in the first
instance are of considerable importance when one comes to consider
whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest user. If
the user in its inception was tainted it would be difficult in most cases
to purify it subsequently". It was further noted by the learned Judge
in that case that he could not regard the discreditable origin of the
user as cleansed by the subsequent history."
</p>
<p id="p_350">171. The party who has appropriated the mark cannot claim the
benefit of concurrent user      because    the   governing   principle        of
concurrent user lies on account of honesty. It is also immaterial if the
defendant has filed the application prior in time or claiming as its
owner of the mark by way of user as proposed to be used if the mark
is already known, adopted and used in overseas countries prior in
time. The filing of such application is to be treated as fraudulent act by
a party. The stolen property can never become rightful property in this
manner.
</p>
<p id="p_351">172. From the evidence adduced by the defendant Nos. 1 to 3, it is
clear in my mind that the defendants have been using the PRIUS as a
trade name/corporate name from the year 2001-2002 as M/s Prius


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                          Page 97 of 121</span>
 Auto Industries, the firm started its business in April, 2001 in which
PRIUS formed part of its trading style. As far as mark PRIUS is
concerned, the first application for registration of trademarks was filed
on 13th March, 2002 and second application on 2nd January, 2003. It
appears to the Court that the defendant Nos.1 to 3 at least started
using the trademark since the year 2002-2003. The defendant No.4
was incorporated and commenced its business in the year 2006. At the
best, if the user claimed by the defendants is taken as correct, still it is
apparent on the face of the record that it is the plaintiff who adopted
and used the mark PRIUS prior in time in overseas countries. The
plaintiff has placed large number of documents to show that prior to
adoption and use of mark PRIUS by the defendants, the plaintiff has
used the product in many countries of the world, even the plaintiff has
filed application for registration of the same mark prior to the alleged
use of the defendants.     Not only that, the plaintiff has been able to
prove before this Court by way of documentary evidence that the
mark PRIUS has been advertised in many ways by way of publication
of articles, seminar held and in the magazines which are available in
India, directly or indirectly. If the entire evidence produced by the
plaintiff is examined even in a casual manner, the same speak that it
is the plaintiff who is the owner/proprietor of the mark PRIUS. The
defendants, under no circumstances, can allege that it is the
defendants who adopted or used the mark PRIUS first time in the
world. The bonafide claim of the defendants becomes more doubtful
when it has come in evidence that the father of the Managing Partner
i.e. defendant No.1 was aware about the goodwill and reputation of
the trademarks of the plaintiff. The father of Mr.Deepak Mangal was
dealing with the parts of Toyota and its device; the firm of the father



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                           Page 98 of 121</span>
 was closed and the present firm M/s Prius Auto Industries was started
in 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_352">173. The explanation given by defendants No.1 to 3 about bonafide
adoption is not trustworthy.       It may be true that at the time of
adoption of mark PRIUS as trade name and later on by filing of
applications for registration of trademark, the plaintiff may not be
using the mark PRIUS in India but the cars of the plaintiff were
available in many countries on that date and year. People are rightly
mentioning for the last many years that the world is becoming very
small. The goodwill, name and reputation can travel in other countries
even within less than a period of one month. In the present case, the
plaintiff adopted the mark in the year 1990 and started using it in
1995-96, when the defendants were not in the trade at all. When the
mark was adopted or used by the defendants, the plaintiff had already
taken many steps to launch the car in other countries prior to five
years than the defendants' use. The defendants have been giving lame
excuses from time to time changing its stand in order to show
bonafide adoption which, in fact, seems to be untrue, as the
defendants and father of defendant No.1 were earlier aware about the
trademarks of the plaintiff.      It appears to the Court that it was
systematically moved by the defendants to start the firm as well as to
adopt the identical trademarks. The conduct of the defendants would
speak for itself.     It is a matter of record that despite of directions
issued by the Division Bench of this Court in appeal, the defendants
did not respect the orders by complying with the same. When the
main suit was heard after more than 4 years, it was pointed out the
evidence filed by the plaintiff to the defendants that they have been
using TOYOTA, its device and INNOVA as trademarks and not in a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                         Page 99 of 121</span>
 manner directly by the Division Bench.    The counsel very reluctantly
made the statement on behalf of the defendants that they would
change the same. Even as of today, the plaintiff is not aware as to
whether the defendants have changed or not the packaging in view of
the orders of Division Bench. Even statements of accounts were
regularly filed by the defendants as directed by the Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_353">174. It is correct that the suit was filed in 2009 i.e. after about 6-7
years from the date of user of trademark and trade name by the
defendant Nos.1 to 3.     As far as defendant No.4 is concerned, it
commenced its business in 2006. No cogent and clear evidence has
been produced by the defendants that the plaintiff was positively
aware about their activities.     During this period, no doubt, the
defendants obtained the registration of the trademark PRIUS.           The
plaintiff's rectification to cancel the trademark is pending.    Had the
plaintiff was aware about the use of the mark PRIUS of the defendants
prior to 2008-09, the plaintiff could have opposed the marks of the
defendants under <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_79">Section 21</a> of the Act.     Rather, it proves that the
plaintiff was unaware about the activities of the defendants.         Mere
products of both the parties published in the same Auto Journal do not
prove about the positive knowledge of the plaintiff and no benefit can
be derived by the defendants on this aspect.

</blockquote><p id="p_355">176. Having gone through the said judgments, it appears to the Court
that none of the judgments would help the case of the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_356">177. In the case of Veerumal Praveen Kumar (supra), the
injunction was refused by the Division Bench merely on the ground
that despite of registration, the trademark was not used for decades
together. The Court held that if there was a non-user for a long period
of time, the mark would lose its distinctiveness or is permitted to die
for non-user of the same. The said order was passed while considering
the appeal filed in the injunction application. The facts in the present
case are totally distinct. It is not a case of the defendants themselves
that the trademarks TOYOTA, Toyota Device and PRIUS are been used
in overseas countries and in India.            It is the admitted case of the
defendants      that   the   plaintiff   has   used   the   trademark     PRIUS
continuously in India after 2009-2010. Thus, the facts are materially
different.

<p id="p_357">         In the case of Rhizome Distilleries P. Ltd. and Ors. (supra),
the Court was of the opinion that the two trademarks are not
deceptively similar and secondly in para 27 of the said judgment, it is
held by the Division Bench that there are several other manufacturers
who exist of the word IMPERIAL.        Therefore, the injunction was not
granted in the said case.       There is no such position in the present
case.
</p>
<p id="p_358">        The facts of UAS Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd. (supra) are quite
different. In para 23 of the said judgment, the Court had come to the
conclusion that the filing of the sales achieved by the plaintiff
worldwide over a period of 7 years was only about USD$470,000.
However, the plaintiff has been able to achieve the said turnover after
spending about USD$180,000.           Therefore, it was not possible to
achieve the claim of the plaintiff with regard to trans-border
reputation. The said facts are quite distinct from the facts of the
present case.         In the present case, admittedly, the goodwill and
reputation have already been established by the plaintiff under the
impugned trademark PRIUS which is unique and residual in million of
rupees.     Further, the test while deciding the interim application and
the main suit is different. While deciding the interim application, the
balance of convenience has to be struck between the parties and one
of the factors at that time was relevant that whether the plaintiff was
entitled for injunction.     Under these reasons, the Court did not pass
the order in the said case. In the present case, the plaintiff has been
able to establish prior adoption and user of the trademarks. Further all
the trademarks used by the defendants are the same.

 trans-border goodwill and reputation the plaintiffs have relied upon
materials published in the dental journal which admittedly has very
restricted circulation.     Mere publication of such advertisement and
materials in dental journal cannot and would not establish a trans-
border reputation.        Such reputation, if any, was confined to a
particular class of people i.e. the persons subscribing to the said
specialized journals and cannot be said to be extended to the general
consumers."

injunction as the Court held that there was no sufficient evidence of
use of trademark ROCA.            Even the evidence on the basis of trans-
border reputation cannot be taken into consideration.                Facts in the
present case are materially different. Admittedly, despite of the order
passed by the Division Bench passed at the time of interim stage, the
defendant has been breaching the said order by using of the mark
Toyota Device and INNOVA as a trademark as is evident from the
evidence produced by the plaintiff. The said use was contrary to the
direction passed by the Division Bench. It is an undisputed fact that
the trademark TOYOTA and TOYOTA Device have been used in India
for the last three decades, even when the defendants No.3 and 4 were
not incorporated. There was a direct use of the said trademarks. The
trademark PRIUS has been used in many countries of the world. The
plaintiff has been able to establish the trans-border reputation by
virtue of the evidence produced before this Court.              Therefore, the
facts are quite different in the present case. The said case was also
decided     on    the   interim    application.   The   situation,    facts   and

 particularly in trademarks matter that each matter depends upon its
own facts. In the trademarks cases, the Court has to see the overall
conduct of the party. In the present case, the defendants have not
only disobeyed the order of the Division Bench but have also earned
undue profits by using five trademarks of the plaintiff knowingly and
intentionally.

<p id="p_361">       The case of Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. (supra) is not
applicable which was based purely on striking the balance between the
parties and the injunction was refused on the basis of non-user. The
trademark ARROW could not be used by the plaintiff on the ground of
being Government Policy import instruction.     On the other hand, the
defendant was using the trademark for the many years when the suit
was filed. The plea was taken by the defendant about the non-user of
the trademark in India.     The said government policy was later on
relaxed. In the case of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_90">N.R. Dongre and Ors. v. Whirlpool Corpn.

been accepted after the relaxation of the policy.

<p id="p_362">       The case of Exide Industries Ltd. (supra) is not applicable. As
a matter of fact, the main suit filed by the plaintiff was decreed
against the defendant bearing the trademark EXIDE which was being
used by the plaintiff in India. The defendant No.1 in the counter claim
claimed prior user of the trademark EXIDE in India since 1st
September, 1902 till about 1950. There was an agreement between
the parties whereby some parts of the countries of the world were
allotted to the defendants and after 1950 defendant No.1 did not use
the trademark existed in India.     When the defendant No.1 tried to
introduce its products in India in the year 1997 suit for infringement of
trademark was filed by the plaintiff disclosing all the facts that the

 defendant No.1 did not any right to use the trademark EXIDE in India
in view of the agreement arrived at between the parties. On the other
hand, the stand of the defendant was that during the period from
1902 to 1950 the said trademark EXIDE in India there was no division
between the parties.     Therefore, the defendant tried to take the
advantage of the said user claiming i.e. as the prior user, the Court did
not accept the argument of the defendant and passed the decree for
permanent injunction against the defendant.       Thus, the facts in the
present case are totally different. The finding of the Court did not help
the case of the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_363">       The judgment of The Gillette Company and Ors. (supra) is
not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. The
main trademark of the defendant was EKCO FLEXGRIP. The FLEXGRIP
was the generic name used by both the parties.           The Court had
already come to the conclusion that two trademarks EKCO FLEXGRIP
and LUXOR MAT FLEXGGRIP were not similar. One of the factors was
that the FLEXGRIP was not used by the plaintiff in India. Therefore,
while striking the balance between the parties, the injunction was not
granted. The facts are totally different in the present case. Here the
trademark used by the defendants is identical. All the trademarks of
the plaintiff were adopted prior to the use by the defendants.         The
trademark TOYOTA, Toyota Device and INNOVA are admittedly used in
India by the plaintiff prior to the defendants.    As far as trademark
PRIUS is concerned, the same was used in many countries except in
India. In India, the plaintiff was able to prove its case to show that
the trans-border reputation has travelled by virtue of magazines,
articles and interviews prior to the date of the user claimed by the
defendants.

<p id="p_364">        Under these circumstances, the judgments referred by the
defendants are totally different and distinct from the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_365">178. Even otherwise, if the party is guilty of flagrant and rank case of
dishonesty and the Court finds that the date of adoption is tainted, the
entire user would become dishonest and such adoption and user is to
be treated as in bad faith.   If on the date of filing of application for
registration of the same mark with the knowledge of the party that it
belongs to another one, the filing of application for registration, the
claim of ownership has to be rejected as per scheme and object of the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_366">       Under these circumstances, as explained, I am clear in my mind
that the defendants have adopted the trademark/name PRIUS with the
sole intention of enjoying the benefits that flow from the tremendous
reputation and goodwill that exists in favour of the plaintiff's identical
trademark. The defendants were well aware of the tremendous
international reputation and goodwill acquired by the plaintiff in the
trademark PRIUS and have no apparent justification for adopting the
said mark. The fact that the defendants were aware of the plaintiff's
trademarks, is well evidenced from the deposition of the defendants'
witnesses, which highlights the defendants' clear awareness of the
plaintiff's hybrid car PRIUS in light of numerous events prior to 2001.
A timeline representing the defendants' knowledge of the plaintiff's
trademark PRIUS has been handed over during the course of the final
arguments.

of the trademark SIFY as untenable and stated that "....The doubtful

case of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of
Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, reported in
(2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Supreme Court while considering a plea
of passing off and grant of ad-interim injunction held in no uncertain
terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services under a
trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by
the Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
services in the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to
the business of one who has the property in that name. It was held
that honesty and fair play are and ought to be the basic policy in the
world of business and when a person adopts or intends to adopt a
name which already belongs to someone else, it results in confusion,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                        Page 107 of 121</span>
 has the propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone
else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.
</p>
<p id="p_370">182. It was also held in Laxmikant V. Patel (supra) that the
principles which apply to trademark are applicable to trade name also.
Para 10 of the aforesaid judgment reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">       "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business
       in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients
       in believing that his goods or services belonging to
       someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
       not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently
       or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
       play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
       business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
       adopt a name in connection with his business or services
       which already belongs to someone else it results in
       confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers
       and clients of someone else to himself and thereby
       resulting in injury."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_118">       In this case, the Supreme Court further observed that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_119">       "Where there is probability of confusion in business, an
       injunction will be granted even though the defendants
       adopted the name innocently."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_371">183. Therefore, such confusion caused in the minds of the consumers
and members of the trade alike between the plaintiff and the
defendants, owing to the defendants' illegal and unauthorized adoption
and use of the trademark PRIUS amounts to an action of passing off.
The use of the mark by the defendants as per settled law is not
protected despite of registered trademark in their favour.      The most
closet case in the facts and circumstances of the case is <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_91">N.R. Dongre
v. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, (1996) 5 SCC 714 wherein the trademark
Whirlpool was a dictionary word; it was appropriated by the

 defendants in India.     It was the defendants who used the said
trademark Whirlpool in India.
</p>
<p id="p_372">       The defendants in the matter Whirlpool (supra) also obtained
the registrations of the trademarks.    Upon information, the plaintiff
filed the rectification as well as filed the suit for passing off.     The
injunction was granted up to the Supreme Court. The plaintiff in the
above said matter has been able to establish the classic case of
passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_373">184. The plaintiff has discharged its burden by proving its case of
passing off beyond any doubt. Thus, both issues are decided against
the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_374">185. I shall now discuss the matter on issue No.4 which reads as
under:-
</p>
<p id="p_375">       Whether the suit suffers from delay, latches and
       acquiescence? OPD

</p><p id="p_376">186. Normally, thumb rule is that the plaintiff must file an action as
early as possible whenever infringement is noticed by the plaintiff
whose legal rights are violated. The defence of latches or inordinate
delay is a defence in equity.   An equitable defence can be put by a
party who has acted fairly and honestly.       If the plaintiff had no
knowledge of its infringement of rights, he cannot lose his right. Even
delay by itself cannot be said to amount to consent waiver or
acquiescence or estoppel.    If the plaintiff was not aware which has
been done by the defendant, benefit is always enjoyed by the
defendant during unnoticed period.     Delay in bringing the action is
mostly relevant at the time of considering the interim application. In
the main suit after trial, always the issue is whether the suit filed by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                       Page 109 of 121</span>
 the plaintiff is time barred or not.   Passing off action is one of the
facets of law of tort. <a href="/doc/371879/" id="a_92">Section 22</a> of Limitation Act, 1963 provides that
every act of tort gives to a party a fresh cause of action.
</p>
<p id="p_377">187. Latches and inordinate delay are not similar to acquiescence.
The consent of acquiescence has been explained by KERLY in the Law
of Trademarks and Trade Names, 310 (12th Edn., 1986), para 15.45.
The same reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">       "The classic case of acquiescence proper is where the
       proprietor, knowing of his rights and knowing that the
       infringer is ignorant of them, does something to encourage
       the infringer's misapprehension, with the result that the
       infringer acts upon bids mistaken belief and so worsens his
       position. It seems clear that something less than that is
       needed to offer a defence, but how much less is not clear.
       The current tendency is to hold that a defence of
       acquiescence or lakes may be set up whenever it is
       unconscionable for the plaintiff to deny anything that he
       (consciously or unconsciously) has allowed or encouraged
       the defendant to believe. Mere failure to sue, without some
       positive act of encouragement, is not in general enough to
       give a defence. A defendant who infringes knowing of the
       plaintiff's mark can hardly complain if he is later sued upon
       it, nor is a defendant who starts to infringe without
       searching the Register of Trademarks is any better position
       that if he had searched and so learned of the plaintiff's
       mark. Acts of the proprietor done in ignorance of the
       infringement, or even done without his own registration in
       mind, will not amount to acquiescence. A defence of
       estoppel by acquiescence is to be distinguished from a
       defence that by delay the mark has become publici juris."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_378">188. The plaintiff's conduct is free from blame if in order to curb the
menace of manufacture of goods which are blatant violation of
intellectual property intentionally and deliberately.    At that point of
time, it will always be proper for the Court to take into consideration




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                           Page 110 of 121</span>
 the interest of the general public in order to avoid any confusion and
deception.
</p>
<p id="p_379">189. It is the case of the plaintiff that it was first made aware of the
defendants in October 2009, when it came across the defendants'
trademark registrations for the mark PRIUS in class 12 bearing
registration number 1163954 and 1086682, upon conducting a search
on the website of the Trademarks Registry. It is stated that as soon
as the plaintiff gained knowledge of the said registrations by the
defendants, it filed rectification petitions against the defendants being
Ex.PW-2/21 &amp; PW-2/22. After filing the rectification proceedings, the
plaintiff had initiated the present suit for infringement and passing off
against the defendants before this Court. In the testimony of
witnesses, the similar statement is made. Even the defendants have
not filed any document supporting the fact that the plaintiff had prior
knowledge of the defendants or that the present suit suffers from
delay or latches or acquiescence.     An act of acquiescence involves a
positive act from the plaintiff, enabling the defendants or giving it the
impression that the plaintiff is aware of the violation of its rights and
despite such knowledge, permits the defendants from continuing with
such violation. From the defendants' evidence, no positive and cogent
evidence is produced in order to establish that the plaintiff was fully
aware about the defendants' activities prior to that or the date of user
claimed by the defendants. It is also a case of infringement as well as
passing off.      In trademark matters, every sale gives fresh cause of
action.    The question of delay, latches and acquiescence does not
arise. Even otherwise, it is the case where the defendants have used
four well-known trademarks of the plaintiff.         There is no valid
justification given. Thus, the delay is not fatal. In the present case,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                       Page 111 of 121</span>
 as soon as the plaintiff came to know the user in open market, the
plaintiff has asserted and sought to protect its rights from being
violated by the defendants by instituting the present suit before this
Court     and    by   initiating   rectification   proceedings    against      the
defendants' such steps would establish that the plaintiff was serious
about its right. The said issue is thus decided in favour of the plaintiff.
The defendants have failed to discharge their onus of proving issue
No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_380">190. As far as delay in filing of the suit is concerned, it is the admitted
position in law that action of passing off is one of the facets of law of
tort.   <a href="/doc/371879/" id="a_93">Section 22</a> of the Limitation Act provides that on every act of
tort, the fresh cause of action accrues. It is a recurring and continuous
cause of action. For example, if a person hits another person every
week under the law of tort, every week the person would have fresh
cause of action and limitation of three years under <a href="/doc/453721/" id="a_94">Article 88</a> of the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_95">Limitation Act</a> would occur. The question of latches and acquiescence
does not arise because firstly, there is no evidence that the plaintiff
was aware about the activities of defendant and secondly, the plaintiff
is carrying on its business outside India. The defendants failed to
discharge its burden by proving that the plaintiff had knowledge about
their business prior to 2006 as the suit was filed in 2009, nor it is the
case where the plaintiff has allowed the defendants to increase their
business while sitting out across the road watching the business of the
defendants. Even, it appears that the plaintiff was not aware about the
advertisements of the marks in Trademarks Journals, otherwise the
plaintiff could have opposed the same at that point itself. When the
plaintiff now can file the suit for infringement and passing off as well
as rectification who could have stopped them not to file the notice of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                              Page 112 of 121</span>
 opposition under <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_96">Section 21</a> of the Act, it shows the bonafide of the

Waterproof Manufacturing Co</a>., AIR 1997 SC 1398, it was held as
under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_121">       "20.........It is now well settled that an action for passing off
       is a common law remedy being an action in substance of
       deceit under the Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever
       fresh deceitful act is committed the person deceived would
       naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour. Thus
       every time when a person passes off his goods as those of
       another he commits the act of such deceit. Similarly
       whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a
       registered trademark of another he commits a recurring
       act of breach or infringement of such trademark giving a
       recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such
       infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree
       how in such a case when in historical past earlier suit was
       disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of
       proper relief, for all times to come in future defendant of
       such a suit should be armed with a license to go on
       committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off with
       impunity without being subjected to any legal action
       against such future acts."</blockquote>

<p id="p_382">       The ratio of the aforesaid decisions is squarely applicable to the
facts of the present case. Thus, the suit is not barred by time or there
is any delay, latches and acquiescence.

<p id="p_383">192. Issue No.8 is pertaining to concealment of facts if concealed by
the plaintiff. The same is reproduced here as under:

</blockquote><p id="p_384"> 193. The defendants have contended that the plaintiff has not
approached this Court with clean hands and that it has suppressed
material particulars relating to the registrations secured by the
defendants for their mark PRIUS in India. The defendants have failed
to produce any cogent and clear evidence to establish that the plaintiff
is guilty of concealment of fact. The defendants have merely assumed
when the marks of both the parties were published in the same
publication prior to 2009. However, the defendants have not produced
any independent witness who could depose that the plaintiff was
aware about the defendants' act prior to date of knowledge claimed.
It is only the argument that this Court draw inference in this regard
which is not permissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_385">194. Even, the plaintiff had disclosed the fact that the registrations
secured by the defendants were challenged by the plaintiff at the time
of securing the ex parte ad-interim injunction on 22nd December, 2009
since the order itself reads "...The Defendant is using the trademarks
TOYOTA, Toyota Device, INNOVA and PRIUS. The Plaintiff has filed the
rectification to the registered trademark obtained by the Defendant
No.3 in respect of auto parts and accessories."

<p id="p_386">195. The issue of awareness of user of marks has been discussed to
some extent while deciding the issue No.4. In view of the same, it
cannot be said that the plaintiff has concealed material particulars
from this Court in the absence of any cogent proof.
</p>
<p id="p_387">196. The defendants have failed in proving issue No. 8 in their favour,
hence, the same is decided against the defendants and in favour of
the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_388">197. Now, I shall deal with the last issue No.11, i.e. Relief.     In the
plaint, the plaintiff has sought the relief of damages in para 27(d) of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                       Page 114 of 121</span>
 the plaint.     However, during the course of hearing, the plaintiff has
pressed the restricted relief of punitive damages.
</p>
<p id="p_389">198. It is contended by the plaintiff that the plaintiff is not only
entitled to a relief of permanent injunction restraining infringement
and passing off, but also entitled to claim damages against the
defendants on account of the following factors:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_123">       (i)     Punitive damages as the defendants misrepresented to this
               Court that the use of the trademark TOYOTA, INNOVA,
               QUALIS         and     TOYOTA        DEVICE     was     honest      and       in
               consonance with practices in industrial and commercial
               matters.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_124">       (ii)    Punitive           damages    as     the   defendants       adopted       the
               trademark PRIUS solely to ride upon the goodwill and
               reputation of the plaintiff's world renowned automobile
               PRIUS;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_390">199. The       defendants           conducted      business    under       the   plaintiff's
trademark PRIUS and have expanded their business from being a
small business firm to a big company. Moreover, the defendants'
products      are     at     best    merely       compatible   with     some      vehicles
manufactured by the plaintiff. These goods do not match up to the
high finesse and quality achieved by the plaintiff for its automobiles as
well as spare parts and accessories under the mark TOYOTA, INNOVA,
PRIUS and TOYOTA Device.
</p>
<p id="p_391">200. The defendants have also filed sales records of the defendants
No.3     and     4,        i.e.    Prius    Auto     Industries      and     Prius     Auto

</pre><p id="p_392">201. It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the main sale made by
the defendants is attributed to the mistaken belief in the minds of
consumers with average intelligence and imperfect recollection that
there exists some nexus between the plaintiff and the defendants.
Hence, the plaintiff is entitled to a large portion of the sales revenues
as claimed by the defendants who are liable to pay punitive damages
as they misrepresented to this Court that the use of the trademarks
TOYOTA, INNOVA, PRIUS and TOYOTA Device was honest and in
consonance with practices in industrial and commercial matters.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                       Page 117 of 121</span>
<p id="p_393"> 202. It is argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that it is
established by the plaintiff that the defendants' adoption of the
trademark PRIUS was malafide and patently dishonest. The use by the
defendants of the plaintiff's trademark has, therefore, caused damage
to the immense reputation enjoyed by the plaintiff over its hybrid
automobile.           Moreover, it has severely threatened the plaintiff's
trademark PRIUS from serving its primary purpose, i.e. identifying
automobiles and parts thereof as bearing the said mark as emanating
from the plaintiff itself.
</p>
<p id="p_394">203. No doubt, there is a force in the argument of the plaintiff's
counsel that the defendants were well aware of the tremendous
reputation enjoyed by the plaintiff's automobile PRIUS. However, it
denied such knowledge and offered unreasonable and acceptable
reasons for adoption of the said mark.        The defendants continued to
make false statements regarding their reason for adopting the
trademark PRIUS and specifically denied having any knowledge of the
plaintiff's mark. Being in the automobile industry, it is hard to fathom
that the defendants were not aware of the world's first hybrid engine
powered car which revolutionized environmental centric automobile
engineering.
</p>
<p id="p_395">204. Sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/74277/" id="a_98">Section 135</a> of the Act provides that relief
may be granted in any suit for infringement or passing off includes
injunction and at the option of the plaintiff, either damages or an
account of profits. The plaintiff has chosen the route of damages and
requested for punitive damages.
</p>
<p id="p_396">205. The Courts have previously granted both exemplary and punitive
damages against the defendants in ex parte matters of similar nature.
<a href="/doc/1152738/" id="a_99">In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava &amp; Anr</a>., (supra) while


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">CS(OS) No.2490/2009                                          Page 118 of 121</span>
 awarding punitive damages of Rs.5 lakhs in addition to compensatory
damages also of Rs.5 lakhs, Justice R.C. Chopra observed that "Time
has come when the Courts dealing in actions for infringement of
trademarks,       copyrights,    patents   etc.,   should   not     only     grant
compensatory damages but also award punitive damages with a view
to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation
with impunity out of lust for money, so that they realise that in case
they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the
aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also,
which may spell financial disaster for them."
</p>
<p id="p_397">206. Further, this Court in Microsoft Corporation v. Rajendra
Pawar &amp; Anr., 2008 (36) PTC 697 (Del.) decided on 27th July, 2007
has held "Perhaps it has now become a trend of sorts, especially in
matters pertaining to passing off, for the defending party to evade
court proceedings in a systematic attempt to jettison the relief sought
by the plaintiff. Such flagrancy of the Defendant's conduct is strictly
deprecatory, and those who recklessly indulge in such shenanigans
must do so at their peril, for it is now an inherited wisdom that evasion
of court proceedings does not de facto tantamount to escape from
liability. Judicial process has its own way of bringing to tasks such
erring parties whilst at the same time ensuring that the aggrieved
party who has knocked the doors of the court in anticipation of justice
is afforded with adequate relief, both in law and in equity. It is here
that    the    concept   of     awarding   punitive   damages      comes       into
perspective."
</p>
<p id="p_398">207. As all issues framed are decided accordingly, the plaintiff is
entitled for all reliefs as sought. The following reliefs are granted in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_125">    i) It    is   directed   that   permanent   injunction   restraining     the

       TOYOTA, the Toyota device, INNOVA and PRIUS in any manner
       whatsoever on goods not originating from the plaintiffs or not
       made under the plaintiff's quality control thus leading to dilution
       of the distinctiveness of the said marks tarnishing the reputation
       of the plaintiff's said trademarks (except if the defendants would
       give an undertaking strictly within four weeks by way of affidavit
       that as per order of Division Bench, they would be allowed to
       use the same with the different writing style/fonts which do not
       indicate any         manner if the defendants are using such

<p id="p_399">   iii) As far as punitive damages are concerned, it appears that the
       defendants must have sold the goods under the similar
       trademarks and trade names for more than Rs.40 crores (Prior
       to 2010, the defendant No.4 has admitted in the written
       statement that they have sold the goods for more than Rs.20
       crores and as per the statement of accounts filed by the
       defendants for subsequent period after 2010, the defendants
       have sold the goods for more than Rs.22 crores).             Even if
       punitive damages are assessed at the rate of 0.5% of the total
       sales of the defendants, it would come to Rs.20 lakhs. However,
       in view of the facts of the present case, a sum of Rs.10 lakhs is
       awarded against the relief para 27(d) of the plaint. The plaintiff
       is also entitled for the actual costs and fee of the counsel spent
       on this litigation. Pending application also stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_400">208. A decree be drawn accordingly. In the interest of justice, equity
and fair play, the defendants are granted two months' time to change
the impugned trademarks and trade names of defendants No.3 and 4
and dispose of the existing stocks.
