G.S.SISTANI, J (ORAL)

1.</pre><p id="p_1">     Plaintiffs have filed the present suit for permanent injunction restraining
       infringement of registered trade marks, passing off of unfair competition,
       delivery up and rendition of accounts.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     As per the plaint, the plaintiffs are world-renowned manufacturers and
       marketers     of   inter   alia    storage   devices,    media     players,
       routers/switches/bridges, comprising of OEM/system manufacturer,
       desktop and enterprise, solid state drives(SSD) and software and mobile
       applications which are marketed and sold under the plaintiffs'
       trademarks. In India, the plaintiff no.1 holds statutory rights in the
       plaintiffs' trademarks. Details of such registrations have been tabulated
       in para 9 of the plaint.       The plaintiffs claim that the trademarks
       registrations are valid and subsisting in law. The plaintiffs have also
       recorded the above trademarks rights with the Customs authorities under
       the Intellectual Property Rights(Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(COMM).1155/2016                                                   Page 1 of 4</span>
      2007 under which they are entitled to specifically prevent the import of
     infringing goods bearing the above trademarks. It is claimed that on
     account of the aforesaid registration, whenever any third party attempts
     to import products bearing the plaintiffs' registered trademarks and the
     Customs authorities either find that the said party is not included in the
     list of the plaintiff's authorized importers or the products appear to be
     counterfeit, a notice is generated seeking the plaintiffs' inputs on the said
     products and comment on whether they are infringing goods or are
     genuine products in order for them to be appropriately dealt with under
     the Customs Rules.
</p><p id="p_3">3.   It is claimed that the plaintiffs also own and maintain several websites
     whose domain names contain "WESTERN DIGITAL" or "WD" and are
     used for marketing and selling WD products, some of which are as
     under:
</p><p id="p_4">           www.wd.com - created on May 25,1994;
</p><p id="p_5">           www.westerndigital.com - created on January 21, 1998;
           www.wdstore.com - created on May 23, 2001;
</p><p id="p_6">           www.westernditigal.info - created on September 12, 2001;
           www.westerndigital.biz - created on March 28, 2002;
           www.westernditigal.asia - created on March 17, 2008.

<p id="p_7">4.   Defendant no.2 is an importer of computer peripherals and hardware
     such as hard disk drives, flash drives, tablets, USB dial drives, micro
     SDHC cards. Defendant no.1 is the proprietor of defendant no.2. The
     complaint of the plaintiffs is that goods of the plaintiffs are being
     imported into India.     However, the goods are not imported through
     legitimate channel or in a lawful manner. Another complaint of the
     plaintiff is that although to the best of the knowledge of the plaintiff, the
     goods may be genuine, but the goods do not show that they are parallel
     imports from a particular country. The goods are not supported by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM).1155/2016                                                   Page 2 of 4</span>
      Western Digital warranty services or customer care and thus, the unwary
     customers may be misled that the goods being sold to have carried the
     same warranty and services as provided by the plaintiffs. The result of
     this would be that the disgruntled customer may affect the rights and
     reputation of the plaintiffs. Both the parties had relied on a decision
     rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_1">Kapil Wadhwa &amp; Ors., v. Samsung Electronics
     Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., reported at 2013(53) PTC 112(Del)(DB). The parties
     have very fairly agreed that the matter can be amicably resolved, subject
     to the condition that the defendants would be willing to place
     permanently and affix a label to show that the goods have been imported
     and are not supported by an authorized Western Digital warranty.
</p><p id="p_8">5.   The present suit is decreed on the following agreed terms:

                       (whether by Ambitious Marketing or by any third party)
