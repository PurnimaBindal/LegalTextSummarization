</p><p id="p_3">                         2.      The respondent had filed the above suit claiming itself to
                         be the registered proprietor of the marks HYLUFRESH used
                         for manufacturing and selling of eye drops. The respondent is
                         aggrieved of the adoption of the trade mark HYLOFRESH by

</p><p id="p_4">                         3.      An ex parte ad interim order of injunction was passed in

                         28.05.2019. The appellant filed an application under Order

</p><p id="p_8">                         6.      The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the
                         learned Trial Court, having found the marks of the appellant
                         and the respondent to be deceptively similar to each other and
                         being used for the same pharmaceutical product, that is eye
                         drops, as also that the appellant was the prior user of its mark,
                         applying the test of triple identity, an ad interim injunction in
                         favour of the appellant and against the respondent should have
                         been granted.
</p><p id="p_9">                         7.      He submits that there are contradictory findings of the
                         learned Trial Court, inasmuch as, while the learned Trial Court
                         accepts the claim of the appellant being the prior user of the
                         mark for purposes of vacating the ad-interim injunction against
                         the appellant, holds that the same shall have to be proved for
                         denying the ad-interim injunction in favour of the appellant and
                         against the respondent. In this regard, he draws my reference to
                         the observations of the learned Trial Court in paragraphs 95 and
                         96 of the impugned order, reproduced hereinunder:

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                         &quot;95. The suit of the plaintiff is based on a
                                         registered trade mark HYLUFRESH and
                                         whereas, the counter claim of the
                                         defendant/counter claimant is on the basis of
                                         an     unregistered       trade    mark.     The
                                         defendant/counter claimant has sought inter
                                         alia relief of passing off against the plaintiff.</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">                                         In passing off, the first and foremost issue that
                                         deserves adjudication is the question of prior
                                         use and thereafter, reputation and goodwill. I
                                         am of the considered view that a prima facie
                                         proof of validity of a trade mark is different
                                         from prima facie proof of infringement. It is

                                        to vacate the order dated 28.05.2019, as the
                                        defendant cannot be restrained from using the

                                        of the extra-cellular matrix, and has a key role
                                        in tissue regeneration, inflammation response,

                         reiterated that the mere fact that the word is derived from the
                         name of the salt does not mean that it loses protection for all
                         times to come. Whether a mark is a &#x27;generic word&#x27; or is &#x27;publici
                         juris&#x27; is a question of fact and if the word has attained

                         distinctiveness is entitled to recognition. The above judgment

                         derived from an active ingredient- Sodium Hyaluronate, but
                         also, the user claimed by the parties is not for a long period
                         prior to the filing of the suit. The appellant claims the user since
                         November, 2015, while the suit was filed by the respondent in
                         2018. On the other hand, the respondent claims the user since
                         April, 2016, though he has filed invoices on record since March,
                         2018. Whether the appellant has acquired any goodwill or

                         does not hold any registration for its mark. Therefore, what

<p id="p_25">                         16.     In these peculiar facts, in my opinion, the learned Trial
                         Court was correct in its approach to leave it for the parties to
                         lead evidence in support of their claim of user.

<p id="p_26">                         17.     I find that there is also no contradiction in the findings of
                         the learned Trial Court, as claimed by the learned counsel for
                         the appellant in this regard, inasmuch as the learned Trial Court,
                         while rejecting the claim of the respondent for an injunction,
                         held that the appellant has at least prima facie been able to show
                         its user of the mark since 2015, that is, prior to the respondent.
                         This finding was necessary for declining the interim injunction
                         to the respondent. While, for refusing an injunction in favour of
                         the appellant herein, the learned Trial Court states that this user,
                         though prima facie evident, would need to be proved by way of
                         evidence. The claim of prior user would also have to be tested
                         against the registered proprietor of the mark. No fault can be
                         found with the above approach of the learned Trial Court.

                         court has ignored certain principles of law regulating the grant
                         or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. The appellate court will
                         not re-assess the material and seek to reach to a conclusion
                         different from the one reached by the court below, if the one
                         reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. If
