O R D E R 
</pre><p id="p_1">Shri Shanker Raju:
</p>
<p id="p_2">	In service matters there is no scope of Public Interest Litigation as ruled by the Apex Court in Gurpal Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2005, SCC (C&amp;S) 636.   Old transfer case filed by Superintendent in MCD assails Office Order dated 14.08.1999 whereby as a stop gap arrangement against 75% quota prescribed for Superintendent for promotion as Administrative Officer/Assistant Assessor &amp;Collector, 11 persons had been promoted on ad hoc basis.   Also sought in this TA quashing of appointment to the post of Stenographer service and a direction to the respondents not to inter-mingle cadres into one.  Recruitment regulations dated 30.08.1996 have also been assailed with a command to the respondent to appoint persons from Ministerial cadre to perform duties as Administrative Officer/Asstt. Assessor and Collector.
</p><p id="p_3">As none appeared for the applicant being an old case, TA is being disposed of under Rule 15 of CAT Ministerial Rules, 1987.  In an interim order passed by the High Court on 01.09.1999 in C.M. No.9732/1999, respondent was restrained from filling up  the post of AO/AA&amp;C either on ad hoc basis or stop gap arrangement against the quota prescribed for the post of Superintendent from the employees of other cadres.   Superintendent is the feeder cadre for LDC/UDC and Head Clerk. There is another cadre of Stenographers where the erstwhile regulations prescribed competitive examination which has been done away with on subsequent amendment.
</p><p id="p_4">Recruitment regulations for the post of Superintendent notified on 11.12.1980 reserves 20% of vacancies to Stenographer GradeI, 65% to Head Clerks and 15% to the Translators.  Insofar as regulations for the post of Assistant Assessor &amp;Collector a degree with three years experience with qualification relaxable at the Commissioners  discretion, is in vogue .  Subsequently, Amended Recruitment Rules for Stenographers cadre prescribed that the cadre of Stenographer Grade-I to be filled 100% from amongst the stenographer Grade-II and no competitive test was prescribed.   However, Recruitment Rules for the post of Administrative Officer notified on and had been amended only in 1996 with the concurrence of the UPSC whereby 75% of the posts are to be filled by promotion from amongst Superintendents with three years regular service in the grade. 
</p><p id="p_5">On 06.07.1997 an assurance was given by the respondent to fill up the post of AO/AA&amp;C on promotion by four Superintendents, was not adhered to .  On 14.08.1999 the respondent as a stop gap arrangement against 75% quota meant for Superintendent, appointed Senior Stenographers on promotion on ad hoc basis as AO/AA&amp;C.  However, with a stipulation that they will not be conferred seniority and as soon as officers from cadre of Superintendent become available, they would be promoted and the Senior Stenographer shall have to be reverted back.  Accordingly, vide Resolution No.392 dated 09.10.2000, in view of the amendment in regulations in AO cadre, the UPSC did not agree but agreed with disposition of requirement of a degree as one time relaxation and Resolution No.41 of the Amendment Committee on 17.08.2000 sought to consider 41 non graduate  Superintendents to be promoted to the post of AO/AA&amp;C.  Accordingly, as per respondents version as no Superintendent with requisite qualification and experience was available, the posts were filled up from Stenographers and Translators but it is stated that some posts have been filled up on transfer on deputation also as a stop gap arrangement.  It is also stated that officials i.e. non-graduate Stenographers who had been working as A.O. have obtained stay from High Court.  From reversion in CWP 3952/1996, it is also stated that seven Superintendents have been promoted as AO/AA&amp;C by relaxing the condition of length of service.
</p><p id="p_6">Applicant in this W.P. has assailed disposition of competitive examination for Stenographic cadre and a grievance that the other incumbents from different cadres are being included as a feeder category for the post of A.O.  It is also stated that Stenographic service being cadre in itself no incumbent should encroach upon the Ministerial cadre for appointment to the post of AO/AA&amp;C which is exclusively  meant for ministerial staff.
</p><p id="p_7">A challenge has been made on the ground that despite vacancies of UDC/Head Clerks and Superintendent people are not being considered on year wise basis by holding DPCs,  it is also stated that in the ministerial cadre officials have a ferment right to be considered for promotion which has been denied to them.
</p><p id="p_8">Lastly, it is mentioned in the pleadings that by making ad hoc promotions, the quota meant for Superintendent has been encroached upon and ineligible persons have been appointed as such.
</p><p id="p_9">The respondents counsel denied the allegations.  It is stated that the affected Stenographers not being made parties in this TA is made from non joinder on merit.   It is stated that once the appointment on promotion in stenographic cadre by a Statutory Regulation disposes __ with the competitive examination, the same cannot be challenged.  It is also stated that pay scales of different posts in the stenographic cadre were revised as per recommendations of Central Pay Commission.   Earlier post of Superintendent was to be filled up from amongst Head Clerks, Stenographers and Translators.  On revision of the pay scale of Translators and Stenographers who have been treated at par with Superintendent, the Recruitment Rules for the post of AO were amended to include Stenographers and Translators in the channel of promotion.
</p><p id="p_10">It is the stand of the respondent that the promotion in various categories is made in accordance with the RRs and hence none of the Superintendents were eligible as they were not considered.  However, the resolution of 2000 has not been denied where seven persons on one time relaxation belonging to Superintendent cadre have been promoted as AO.
</p><p id="p_11">We have accordingly considered the pleadings in TA as well as contentions put forth  by learned counsel for the respondents.
</p><p id="p_12">In our considered view, a change to the Recruitment Rules of AO whereby Stenographers and Translators have been indicated as feeder category cannot be assailed successfully in law as even for the post of Superintendent these two categories are feeder cadre.  Moreover, once the Recruitment Rules have been framed prescribing the quota of 75% for Superintendent to be considered for promotion as AO, the grievance of the applicant that Stenographers are not eligible as they have not passed the competitive examination, cannot be held good as by way of regulations competitive examination has been done away with and there is no challenge to those Recruitment Regulations. Moreover, the amendment in the AO cadre was brought about in administrative exigencies as the pay scale of Stenographers and Translators got revised at par with Superintendent, as such they had become the feeder categories.  The earmarked quota for Superintendent for their promotion cannot be assailed in law unless there is  violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India is made out.  Moreover, in the domain of executive framing of recruitment regulations is their prerogative, as such we are of the considered view that the Recruitment Rules for the post of  AO/AA&amp;C do not suffer from any legal infirmity.
</p><p id="p_13">As regards consideration of the applicant for promotion as A.O., is concerned, certainly right to be considered for promotion on fair and equitable basis, is a guaranteed Fundamental Right to a Govt. servant as ruled in <a href="/doc/1764481/" id="a_1">S.B. Bhattacharjee vs. S.D. Mazumdar</a>, 2008, 1 (SCC) Labor and Services 21.
</p><p id="p_14">Right to be considered for promotion also implies that promotional chances cannot be foreclosed forever and its purpose is to remove stagnation and avoid frustration among the employees, as held in <a href="/doc/456885/" id="a_2">A. Satyanarayana &amp; others vs. Purushotham &amp; others</a>, (2008) 2 SCC (L&amp;S) 279.
</p><p id="p_15">With the above back drop order passed by the respondents on 14.08.1999 whereby on a stop gap arrangement against 75% quota Senior Stenographers were promoted as AO/AA&amp;C, is not fair and equitable exercise in law by the respondents.   No feeder category can encroach upon the quota meant for other feeder category.  However, this officiation shall not bestow upon the Stenographers any right to seniority or promotion but is also subjected to reversion on availability of promotee Superintendents.  We deplead this but for want of impleadment of these Stenographers no adverse orders can be passed against them.  Non impleadment is intervention of principles of natural justice.
</p><p id="p_16">However, another facet is that once 41 vacancies are to be filled amongst the Superintendent on promotion for the post of AO/AA&amp;C on disposition of qualification, respondents have promoted only seven Superintendents.  Applicant who states to be eligible was not considered which is violation of his Fundamental Rights.  No decision has come forth to deny such a claim to the applicant specially in view of a communication between UPSC and Commissioner on  27.05.2002 where one time relaxation has been sought for promotion for Superintendent as AO/AA&amp;C having not done so in case of the applicant at the relevant time certainly applicant has a right to be considered.  Resultantly for the foregoing reasons this TA is purely right to the extent that the respondents are directed on relaxation of educational qualification to consider the claim of the applicant for promotion as AO/AA&amp;C from 2000 in such an event the applicant shall be entitled to all consequences as admissible in law.  This compliance shall be done within a period of two months from the date of receipt of copy of this order.  No costs.

<a href="/doc/1598563/" id="a_42">Union of India v. Kuldeep Singh</a>, (2004) 2 SCC 590 with the following observations:
</p><p id="p_37">In its ordinary meaning, the word discretion signifies unrestrained exercise of choice or will; freedom to act according to ones own judgment; unrestrained exercise pf will; the liberty or power of acting without control other than ones own judgment. But, when applied to public functionaries, it means a power or right conferred upon them by law, of acting officially in certain circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of other. Discretion is the discern between right and wrong; and, therefore, whoever hath power to act at discretion, is bound by the rule of reason and law. When it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities, that something is to be done according to the rule of reasons and justice, not according to private opinion; according to law and not humor. It is to be not arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular. And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man, competent to the discharge of his office ought to have confined himself. When a statute gives a judge a discretion, what is meant is a judicial discretion, regulated according to the known rules of law, and not the mere whim or caprice of the person to whom it is given on the assumption that he is discrete.

A bare reading of the two orders shows that the order in review application was in complete variation and disregard of the earlier order and the strong as well as sound reasons contained therein whereby the original application was rejected.  The scope for review is rather limited and it is not permissible for the forum hearing the review application to act as an appellate authority in respect of the original order by a fresh order and rehearing of the matter to facilitate a change of opinion on merits.  The Tribunal seems to have transgressed its jurisdiction in dealing with the review petition as if it was hearing an original application.  This aspect has also not been noticed by the High Court.

</p>	
<p id="p_73">	37.	Before parting with this aspect of the case, we consider it necessary to reiterate the settled legal position that matters relating to creation and abolition of posts, formation and structuring / restructuring of cadres, prescribing the source / mode of recruitment and qualifications, criteria of selection, evaluation of service records of the employees fall within the exclusive domain of the employer. What steps should be taken for improving efficiency of the administration is also the preserve of the employer. The power of judicial review can be exercised in such matters only if it is shown that the action of the employer is contrary to any constitutional or statutory provision or is patently arbitrary or is vitiated due to mala fides. The court cannot sit in appeal over the judgment of the employer and ordain that a particular post be filled by direct recruitment or promotion or by transfer. The court has no role in determining the methodology of recruitment or laying down the criteria of selection. It is also not open to the court to make comparative evaluation of the merit of the candidates. The court cannot suggest the manner in which the employer should structure or restructure the cadres for the purpose of improving efficiency of administration.


Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1718122/" id="a_99">Anil Kumar Vitthal Shete &amp; others v. State of Maharashtra &amp; another</a>, (2007) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 901 ruled as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_74">33. From the above decisions, it is clear that it is always open to an employer to adopt a policy for fixing service conditions of his employees. Such policy, however, must be in consonance with the Constitution and should not be arbitrary, unreasonable or otherwise objectionable. When several cadres are sought to be unified in few cadres, e.g. three cadres in the instant case, it is natural that all Judicial Officers have to be placed in one or the other cadre. The said fact itself cannot make the decision vulnerable. The High Court, in our opinion, considered the question in its proper perspective and while creating three cadres and placing Judicial Officers in one of the cadres, took into account the relevant principles. So far as the Judges of Small Causes Courts are concerned, they were placed in Category 2 but considering the fact that it was a promotional post from Civil Judges (Senior Division), all of them were en bloc placed above Civil Judges (Senior Division) in the said Category. We find no infirmity therein. It is also clear that in the State of Maharashtra, the new cadre of District Judges covers three existing cadres (i) District Judges, (ii) Joint District Judges, and (iii) City Civil Court Judges and all of them have been placed senior to other cadres in the same category of Additional District Judges, Chief Judges, Small Causes Court and Additional Chief Judges, Small Causes Court. This has been done on the basis that for the District Judge cadre, Additional District Judge cadre is a feeder cadre. The cadre of Additional District Judge is also a feeder cadre for the cadre of Judges of the City Civil Court. Likewise, the cadre of Additional Chief Judge, Small Causes Court is a feeder cadre for the Judges of City Civil Court. In other words, a person holding the post of Additional District Judge can be promoted as a District Judge or as a City Civil Court Judge. Since all the three cadres were to be merged, the superiority of the District Judges and the Judges of City Civil Court was required to be maintained and is accordingly maintained. But it does not mean that District Judges, Chief Judges, Small Causes Court and Additional District Judges/Additional Chief Judges, Small Causes Court cannot be placed in one and the same category. We, therefore, find no illegality in the decision of the Full Court on its Administrative Side which calls for interference.

</p>
<p id="p_97">4)     It is not in dispute that the CAT, Patna Bench passed an order recommending the authority not to rely on the order of caution dated 22.09.1997 and the order of adverse remarks dated 09.06.1998. In view of the said order, one obstacle                                         relating to his promotion goes.     Coming to the second aspect, that though      the benchmark "very good" is required for being considered for promotion admittedly the entry of "good" was not communicated to the appellant. The entry of 'good' should have been communicated to him as he was having "very good" in the previous year. In those circumstances, in our opinion, non-communication of entries in the ACR of a public servant whether he is in civil, judicial, police or any other service (other than the armed forces), it has civil consequences because it may affect his chances for promotion or get other benefits. Hence, such non-communication would be arbitrary and as such violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_128">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The same view has been reiterated in the above referred decision relied on by the appellant. Therefore, the entries "good" if at all granted to the appellant, the same should not have been taken into consideration for being considered for promotion to the higher grade. The respondent has no case that the appellant had ever been informed of the nature of the grading given to him.
</p>
<p id="p_98">5)     Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has pointed out that the officer who was immediately junior in service to the appellant was given promotion on 28.08.2000. Therefore, the appellant also be deemed to have been given promotion from 28.08.2000. Since the appellant had retired from service, we make it clear that he is not entitled to any pay or allowances for the period for which he had not worked in the Higher Administrative Grade Group-A, but his retrospective promotion from 28.08.2000 shall be considered for the benefit of re-fixation of his pension and other retrial benefits as per rules.

The scope, content and meaning of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_139">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution has been the subject matter of intensive examination by this Court in a catena of decisions. It would, therefore, be merely adding to the length of this judgment to recapitulate all those decisions and it is better to avoid that exercise save and except referring to the latest decision on the subject in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_140">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a>, (1978) 2 SCR 621 : (AIR 1978 SC 597) from which the following observation may be extracted:
</p>
<p id="p_108">"........what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article ? There can be no doubt that it a founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its all- embracing scope and meaning for, to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits...... <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_141">Article 14</a> strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_142">Art. 14</a> like a brooding omnipresence."
</p>
<p id="p_109">11. The decisions clearly lay down that though <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_143">Art. 14</a> forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, viz., (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group; and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the statute in question. (<a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_144">See Ram Krishna Dalmia v. S. R. Tendolkar</a>, 1959 SCR 279 at P. 296: (AIR 1958 SC 538 at p. 547)). The classification may be founded on differential basis according to objects sought to be achieved but what is implicit in it is that there ought to be nexus i.e. causal connection between the basis of classification and object of the statute under consideration. It is equally well settled by the decisions of this Court that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_145">Art .14</a> condemns discrimination not only by a substanstive law but also by a law of procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_110">12. After an exhaustive review of almost all decisions bearing on the question of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_146">Art. 14</a>, this Court speaking through Chandrachud, C. J. in Re. Special Courts Bill, (1979) 2 SCR 476 at p. 534: (AIR 1979 SC 478 at P. 509) restated the settled propositions which emerged from the judgments of this Court undoubtedly in so far as they were relevant to the decision on the points arising for consideration in that matter. Four of them are apt and relevant for the present purpose and may be extracted. They are :
</p>
<p id="p_111">"3. The constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula. Therefore, classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things. The Courts should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_112">4. The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_147">Article 14</a> is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same.
</p>
<p id="p_113">5. The law can make and set apart the classes according to the needs and exigencies of the society and as suggested by experience. It can recognise, even a degree of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive.
</p>
<p id="p_114">6. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others, and (2) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_115">13. The other facet of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_148">Article 14</a> which must be remembered is that it eschews arbitrariness in any form. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_149">Article 14</a> has, therefore, not to be held identical with the doctrine of classification. As was noticed in Maneka Gandhi's case (AIR 1978 SC 597) in the earliest stages of evolution of the Constitutional law, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_150">Art. 14</a> came to be identified with the doctrine of classification because the view taken was that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_151">Article 14</a> forbids discrimination and there will be no discrimination where the classification making the differentia fulfils the aforementioned two conditions. However, in <a href="/doc/1327287/" id="a_152">E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, (1974) 2 SCR 348: (AIR 1974 SC 555) it was held that the basic principle which informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination. This Court further observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_116">"From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_153">Art. 14</a> and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_154">Art. 16.</a> Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment."
</p>
<p id="p_117">14. Justice Iyer has in his inimitable style dissected <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_155">Article 14</a> as under :
</p>
<p id="p_118">"The article has a pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul and allergic to discriminatory diktats. Equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness and ex cathedra ipse dixit is the ally of demagogic authoritarianism. Only knight-errants of 'executive excesses', if we may use current cliche, can fall in love with the Dame of despotism, legislative or administrative. If this Court gives in here it gives up the ghost. And so it is that I insist on the dynamics of limitations on fundamental freedoms as implying the rule of law; Be you ever so high, the law is above you." ((1978) 2 SCR 621 at p. 728: AIR 1978 SC 597 at p. 661). Affirming and explaining this view, the Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sahravardi, (1981) 2 SCR 79 : (AIR 1981 SC 487) held that it must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that what <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_156">Article 14</a> strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality. The Court made it explicit that where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_157">Article 14.</a> After a review of large number of decisions bearing on the subject, in Air India etc. v. Nargesh Meerza, (1982) 1 SCR 438 : (AIR 1981 SC 1829) the Court formulated propositions emerging from an analysis and examination of earlier decisions. One such proposition held well established is that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_158">Article 14</a> is certainly attracted where equals are treated differently without any reasonable basis.
</p>
<p id="p_119">15. Thus the fundamental principle is that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_159">Article 14</a> forbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation which classification must satisfy the twin tests of classification being founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.
</p>
<p id="p_120">16. As a corollary to this well established proposition, the next question is, on whom the burden lies to affirmatively establish the rational principle on which the classification is founded correlated to the object sought to be achieved? The thrust of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_160">Article 14</a> is that the citizen is entitled to equality before law and equal protection of laws. In the very nature of things the society being composed of unequals a welfare State will have to strive by both executive and legislative action to help the less fortunate in society to ameliorate their condition so that the social and economic inequality in the society may be bridged. This would necessitate a legislation applicable to a group of citizens otherwise unequal and amelioration of whose lot is the object of state affirmative action. In the absence of the doctrine of classification such legislation is likely to flounder on the bed rock of equality enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_161">Article 14.</a> The Court realistically appraising. the social stratification and economic inequality and keeping in view the guidelines on which the State action must move as constitutionally laid down in Part IV of the Constitution, evolved the doctrine of classification. The doctrine was evolved to sustain a legislation or State action designed to help weaker sections of the society or some such segments of the society in need of succour. Legislative and executive action may accordingly be sustained if it satisfies the twin tests of reasonable classification and the rational principle correlated to the object sought to be achieved. The State, therefore, would have to affirmatively satisfy the Court that the twin tests have been satisfied. It can only be satisfied if the State establishes not only the rational principle on which classification is founded but correlates it to the objects sought to be achieved. This approach is noticed in <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_162">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India</a>, (1979) 3 SCR 1014 at p. 1034 : (AIR 1979 SC 1628 at pp. 1637-38) when at page 1034, the Court observed that a discriminatory action of the Government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.

An advertisement or notification issued/published calling for applications constitutes a representation to the public and the authority issuing it is bound by such representation. It cannot act contrary to it. One reason behind this proposition is that if it were known that persons who obtained the qualifications after the prescribed date but before the date of interview would be allowed to appear for the interview, other similarly placed persons could also have applied. Just because some of the persons had applied notwithstanding that they had not acquired the prescribed qualifications by the prescribed date, they could not have been treated on a preferential basis. Their applications ought to have been rejected at the inception itself. This proposition is indisputable and in fact was not doubted or disputed in the majority judgment. This is also the proposition affirmed in <a href="/doc/1243161/" id="a_196">Rekha Chaturvedi v. University of Rajasthan</a>. The reasoning in the majority opinion that by allowing the 33 respondents to appear for the interview, the recruiting authority was able to get the best talent available and that such course was in furtherance of public interest is, with respect, an impermissible justification. It is, in our considered opinion, a clear error of law and an error apparent on the face of the record. In our opinion, R.M. Sahai, J. (and the Division Bench of the High Court) was right in holding that the 33 respondents could not have been allowed to appear for the interview.
</p>
<p id="p_150">15. The said decision is, therefore, an authority for the proposition that in absence of any cut-off date specified in the advertisement or in the rules, the last date for filing of an application shall be considered as such.

<p id="p_152">17.	<a href="/doc/358165/" id="a_198">In State of T.N. v. Seshachalam</a>, 2008 (1) SCC (L&amp;S) 475, the Apex Court ruled that merely because a cut-off date has been fixed per se cannot be said to be arbitrary, as some date is required to be fixed for that purpose. Though the cut-off date when does not pass the twin test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_199">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, has been held to be arbitrary in the light of Constitution Bench decision of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1416283/" id="a_200">D.S. Nakara &amp; others v. Union of India</a>, 1983 SCC (L&amp;S) 145. However, in a subsequent decision in K.S. Krishnaswamy etc. v. Union of India &amp; another, (2006) 13 SCC 215, the decision in D.S. Nakaras case (supra) was not found to be applicable. 
</p>
<p id="p_153">18.	If one has regard to the above, when inequality found in treatment, though merely because a cut-off date is prejudicial to a person, as if one is falling on other side of the cut-off date would not per se declare as arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_154">19.	In Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research &amp; others v. Ramesh Chandra Agrawal &amp; another, 2009 (1) SCC (L&amp;S) 547 on fixation of cut-off date and examination in judicial review, the Apex Court ruled as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_155">29.   A `State' is entitled to fix a cut off date. Such a decision can be struck down only when it is arbitrary. Its invalidation may also depend upon the question as to whether it has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. 2.5.1997 was the date fixed as the cut off date in terms of the scheme. The reason assigned therefor was that this was the date when this Court directed the appellants to consider framing of a regularization scheme. They could have picked up any other date. They could have even picked up the date of the judgment passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal. As rightly contended by Mr. Patwalia, by choosing 2.5.1997 as the cut off date, no illegality was committed. Ex facie, it cannot be said to be arbitrary. 
</p>
<p id="p_156">30.	The High Court, however, proceeded on the basis that the cut off date should have been the date of issuance of the notification. The employer in this behalf has a choice. Its discretion can be held to be arbitrary but then the High Court only with a view to show sympathy to some of the candidates could not have fixed another date, only because according to it, another date was more suitable. In law it was not necessary. The court's power of judicial review in this behalf although exists but is limited in the sense that the impugned action can be struck down only when it is found to be arbitrary. It is possible that by reason of such a cut off date an employee misses his chance very narrowly. Such hazards would be there in all the services. Only because it causes hardship to a few persons or a section of the employees may not by itself be a good ground for directing fixation of another cut off date.
</p>
<p id="p_157">31.   The scheme was a one-time measure. The number of posts was not confined to the posts which have been sanctioned. The validity of the scheme has been challenged as unrealistic, illusive, arbitrary or unworkable. We may at this juncture notice that whereas the Tribunal directed framing of a scheme, this Court directed the appellants to consider the same.
</p>
<p id="p_158">32.   Cut off date has been fixed for those who are eligible as per the criteria laid down by the scheme. The service rules were framed in terms of the bye-laws of the society. It would bear repetition to state that the Appellant 1 is not a statutory authority. It is a research oriented-organization. It knows its needs. The research fellows and research associates because of their involvement in the research work are to get priority in their appointments. Particular projects whether funded by the Ministry concerned or others would depend upon the nature thereof. It, by a judicial fiat, could not have been made a continuous scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_159">33.	Indisputably, a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial review. But, the court must invalidate a policy on some legal principles. It can do so, inter alia, on the premise that it is wholly irrational and not otherwise. The contention of the respondents that only two chances are granted for consideration of the candidature of the employees for the purpose of regularization is, in our opinion, misconceived. The scheme being a one-time measure, even one opportunity could have been granted.

<p id="p_182">In judicial review on a lis when presented before us sometimes without going into the intricacies of rules and law, we are equity based. Compassionate relief does not attract the technicalities of law. Grant of pension to a government servant and in turn on his death, grant of family pension is a fundamental right guaranteed to the widow. If the husband dies and the widow is not getting the due family pension as per rules, it is always open for her to institute a case before us on a cause of action, which has been approved by the Five Judge Bench of this Tribunal in Mrs. Chandra Kala Pradhan v.

The Apex Court at a great length laid emphasis on the doctrine of precedent in Official Liquidator v. Dayanand &amp; others, (2009) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 943 with the following observations:
</p>
<p id="p_198">17.	<a href="/doc/121683030/" id="a_251">In K.G. Arumugham &amp; others v. K.A. Chinnappan &amp; others</a>, (2005) 2 SCC 793, the Apex Court held that High Court cannot sit in appeal in an earlier order passed by it in the same matter, which has already attained finality and set aside that order. The doctrine of precedent is well explained by observing that a coordinate Bench of the High Court is bound by another coordinate Bench where the order has attained finality.

<p id="p_199">14.	Moreover, one cannot be deprived of a reasonable opportunity to cross examine the witnesses. A document when made part of the departmental proceedings, unless it is in clear terms admitted as a guilt by the delinquent official, it has to be proved on a methodology approved in law. This methodology has been laid down in S.B. Rameshs case (supra) as well as in <a href="/doc/456256/" id="a_252">Hardwari Lal v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, (1999) 8 SCC 582 wherein, in categorical terms, it is ruled that a document cannot be proved without examination of its maker. 
</p>
<p id="p_200">10.	Insofar as the recovery is concerned, which has now been recovered from the applicant, we are fortified with our view as ruled by the Apex court in <a href="/doc/1283806/" id="a_253">Paras Nath Singh v. State of Bihar &amp; others</a>, 2009 (2) SCC (L&amp;S) 198 wherein it is ruled that even if there is wrong promotion, which is not attributable to the concerned employee, no recovery could be effected.

<p id="p_205">19.	Delay defeats justice and with the passage of time, i.e., almost 17 years, now asking the applicant to comment upon the inquiry where on fading of human memory and non-availability of the records, this delay has certainly prejudiced the applicant, as ruled by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/376162/" id="a_259">Agyakar Singh v.

<p id="p_208">9.	Insofar as the recovery is concerned, on wrong time bound promotion given in case of a retired government servant, recovery has not been found to be justifiable by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1283806/" id="a_264">Paras Nath Singh v.

State of Bihar &amp; others</a>, (2009) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 744. In the above view of the matter, re-fixation of pay of the applicant and accordingly, pension and pursuant recovery suffer from the vice of audi alteram partem and being contrary to the principles of natural justice, cannot be countenanced in law. As there is no distinction between a retired employee on attaining the age of or voluntarily retired person, when no fault is attributable to the applicant, recovery cannot be countenanced.
</p>
<p id="p_210">11.	Insofar as promotion of the applicant is concerned, in para 15 of the writ petition, the contention raised is that promotion as Headmistress is to a post involving higher duties and responsibilities. The decision of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1681829/" id="a_266">State of Rajasthan v. Fateh Chand Soni</a>, (1996) 1 SCC 562 clearly rules that promotion can be either to a higher pay scale or higher post. In such an event, when it is not controverted by the respondents that post of Headmistress assumes higher responsibilities, as compared to Assistant Teacher, the aforesaid fixation of the applicant on promotion was in accordance with rules.

<a href="/doc/1598563/" id="a_326">Union of India v. Kuldeep Singh</a>, (2004) 2 SCC 590 with the following observations:
</p><p id="p_248">In its ordinary meaning, the word discretion signifies unrestrained exercise of choice or will; freedom to act according to ones own judgment; unrestrained exercise pf will; the liberty or power of acting without control other than ones own judgment. But, when applied to public functionaries, it means a power or right conferred upon them by law, of acting officially in certain circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of other. Discretion is the discern between right and wrong; and, therefore, whoever hath power to act at discretion, is bound by the rule of reason and law. When it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities, that something is to be done according to the rule of reasons and justice, not according to private opinion; according to law and not humor. It is to be not arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular. And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man, competent to the discharge of his office ought to have confined himself. When a statute gives a judge a discretion, what is meant is a judicial discretion, regulated according to the known rules of law, and not the mere whim or caprice of the person to whom it is given on the assumption that he is discrete.

The scope for review is rather limited and it is not permissible for the forum hearing the review application to act as an appellate authority in respect of the original order by a fresh order and rehearing of the matter to facilitate a change of opinion on merits.

</p>	
<p id="p_284">	37.	Before parting with this aspect of the case, we consider it necessary to reiterate the settled legal position that matters relating to creation and abolition of posts, formation and structuring / restructuring of cadres, prescribing the source / mode of recruitment and qualifications, criteria of selection, evaluation of service records of the employees fall within the exclusive domain of the employer. What steps should be taken for improving efficiency of the administration is also the preserve of the employer. The power of judicial review can be exercised in such matters only if it is shown that the action of the employer is contrary to any constitutional or statutory provision or is patently arbitrary or is vitiated due to mala fides. The court cannot sit in appeal over the judgment of the employer and ordain that a particular post be filled by direct recruitment or promotion or by transfer. The court has no role in determining the methodology of recruitment or laying down the criteria of selection. It is also not open to the court to make comparative evaluation of the merit of the candidates. The court cannot suggest the manner in which the employer should structure or restructure the cadres for the purpose of improving efficiency of administration.


Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1718122/" id="a_383">Anil Kumar Vitthal Shete &amp; others v. State of Maharashtra &amp; another</a>, (2007) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 901 ruled as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_285">33. From the above decisions, it is clear that it is always open to an employer to adopt a policy for fixing service conditions of his employees. Such policy, however, must be in consonance with the Constitution and should not be arbitrary, unreasonable or otherwise objectionable. When several cadres are sought to be unified in few cadres, e.g. three cadres in the instant case, it is natural that all Judicial Officers have to be placed in one or the other cadre. The said fact itself cannot make the decision vulnerable. The High Court, in our opinion, considered the question in its proper perspective and while creating three cadres and placing Judicial Officers in one of the cadres, took into account the relevant principles. So far as the Judges of Small Causes Courts are concerned, they were placed in Category 2 but considering the fact that it was a promotional post from Civil Judges (Senior Division), all of them were en bloc placed above Civil Judges (Senior Division) in the said Category. We find no infirmity therein. It is also clear that in the State of Maharashtra, the new cadre of District Judges covers three existing cadres (i) District Judges, (ii) Joint District Judges, and (iii) City Civil Court Judges and all of them have been placed senior to other cadres in the same category of Additional District Judges, Chief Judges, Small Causes Court and Additional Chief Judges, Small Causes Court. This has been done on the basis that for the District Judge cadre, Additional District Judge cadre is a feeder cadre. The cadre of Additional District Judge is also a feeder cadre for the cadre of Judges of the City Civil Court. Likewise, the cadre of Additional Chief Judge, Small Causes Court is a feeder cadre for the Judges of City Civil Court. In other words, a person holding the post of Additional District Judge can be promoted as a District Judge or as a City Civil Court Judge. Since all the three cadres were to be merged, the superiority of the District Judges and the Judges of City Civil Court was required to be maintained and is accordingly maintained. But it does not mean that District Judges, Chief Judges, Small Causes Court and Additional District Judges/Additional Chief Judges, Small Causes Court cannot be placed in one and the same category. We, therefore, find no illegality in the decision of the Full Court on its Administrative Side which calls for interference.

<p id="p_307">Recently, the Constitution Bench of Apex Court in Abhijit Ghosh Dastidar v. Union of India &amp; others (Civil Appeal No.6227/2008) decided on 22.10.2008 has relied upon the decision in Dev Dutts case (supra) and held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_308">4)     It is not in dispute that the CAT, Patna Bench passed an order recommending the authority not to rely on the order of caution dated 22.09.1997 and the order of adverse remarks dated 09.06.1998. In view of the said order, one obstacle                                         relating to his promotion goes.     Coming to the second aspect, that though      the benchmark "very good" is required for being considered for promotion admittedly the entry of "good" was not communicated to the appellant. The entry of 'good' should have been communicated to him as he was having "very good" in the previous year. In those circumstances, in our opinion, non-communication of entries in the ACR of a public servant whether he is in civil, judicial, police or any other service (other than the armed forces), it has civil consequences because it may affect his chances for promotion or get other benefits. Hence, such non-communication would be arbitrary and as such violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_412">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The same view has been reiterated in the above referred decision relied on by the appellant. Therefore, the entries "good" if at all granted to the appellant, the same should not have been taken into consideration for being considered for promotion to the higher grade. The respondent has no case that the appellant had ever been informed of the nature of the grading given to him.
</p>
<p id="p_309">5)     Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has pointed out that the officer who was immediately junior in service to the appellant was given promotion on 28.08.2000. Therefore, the appellant also be deemed to have been given promotion from 28.08.2000. Since the appellant had retired from service, we make it clear that he is not entitled to any pay or allowances for the period for which he had not worked in the Higher Administrative Grade Group-A, but his retrospective promotion from 28.08.2000 shall be considered for the benefit of re-fixation of his pension and other retrial benefits as per rules.

The scope, content and meaning of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_423">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution has been the subject matter of intensive examination by this Court in a catena of decisions. It would, therefore, be merely adding to the length of this judgment to recapitulate all those decisions and it is better to avoid that exercise save and except referring to the latest decision on the subject in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_424">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a>, (1978) 2 SCR 621 : (AIR 1978 SC 597) from which the following observation may be extracted:
</p>
<p id="p_319">"........what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article ? There can be no doubt that it a founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its all- embracing scope and meaning for, to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits...... <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_425">Article 14</a> strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_426">Art. 14</a> like a brooding omnipresence."
</p>
<p id="p_320">11. The decisions clearly lay down that though <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_427">Art. 14</a> forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, viz., (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group; and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the statute in question. (<a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_428">See Ram Krishna Dalmia v. S. R. Tendolkar</a>, 1959 SCR 279 at P. 296: (AIR 1958 SC 538 at p. 547)). The classification may be founded on differential basis according to objects sought to be achieved but what is implicit in it is that there ought to be nexus i.e. causal connection between the basis of classification and object of the statute under consideration. It is equally well settled by the decisions of this Court that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_429">Art .14</a> condemns discrimination not only by a substanstive law but also by a law of procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_321">12. After an exhaustive review of almost all decisions bearing on the question of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_430">Art. 14</a>, this Court speaking through Chandrachud, C. J. in Re. Special Courts Bill, (1979) 2 SCR 476 at p. 534: (AIR 1979 SC 478 at P. 509) restated the settled propositions which emerged from the judgments of this Court undoubtedly in so far as they were relevant to the decision on the points arising for consideration in that matter. Four of them are apt and relevant for the present purpose and may be extracted. They are :
</p>
<p id="p_322">"3. The constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula. Therefore, classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things. The Courts should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_323">4. The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_431">Article 14</a> is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same.
</p>
<p id="p_324">5. The law can make and set apart the classes according to the needs and exigencies of the society and as suggested by experience. It can recognise, even a degree of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive.
</p>
<p id="p_325">6. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others, and (2) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_326">13. The other facet of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_432">Article 14</a> which must be remembered is that it eschews arbitrariness in any form. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_433">Article 14</a> has, therefore, not to be held identical with the doctrine of classification. As was noticed in Maneka Gandhi's case (AIR 1978 SC 597) in the earliest stages of evolution of the Constitutional law, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_434">Art. 14</a> came to be identified with the doctrine of classification because the view taken was that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_435">Article 14</a> forbids discrimination and there will be no discrimination where the classification making the differentia fulfils the aforementioned two conditions. However, in <a href="/doc/1327287/" id="a_436">E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, (1974) 2 SCR 348: (AIR 1974 SC 555) it was held that the basic principle which informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination. This Court further observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_327">"From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_437">Art. 14</a> and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_438">Art. 16.</a> Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment."
</p>
<p id="p_328">14. Justice Iyer has in his inimitable style dissected <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_439">Article 14</a> as under :
</p>
<p id="p_329">"The article has a pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul and allergic to discriminatory diktats. Equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness and ex cathedra ipse dixit is the ally of demagogic authoritarianism. Only knight-errants of 'executive excesses', if we may use current cliche, can fall in love with the Dame of despotism, legislative or administrative. If this Court gives in here it gives up the ghost. And so it is that I insist on the dynamics of limitations on fundamental freedoms as implying the rule of law; Be you ever so high, the law is above you." ((1978) 2 SCR 621 at p. 728: AIR 1978 SC 597 at p. 661). Affirming and explaining this view, the Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sahravardi, (1981) 2 SCR 79 : (AIR 1981 SC 487) held that it must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that what <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_440">Article 14</a> strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality. The Court made it explicit that where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_441">Article 14.</a> After a review of large number of decisions bearing on the subject, in Air India etc. v. Nargesh Meerza, (1982) 1 SCR 438 : (AIR 1981 SC 1829) the Court formulated propositions emerging from an analysis and examination of earlier decisions. One such proposition held well established is that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_442">Article 14</a> is certainly attracted where equals are treated differently without any reasonable basis.
</p>
<p id="p_330">15. Thus the fundamental principle is that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_443">Article 14</a> forbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation which classification must satisfy the twin tests of classification being founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.
</p>
<p id="p_331">16. As a corollary to this well established proposition, the next question is, on whom the burden lies to affirmatively establish the rational principle on which the classification is founded correlated to the object sought to be achieved? The thrust of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_444">Article 14</a> is that the citizen is entitled to equality before law and equal protection of laws. In the very nature of things the society being composed of unequals a welfare State will have to strive by both executive and legislative action to help the less fortunate in society to ameliorate their condition so that the social and economic inequality in the society may be bridged. This would necessitate a legislation applicable to a group of citizens otherwise unequal and amelioration of whose lot is the object of state affirmative action. In the absence of the doctrine of classification such legislation is likely to flounder on the bed rock of equality enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_445">Article 14.</a> The Court realistically appraising. the social stratification and economic inequality and keeping in view the guidelines on which the State action must move as constitutionally laid down in Part IV of the Constitution, evolved the doctrine of classification. The doctrine was evolved to sustain a legislation or State action designed to help weaker sections of the society or some such segments of the society in need of succour. Legislative and executive action may accordingly be sustained if it satisfies the twin tests of reasonable classification and the rational principle correlated to the object sought to be achieved. The State, therefore, would have to affirmatively satisfy the Court that the twin tests have been satisfied. It can only be satisfied if the State establishes not only the rational principle on which classification is founded but correlates it to the objects sought to be achieved. This approach is noticed in <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_446">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India</a>, (1979) 3 SCR 1014 at p. 1034 : (AIR 1979 SC 1628 at pp. 1637-38) when at page 1034, the Court observed that a discriminatory action of the Government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.

However, it is trite law that when civil consequences ensue upon the government servant, a prior reasonable opportunity is a mandate, which is in consonance with the principle of audi alteram partem.

Chander Shekhar</a>, (1997) 4 SCC 18, on a reference, following has been observed:
</p>
<p id="p_358">"(1) Whether the view taken by the majority (Honble Dr Thommen and V. Ramaswami, JJ.) that it is enough for a candidate to be qualified by the date of interview even if he was not qualified by the last date prescribed for receiving the applications, is correct in law and whether the majority was right in extending the principle of Rule 37 of the Public Service Commission Rules to the present case by analogy?" 
</p>
<p id="p_359">	14. It was held :
</p>
<p id="p_360">"So far as the first issue referred to in our Order dated 1-9-1995 is concerned, we are of the respectful opinion that majority judgment (rendered by Dr T.K. Thommen and V. Ramaswami, JJ.) is unsustainable in law. The proposition that where applications are called for prescribing a particular date as the last date for filing the applications, the eligibility of the candidates shall have to be judged with reference to that date and that date alone, is a well-established one. A person who acquires the prescribed qualification subsequent to such prescribed date cannot be considered at all. An advertisement or notification issued/published calling for applications constitutes a representation to the public and the authority issuing it is bound by such representation. It cannot act contrary to it. One reason behind this proposition is that if it were known that persons who obtained the qualifications after the prescribed date but before the date of interview would be allowed to appear for the interview, other similarly placed persons could also have applied. Just because some of the persons had applied notwithstanding that they had not acquired the prescribed qualifications by the prescribed date, they could not have been treated on a preferential basis. Their applications ought to have been rejected at the inception itself. This proposition is indisputable and in fact was not doubted or disputed in the majority judgment. This is also the proposition affirmed in <a href="/doc/1243161/" id="a_480">Rekha Chaturvedi v. University of Rajasthan</a>. The reasoning in the majority opinion that by allowing the 33 respondents to appear for the interview, the recruiting authority was able to get the best talent available and that such course was in furtherance of public interest is, with respect, an impermissible justification. It is, in our considered opinion, a clear error of law and an error apparent on the face of the record. In our opinion, R.M. Sahai, J. (and the Division Bench of the High Court) was right in holding that the 33 respondents could not have been allowed to appear for the interview.
</p>
<p id="p_361">15. The said decision is, therefore, an authority for the proposition that in absence of any cut-off date specified in the advertisement or in the rules, the last date for filing of an application shall be considered as such.

<p id="p_363">17.	<a href="/doc/358165/" id="a_482">In State of T.N. v. Seshachalam</a>, 2008 (1) SCC (L&amp;S) 475, the Apex Court ruled that merely because a cut-off date has been fixed per se cannot be said to be arbitrary, as some date is required to be fixed for that purpose. Though the cut-off date when does not pass the twin test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_483">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, has been held to be arbitrary in the light of Constitution Bench decision of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1416283/" id="a_484">D.S. Nakara &amp; others v. Union of India</a>, 1983 SCC (L&amp;S) 145. However, in a subsequent decision in K.S. Krishnaswamy etc. v. Union of India &amp; another, (2006) 13 SCC 215, the decision in D.S. Nakaras case (supra) was not found to be applicable. 
</p>
<p id="p_364">18.	If one has regard to the above, when inequality found in treatment, though merely because a cut-off date is prejudicial to a person, as if one is falling on other side of the cut-off date would not per se declare as arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_365">19.	In Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research &amp; others v. Ramesh Chandra Agrawal &amp; another, 2009 (1) SCC (L&amp;S) 547 on fixation of cut-off date and examination in judicial review, the Apex Court ruled as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_366">29.   A `State' is entitled to fix a cut off date. Such a decision can be struck down only when it is arbitrary. Its invalidation may also depend upon the question as to whether it has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. 2.5.1997 was the date fixed as the cut off date in terms of the scheme. The reason assigned therefor was that this was the date when this Court directed the appellants to consider framing of a regularization scheme. They could have picked up any other date. They could have even picked up the date of the judgment passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal. As rightly contended by Mr. Patwalia, by choosing 2.5.1997 as the cut off date, no illegality was committed. Ex facie, it cannot be said to be arbitrary. 
</p>
<p id="p_367">30.	The High Court, however, proceeded on the basis that the cut off date should have been the date of issuance of the notification. The employer in this behalf has a choice. Its discretion can be held to be arbitrary but then the High Court only with a view to show sympathy to some of the candidates could not have fixed another date, only because according to it, another date was more suitable. In law it was not necessary. The court's power of judicial review in this behalf although exists but is limited in the sense that the impugned action can be struck down only when it is found to be arbitrary. It is possible that by reason of such a cut off date an employee misses his chance very narrowly. Such hazards would be there in all the services. Only because it causes hardship to a few persons or a section of the employees may not by itself be a good ground for directing fixation of another cut off date.
</p>
<p id="p_368">31.   The scheme was a one-time measure. The number of posts was not confined to the posts which have been sanctioned. The validity of the scheme has been challenged as unrealistic, illusive, arbitrary or unworkable. We may at this juncture notice that whereas the Tribunal directed framing of a scheme, this Court directed the appellants to consider the same.
</p>
<p id="p_369">32.   Cut off date has been fixed for those who are eligible as per the criteria laid down by the scheme. The service rules were framed in terms of the bye-laws of the society. It would bear repetition to state that the Appellant 1 is not a statutory authority. It is a research oriented-organization. It knows its needs. The research fellows and research associates because of their involvement in the research work are to get priority in their appointments. Particular projects whether funded by the Ministry concerned or others would depend upon the nature thereof. It, by a judicial fiat, could not have been made a continuous scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_370">33.	Indisputably, a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial review. But, the court must invalidate a policy on some legal principles. It can do so, inter alia, on the premise that it is wholly irrational and not otherwise. The contention of the respondents that only two chances are granted for consideration of the candidature of the employees for the purpose of regularization is, in our opinion, misconceived. The scheme being a one-time measure, even one opportunity could have been granted.

<p id="p_393">In judicial review on a lis when presented before us sometimes without going into the intricacies of rules and law, we are equity based. Compassionate relief does not attract the technicalities of law. Grant of pension to a government servant and in turn on his death, grant of family pension is a fundamental right guaranteed to the widow. If the husband dies and the widow is not getting the due family pension as per rules, it is always open for her to institute a case before us on a cause of action, which has been approved by the Five Judge Bench of this Tribunal in Mrs. Chandra Kala Pradhan v.

Union of India</a>, 1983 SCC (L&amp;S) 145 that in upholding the constitutional mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_526">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, financial constraints are not to be an impediment. Like-wise the Bombay High Court in Union of India &amp; others v. Atomic Energy Workers &amp; Staff Union &amp; others, (2005) 1 ATJ HC 92, it has been held that financial constraint cannot be a defence to parity of scales. Our view is further reiterated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1493500/" id="a_527">State of Punjab &amp; another v. Surjit Singh &amp; others</a>, 2009 (11) SCALE 149.

<p id="p_403">12.	Another aspect of the matter is the alleged misconduct of coming late to office by six minutes cannot be treated as a trivial misconduct, for which holding of an inquiry and imposing a major punishment, certainly is unwarranted and unreasonable in the circumstances. An error of judgment or simple negligence is also not a misconduct, as ruled by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1478869/" id="a_528">Inspector Prem Chand v.

</p>
<p id="p_407">15.	Insofar as the ratio decidendi of a case is concerned, an observation made by superior Court is not binding.

Paryani Mukesh Jawaharlal &amp; others, (2007) 10 SCC 201 ruled that Judicial discipline is self discipline. It is an inbuilt mechanism in the system itself. Judicial discipline demands that when the decision of a co-ordinate Bench of the same High Court is brought to the notice of the Bench, it is respected and is binding, subject of course, to the right to take a different view or to doubt the correctness of the decision and the permissible course then often is to refer the question or the case to a larger Bench. This is the minimum discipline and decorum to be maintained by judicial fraternity. The aforesaid ratio also is an authority to the fact that if a judgment is not brought into notice and the decision is taken by a coordinate Bench ignoring the same it would be per incuriam decision. The Apex Court at a great length laid emphasis on the doctrine of precedent in Official Liquidator v. Dayanand &amp; others, (2009) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 943 with the following observations:
</p>
<p id="p_409">17.	<a href="/doc/121683030/" id="a_536">In K.G. Arumugham &amp; others v. K.A. Chinnappan &amp; others</a>, (2005) 2 SCC 793, the Apex Court held that High Court cannot sit in appeal in an earlier order passed by it in the same matter, which has already attained finality and set aside that order. The doctrine of precedent is well explained by observing that a coordinate Bench of the High Court is bound by another coordinate Bench where the order has attained finality.

<p id="p_410">14.	Moreover, one cannot be deprived of a reasonable opportunity to cross examine the witnesses. A document when made part of the departmental proceedings, unless it is in clear terms admitted as a guilt by the delinquent official, it has to be proved on a methodology approved in law.

Delay defeats justice and with the passage of time, i.e., almost 17 years, now asking the applicant to comment upon the inquiry where on fading of human memory and non-availability of the records, this delay has certainly prejudiced the applicant, as ruled by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/376162/" id="a_544">Agyakar Singh v.

State of Bihar &amp; others</a>, (2009) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 744. In the above view of the matter, re-fixation of pay of the applicant and accordingly, pension and pursuant recovery suffer from the vice of audi alteram partem and being contrary to the principles of natural justice, cannot be countenanced in law. As there is no distinction between a retired employee on attaining the age of or voluntarily retired person, when no fault is attributable to the applicant, recovery cannot be countenanced.
</p>
<p id="p_421">11.	Insofar as promotion of the applicant is concerned, in para 15 of the writ petition, the contention raised is that promotion as Headmistress is to a post involving higher duties and responsibilities. The decision of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1681829/" id="a_551">State of Rajasthan v. Fateh Chand Soni</a>, (1996) 1 SCC 562 clearly rules that promotion can be either to a higher pay scale or higher post. In such an event, when it is not controverted by the respondents that post of Headmistress assumes higher responsibilities, as compared to Assistant Teacher, the aforesaid fixation of the applicant on promotion was in accordance with rules.
