Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
</pre><p id="p_1">1. Notice. Ms. Archana Shankar, learned counsel accepts notice on behalf
the Respondent/Plaintiff.    With the consent of learned counsel for the
parties, the appeal has been heard finally.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2. This appeal by the Defendant in C.S. (COMM) No.343/2019 is directed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                      Page 1 of 18</span>
 against the order dated 5th July, 2019 passed by the learned Single Judge in
I.A. No.8878/2019 in the said suit whereby, inter alia, the Appellant was
restrained from infringing Indian patent IN No. 240207 held by the
Respondent/Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3. The Respondent, which is part of the Bayer Groups of Companies, filed
the aforementioned suit against the Appellant/Defendant for permanent
injunction to restrain it from making, using, selling, distributing, advertising,
exporting, offering for sale and in any other manner directly or indirectly
dealing with any product that infringes the subject matter of the Plaintiff‟s
Indian Patent No. 240207 or any claims thereof, including Regorafenib and
any forms thereof.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4. The Plaintiff averred in the plaint that it was granted the above patent on
29th April 2010 and the drug covered i.e. Regorafenib is used for treatment
of metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
It was averred that this was a valid and subsisting patent having a term of 20
years from 22nd July, 2004. It was disclosed in the plaint that
Appellant/Defendant had filed a revocation petition against the said patent
before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) and that the said
application is pending. The plaint also disclosed that another patent
registered in favour of the Respondent/Plaintiff is IN 215758 which related
to "Carboxyaryl Substituted Diphenyl Ureas" and that "the said patent does
not cover Regorafenib".
</p>

<p id="p_5">5. It was stated in the plaint that in the last week of June 2019, the Plaintiff
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                             Page 2 of 18</span>
 became aware of the infringing activities of the Defendant when it found out
from various sources that the Defendant was planning to commercialize the
Regorafenib product in Indian market. It was further averred that the
Defendant was planning to introduce in the market the said product under
the brand name „Regonat‟ and that the said product had not yet been
commercially launched.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6. The Plaintiff referred to a photograph of the Defendant‟s product obtained
by its personnel which showed that the tablet strength was identical to the
strength in which the Plaintiff markets its commercial Regorafenib products
viz., Stivarga, Nublexa and Resihance. It was alleged therefore that the
Defendant had merely copied the patented product of the Plaintiff. In Para
34 of the plaint, it was averred that the Plaintiff had recently learnt that the
Defendant had filed in the City Civil Court in Hyderabad, a suit for
declaration of non-infringement against the Plaintiff pertaining to the
product having international non-proprietary name Regorafenib and that the
said suit was listed on 28th June, 2019. It was further stated that notice
appeared to have been made returnable on 8th July, 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7. In para 35 (iv) of the plaint it was averred that without waiting for an
injunction sought in the suit to be granted, the Defendant appeared to have
"sent its infringing products to their distributors, although the infringing
product has not entered the commercial and retail market as believed by the
by the Plaintiff."
</p>

<p id="p_8">8. The suit C.S.(COMM) No.343/2019 was listed first for hearing before the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 3 of 18</span>
 learned Single Judge on 5th July, 2019 along with the aforementioned I.A.
8878/2019 filed by the Plaintiff under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC
seeking an interim injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9. A perusal of the impugned order shows that the Defendant appeared on
caveat and was represented by a senior counsel. Para 11 of the impugned
order indicates that the learned Single Judge "straightaway asked the senior
counsel for the Defendant as to why the interim order in terms of the order
dated 31st May, 2019 in CS(COMM) No. 314/2019 titled as <a href="/doc/100652936/" id="a_1">Sterlite
Technologies Ltd. V. ZTT India Pvt. Ltd</a>. should not be passed till the
completion of pleadings and hearing of the application for interim relief". A
copy of the aforementioned order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra) was
also "handed over to the senior counsel for the Defendant."
</p>

<p id="p_10">10. At this stage it requires to be noticed that the suit, in which the said
interim order in <a href="/doc/100652936/" id="a_2">Sterlite Technologies Ltd. v. ZTT India Pvt. Ltd</a>. was
passed (incidentally by the same learned Single Judge who passed the
impugned interim order), was for a permanent injunction restraining the
Defendant in that case from infringing two Indian patents. The subject
patents there were „method patents‟. The case of the Plaintiff in that case
was that "the optical fibre being marketed by the Defendant had the same
technical parameters as of the optical fibres of the Plaintiff produced with
the patented technology." The said interim order in Sterlite Technologies
Ltd. granting ad interim injunction was passed ex-parte. Interestingly in Para
9 of the said order, the learned Single Judge observed that "at this stage, it is
not possible to form an opinion, even prima facie." In the said order the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                             Page 4 of 18</span>
 learned Single Judge was of the view that there should invariably be an
interim injunction granted in the first place in favour of a patent holder for
the reasons set out in paras 16-17, which read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "16. I say so because, a patentee, even after succeeding in the
      suit, in the absence of any interim order, is entitled only to
      profits earned by the defendant and which do not reflect the
      profits which the plaintiff would have earned if there had been
      no infringement. As aforesaid, the infringer is able to market at
      a much lower price, resulting in earning far less profits that
      which the patentee would have earned if there had been no
      infringement. The patentee would then also be entitled to
      punitive action against defendant for violation of the interim
      order.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      17. Such arrangement, in my view, will also ensure that suits
      for infringement are not contested, only to take advantage of
      and to reap the fruits of delays in Court process, inspite of
      defendant in its heart knowing the truth. Each defendant, in its
      heart knows the truth and if in spite of knowing that it is in
      infringement, violates the interim order, will, besides taking the
      risk of financial liability, also run the risk of penal
      consequences. This will also ensure purity of the Court
      process."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">11. According to the learned Single Judge "this experimentation, with
interim orders in patent infringement suits, is the need of the hour."
</p>

<p id="p_12">12. On the above reasoning there was in the instant case by the impugned
order granted, on the lines of the order granted in Sterlite Technologies Ltd.
(supra) till the next date i.e. 20th September 2019, an interim injunction
restraining the Appellant/Defendant herein from infringing the IN Patent
No. 240207. A copy of the order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra) was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 5 of 18</span>
 annexed to the impugned interim order "for convenience".
</p>

<p id="p_13">13. Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior counsel appearing for the
Defendant/Appellant submitted as under:
</p><p id="p_14">(i) The impugned interim order is contrary to the settled law explained in
several decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court in the matter of
granting an ad interim injunction. In particular there is no satisfaction
recorded of the Plaintiff having made out a prima facie case or that the
balance of convenience is in his favour or that it would suffer irreparable
hardship if the injunction is not granted.
</p>

<p id="p_15">(ii) On essentially the same issue regarding the validity of the patent
IN240207 in respect of Regorafenib, the earlier suit filed by the Defendant
in the Civil Court in Hyderabad against the Plaintiff is pending and,
therefore, in terms of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(CPC), the suit before this Court could not have proceeded.
</p>

<p id="p_16">(iii) There was no presumptive validity in the grant of a patent; there was
already a revocation application filed against the suit patent pending before
the IPAB; inasmuch as the compound patented in IN240207 stood already
disclosed in IN 215758 and was in the public domain there could not have
been a valid patent granted in respect thereof again in favour of the Plaintiff,
particularly since the Plaintiff had after making such disclosure deleted the
claim made in respect thereof in IN 215758.
</p>

<p id="p_17">(iv) The impugned order overlooked the fact that the defendant's product is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 6 of 18</span>
 already in the market. In support of this assertion, Mr. Vaidyanathan
tendered in this Court an affidavit on behalf of the Defendant stating inter
alia that it had released its product Regonat in the market on 27th June 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_18">(v) Although the Plaintiff‟s product was in market since 2013, the price of a
bottle containing 28 tablets was either Rs.36,000/- or Rs. 40,000/- ( for 2
varieties of the tablets), whereas the Appellant/Defendant‟s product price is
Rs,9,000/- per bottle. He added that the Defendant is prepared to provide
medicines to 2000 patients free for life.
</p>

<p id="p_19">(vi) The impugned order does not account for the balance of convenience
and the prejudice that would be caused to the Defendant if the interim
injunction was to be granted. According to Mr. Vaidyanathan assuming
without admitting the Plaintiff‟s case that its annual sales of Regorafenib is
around Rs. 25 Crores, the Defendant was prepared to deposit in the Court
Rs. 5 Crores without prejudice to its rights and contentions towards the
plausible losses that might be suffered by the Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_20">(vii) Mr. Vaidyanathan also made reference to the decision of the Division
Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_3">Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation v. Glenmark
Pharmaceuticals</a> 2015 (63) PTC 257 [Del][DB] where inter alia it was held
that the safe approach for a Single Judge to adopt in the matter of grant of
interim injunction in a patent infringement suit was to deny relief in the first
hearing and "if there is slightest doubt, set down the application for hearing
at the earliest opportunity, even while requiring some semblance of formal
disclosure of the defendant". He accordingly prayed that the matter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 7 of 18</span>
 regarding grant of interim injunction, after setting aside the impugned order,
should be remanded to the learned Single Judge for fresh disposal on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_21">14. Dr. A.M. Singhvi and Mr. P.V. Kapur, learned Senior counsel appearing
for the Respondent/Plaintiff made the following submissions:
</p>

<p id="p_22">(i) The elements of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable
hardship to the Plaintiff in support of the grant of interim injunction in its
favour, even if not so stated in express terms, were discernable from the
impugned order.
</p>

<p id="p_23">(ii) It was plain that the only defence of the Defendant was regarding
invalidity of the patent whereas there was sufficient admission even in the
plaint in the suit filed by the Defendant in the City Civil Court at Hyderabad
that the suit patent covered the product Regorafenib.
</p>

<p id="p_24">(iii) Without pursuing its revocation application pending before the IPAB to
its logical conclusion, the Defendant had risked introducing its product in
the market. This was dishonest and done knowing fully well that the product
sought to be introduced by it was already covered by a valid patent held by
the Plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_25">(iv) The Defendant had in the suit filed in the City Civil Court at Hyderabad
only spoken of its proposal to „explore‟ the market. It was inconceivable that
between first hearing of the said suit on 28th June, 2019 and the date of
hearing of the Plaintiff‟s suit by the learned Single Judge of this Court on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                           Page 8 of 18</span>
 5th July, 2019, the Defendant could have commercially launched its product
in the market. In the list of dates filed in the present appeal it is disclosed
that the product was launched by the Defendant on 20th June 2019 whereas
in the affidavit now filed with the present appeal, it is stated that the product
was released in the market on 27th June 2019. These inconsistent statements
give rise to grave doubts whether the product of the Defendant was actually
in the market.
</p>

<p id="p_26">(v) The mere fact that the „genus‟ of the formula for Regorafenib was
disclosed in IN 215758 would not preclude the Plaintiff from being granted
a patent in respect of a specific species thereof i.e. for the drug Regorafenib.
Mr. Kapur placed reliance on a decision dated 8th February 2017 of the US
Patent &amp; Trademark Office in support of such proposition.
</p>

<p id="p_27">(vi) Serious prejudice would be caused to the Plaintiff if the interim
injunction granted would not continue. Reliance is placed on the decision in
Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation (supra) to urge that irreparable
hardship and loss which cannot be compensated monetarily would be caused
to the Plaintiff, as a holder of a valid pharmaceutical patent, if the interim
injunction granted by the learned Single Judge was not continued.
</p>

<p id="p_28">15. By way of rejoinder, Mr. Vaidyanathan pointed out that the Defendant‟s
revocation application filed in the IPAB in October, 2014 itself could not be
taken up for hearing for various reasons beyond the Defendant‟s control. In
particular, the IPAB itself was not functional due to the absence of a
Technical Member for over two years. It is further pointed out that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                             Page 9 of 18</span>
 Defendant‟s suit in the City Civil Court, Hyderabad was filed first as a
commercial suit on 21st June, 2019 but after removal of objections and
refiling, it could be heard as a regular suit only on 28th June, 2019. The facts
averred in the said plaint pertained to the date of initial filing i.e. 21st June,
2019.
</p>

<p id="p_29">16. The above submissions have been considered. At the outset, the Court
would like to observe that the impugned order was clearly not an „ex parte‟
order in an application for interim injunction, in a suit alleging infringement
of a patent. The Defendant appeared on caveat on the very first date and
made the submissions. On the other hand, the order which has been adopted
by the learned Single Judge as the order in the application for interim
injunction in the suit filed by the present Respondent/ Plaintiff i.e. the order
in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (Supra) was an ex parte order.
</p>

<p id="p_30">17. This Court would like to preface the discussion by reference to the
settled law in relation to the passing of orders of interim injunction.
Illustratively, reference may be made to the decision in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_4">Wander v. Antox</a>
(1990) (Supp) SCC 727 where the legal principles were enunciated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction
        is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the
        plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and
        uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the
        trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well
        settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory
        remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object
        of the interlocutory injunction, it is stated
                "...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by
                violation of his rights for which he could not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                              Page 10 of 18</span>
              adequately be compensated in damages
             recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were
             resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for
             such protection must be weighed against the
             corresponding need of the defendant to be
             protected against injury resulting from his having
             been prevented from exercising his own legal
             rights for which he could not be adequately
             compensated. The court must weigh one need
             against another and determine where the "balance
             of convenience lies."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo,
      the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The
      court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he
      considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be
      prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration
      whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or
      whether he has already been doing so in which latter case
      considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a
      case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are
      attracted."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">18. <a href="/doc/1822024/" id="a_5">In Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden</a> (1990) 2 SCC 117,
the Supreme Court explained:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus
      granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last
      non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy
      until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to
      compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done
      or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the
      party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction
      to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the
      trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party
      against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it
      to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 11 of 18</span>
       great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain
      guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are:
      (1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trail. That is, it shall be of
      a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally
      required for a prohibitory injunction.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which
      normally cannot be compensated in terms of money
      (3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking
      such relief.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of an
      interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in the
      sound judicial discretion of the Court to be exercised in the
      light of the facts and circumstances in each case. Though the
      above guidelines are neither exhaustive or complete or absolute
      rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances needing
      action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or refusal of
      such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial
      discretion."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">19. The decision in Dorab Cawasji (supra) has been followed by the
Supreme Court in its recent judgment in <a href="/doc/95304362/" id="a_6">Tek Singh v. Shashi Verma</a> 2019
(3) SCALE 86, in which it clarified that "when a mandatory injunction is
granted at the interim stage much more than a mere prima facie case has to
be made out."
</p>

<p id="p_33">20. <a href="/doc/863497/" id="a_7">In Shiv Kumar Chadda v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi</a> (1993) 3
SCC 161, reiterating the above principles, the Supreme Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "30....It has been pointed out repeatedly that a party is not
      entitled to an order of injunction as a matter of right or course.
      Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the court and
      such discretion is to be exercised in favour of the plaintiff only
      if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that unless the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                               Page 12 of 18</span>
       defendant is restrained by an order of injunction, an
      irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the plaintiff
      during the pendency of the suit. The purpose of temporary
      injunction is, thus, to maintain the status quo. The court grants
      such relief according to the legal principles - ex debito
      justitiae. Before any such order is passed the court must be
      satisfied that a strong prima facie case has been made out by
      the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the
      suit and the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal
      of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">21. Matters involving alleged infringement of patents constitute a separate
species of litigation. A further sub-species would be those concerning
pharmaceutical patents. This is because the law concerning them under the
<a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_8">Patents Act</a> 1970 and other related legislation has peculiar elements that
would have to be kept in view by the Court. Unsurprisingly, therefore, there
is a growing volume of Indian case law dealing with the parameters that
should weigh with the Court while examining the case of alleged
infringement of pharmaceutical patents. While the parameters that have to
generally be kept in view in all suits where interim injunctions are sought
would apply in such cases as well, they would indubitably involve other
parameters which have been discussed in a large number of decisions
including the decision that both parties have relied upon, Merck Sharp &amp;
Dohme Corporation (supra). A further example, illustratively, is the
decisions in <a href="/doc/57798471/" id="a_9">Cipla Ltd. v. F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</a>. (2009) 40 PTC 125
(DB). The question of challenge to the validity of pharmaceutical patents
has also engaged the attention of the Indian Courts at all levels. The need for
the principles that would have to be kept in mind while dealing with those
contentions, even at the interim injunction stage, hardly need be emphasised.

(2013) 6 SCC 1.
</p>

<p id="p_36">22. Dr. Singhvi sought to defend the impugned order in so far as the forming
of a view of the existence of a prima facie case in favour of the Plaintiff.
According to him the appellate Court as „a Court of substance‟ has to go by
an overall reading of the order under appeal and not by the particular
wording of it. He referred to paras 12 and 13 of the impugned order and
submitted that they reflected that the learned Single Judge had in effect held
that the Plaintiff had a prima facie case in its favour. The said paras read as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "12. The senior counsel for the defendant draws attention to
         para no.9 of the plaint, where the plaintiff has disclosed Indian
         Patent No.IN 215758 also held by it and has contended that the
         plaintiff, while applying for Indian Patent No.IN 215758 has
         disclosed what is the subject matter of suit patent being Indian
         Patent No.IN 240207, and made a claim with respect
         "REGORAFENIB" but subsequently deleted the same. It is
         argued that Indian Patent No.IN 240207 is invalid for this
         reason only, because the plaintiff, after making a disclosure of
         Indian Patent No.IN 240207 could not have subsequently
         sought separate patent therefor and was not entitled thereto on
         account of waiver and acquiescence. It is also contended that
         there is no inventive step.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">         13. In my view same would be a ground for invalidity of the
         patent. The same would also be a ground for defeating the suit
         and if the suit is defeated, the consequences as provided in the
         order dated 31stMay, 2019 in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. supra
         would not apply."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">23. The observation of the learned Single in para 14 of the impugned order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                             Page 14 of 18</span>
 on the above submission simply reads thus: "The argument of the Defendant
is thus not a ground at least till the next date of hearing, for not passing
interim orders in terms of Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (supra)" Far from
rejecting the submission, the learned Single Judge acknowledges that it
would be „a ground for invalidity of the patent‟ and would also be „a ground
for defeating the suit‟. However, there is no formation of an opinion of the
Plaintiff having made out a prima facie case in its favour for grant of an
interim injunction. Even the order in Sterile Technologies Ltd. (supra)
incorporated as it were „by reference‟ by the learned Single Judge in the
impugned order does not set out any prima facie view. On the contrary, it
records in para 9 that „at this stage, it is not possible to form an opinion,
even prima facie‟. As regards the other two elements viz., balance of
convenience and irreparable hardship, there is no mention of these, even
impliedly in the impugned order.
</p>

<p id="p_38">24. Although, there are special features in litigation involving infringement
of patents, that still would not obviate the Court dealing with the question of
grant of interim injunction to record the three important elements as have
been stressed in a large number of decisions of the Supreme Court. While
the Court agrees with Dr. Singhvi that it is not necessary that the order
granting or refusing interim injunction should expressly state about the
above elements but a reading of the order should indicate the forming of an
opinion by the Court on the said aspects. A reading of the impugned order
does not reflect that the Court has formed such an opinion on the three
elements.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 15 of 18</span>
<p id="p_39"> 25. Again, each case of alleged infringement of patent, particularly a
pharmaceutical patent, would turn on its own facts. It is not possible to
conceive an „across-the-board‟ blanket approach that would apply to all such
cases, where as a matter of routine at the first hearing there would be a grant
of injunction in favour of the Plaintiff. The decision in the application of
interim injunction has to necessarily indicate the view of the Court on the
three elements mentioned herein before and the additional features when it
involves a case of alleged infringement of a patent, and in particular, a
pharmaceutical patent. It is not the length of the order or its precise wording
that matters. It is necessary, however, that the factors mentioned
hereinbefore must be discernible from the order which comes to a
conclusion one way or the other regarding grant of an interim injunction.
</p>

<p id="p_40">26. The Court would also like to add here that the impugned order which
restrains the Defendant from infringing the suit patent does not lend itself to
sufficient clarity. Although the Appellant/Defendant has understood it to
mean that the Defendant is restrained from manufacturing, selling its
product in the market, it would have helped if the order specified what the
Defendant can or cannot do. There is a possibility, given the wording of the
impugned order that it might lead to further litigation on whether in fact
there has been compliance or not with the said order.
</p>

<p id="p_41">27. This Court hastens to clarify that it should not be understood as having
expressed any opinion one way or the other on the respective contentions of
the parties noted hereinbefore. These have been set out only to highlight
what their respective cases at this stage for grant of interim injunction are.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                            Page 16 of 18</span>
<p id="p_42"> These necessarily have to be considered. A reading of the impugned order
does not reflect a consideration of the above issues placed before the Court
by the parties. It must be added that the broad aspects of the submissions are
indeed contained in the plaint, pleadings and documents which were
available to the learned Single Judge when the impugned interim order was
passed.
</p>

<p id="p_43">28. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that the
impugned interim order requires to be set aside and the application for
interim injunction i.e. IA 8878/2019 be heard once again by the learned
Single Judge on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_44">29. It was urged before this Court on behalf of the Respondent/Plaintiff that
till the next date before the learned Single Judge, this Court should continue
the interim injunction granted by the impugned order. The Court is not
inclined to accept this prayer. It is however clarified that the status quo as on
5th July, 2019 prior to the passing of the impugned interim order will be
maintained by the Appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_45">30. The Court directs IA 8878/2019 to be placed for hearing before the
learned Single Judge on 17th July, 2019. The Appellant will, on or before
16th July, 2019 file its reply to the said application with an advance copy to
the Plaintiff. It will be open for the Plaintiff to present its rejoinder thereto,
if any, in the Court on 17th July 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_46">31. The learned Single Judge, will after hearing the parties, pass a fresh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO (OS) (COMM) 158/2019                                              Page 17 of 18</span>
 order uninfluenced by the order in Sterlite Technologies Ltd. (Supra) or the
order dated 5th July 2019, which has been set aside by this Court or by the
present order.
</p>

<p id="p_47">32. The appeal and application are disposed of in the above terms.
</p>

<p id="p_48">33. Copy of this order be given dasti under the signatures of the Court
Master.
