<p id="p_4">2.    <a href="/doc/931916/" id="a_2">In Shanti Fragrances v. Union of India and others</a> 1, a Division

Bench of this Court observed:­

</p><p id="p_5">       12. It does appear that there is a direct conflict between <a href="/doc/907881/" id="a_3">Kothari
       Products [Kothari Products Ltd. v. State of A.P</a>., (2000) 9 SCC
       263], <a href="/doc/1866770/" id="a_4">Radheshyam Gudakhu Factory [State of Orissa v. Radheshyam
       Gudakhu Factory</a>, (2018) 11 SCC 505 : (1988) 68 STC 92 (SC)]
       and Reliance Trading Co. [Reliance Trading Co. v. State of Kerala,
       (2011) 15 SCC 762] judgments on the one hand, and Agra Belting
       Works [CST v. Agra Belting Works, (1987) 3 SCC 140 : 1987 SCC
       (Tax) 233] , which was also followed by two other judgments, on the
       other. We may hasten to add that there are three­Judge Bench
       decisions on both sides. ...”


</p><p id="p_6">3.    The Bench further observed:­

       “13. … One other interesting feature of this case is whether, after
       <a href="/doc/505842/" id="a_5">Union of India v. Raghubir Singh2, SCR</a> at pp. 335­37 : SCC pp. 777­
       78, para 27, it can be stated that Judges of this Court do not sit in 2s
       and 3s for mere convenience, but that a Bench which is numerically
       superior will prevail over a Bench of lesser strength. If the doctrine of
       precedent, as applied by this Court, is to be a matter of numbers,
       then, interestingly enough, as has been held by Beaumont, C.J. in
       Ningappa Ramappa Kurbar v. Emperor3, the position in law could be
       as under: (AIR p. 409 : SCC OnLine Bom)
             “…The Court in that case consisted of five Judges, one of whom,
             Shah, J., dissented from that proposition. The authority of the case
             may be open to question, since there had been a previous decision
             of a Full Bench of this Court of four Judges in Queen
             Empress v. Mugappa Bin Ningapa [Queen Empress v. Mugappa
             Bin Ningapa, ILR (1893) 18 Bom 377] , which had reached a
             different conclusion. Apparently it was considered that five Judges,
             by a majority of four to one, could overrule a unanimous decision of
             four Judges, the net result being that the opinion of four Judges
             prevailed over the opinion of five Judges of co­ordinate jurisdiction.
             There seems to be very little authority on the powers and
             constitution of a Full Bench. There can be no doubt that a Full

1 (2018) 11 SCC 305

3 1941 SCC OnLine Bom 41 : AIR 1941 Bom 408

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                      2</span>
     Bench can overrule a Division Bench, and that a Full Bench must
     consist of three or more Judges; but it would seem anomalous to
     hold that a later Full Bench can overrule an earlier Full Bench,
     merely because the later Bench consists of more Judges than the
     earlier. If that were the rule, it would mean that a Bench of seven
     Judges, by a majority of four to three, could overrule a unanimous
     decision of a Bench of six Judges, though all the Judges were of
     co­ordinate            jurisdiction.        In Enatullah v. Kowsher
     Ali [Enatullah v. Kowsher Ali, 1926 SCC OnLine Cal 104 : ILR
     (1927) 54 Cal 266] , Sanderson, C.J., stating the practice in
     Calcutta, seems to have been of opinion that a decision of a Full
     Bench could only be reversed by the Privy Council or by a Bench
     specially constituted by the Chief Justice. Even if this be the true
     rule, there is nothing to show that the Chief Justice acted upon it
     in <a href="/doc/14028/" id="a_6">Emperor v. Purshottam Ishwar Amin [Emperor</a> v. Purshottam
     Ishwar Amin, 1920 SCC OnLine Bom 144 : ILR (1921) 45 Bom 834]
     . I do not recollect myself ever to have constituted a Special Bench
     to consider the ruling of a Full Bench, though I have constituted
     many Full Benches to consider rulings of Division Benches.
     However, I need not pursue this subject further, since, for the
     purpose of the present appeal, I am prepared to assume that an
     alternative charge of perjury lies, and that it was a charge of that
     nature which the learned Additional Sessions Judge contemplated.
     The question then is whether it is expedient in the interests of
     justice that such a charge should be made.”

</p><p id="p_7">14. This conundrum was also addressed by M.B. Lokur, J. in Supreme

      “669. One of the more interesting aspects of <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_9">Pradeep Kumar

      the 7 (seven) learned Judges constituting the Bench, 5 learned
      Judges overruled the unanimous decision of another set of 5
      learned Judges in <a href="/doc/435970/" id="a_10">Sabhajit Tewary [Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of
      India</a>, (1975) 1 SCC 485 : 1975 SCC (L&amp;S) 99] . Two of the

      Tewary [Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India</a>, (1975) 1 SCC 485 :

      while a total of 7 learned Judges took a particular view on an
      issue of fact and law, that view was found to be incorrect by 5
      learned Judges, whose decision actually holds the field today.
      Is the weight of numbers irrelevant? Is it that only the numbers
      in a subsequent Bench are what really matters? What would
      have been the position if only 4 learned Judges in <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_13">Pradeep

             Would a decision rendered unanimously by a Bench of 5
             learned Judges stand overruled by the decision of 4 learned
             Judges in a subsequent Bench of 7 learned Judges? <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_15">Pradeep

             presents a rather anomalous situation which needs to be
             addressed by appropriate rules of procedure. If this anomaly is
             perpetuated then the unanimous decision of 9 learned Judges
             in Third Judges case [Special Reference No. 1 of 1998, In re,
             (1998) 7 SCC 739] can be overruled (as sought by the learned
             Attorney General) by 6 learned Judges in a Bench of 11 learned
             Judges, with 5 of them taking a different view, bringing the total
             tally of Judges having one view to 14 and having another view
             to 6, with the view of the 6 learned Judges being taken as the
             law!”

</p><p id="p_8">       15. It may be pointed out that in the present case, if numbers are
       totted up, the <a href="/doc/907881/" id="a_16">Kothari Products [Kothari Products Ltd. v. State of A.P</a>.,

<p id="p_12">5.        The ADE Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection

of additional duties of excise in respect of certain goods, over and above

the duties of excise levied under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_22">Central Excise Act</a> 1944.                         The

Statement of Objects of the ADE Act reads:­

                 “The object of the Bill is to impose additional duties of excise in
             replacement of the sales taxes levied by the Union and States on
             sugar, tobacco and mill­made textiles and to distribute the net
             proceeds of these taxes, except the proceeds attributable to Union
             Territories, to the States. The distribution of the proceeds of the
             additional duties broadly follows the pattern recommended by the
             Second Finance Commission. Provision has been made that the
             States which levy a tax on the sale or purchase of these
             commodities after 1.4.1958 do not participate in the distribution of
             the net proceeds. Provision is also being made in the Bill for
             including these three goods in the category of goods declared to be
             of special importance in inter­State trade or commerce so that,
             following the imposition of uniform duties of excise on them, the
             rates of sales tax if levied by any State are subject from 1.4.1958
             to the restrictions in <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_23">Section 15</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.”

             duties of excise in   place of sales tax so far as these goods were
             concerned. Since      the State legislatures were at liberty, if they

            commodities, the Act provided that the additional excise duties will
            be distributed only among such States as did not levy a tax on the
            sale or purchase of these commodities. Also, by including these
            goods in the category of goods declared to be of special importance
            in inter­State trade or commerce, the legislation ensured that, if
            any State levied sales tax in respect of these commodities, such
            levy was subject to the restrictions contained in the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_25">Central Sales
            Tax Act</a>, 1956.”


</p><p id="p_14">7.       It is well settled that once goods are chargeable under the ADE Act,

the State cannot levy sales tax on the same goods under a State

enactment. <a href="/doc/443222/" id="a_26">In Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. v. State of U.P</a> 10., this Court

held:­

            “70. So even if tobacco is an article of luxury, a tax on its supply is
            within the exclusive competence of the State but subject to the
            constitutional curbs prescribed under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_27">Article 286</a> read with
            <a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_28">Sections 14</a> ad 15 of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_29">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956 and most
            importantly the ADE Act of 1957 under which no sales tax can be
            levied on tobacco at all if the State was to take the benefits under
            that Act.”


</p><p id="p_15">8.       In Kothari Products Ltd. (supra), the question was, ‘tobacco’ being

specified in the First Schedule to the ADE Act, and exempted from Sales

Tax under Section 8 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act 1957,

whether ‘gutka’ could be taxed by the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Court

found that “gutka” being tobacco, covered by an Entry in the First

Schedule to the ADE Act and liable to be taxed under the ADE Act, it was

covered by the exemption in Section 8 of the Andhra Pradesh General

Sales Tax Act .       <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_30">The State Act</a> could not have been amended to tax

“gutka”.

</p>



<p id="p_18">10.   In the State of Orrisa vs. Radhey Shyam Gudakhu Factory 11,

the issue was whether Gudakhu was covered by the expression ‘tobacco’

as defined in Section 2(c) of ADE Act.      Following the decision of the

Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/122115/" id="a_31">Gulabchand Harekchand v. State of West

Bengal12</a>, this Court held that Gudakhu is a product of ‘tobacco’ and

hence, a product which falls within the exemption covered by S. No. 35 of

the Schedule to the Orissa Sales Tax Act 1947.

<p id="p_19">11.   <a href="/doc/195215/" id="a_32">In Reliance Trading Company, Kerala v. State of Kerala</a> 13, this

Court took the view that cotton based tarpaulin was exempted from Sales

Tax under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, since it was exigible to

Additional Excise Duty under the First Schedule of the ADE Act.
</p>



<p id="p_20">12.   In Agra Belting Works (supra), the question was whether any class

of goods – cotton fabrics of all kinds, to be specific, exempted from <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_33">Sales

<p id="p_22">13.   In Agra Belting Works (supra), the majority of the three­Judge

Bench of this Court, by ratio of 2:1, inter alia, held:­


          “6. As has been pointed out above, <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_37">Section 3</a> is the charging
          provision; <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_38">Section 3</a>­A authorises variation of the rate of tax and
          <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_39">Section 4</a> provides for exemption from tax. All the three sections are
          parts of the taxing scheme incorporated in the Act and the power
          both under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_40">Section 3</a>­A as also under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_41">Section 4</a> is exercisable by
          the State Government only. When after a notification under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_42">Section
          4</a> granting exemption from liability, a subsequent notification under
          <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_43">Section 3</a>­A prescribes the rate of tax, it is beyond doubt that the
          intention is to withdraw the exemption and make the sale liable to
          tax at the rate prescribed in the notification. As the power both for
          the grant of exemption and the variation of the rate of tax vests in
          the State Government and it is not the requirement of the statute
          that a notification of recall of exemption is a condition precedent to
          imposing tax at any prescribed rate by a valid notification under
          <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_44">Section 3</a>­A, we see no force in the contention of the assessee
          which has been upheld by the High Court. In fact, the second
          notification can easily be treated as a combined notification — both
          for withdrawal of exemption and also for providing higher tax.
          When power for both the operations vests in the State and the
          intention to levy the tax is clear we see no justification for not
          giving effect to the second notification. We would like to point out
          that the exemption was in regard to a class of goods and while the
          exemption continues, a specific item has now been notified under
          <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_45">Section 3</a>­<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_46">A of the Act</a>.”

</p><p id="p_23">14.   B.C. Ray, J. dissenting with the majority view, held:­

          “14. The next question for consideration is what is the effect of a
          notification under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_47">Section 3</a>­A including an item in the Schedule for

          sales tax under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_48">Section 4</a> of the Sales Tax Act.

</p><p id="p_25">          15. A similar question also arose in the case of CST v. Rita Ice
          Cream Co., Gorakhpur [1981 UPTC 1239 (DB)(All HC)] and it was
          held that so long as the general exemption under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_49">Section 4</a>
          continues a particular item notified under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_50">Section 3</a>­<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_51">A of Sales Tax
          Act</a> cannot be taxed.
</p>

<p id="p_26">          16. On a conspectus of all these decisions aforesaid, the only
          irresistible inference follows that so long as the general exemption
          granted under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_52">Section 4</a> with regard to cotton fabrics of all kinds
          continues no sales tax can be imposed on beltings of all kinds
          which fall within the cotton fabrics of all kinds and the general
          exemption under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_53">Section 4</a> will prevail over the notification made
          under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_54">Section 3</a>­<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_55">A of the Sales Tax Act</a>. I am unable to subscribe to
          the view that since the notification under <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_56">Section 3</a>­A of the U.P.
          Sales Tax Act has been made subsequent to the notification issued
          under <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_57">Section 4</a> of the said Act, the subsequent notification under
          <a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_58">Section 3</a>­A will prevail over the general exemption granted under
          <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_59">Section 4</a> of the said Act. In my considered opinion the reasonings
          and conclusions arrived at by the High Court are unexceptionable.”

<p id="p_30">17.   In our considered opinion there is no conflict between the Kothari

Products (supra) line of cases and the Agra Belting line of cases. The

Kothari Products (supra) line of cases was on the question of whether

“tobacco” or other goods specified in the First Schedule to the ADE Act

and hence exempted from Sales Tax under State sales tax enactments,

can be made exigible to tax under the State enactments by amending the

Schedule thereto. On the other hand, Agra Belting Works (supra) line of

cases was on the question of interplay between general exemption of

specified goods from sales tax under Section 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act

through Bhat, J. held:­


          “10. A careful reading of the judgments in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_71">Indra Sawhney v. Union
          of India [Indra Sawhney</a> v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC
          217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1] , clarifies that seven out of nine
          Judges concurred that there exists a quantitative limit on
          reservation—spelt out at 50%. In the opinion of four Judges,
          therefore, per the judgment of B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., this limit
          could be exceeded under extraordinary circumstances and in
          conditions for which separate justification has to be forthcoming by
          the State or the agency concerned. However, there is unanimity in
          the conclusion by all seven Judges that an outer limit for
          reservation should be 50%. Undoubtedly, the other two Judges,
          Ratnavel Pandian and P.B. Sawant, JJ. indicated that there is no
          general rule of 50% limit on reservation. In these circumstances,
          given the general common agreement about the existence of an
          outer limit i.e. 50%, the petitioner&#x27;s argument about the incoherence
          or uncertainty about the existence of the rule or that there were
          contrary observations with respect to absence of any ceiling limit in

         the ratio in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_76">Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India</a>, 1992
         Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1] . It would be useful to
         notice that unanimity in a given Bench (termed as a “super
         majority”) — denoting a 5 : 0 unanimous decision in a Constitution
         Bench cannot be construed as per se a strong or compelling reason
         to doubt the legitimacy of a larger Bench ruling that might contain
         a narrow majority (say, for instance with a 4 : 3 vote, resulting in
         overruling of a previous unanimous precedent). The principle of
         stare decisis operates both vertically — in the sense that decisions
         of appellate courts in the superior in vertical hierarchy, bind
         tribunals and courts lower in the hierarchy, and horizontally — in
         the sense that a larger Bench formation ruling, would be binding
         and prevail upon the ruling of a smaller Bench formation. The logic
         in this stems from the raison d&#x27;être for the doctrine of precedents
         i.e. stability in the law. If this rule were to be departed from and
         the legitimacy of a subsequent larger Bench ruling were to be
         doubted on the ground that it comprises of either plurality of
         opinions or a narrow majority as compared with a previous Bench
         ruling (which might be either unanimous or of a larger majority, but
         of lower Bench strength), there would be uncertainty and lack of
         clarity in the realm of precedential certainty. If precedential
         legitimacy of a larger Bench ruling were thus to be doubted, there
         are no rules to guide the courts&#x27; hierarchy or even later Benches of
         the same court about which is the appropriate reading to be
         adopted (such as for instance, the number of previous judgments
         to be considered for determining the majority, and consequently
         the correct law).
</p>
<p id="p_35">         12. In view of the above reasoning, it is held that the existence of a
         plurality of opinions or discordant or dissident judgments in the
         past — which might even have led to a majority (on an overall
         headcount) supporting a particular rule in a particular case cannot
         detract from the legitimacy of a rule enunciated by a later, larger
         Bench, such as the nine­Judge Bench ruling in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_77">Indra
         Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India</a>, 1992 Supp (3) SCC

<p id="p_49">E.    A similar question has been examined by a Full Bench of the High Court of

      Gujarat in a judgment reported as State of Gujarat v GordhandasKeshavji

      Gandhi and Ors.17. The Court was considering the binding nature of the

      judgments of the Bombay High Court in the successor Gujarat High Court but an

      ancillary question was considered in respect of numerical strength of the Bench

      as well. Though there is divergence of opinion amongst the judges of the Court,

      but the minority view was relevant for the second question arising for

      consideration. The minority view is expressed by N.M. Miabhoy J and

      P.N.Bhagwati J. We are in agreement with the said view. The order passed by

      learned Hon’ble Mr. Justice N.M. Miabhoy J reads thus:

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            “44. ……………The principles which guided the latter Court in the
            matter of judicial precedents have been set out by that Court in
            (1944) 1 KB 718. All Division Benches considered themselves to be
            bound by the judicial precedents created by Full Benches not only
            on the ground of judicial comity but also on the ground that a Full
            Bench consisted of more number of Judges than a Division Bench. If
            a judicial precedent created by a Full Bench required to be
            reconsidered, then, the usual practice was to refer the matter to a
            Full Bench consisting of more number of Judges than the number
            which constituted the former Full Bench whose decision was sought
            to be revised. The practice was to regard the precedent of a larger
            Full Bench as having greater efficacy and binding authority than
            the precedent of a Full Bench consisting of a smaller number of
            Judges. This practice was criticised by Beaumont, C.J. in 43 Bom LR
            864 at p. 868 : (AIR 1941 Bom 408 at p. 409). It is not necessary to
            express any opinion in this case as to whether this criticism was or
            was not justified. However, the observations made by the learned

              Chief Justice in the above case ignores the important fact that,
              when a Full Bench consists of a larger number of Judges, then, the
              decision is not merely of a greater number of Judges, but it is one
              arising from out of the joint deliberations and discussions of a
              greater number of Judges and that this fact may give to the
              decision of a Full Bench consisting of a larger number of Judges a
              greater binding authority than that of a Full Bench consisting of a
              smaller number of Judges…………….. In view of the observations
              made by Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the aforesaid two
              cases18, the view that should prevail in India is the view-that the
              decision of a larger Full Bench should be followed in preference to
              the decision of a smaller Full Bench.

              of Judges than the subsequent Full Bench? The question ultimately
              resolves itself into a narrow one, namely, how far the principle of
              superiority of numerical strength should be carried. If the principle
              of superiority of numerical strength is applied to Full Benches of the
              High Court whatever be the numerical strength of the Judges

                  on the powers and constitution of a Full Bench.-There can be
                  no doubt that a Full Bench can overrule a Division Bench, and
                  that a Full Bench must consist of three or more Judges; but it
                  would seem anomalous to hold that a later Full Bench can
                  Overrule an earlier Full Bench, merely because the later
                  bench consists of more Judges than the earlier. If that were
                  the rule, it would mean that a Bench of seven Judges, by a
                  majority of four to three, could overrule a unanimous
                  decision of a Bench of six Judges, though all the Judges were
                  of co-ordinate jurisdiction.”



            .......................... It was the anomaly of this situation which
            prompted Beaumont, C.J., to make the aforesaid observations. This
            anomaly is, however, inherent in the principle of superiority of
            numerical strength and should not stand in the way of acceptance
            of that principle in its application to Full Benches of the High Court .
            The same anomaly also arises when four or five Judges of the High
            Court, each sitting singly take one view of the law on a particular
            point while a Division Bench consisting of two Judges takes a
            different view or when three or four Division Benches, each
            consisting of two Judges, take one view on a point of law while a
            Full Bench of three Judges takes a different view. The opinion of two
            Judges prevails over the opinion of four or five Judges in the former
            case while in the latter case the opinion of three Judges prevails
            over the opinion of eight or ten Judges, though all the Judges are of
            co-ordinate jurisdiction. This anomaly cannot, therefore, be a valid
            argument against the application of the principle of superiority of
            numerical strength amongst Full Benches of the High Court. The
            principle of superiority of numerical strength is a principle which, as
            I have already pointed out above, imparts flexibility to the law and
            provides an easy machinery within the framework of the High Court
            itself for correction of erroneous decisions which would otherwise
            stand inviolate, immune from challenge except on appeal to the
            Supreme Court.” (Emphasis Supplied)

G.   The conclusion (1) is that a decision delivered by a Bench of largest strength is

     binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength. It is the

     strength of the Bench and not number of Judges who have taken a particular

     view which is said to be relevant. However, conclusion (2) makes it absolutely

     clear that a Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or dissent from the view of

     law taken by a Bench of larger quorum. Quorum means the bench strength

     which was hearing the matter.

<p id="p_54">H.   Thus, it has been rightly concluded that the numerical strength of the Judges

     taking a particular view is not relevant, but the Bench strength is determinative

     of the binding nature of the Judgment.
