           objection about their locus. According to the respondent - Bank, the

           petitioners have failed to substantiate that all or anyone of them
             


           possesses the requisite qualification and eligibility criterion for

           inspite of being called upon to furnish such information, the petitioners





           have failed to do so. Moreover, this petition has been filed only after

           realising that the companion petition would fail. For that reason alone,

           the petition should be dismissed. According to the respondent - Bank,





           the recruitment process through campus interview is a well known

           method of recruitment for quite some time.         The selection through

           campus recruitment is a separate mechanism and is incomparable with

           completed their education and as they are not pursuing any course in

           any Institution,   cannot complain about discrimination.             Moreover,




                                                           
           campus recruitment is the need of the contemporary business

           techniques, policies and initiatives for which reason, it cannot be said to




                                               
           be unreasonable. The mechanism provided for campus recruitment is
                                 
           not only transparent and fair but also ensures objectivity. In that, an

           independent committee of experts is appointed to consider the

           any malafide exercise of power in formulation of the recruitment policy

           appointment through the campus interview as per that policy. As a

           result, the challenge to the recruitment policy is completely devoid of

           merits and moreso, at the instance of the petitioners, who cannot claim

           to be on par with the class of candidates considered in campus

           employment, but raising issues which go to the root of authority of the





           State and Instrumentalities of the State to adopt policy, which is in the

           teeth of the rights guaranteed to the citizens of India under Part III of the

           Constitution of India.   We are not impressed by the objection under

           been filed only to overcome the deficiencies noticed in the companion




                                                           
           writ petition during the arguments, none of these objections commend to

           us.   Firstly, the fact that this petition, filed in the year 2012,         takes




                                                
           exception to the policy formulated in the year 2009. The fact that the
                                 
           said policy has been implemented since then, does not and cannot

           denude the petitioners of their remedy to complain about the infraction
                                
           of their rights guaranteed by the Constitution.       There is nothing on

           record to indicate that the decision to adopt procedure of recruitment
             


           through campus interview to fill in the vacancies earmarked for direct
          



           recruits, which was given effect to since 2009, was in public domain.

<p id="p_24">           The petitioners herein cannot be expected to have access to that





           information.   The petitioners on affidavit have stated that they got

           knowledge about the same only after reading news item regarding

           pendency of other petitions in this Court, which appeared in the local





           newspaper very recently. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of

           this statement.   Even otherwise, the argument of laches because of

           implementation of the policy for last around 3 years, is too

           hypertechnical argument to throw out the petition at the threshold.

           persons from questioning the policy of the respondent-bank, which

           permits   such   recruitment    method        against   public     posts,      being

<p id="p_59">             50. It is argued that in a country like India where
             there is so much poverty and unemployment and
          



             there is no equality of bargaining power, the action of
             the State in not making the employees permanent,
             would be violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_40">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. But
             the very argument indicates that there are so many
             waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for





             competing for employment and it is in that context
             that the Constitution as one of its basic features, has
             included Articles 14, 16 and 309 so as to ensure that
             public employment is given only in a fair and
             equitable manner by giving all those who are





             qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the
             guise of upholding rights under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_41">Article 21</a> of the
             Constitution of India, a set of persons cannot be

                         this juncture. The law is dynamic and our Constitution
                         is a living document. May be at some future point of
                         time, the right to employment can also be brought in




                                                                                      
                         under the concept of right to life or even included as a
                         fundamental right. The new statute is perhaps a
                         beginning. As things now stand, the acceptance of




                                                              
                         such a plea at the instance of the employees before
                         us would lead to the consequence of depriving a large
                         number of other aspirants of an opportunity to
                         compete for the post or employment. Their right to




                                                             
                         employment, if it is a part of right to life, would stand
                         denuded by the preferring of those who have got in
                         casually or those who have come through the back
                         door. The obligation cast on the State under <a href="/doc/1331994/" id="a_43">Article
                         39(a)</a> of the Constitution of India is to ensure that all




                                                 
                         citizens equally have the right to adequate means of
                         livelihood. It will be more consistent with that policy if
                         the courts recognize that an appointment to a post in
                                 
                         government service or in the service of its
                         instrumentalities, can only be by way of a proper
                         selection in the manner recognized by the relevant
                                
                         legislation in the context of the relevant provisions of
                         the Constitution. In the name of individualizing justice,
                         it is also not possible to shut our eyes to the
                         constitutional scheme and the right of the numerous
                         as against the few who are before the court. The
             


                         Directive Principles of State Policy have also to be
                         reconciled with the rights available to the citizen
          



                         under Part III of the Constitution and the obligation of

                   against violation of such rights by direct access to the
                   highest Court of the country. Part IV enumerates

           for campus recruitment. That may give rise to all kinds of situations and

            cadre can also continue to be provided differential
            remuneration. This will help banks attract talented individuals
          



            in operational areas like marketing, information technology, risk
            management and credit. Such differential remuneration will be
            subject to an overall ceiling for establishment expenditure.

            varying number of employees and their levels of performance.
            The guideline prescribing a uniform contribution of 3 per cent
            of the bank's Net Profit or a maximum of Rs. 10 crore will be
            replaced by an upper ceiling on the contribution to be made

           the Constitution, namely, the Principle of Equality enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_95">Article 14</a>

           of which <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_96">Article 16 (1)</a> is a facet.          The private sector has no
                                 
           constitutional obligation towards upholding of the justice-social,

           economic and political and adherence to equality of status and
             


           opportunity to all the citizens of the country, unlike in the case of State
          



           and the Instrumentalities of the State. The State Authorities have to

           strive to maintain and preserve the well cherished rights guaranteed by





           the Constitution of equality much less of opportunity in the matter of

           public employment. Notably, the Constitution recognises that it is the

           obligation of the State to provide work to all the citizens within the limits





           of its economic capacity and development for securing the right to work,

           as per <a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_97">Article 41</a> of the Constitution of India. Public posts or public

           observe that the classification, in order to be outside the vice of
          



           inequality, must be founded on an intelligible differentia, which on

           rational grounds distinguishes persons grouped together from those left
