the said amount from the students.

would submit that as in view of the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/270006/" id="a_7">Midnapore

Peoples' Coop. Bank Ltd. v. Chunilal Nanda</a>, [(2006) 5 SCC 399] an appeal

in terms of <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_8">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1970 would be

maintainable, the special appeal filed by the respondent should have been

dismissed in limine. It was urged that as the special appeal itself was not

maintainable, any interlocutory order passed therein should be held to be a

nullity. It was pointed out that in any event as merely a show cause notice

had been issued by the learned Single Judge by an order dated 31st August,

2006, no appeal lay thereagainst. As the decision of the learned Single

Judge dated 31st August, 2006 was binding on the State of Uttar Pradesh and

as prima facie the State has committed an act of contempt in issuing the

impugned GO. dated 7th September, 2006, the first respondent herein who

was aware of the said order could be proceeded against for commission of

contempt. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_9">Babulal v. Municipal

Corpn., Ratlam</a>, [ (2005) 13 SCC 101], where it was held :-.

              debatable one, particularly having regard to the

<p id="p_25">13.   Mr. A. Mariarputham, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

respondent No.1, on the other hand would contend :-



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      (i)     A valuable right of the appellant to receive fees from the

              students having been taken away by reason of the order passed

              by the learned Single Judge the Special Appeal was

              maintainable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      (ii)    As it is accepted that an appeal under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_11">Section 19</a> of the

              Contempt of Courts Act would have otherwise been

              maintainable before a Division Bench, it did not matter whether

              the Division Bench exercised its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_12">Section 19</a>

              of the Contempt of Courts Act or under the Letters Patent of

              the High Court.

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      (iii)   In view of the subsequent event, namely - determination of the

              same amount of fees by the Committee which has also received

            the approval of the Government having been questioned before

            the High Court in a writ petition and the matter is pending

            judgment, this Court should not interfere with the impugned

            order.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_26">14.   The controversy as regards exercise of jurisdiction of the appellate

court under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_13">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of the Court Act is a vexed one.

Whereas one line of decisions beginning from <a href="/doc/378445/" id="a_14">Baradakanta Mishra v.

Justice Gatikrushna Misra</a>, [ (1975) 3 SCC 535 ] till Midnapore Peoples'

Coop. Bank Ltd. (supra) is that an appeal would be maintainable only when

an order of punishment has been made, in <a href="/doc/553513/" id="a_15">R.N. Dey v. Bhagyabati

Pramanik</a>, [ (2000) 4 SCC 400 ] it has been held to be maintainable if the

jurisdiction is excised by any court under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_16">Contempt Courts Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_27">15.   The question, we may notice, has been referred to a 3 Judge Bench in

Dharam Singh v. Guljari Lal &amp; Ors. [Civil Appeal No.18852 of 2005).


</p><p id="p_28">      We, therefore, need not decide the larger question, namely,

maintainability of the appeal under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_17">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts

Act, 1970 vis-`-vis maintainability of the Special Appeal under the Letters

Patent of the High Court, since the matter has been referred to a larger

Bench.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      10</span><p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">16.      We, however wish to deal with the basic issue. Appellant filed the

writ petition, inter alia, for a direction upon the State to regulate

professional education so far as it, inter alia, relates to fixation of fee. First

Respondent admittedly runs a professional institution. It, subject to any

law, would be bound by the decision of this Court in T.M.A. pai (supra).

The contemnor or the institution which he represents, however, was not a

party.     If he was not a party, subject to statutory interdict, only in

exceptional cases, he may be proceeded against under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_18">Contempt of

Courts Act</a>, 1970. It is one thing to say that a direction having been issued

upon the State Government; issuance of a Government Order in exercise of

its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_19">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India would attract

the wrath of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_20">Contempt of Courts Act</a>; but it would be another thing to

say that a party who merely derives benefit from such Government Order

would also be liable to be proceeded against under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_21">Contempt of Courts

Act</a> despite the fact that he was not a party to the judgment.


</p><p id="p_31">17.      The learned Single Judge did not address itself to this aspect of the

matter at all. Ordinarily, a person if not a party to the lis and no direction

having been issued against him, a contempt petition against him would not

lie. Whether an exceptional case has been made out against him is yet to be

determined.

PC 295], it has been observed :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">            "The question whether a contempt committed not
            by any person inhibited by injunction for breach of
            that injunction but by a person said to have aided
            and abetted a person so inhibited in breaking the
            injunction is of such a criminal nature as to
            prevent an appeal has given rise to much
            controversy, controversy which in the present case
            this Board does not think it necessary to resolve.
            The respondents themselves when petitioning the
            Court asked the Court to issue notice upon the
            opposite parties to show cause why they should
            not be committed for contempt for disobedience of
            the injunction. Strictly speaking this was a wrong
            remedy to ask against Ghose and Banerjee. The
            injunction was not binding on them and they had
            never disobeyed it. The petition should have
            asked that they be committed for aiding and
            abetting the Secretary of State in his disobedience.
            Indeed on the authority of 1848) - 11 Beav 180
            and 181, the High Court might well have
            dismissed the petition against those two appellants
            and left the petitioners to apply again in proper
            form. Though the High Court did not do so but
            treated the petition as if application had been made
            to commit those appellants for contempt in aiding
            and abetting the Secretary of State, yet their
            Lordships do not think, the respondents have any
            cause of complaint if the Court in admitting the
            appeal treated the case (as the respondents
            themselves had done) as being a petition for
            breach of the injunction and gave a certificate as in
            a civil matter."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_34">19.   It is one thing to say that a person claiming title or any other right is

bound by a direction issued to another through or under whom he is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12</span>

claiming a right but it may not be correct to opine that a person who has

nothing to do with the functions of the State would also be liable therefor.

In any event, the issue admittedly is a debatable one. It is required to be

gone into. Without any application of mind in this behalf on the part of the

High Court not only a notice has been issued but also an interim order has

been passed which vitally affects the respondents No.1.


</p><p id="p_35">      A person aggrieved by an order must have a remedy. Technicalities

of law should not be allowed to come on his way to move the higher courts.


</p><p id="p_36">20.   If Mr. Mishra is correct in his contention that an appeal was

maintainable under <a href="/doc/1686702/" id="a_23">Section 19</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, such an

appeal would also lie before a Division Bench of the High Court. It may,

subject to just exceptions, not matter much as to whether an appeal is

entertained under the said provision or under the Letters Patent of the High

Court. The Division Bench of the High Court, therefore, could entertain an

appeal subject, of course, to allocation subject matters by the Chief Justice

of High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">21.   There cannot, however, be any doubt or dispute that this Court has

the jurisdiction to interfere with both the orders under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_24">Article 136</a> of the

Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_40">22.   Once the counsel for the parties are heard at great length, this Court

may in appropriate cases and in particular a case of this nature and keeping

in view the subsequent events may either refuse to interfere with the

original writ proceedings, could be proceeded against, is a debatable one.

Such a question, therefore, was required to be determined at the threshold.

If prima facie two views are possible and unless it is firmly held that the

respondent No.1 not only was bound by the directions issued by the High

Court but he had also defied it willfully and deliberately, he cannot be

punished for commission of contempt.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">            "19. It may be true that this Court upon hearing
            the parties, by the order dated 1.5.2007 granted the
            respondent 15 days' time to deposit all arrears of
            rent at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month including
            the rent for the month of April 2007. We are not
            concerned with the implementation of the said
            order as violation thereof is not the subject matter
            of the contempt proceedings pending before us.
            The order of this Court properly construed,
            therefore, would mean that the admitted lease
            would cover only 16,000 square feet of land.
            Different phraseologies like "entire" and
            "admitted" have been used by this Court.
            Construction of the said order, therefore, must be
            resorted to upon reading the same in its entirety. It
            is a well settled principle of law that if two
            interpretations are possible of the order which is
            ambiguous, a contempt proceeding would not be
            maintainable. <a href="/doc/1333014/" id="a_29">In The State of Bihar v. Rani

                   if on a proper construction of the order, read
                   in the light of the relevant pleadings, the
                   State Government was directed to abstain
                   from publishing a notification under <a href="/doc/1075225/" id="a_30">Section
                   3(1)</a> of the Act, still, if the order was
                   ambiguous and equivocal and reasonably
                   capable of two interpretations, a party who

                    interpretations could not be held to have
                    willfully disobeyed the order. Stated in
                    these terms, the contention appears
                    unexceptionable. For its being accepted in
                    any particular case, however, two conditions
                    have to be satisfied: (1) that the order was
                    ambiguous and was reasonably capable of
                    more than one interpretation, (2) that the
                    party being proceeded against in fact did not
                    intend to disobey the order, but conducted
                    himself in accordance with his interpretation
                    of the order.'
              This aspect of the matter has been considered by
              this Court in Purnendu Mukhopadhyay and Ors. v.

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">            "In our view the aforesaid contention for the
            learned counsel for the respondents requires to be
            rejected on the ground that after receipt of the
            notice, officers concerned tendered unconditional
            apology and after accepting the same, the High
            Court rejected the prayer for discharge of the rule
            issued for contempt action. When the court either
            suo motu or on a motion or a reference, decides to
            take action and initiate proceedings for contempt,
            it assumes jurisdiction to punish for contempt. The
            exercise of jurisdiction to punish for contempt
            commences with the initiation of a proceeding for
            contempt and if the order is passed not discharging
            the rule issued in contempt proceedings, it would
            be an order or decision in exercise of its
            jurisdiction to punish for contempt. Against such
            order, appeal would be maintainable."

allow the interim order passed by the learned Single Judge to continue;

assuming that the Division Bench had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal

and consequently pass the interim order staying the operation of the order of

the learned Single Judge. While, therefore, quashing both the orders, we

would request the learned Single Judge to consider the merit of contempt

matter only after disposal of the Writ Petition No.2117 (M/S) of 2006.
