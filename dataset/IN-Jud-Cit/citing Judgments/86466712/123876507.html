this manner are governed by &#x27;Terms and Conditions&#x27; of the Amazon Global

Purchase Order in November, 2017, the disclosure of which would have led
to rejection of the plaint at the outset; (d) Terms and Conditions stipulate
and customers agree inter alia that the sale takes place in USA; orders from
Amazon Global Store are placed with Amazon USA; products ordered are
not imported into India at the time of purchase; prospective sales shall be in
USA and subject to its laws, regulations and under the exclusive jurisdiction
of State of Washington; (e) infringement, if any, has taken place in USA as
all elements of sale, including offer, acceptance, placing of orders as well as
conclusion of the sale transaction occurred in USA, i.e., outside the territory
of India; (f) <a href="/doc/1624758/" id="a_2">Section 1(2)</a> of the Act provides that the Act extends to whole of
India and, therefore, if this Court was to assume jurisdiction, it would
tantamount to giving the Act extra-territorial application, which will be in
conflict with the Legislative mandate, since Defendant No. 2 has no business
activity/website operational in India; (g) Plaintiffs have resorted to clever
drafting of the plaint to create a false impression that they are the sole and
exclusive worldwide owners of Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC)

the case and moreover, the goods pass at the time the contract is entered
into. Seen in this light, sale and transfer of goods in the present case would
be governed by the Terms and Conditions of the Amazon Global Store in
USA; (i) Defendant No. 2 neither runs a website nor offers for sale/sells any
goods in India and no allegation of infringement of trademarks of the
Plaintiffs can be levelled against it, particularly, in view of the admission of

have deliberately concealed a material document, i.e., the Terms and

a ground which the Court ought to examine at the stage of an application

under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, as no party can come to the Court with
unclean hands. <a href="/doc/154710601/" id="a_8">In Dahiben v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali (Gajra) Dead
Through Legal Representatives and Others</a>, 2020 (7) SCC 366, the
Supreme Court held that the Trial Court rightly exercised the power under
Order VII Rule 11 CPC, once it was found that there was an omission of the
date of the registered sale-deed, which had an impact on the decision with
respect to limitation. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/186792334/" id="a_9">Nawal Singh v. Chaman Lal &amp;
Ors</a>., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 500, to contend that while examining an
application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, not only the plaint but also the
documents filed along with it and those which ought to have been filed but
were deliberately withheld, can be seen. Reliance is placed on the judgment
in <a href="/doc/43753121/" id="a_10">Xavier D&#x27;Souza &amp; Anr. v. Luis D&#x27;Souza &amp; Anr</a>., 2008 SCC OnLine

documents is intentional and made to deceive the Court, the plaint must be
rejected.
</p><p id="p_12">5.      Responding to the contentions raised on behalf of Defendant No. 2,
learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs submits: (a) Plaintiffs are carrying
on business within the territorial limits of this Court in a variety of ways
such as, but not limited to, sale of their products, under their trademarks, to
consumers in Delhi, through exclusive brick and mortar shops and on their
own website as well as the website of their licensees and thus, this Court has

customers, including Delhi, as averred in paragraphs 30, 31, 33, 37, 44 to 52
and 60 of the plaint and thus, cause of action has arisen within the territorial
limits of this Court under Section 20(c) CPC; (c) this Court in <a href="/doc/174163570/" id="a_12">Burger King
Corporation v. Techchand Shewakramani &amp; Ors</a>., 2018 SCC OnLine Del
10881 and <a href="/doc/146301412/" id="a_13">Exxon Mobil Corporation v. Exoncorp Private Limited</a>, 2019
SCC OnLine Del 9193, has held that in a case involving trademark,
infringement happens when a person &#x27;uses&#x27; the mark in the course of the
trade and &#x27;use&#x27; would include &#x27;offer for sale&#x27;. As Defendant No. 1&#x27;s website
offers counterfeit products for sale to customers at Delhi, suit is
maintainable before this Court and applying the law propounded in
Millennium &amp; Copthorne International Limited (supra), Banyan Tree
Holding (P) Limited (supra) and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.
(supra); (d) under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_14">Section 29(6)(b)</a> of the Act, a mere offer for sale of an
infringing product constitutes a cause of action for filing a suit for
infringement under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_15">Section 29</a> of the Act; (e) for the purpose of adjudicating
the present application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, Court                         is only
required to examine the plaint on a demurrer to see if it sets out a cause of
action, which is triable and no reliance can be placed on pleadings or

the contract of sale and purchase; (h) reliance by Defendant No. 2 on <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_19">Sale of

against the Defendants is infringement of their trademarks under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_20">Section 29</a>
of the Act premised on offer to sell and, therefore, place of completion of
transaction is irrelevant; (i) Defendant No. 2 has alleged that it has procured
the infringing goods from a lawful source in the USA, which it has
described as BHPC Associates LLC, however, no material of the alleged
procurement/purchase has been filed on record. Plaintiffs have no
affiliation/association/economic link with the said Company or any of its
beneficiaries and plea of international exhaustion is not available to

embody the principle of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to

</p><p id="p_21">8.      In order to examine this issue, it is relevant to examine the grounds on
which the Plaintiffs have claimed jurisdiction of this Court and the
paragraph relating to jurisdiction in the plaint is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        &quot;62. This Hon&#x27;ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to
        entertain, try and adjudicate the present Commercial Suit under
        Section 134(2) of the TM Act as the Plaintiffs are carrying on
        their business within the territorial limits of this Hon&#x27;ble Court
        in a variety of ways such as (but not limited to) sale of its
        products under the Plaintiffs Trade Marks to consumers in
        Delhi. Specifically, the products of the Plaintiffs are available
        for sale in malls such as Select Citywalk, Saket, Promenade
        Mall, Vasant Kunj, amongst others. The Plaintiffs products are
        also available for sale to customers in Delhi through the
        website of its licensees. Any internet user in Delhi can access
        the Plaintiffs licensees website and purchase Plaintiffs
        products. Furthermore, the Defendant also carries on business
        operations from within the territorial jurisdiction of this
        Hon&#x27;ble Court. The Defendant No. 1 operates/runs website
        namely, &lt;www.amazon.in&gt; which specifically targets
        consumers based in Delhi amongst others and a transaction
        can be concluded through such website in Delhi. The
        Counterfeit Products available for sale on the website of the
        Defendant No. 1 can be purchased by any customer in Delhi.

Bench in <a href="/doc/123737198/" id="a_25">Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Purshottam Kumar
Chaubey &amp; Ors</a>., 2016 SCC OnLine Del 376, and for ready reference, para

        interpretation given to the expression &quot;carries on business&quot; in
        the context of a defendant under section 20 of the Code has also
        been employed in the context of a plaintiff under the said

<p id="p_24">10.     <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_32">Section 134</a> of the Act provides that a suit for infringement etc., can
be instituted within the jurisdiction of a Court in which the person/entity
instituting the suit actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or
personally works for gain. To bring the case within the four corners of
<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_33">Section 134(2)</a> of the Act, it is pleaded that Plaintiffs are carrying on

view, this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit under <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_34">Section
134(2)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_26">11.     Section 20(c) CPC provides that a suit can be instituted at any place
where the cause of action, wholly or in part arises. In order to test the claim
of the Plaintiffs with respect to jurisdiction under Section 20(c) CPC, it
needs to be examined as to what constitutes &#x27;cause of action&#x27;, in respect of a
suit alleging violation of intellectual property rights, more particularly, a
claim for infringement and passing off, as in the present case. This question
has been answered by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Burger King
Corporation (supra), relying on the judgments in Indian Performing Rights
Society Limited (supra) and Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and
relevant paras are as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        &quot;19. What constitutes cause of action in the context of a suit
        alleging violation of rights in a trade mark, would therefore be
        the question. In a case involving trade mark infringement,
        infringement happens when a person &quot;uses in the course of
        trade&quot; any mark without the owner&#x27;s consent. Thus, use of a
        mark is the cause of action in an infringement as also in a
        passing off action. If use takes place in a territory where the
        suit is filed, that Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
        When there is use of a mark, there is a cause of action to sue,
        where the use takes place. it is relevant to point out that &quot;use&quot;
        of a trademark as per Section 2(2)(c) of the TM Act is as under:

<p id="p_27">12.     Court has ruled that in a suit involving infringement of a trademark,
cause of action would arise in each and every place where there is use of the
mark, in any form. &#x27;Use&#x27; would include advertisement, promotion, actual
sale of goods as also offer for sale.
</p><p id="p_28">13.     Returning to the facts of the case and testing them on the anvil of the
tests laid down in Burger King Corporation (supra), Plaintiffs have &#x27;used&#x27;
the mark by selling their products to the customers in Delhi, through
exclusive brick and mortar shops in the two malls, aforementioned through
their franchisees/licensees. Additionally, Defendant No. 1 operates its
website, which specifically targets consumers based in Delhi and though the
orders placed by the purchasers are fulfilled by Defendant No. 2, the
transaction is entered into by the consumers at Delhi. Even assuming for the
sake of argument that Plaintiffs do not have an outlet in Delhi, in this day
and time, in my opinion, Defendants&#x27; conduct of business through a website,
where they offer goods for sale, targeting customers in Delhi, thereby raising
queries, would confer jurisdiction on this Court as there is &#x27;offer for sale&#x27;
and consequently &#x27;use&#x27; of the trademark, within the territorial jurisdiction of
this Court. Plaintiffs have filed a screenshot of the website of Defendant
No. 1, showing availability of the products, alleged to be counterfeit and the
same are accessible not only globally but also in India, including Delhi. The
fact that the goods offered on this website are accessible to customers at
Delhi and are also delivered, when an order is placed, is reflected from the
&#x27;location PIN code&#x27; appearing on the screenshot of the website:-

Therefore, Plaintiffs are right in contending that the impugned products are
being offered for sale in Delhi and this Court finds that they are also being
sold and delivered to the customers at Delhi. In this context, this Court also
relies on <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_51">Section 29(6)(b)</a> of the Act, which provides that a mere &#x27;offer for
sale&#x27; of an infringing product would constitute a cause of action for a claim
for infringement under <a href="/doc/95550/" id="a_52">Section 29</a> of the Act. Before drawing the curtains on
this aspect, I may profitably refer to a few judicial precedents.
</p><p id="p_31">14.     In Banyan Tree Holding (P) Limited (supra), the Division Bench of
this Court held that in order to prima facie establish the jurisdiction of this
Court, Plaintiff would have to show that the Defendant engaged in some
commercial activity in the Forum State by targeting its website specifically
at the customers within that State. Relevant paras of the judgment are as
follows:-
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(COMM) 1015/2018                                                             Page 13 of 25</span>

         &quot;42. This Court holds that jurisdiction of the forum court does
        not get attracted merely on the basis of interactivity of the
        website which is accessible in the forum state. The degree of the
        interactivity apart, the nature of the activity permissible and
        whether it results in a commercial transaction has to be
        examined. For the &#x27;effects&#x27; test to apply, the Plaintiff must
        necessarily plead and show prima facie that the specific
        targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an
        injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state. For the
        purposes of a passing off or an infringement action (where the
        plaintiff is not located within the jurisdiction of the court), the
        injurious effect on the Plaintiff&#x27;s business, goodwill or
        reputation within the forum state as a result of the Defendant&#x27;s
        website being accessed in the forum state would have to be
        shown. Naturally therefore, this would require the presence of
        the Plaintiff in the forum state and not merely the possibility of
        such presence in the future. Secondly, to show that an injurious
        effect has been felt by the Plaintiff it would have to be shown
        that viewers in the forum state were specifically targeted.
        Therefore the &#x27;effects&#x27; test would have to be applied in
        conjunction with the &quot;sliding scale&quot; test to determine if the
        forum court has jurisdiction to try a suit concerning internet
        based disputes.
</p><p id="p_34">        xxx                                      xxx                           xxx
</p><p id="p_35">        45. This court holds that in order to prima facie establish
        that the Defendant purposefully availed of the jurisdiction of
        this court, the Plaintiff would have to show that the Defendant
        engaged in some commercial activity in the forum State by
        targeting its website specifically at customers within that State.
        This is consistent with the law laid down in Cybersell and
        reiterated later in Toys R Us. It is also consistent with the
        application of the &#x27;tighter&#x27; version of the &#x27;effects&#x27; test which is
        &#x27;targeting&#x27;. In any action for passing off or infringement, it
        would have to be shown that the Defendant by using its mark
        intended to pass off its goods as that of the Plaintiff&#x27;s. A mere
        hosting of a website which can be accessible from anyone from
        within the jurisdiction of the court is not sufficient for this

        purpose. Also a mere posting of an advertisement by the
        Defendant depicting its mark on a passive website which does
        not enable the Defendant to enter into any commercial
        transaction with the viewer in the forum state cannot satisfy the
        requirement of giving rise to a cause of action in the forum
        state. Even an interactive website, which is not shown to be
        specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for
        commercial transactions, will not result in the court of the
        forum state having jurisdiction. In sum, for the purposes of
        <a href="/doc/726664/" id="a_53">Section 20</a> (c) CPC, in order to show that some part of the
        cause of action has arisen in the forum state by the use of the
        internet by the Defendant, the Plaintiff will have to show prima
        facie that the said website, whether euphemistically termed as
        &quot;passive plus&quot; or &quot;interactive&quot; was specifically targeted at
        viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions. The
        Plaintiff would have to plead this and produce material to
        prima facie show that some commercial transaction using the
        website was entered into by the Defendant with a user of its
        website within the forum state and that the specific targeting of
        the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm
        to the Plaintiff within the forum state. Question no. (ii) is
        answered accordingly.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_37">15.     Relevant would it be to note that neither of the Defendants has denied
that Defendant No. 1 offers the products in question on its website and the
orders are fulfilled by Defendant No. 2. The stand of Defendant No. 2 is that
it is not running a website by itself and in any case certainly not a website
that offers goods carrying the trademarks of the Plaintiffs and that Defendant
No. 1 runs a website on which customers place orders albeit Defendant No.
2 fulfils the orders, restricted to USA. In my view, the distinction sought to
be brought out by Defendant No. 2 is inconsequential, insofar as the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court is concerned, inasmuch as the
commercial relationship between the Defendants is undisputed, as noted

above. Court finds strength in this view from the judgment of this Court in
Millennium &amp; Copthorne International Limited (supra), where it was held
that if the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit
owing to Defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and
enabling Defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business at Delhi,
there was no reason to hold that it will not be so where the Defendants,
instead of hosting their own interactive website, avail the services of third
party websites to carry on business at Delhi and there is no rationale for
carving out such a distinction. Relevant para of the judgment is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">        &quot;24. In continuation of what was held by the Division Bench
        in World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., I may state that the
        mode of booking/reserving rooms and other facilities
        particularly of dining therein, in hotels/resorts/spas, has
        changed over the years with maximum number of
        bookings/reservations being made through such third party
        websites, so much so that the rates available on the third party
        websites are also found to be considerably lower than the rates
        offered through traditional mode of agents or offices in major
        cities. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that much of the
        volume of businesses of hotels is now through such third party
        websites, in comparison to the business through direct bookings
        and/or through travel agents. Thus, if the Courts at Delhi will
        have jurisdiction over subject matter of suit owing to
        defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and
        enabling defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business
        at Delhi, I see no reason to hold that it will not be so where the
        defendants, instead of hosting its own interactive website,
        avails the service of third party websites to carry on business at
        Delhi. There is no rationale for carving out such a distinction.</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">        Certainly, making a booking/reservation, even if the same does
        not subsequently materialise, is part of carrying on business,
        inasmuch as the hotel which has taken the booking, even if has
        not received any payment, being unable to turn back a customer
        if shows up in pursuance to such booking. The defendants, by

        showing on their websites, their location to be at Delhi, are
        also found to be attracting and luring the customers, otherwise
        intending to visit Delhi, into believing that the hotels and
        resorts of the defendants are at Delhi, though actually,
        territorially speaking, outside Delhi. The defendants, cannot be
        permitted to take different stand/position while carrying on
        business than before this Court. In any case, such acts of the
        defendants amount to specifically targeting the viewers at
        Delhi, within the meaning of Banyan Tree Holding (P)
        Ltd. supra.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_41">16.     I may also allude to two passages from the judgment in World
Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (supra), which are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">        &quot;23. Let us now apply these principles to the type of
        transaction over the internet, which we have explained above.
        The website of the appellant/plaintiff refers to various goods
        and services. It is not an offer but an invitation to an offer, just
        as a menu in a restaurant. The invitation, if accepted by a
        customer in Delhi, becomes an offer made by the customer in
        Delhi for purchasing the goods &quot;advertised&quot; on the website of
        the appellant/plaintiff. When, through the mode of the software
        and the browser, the transaction is confirmed and payment is
        made to the appellant/plaintiff through its website, the
        appellant/plaintiff accepts the offer of the customer at Delhi.
        Since the transaction between the two takes place
        instantaneously, the acceptance by the appellant/plaintiff is
        instantaneously communicated to its customer through the
        internet at Delhi. Therefore, in such a case, part of the cause of
        action would arise in Delhi.</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">        21. But, we are not concerned with the question of cause of
        action between the appellant/plaintiff and its customers in
        Delhi because the defendants are not such customers and they
        are, in any event, all residents of Mumbai. What we are
        examining is whether the third condition specified in Dhodha
        House (supra) is satisfied or not. In other words, if the
        contracts and/or transactions entered into between the
        appellant/plaintiff on the one hand and its customers are being



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(COMM) 1015/2018                                                             Page 17 of 25</span>

        concluded in Delhi, can it not be said that the essential part of
        the business of the appellant/plaintiff, insofar as its transactions
        with customers in Delhi are concerned, takes place in Delhi?
        The offers are made by customers at Delhi. The offers are
        subject to confirmation/acceptance of the appellant/plaintiff
        through its website. The money would emanate or be paid from
        Delhi. Can it not then be considered that the appellant/plaintiff
        is, to a certain extent, carrying on business at Delhi? In our
        view, it would be so. Because of the advancements in
        technology and the rapid growth of new models of conducting
        business over the internet, it is possible for an entity to have a
        virtual presence in a place which is located at a distance from
        the place where it has a physical presence. The availability of
        transactions through the website at a particular place is
        virtually the same thing as a seller having shops in that place in
        the physical world. Let us assume for the sake of argument that
        the appellant/plaintiff had a shop in Delhi from where it sold its
        various goods and services. In that case, it could not be denied
        that the plaintiff carried on business in Delhi. This is apart
        from the fact that the appellant/plaintiff may also have been
        regarded as having voluntarily resided in Delhi. When the shop
        in the &#x27;physical sense&#x27; is replaced by the &#x27;virtual&#x27; shop because
        of the advancement of technology, in our view, it cannot be said
        that the appellant/plaintiff would not carry on business in
        Delhi.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_44">17.     Applying the analogy on facts and ratio of the judgment to the present
case, in my view, this suit is maintainable on a plain reading of the plaint
and the documents appended thereto, as there is offer of sale and ex-
consequentia use of the mark, giving rise to cause of action before this
Court. Whether the Defendants would succeed in the defences raised on
merits, is a matter of trial.

is the cause of action, was made in USA and governed by Global Store
Terms and Conditions and had this been disclosed, the suit was liable to be
dismissed. Reliance is placed on the judgments in <a href="/doc/1747770/" id="a_54">T. Arivandandam v. T.V.
Satyapal and Another</a>, (1977) 4 SCC 467 and <a href="/doc/1320316/" id="a_55">Canara Bank v. P. Selathal
and Others</a>, (2020) 13 SCC 143, to argue that the Court cannot be a mute
spectator to Plaintiffs&#x27; stratagem, concealment and deliberate non-
disclosure.
</p><p id="p_47">19.     In my view, the contention is misplaced as the non-disclosure of the
Terms and Conditions of Sale of the products, more particularly, those
which are the subject matter of the trap purchase, is not material for the
purpose of deciding the present application. The relief sought in the present
suit is for infringement and passing off against the Defendants and in terms
of the provisions of the Act as well as judgments alluded to above, offer to
sell even on an interactive website targeting the customers in a particular
State is enough to grant jurisdiction of the Court as well as to give cause of
action to the Plaintiffs. A perusal of the &#x27;Terms and Conditions for the
Global Store&#x27; shows that the same apply when a customer purchases
products from the Amazon Global Store and thereupon he acknowledges
that the sale takes place in USA and is subject to laws and regulations of
USA and that the State of Washington will have the exclusive jurisdiction.
As rightly contended on behalf of the Plaintiffs, these Terms and Conditions
purely govern relationships between a buyer and a seller, i.e., parties to the
contract and do not bind the Plaintiffs who have filed the present case for
violation of their statutory and common law rights against the Defendants
for selling counterfeit products using their registered trademarks.
Additionally, it is the offer for sale within the jurisdiction of this Court

which is the trigger for a cause of action, which may or may not be followed
by an actual sale of the infringing product and therefore, it is irrelevant
whether the sale takes place in India or outside. Since it is &#x27;offer for sale&#x27;,
which is the cause of action and constitutes infringement under the
provisions of the Act, the argument on behalf of the Defendants with respect
to the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_56">Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930 is also misconceived. Insofar as judgments in
Dahiben (supra) and Xavier D&#x27;Souza &amp; Anr. (supra) are concerned, the
proposition laid down in the said judgments cannot be disputed, however,
these judgments are inapplicable to the present case. In Dahiben (supra),
Plaintiffs had deliberately failed to mention the date of the registered sale-
deed, which omission had an impact on the limitation for filing the suit. The
Court found the omission to be deliberate and since it had impact on the
limitation within which the suit could be filed, the Court upheld the order of
the Trial Court rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.
</p><p id="p_49">20.     The judgment in Xavier D&#x27;Souza &amp; Anr. (supra) is also of no aid to
Defendant No. 2. In the said case, the Plaintiff claiming that he came to
know for the first time on 19.01.2005 that the sale deed had been executed
jointly in favour of the Plaintiff and the Defendant, filed a suit for
declaration to be the exclusive owner of the suit property. Defendant filed an
application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC for rejection of the plaint. After
analysing the matter, the Court came to a conclusion that the Plaintiff was a
party to the sale deed and a businessman and it was unbelievable that he was
oblivious of the document that was executed and therefore, cannot be
permitted to seek a declaration after 18 years when the suit was time barred.
The Court also found that Plaintiff had suppressed that date of the award and
receipt of compensation and had made efforts to get relief from the Court by

suppressing the dates of various documents. The omission was found
intentional and made to deceive the Court. None of these facts fit into the
present case.
</p><p id="p_51">21.     It is also argued on behalf of the Defendants that once it is undisputed
that there are multiple proprietors of the trademark, Plaintiffs cannot seek an
injunction in respect of goods that were legitimately put in the market by
another rightful proprietor and in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_57">Kapil Wadhwa &amp; Ors. v. Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd. and Anr</a>., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5172, the Court has
recognized that principle of exhaustion under <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_58">Section 30(3)</a> and (4) of the
Act is of international exhaustion. There cannot be any debate on the
principle of international exhaustion of rights under the Act, which has been
created to prevent the owner of a registered trademark from receiving
consideration twice for the sale of same goods. However, suffice would it be
to state that this argument cannot be a ground to reject the plaint under
Order VII Rule 11 CPC and at best, could be a defence of the Defendants on
merits to the Plaintiffs&#x27; suit. Even otherwise, at this stage, no proof of
purported procurement or purchase has been filed by Defendant No. 2 to
establish even prima facie that it has procured the infringing goods from a
lawful source in USA, i.e., from BHPC Associates LLC, as alleged.
Responding to the contention, Plaintiffs have sought to clarify that they have
no affiliation or association or even an economic link with the said entity
anywhere in the world and nor are they the beneficiaries of any transaction
made by the Defendants with the said entity in relation to the infringing
products. Learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs has also rightly argued
that principles under <a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_59">Section 30(3)</a> of the Act, which embody the principle
of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to sub-Section (4) of

<a href="/doc/904169/" id="a_60">Section 30</a> and there can be no greater reason which can be termed as
&#x27;legitimate&#x27; than being the registered proprietor of the trademark.
</p><p id="p_53">22.     Principles that govern adjudication under Order VII Rule 11 CPC are
well-settled. The Court is required to examine the plaint on a demurrer and
see if the plaint sets out a cause of action which is triable by the Court. No
doubt, as rightly contended by learned Senior Counsel for Defendant No. 2
and as held in Nawal Singh (supra), the documents filed along with the
plaint can be seen, however, the Court cannot base its adjudication on the
defence in the suit. In this context, I may refer to para 27 from the judgment
in <a href="/doc/65527425/" id="a_61">M/s RSPL Limited v. Mukesh Sharma and Another</a>, 2016 SCC Online
Del 4285, which is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">        &quot;27. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the
        plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the
        cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were
        engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name
        &#x27;GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY&#x27;. In paragraph 37 of the
        plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the
        territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit.</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">        But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely
        quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision
        like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating
        material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker
        Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to
        include positive statement of facts. In the present case,
        paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of
        fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts
        within the jurisdiction of this Court by &#x27;conducting, soliciting,
        rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade
        name&#x27;. Further statements are made in the very same
        paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi
        and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade
        mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A
        specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff&#x27;s

        goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged
        activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as
        also in other parts of the country and that the
        plaintiff/appellant&#x27;s proprietary rights are being prejudicially
        affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While
        considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these
        statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean
        that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the
        present suit by virtue of <a href="/doc/1631603/" id="a_62">Section 134(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
        1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been
        pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are
        conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under
        the trade name - GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY - within the
        jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents
        deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement
        but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule
        10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the
        respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering
        the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI
        TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this
        Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the
        appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have
        to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our
        view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J.
</p><p id="p_56">        in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts
        which are the means of proving the material fact or the
        evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material
        fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the
        learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars
        with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the
        learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement
        and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his
        decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC
        application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above.
        Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the
        Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it
        must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken
        to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the

        appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the
        defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts
        within the jurisdiction of this Court by conducting, soliciting,
        rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade
        name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have
        to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint
        under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_58">23.     In Exphar Sa and Another (supra), the Supreme Court observed as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">        &quot;9. Besides, when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by
        way of demurrer and not at the trial, the objection must
        proceed on the basis that the facts as pleaded by the initiator of
        the impugned proceedings are true. The submission in order to
        succeed must show that granted those facts the court does not
        have jurisdiction as a matter of law. In rejecting a plaint on the
        ground of jurisdiction, the Division Bench should have taken
        the allegations contained in the plaint to be correct.........&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">24.     Thus, for the purpose of present application, Court accepts the
averments made in the plaint, more particularly, paragraphs 8, 49, 50 and 62
of the plaint as correct, wherein, Plaintiffs have categorically averred that
they have stores in Delhi in prominent malls where they sell their products.
It is also averred that products are sold through the websites of their
licensees. Plaintiffs have also averred that Defendant No. 1 is, through its
website, offering the counterfeit products for sale which can be purchased
by customers in Delhi and thus, this Court has jurisdiction, both under
<a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_63">Section 134(2)</a> of the Act and Section 20(c) of CPC. At this stage, the Court
cannot examine the merits of the matter or take into account the defence set
up by the Defendants albeit it is possible that Plaintiffs may not succeed
finally in the suit. For the present, however, all that the Court can consider is
