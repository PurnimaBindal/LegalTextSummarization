Commission to investigate the conditions of all such

socially and educationally backward classes, known

as    Kaka   Kalelkar     Commission,   the   first    National

Commission for backward classes. The Kaka Kalelkar

Commission submitted its report on 30.03.1955 where

it observed - Vol.I “In Maharashtra, besides the

Brahman it is the Maratha who claimed to be the

ruling community in the villages, and the Prabhu,

that    dominated   all    other    communities”.     Thus,   the

first    Backward   Classes     Commission    did     not     find

Maratha as other backward class community in the

State of Bombay.

system    has     become   a    tool    of    convenience         for    the

Government and politicians in power for their vote

bank. It is further pleaded that Maratha was never

treated    as     backward      class      community       and     earlier

their claim was rejected. It was further pleaded

that the impugned enactment seriously prejudices the

chances     of     open    candidates         in     all     fields       of

education    as    well    as   in     service.      It     was    further

pleaded    that     Gaikwad      Commission&#x27;s            report    is    not

based on fiscal data. There was inadequacy of data

base. A community which was found not to be backward

for last 50 years is now declared as backward class

without     any     change      of     circumstances.            The    writ

petitioner,       pleads     that      enactment         shall    have    an

adverse effect which shall divide the society by

points which we have formulated in the
proemial of the judgment and deliberated
in   the   judgment.   We   summarize our
conclusions in the same sequence :
</p>
<p id="p_97">
[1] We hold and declare that the State
possess the legislative competence to
enact the Maharashtra State Reservation
for Seats for Admission in Educational
Institutions   in    the   State  and  for
appointments in the public services and
posts under the State (for Socially and
Educationally Backward Classes) SEBC Act,
2018 and State’s legislative competence is
not   in   any    way    affected  by  the
Constitution (102nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_85">Amendment) Act</a> 2018
and the interim order passed by this Court
in Writ Petition No. 3151 of 2014. We
resultantly uphold the impugned enactment
except to the extent of quantum of
reservation as set out in point no. 6.
</p>
<p id="p_98">[2] We conclude that the report of the
MSBCC under the Chairmanship of Justice
Gaikwad is based on quantifiable and
contemporaneous     data    and    it    has
conclusively    established    the   social,
economical and educational backwardness of
the Maratha community and it has also
established      the      inadequacy      of
representation of the Maratha community in
public employment / posts under the State.
Accordingly we uphold the MSBCC report.
</p>
<p id="p_99">[3]   We   hold    and   declare    that   the
classification of the Maratha class into
“Socially    and    Educationally     Backward
Class”    complies    the    twin    test   of
reasonable     classification      permissible
under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_86">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of
India,      namely,      (a)      intelligible

differentia and (b) rational nexus to the
object sought to be achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_100">[4] We hold and declare that the limit of
reservation should not exceed 50%, however
in exceptional circumstances and extra-</p><pre id="pre_3">
ordinary situations, this limit can be
crossed    subject   to    availability    of
quantifiable    and  contemporaneous     data
reflecting   backwardness,    inadequacy   of
</pre><p id="p_101">representation and without affecting the
efficiency in administration.
</p>
<p id="p_102">[5] We hold and declare that the report of
the Gaikwad Commission has set out the
exceptional   circumstances   and   extra-
</p><p id="p_103">ordinary situations justifying crossing of
the limit of 50% reservation as set out in
Indra Sawhney&#x27;s case.
</p>
<p id="p_104">[6] We hold and declare that the State
Government in exercise of its enabling
power under Articles 15(4)(5) and 16(4) of
the Constitution of India is justified, in
the backdrop of report of MSBCC, in making
provision for separate reservation to
Maratha community. We, however, hold that
the quantum of reservation set out by the
Maharashtra State Reservation for Seats
for Admission in Educational Institutions
in the State and for appointments in the
public services and posts under the State
(for Socially and Educationally Backward
Classes) SEBC Act, 2018, in <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_87">section 4(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_105">(a) and 4(1)(b) as 16% is not justifiable
and resultantly we quash and set aside the
quantum of reservation under the said
provisions over and above 12% and 13%
respectively   as   recommended   by   the
Commission.”

(4)Submissions of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">44. Shri Arvind Datar, learned senior counsel, led

the arguments on behalf of the appellant. Shri Datar

submits that there is no need to refer the judgment

of Constitution Bench of this Court in Indra Sawhney

to an Eleven-Judge Bench. Reference to larger Bench

can be made only for compelling reasons. No judgment

of this Court has doubted the correctness of nine-

Judge    Constitution        Bench    of     this    Court   in   Indra

Sawhney&#x27;s     case.     On   the     other    hand    50%    limit   for

reservation has been reiterated at least by four

Constitution Bench judgments of this Court rendered

after judgment in Indra Sawhney&#x27;s case.                        All the

High Courts have uniformly accepted the limit of 50%

reservation.       In   some    States       where    for    political

reasons 50% limit had been breached, it was struck

down repeatedly. The limit of 50% reservation laid

down    by   the   Constitution       Bench     of    this   Court   in

Indra Sawhney is now an integral part of the trinity

of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_92">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_93">, 15</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_94">16</a> of the Constitution. Any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                     45</span>


legislative or executive legislations against it are

void and have to be struck down.                    Shri Datar has

specifically     referred       to    the     Constitution        Bench

judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_95">M. Nagaraj vs. Union of

India</a>,   (2006)     8     SCC     212    in       which    case     the

Constitution Bench of this Court laid down that the

State    cannot         obliterate          the     Constitutional

requirement of ceiling limit of 50%. It was held

that if the ceiling limit of 50% is breached the

structure   of    quality       and   equality      in    <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_96">Article    16</a>

would collapse.
</p>
<p id="p_126">45. It was further held that even the State has

compelling reason, the State has to see that its

reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness

so as to breach the limit of 50%.                   The request to

refer the judgment of Nagaraj has been refused by

subsequent Constitution Bench judgment of this Court

in <a href="/doc/190772988/" id="a_97">Jarnail Singh and others vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta

and others</a>, 2018(10) SCC 396. The parameters, when

this Court revisits its judgments have been clearly

laid down in which the present case does not fall.

The judgment delivered by nine-Judge Bench needs to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                       46</span>


be followed under the principle of stare decisis.

More so for the last more than 28 years no judgment

of this Court had expressed any doubt about the law

laid down by this Court in Indra Sawhney&#x27;s case. A

very high threshold is to be crossed when reference

is     to   be   made    to     eleven-Judge    Bench.       In      law,

certainty,       consistency      and   continuity        are     highly

desirable. The Parliament has not touched 50% limit

laid    down     under   <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_98">Article    15(4)</a>   and      <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_99">16(4)</a>      of    the

Constitution for the last several decades.


</p><p id="p_127">46. The impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court

is liable to be set aside as it is contrary to the

clear principle laid down in the Indra Sawhney&#x27;s

case. The High Court has not given any reason as to

how     extra-ordinary         situations      as    mentioned         in

paragraph 810 in Indra Sawhney case is made out in

the     context     of        reservation   for       the       Maratha

caste/community          in     Maharashtra.        Exception         and

certain      extra-ordinary         situations       to     the       50%

principle carved out in Indra Sawhney does not cover

the case of Maratha since such “rule is confined to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                           47</span>


far flung and remote areas, where they are out of

main stream of national life”. Indra Sawhney has

also mandated extreme caution for going beyond 50%.

The reservation limit of 50% has also been applied

in the decisions rendered in the context of <a href="/doc/1091659/" id="a_100">Article

243D</a> and <a href="/doc/1547761/" id="a_101">243T</a> of the Constitution of India relating

to     Panchayats       and     Municipalities.              The     earlier

reports of National Commission for Backward Classes

has    rejected      claim    of    Maratha    to       be    included     in

backward class. The opinion of National Commission

for Backward Classes cannot be disregarded by the

State and in the event it had any grievance remedy

of review was provided.
</p>
<p id="p_128">47. The       Maratha    community      has    been          found    to   be

socially      advanced        and   prestigious          caste.      It    is

submitted that limit of 50% is essential right on

part of equality which is part of basic structure.

Even members of Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward

Classes who qualify on merit can continue to enjoy

the benefit of merit quota. The limit of 50% as laid

down     in     Indra     Sawhney,      only        a        Parliamentary

amendment       is      contemplated.         Whenever         Parliament
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                        48</span>


wanted to get over 50% ceiling limit laid down by

Indra    Sawhney,        the   constitutional        Amendments       were

brought,     namely,       Constitution       77th    Amendment        and

Constitution 81st Amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_129">
</p><p id="p_130">48. Shri Datar has referred to various paragraphs of

judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney. In support

of his submission that majority has laid down upper

by wrong appreciation of facts concludes that those

has been articulated in the Indra Sawhney is based

on the principle of giving everyone a fair chance.

50 percent ceiling is based on principle of equality

to prevent reverse discrimination which is as much a

principle that the Constitution records to equality

as anything else. The direction of Indra Sawhney

that    list    of    Other      Backward          Classes    be    reviewed

Dhavan,        however,         submits              that      Maharashtra

legislature had the competence to enact the 2018

Act, even though the Constitution (One Hundred and

Second     Amendment)       had        come     by     that    time.     He,

however,      submits      that        any     legislation       which    is

enacted will still be subject to Indra Sawhney and

Nagraj principles.

He submits that the test to be applied is “what has

happened since the last report negating inclusion of

Maratha that now requires a change to include them”.

He submits that the logic of the principle is that

if the Marathas were not backward for over Seventy

years, how they have suddenly become backward now.

Dr. Dhavan reiterates his submission that there is

no   judgment   which   has    questioned   Indra   Sawhney&#x27;s

case. He submits that reservation under political

pressure, social pressure need not to be taken. A

political   obligation    to    the   electorate    is   not   a

constitutional obligation. He further submits that

object of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_136">Article 16(4)</a> is empowerment i.e. sharing

of the State power. He submits that Maratha are not

deprived of sharing power; hence, no case is made

(5)The 10 grounds urged for referring Indra Sawhney
   judgment to a larger Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_190">
</p><p id="p_191">i)   In the judgment of Indra Sawhney, there is no

     unanimity,       in     view        of    different          reasoning

     adopted in six separate judgments delivered in

     the case. He submits that the judgments are in

     three groups – one containing the judgment of

     Justice Jeevan Reddy, which is for himself and

     three    other    judges,      which       held       that    while   50

     percent is the rule but in certain extraordinary

     situations,      it     can    be    breached.         Shri    Rohtagi

     submits that Justice Pandian and Justice Sawant

     have    held     that    50    percent          can    be    breached,

     hence, the majority opinion is that 50 percent

     can    be   breached.     It    is       only    Justice      Thommen,

     Justice Kuldip Singh and Justice R.M. Sahai who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                                                75</span>


   have held that 50 percent cannot be breached. He

   submits that the judgment of majority opinion in

   Indra Sawhney is being wrongly read as holding

   that   50    percent     is    the   ceiling    limit     for

   reservation.
</p>
<p id="p_192">

</p><p id="p_193">ii) Different judges from 1963 till date have spoken

   in different voice with regard to reservation

   under 15(4) and 16(4) which is a good ground to

   refer Indra Sawhney judgment to a larger Bench.


</p><p id="p_194">iii)The Balaji has held that <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_162">Article 15(4)</a> is an

   been accepted by this Court in N.M. Thomas as

   well as Indra Sawhney, the very basis of fixing

   the ceiling of 50 percent has gone. Shri Rohtagi

   submits     that   the   Constitution    of    India    is   a

   living document. The ideas cannot remain frozen,

   cannot remain frozen for times immemorial.

  down the Constitutional provisions of Part-III

  and    Part-IV.          Indra     Sawhney’s         judgment      has

  restricted the sweep of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_168">Article 15</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_169">Article

Legislative Assembly. The subjective satisfaction of

the   State       Government      to     declare      a    community     as

socially and educationally backward is not to be

Community in the year 1902 by Sahuji Maharaj. He

observation regarding 50 percent is only an Obiter.

By the judgment of this Court in N.M. Thomas, the

basis   of     Balaji    Case     that    <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_204">Article      15(4)</a>       is    an

exception      to     <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_205">Article     15(1)</a>   has    gone.       The    whole

judgment      could    not   be    relied   on    as     a    precedent

anymore. Whether a particular quota of reservation

is violative of <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_206">Article 15(1)</a> depends on facts of

each case. The State ought to be given a free hand

to pick the percentage as per need and requirement

which only use the expression “list” in the context

of identification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

Tribes.        This    is    because     historically,       Scheduled

Constitution         Bench        laid    down     that       opinion      which

embodies       the     greatest           common        measures      of     the

agreement      among     the       Bench    is     to    be    accepted      the

decision of the Court. Thus, for culling out the

decision of the Court in a case where there are

several opinions, on which there is greatest common

measure of agreement is the decision of the Court.


</p><p id="p_276">123.     We now revert back to the judgment of Indra

Sawhney    to    find    out       what     is   the      greatest      common

measures of the agreement between the Judges with

regard    to    the    reservation          to     the       extent   of    50%.

CJ,     M.N.Venkatachaliah,   A.M.     Ahmadi,      JJ.,    has

elaborately dealt with the extent of the reservation

under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_263">Article 16(4).</a> In paragraph 809 conclusion was

recorded by the Court that reservations contemplated

under    <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_264">Article   16(4)</a>   should    not   exceed    50%.    In

paragraph 810 it was observed that in certain extra-

ordinary    circumstances,    some    relaxation     in     this

strict rule of 50% may become imperative. Paragraphs

809 and 810 are to following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">        “809. From the above discussion, the
      irresistible conclusion that follows is
      that the reservations contemplated in

      the people. It might happen that in far
      flung and remote areas the population
      inhabiting those areas might, on account
      of their being out of the mainstream of
      national life and in view of conditions
      peculiar to and characteristical to them,

</blockquote><p id="p_277">124.    Justice S. Ratnavel Pandian while delivering a

separate    judgment   has   expressed    his     disagreement

with the proposition of fixing the reservation for

socially and educationally backward classes at 50%

as a maximum limit. In paragraph 243(9) following

was laid down by Justice Pandian:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">       &quot;243(9) No maximum ceiling of reservation
       can be fixed under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_266">Article 16(4)</a> of the
       Constitution     for     reservation   of
       appointments or posts in favour of any
       backward   class   of  citizens   “in the
       services under the State”. The decisions
       fixing the percentage of reservation only
       up   to    the   maximum    of   50%  are
       unsustainable.”


</blockquote><p id="p_278">125.    Justice   Thommen,   Justice     Kuldip    Singh   and

Justice R.M. Sahai took the view that reservation in

all cases should remain below 50% of total number of

seats. Paragraph 323(8) of Justice Thommen&#x27;s opinion

is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_279">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">       &quot;323(8) Reservation in all cases must be
       confined to a minority of available posts

       reserved under <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_267">Article 15</a> or <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_268">Article 16</a>

</blockquote><p id="p_280">126.     Justice Kuldip Singh also in paragraph 384(i)

expressed his opinion in accord with Justice R.M.

Sahai which is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">       &quot;384(i)   that   the   reservations under
       <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_269">Article 16(4)</a> must remain below 50% and
       under no circumstance be permitted to go
       beyond 50%. Any reservation beyond 50% is
       constitutionally invalid.”


</blockquote><p id="p_281">127.    Justice R.M. Sahai in paragraph 619(i) held

that    reservation      should       in    no    case     exceed      50%.

Justice     T.K.      Thommen,      Justice       Kuldip      Singh     and

Justice R.M. Sahai delivered dissenting opinion.


</p><p id="p_282">128.     Now,   we    come    to    the     judgment      delivered      by

Justice     P.B.       Sawant       who     delivered         concurring

opinion. Two paragraphs of the judgment of Justice

Sawant    are   relevant       to    notice.      In     paragraph      518

justice    Sawant      observed       that    there      is    no     legal

infirmity       in     keeping        the     reservations            under

clause(4) alone or under clause (4) and clause (1)

of   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_270">Article     16</a>    together,      exceeding        50%.     However,

validity of the extent of excess of reservations

over     50%    would        depend        upon    the        facts     and

circumstances of each case. In the same paragraph
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                                             112</span>


Justice    Sawant,     however,   observed   that    it   would

ordinarily be wise and nothing much would be lost,

if the intentions of the Framers of the Constitution

and the observations of Dr. Ambedkar, on the subject

be kept in mind. Justice Sawant obviously referred

to speech of Dr. Ambedkar dated 30.11.1948 where Dr.

Ambedkar has categorically stated that reservation

under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_271">Article 16(4)</a> shall be confined to minority of

seats. However, in paragraph 552 justice Sawant has

recorded his answers       and in answer to Question No.4

following was stated:
</p>
<p id="p_283">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">       “552........
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">       Question 4:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">         Ordinarily, the reservations kept both
       under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_272">Article 16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_273">16(4)</a> together
       should not exceed 50 per cent of the
       appointments in a grade, cadre or service
       in any particular year. It is only for
       extraordinary reasons that this percentage
       may be exceeded. However, every excess
       over 50 per cent will have to be justified
       on valid grounds which grounds will have
       to be specifically made out.”


</blockquote><p id="p_284">129.     The   above    opinion   of   Justice      Sawant   is

completely in accord with the opinion expressed by

Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy in paragraphs 809 and 810.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                                                   113</span>


The opinion of Justice Sawant expressed in the above

paragraph is that ordinarily, the reservations under

<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_274">Article 16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_275">16(4)</a> should not exceed 50%                     and

it is only in            extra-ordinary circumstances that

this percentage may be exceeded               which is also the

opinion    expressed       by    Justice   B.P.    Jeevan       Reddy.

Applying the principle of Constitution Bench of this

Court     in    Rajnarain       Singh   (supra),        the   opinion

embodies the greatest common measure of agreement

between the opinions expressed. Thus, the majority

opinion,       the ratio of judgment of Indra Sawhney as

expressed by the majority is one which is expressed

in paragraphs 809 and 810 of the judgment of Justice

B.P.    Jeevan    Reddy.    The    submission      of    Shri    Mukul

Rohtagi cannot be accepted that majority opinion of

Indra    Sawhney    is    that    50%   can   be   breached.      The

majority opinion as noted above is that normally

reservation should not exceed 50% and it is only in

extra-ordinary circumstances it can exceed 50%. What

can be the extra-ordinary circumstances have been

indicated in paragraph 810.

</p><p id="p_286">130. Alternatively if we again look to the opinion

in all six judgments, we notice :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">       (a) Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy (for himself
           and   three  other   Judges)  held  in
           paragraph 809 that the reservation
           contemplated in clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_276">Article
           16</a> should not exceed 50%.

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">       (b) Justice Thommen, Justice Kuldip Singh

</blockquote>

<p id="p_287">131.    Thus greatest common measure of agreement in

that:

               judgment of Justice Jeevan Reddy
               should exist, for which extreme
               caution is to be exercised.

<p id="p_291">

</p>
<p id="p_295">

</p><p id="p_296">134. Now, we come to the second ground pressed by

Shri Rohtagi is that different Judges from 1993 till

reservation under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_279">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_280">16(4)</a> which is a

good   ground    to    refer    Indra    Sawhney       to    a   larger

Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_297">135. We may notice the Constitution Bench judgment of

this Court in <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_281">M.R. Balaji and others vs. State of

Mysore     and others</a>, AIR 1963 SC 649, in which this

Court while considering <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_282">Article 15(4)</a> had laid down

that   reservation      under     <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_283">Article      15(4)</a>    ordinarily,

speaking generally and in a broad manner special

provision should be less than 50%, how much less

than     50%    would       depend      upon    the         prevailing

circumstances in each case. The Constitution Bench

in the above case was considering the challenge to

order passed by the State of Mysore that 68% of the

seats available for admission to the Engineering and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                                    116</span>


Medical Colleges and to other technical institutions

were reserved and only 32% remain available to the

merit pool. The question about the extent of the

special provision which would be competent to State

to make under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_284">Article 15(4)</a> was also examined by the

Constitution Bench. The Constitution Bench speaking

through   Justice   P.B.     Gajendra   Gadkar   stated

following in paragraph 34:
</p>
<p id="p_298">
</p><p id="p_299">    “34..........A      special       provision
    contemplated   by   <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_285">Article   15(4)</a>    like
    reservation of posts and appointments
    contemplated by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_286">Article 16(4)</a> must be
    within reasonable limits. The interests of
    weaker sections of society which are a
    first charge on the States and the Centre
    have to be adjusted with the interests of
    the community as a whole. The adjustment
    of these competing claims is undoubtedly a
    difficult matter, but if under the guise
    of making a special provision, State
    reserves   practically   all   the    seats
    available   in  all  the   colleges,   that
    clearly would be subverting the object of
    <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_287">Article 15(4).</a> In this matter again, we
    are reluctant to say definitely what would
    be a proper provision to make. Speaking
    generally and in a broad way, a special
    provision should be less than 50%; how
    much less than 50% would depend upon the
    present prevailing circumstances in each
    case.”

</p><p id="p_300">136.     The Constitution Bench also after noticing the

judgment of this Court in        <a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_288">General Manager, Southern

Railway,     Personnel     Officer(Reservation),    Southern

Railway vs. Rangachari</a>, AIR 1962 SC 36, observed

that what is true in regard to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_289">Article 15(4)</a> is

equally      true     in     <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_290">Article   16(4).</a>      Following

observations were made in paragraph 37:

       <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_292">Article 16(4).</a> There can be no doubt that the
       Constitution-makers assumed, as they were
       entitled   to,   that     while   making   adequate
       reservation under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_293">Article 16(4</a>), care would be
       taken   not   to    provide     for   unreasonable,
       excessive or extravagant reservation, for that
       would, by eliminating general competition in a
       large   field   and    by    creating   wide-spread
       dissatisfaction      amongst      the    employees,
       materially affect efficiency. Therefore, like
       the special provision improperly made under
       <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_294">Article 15(4</a>), reservation made under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_295">Article

percentage of 50% on the carry forward rule is T.

Devadasan. The first judgment in which a discordant

note with regard to 50% limit of reservation was

expressed is the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1130169/" id="a_296">State of

Kerala and another vs. N.M. Thomas and others</a>, 1976

(2)   SCC    310,    In   the   above     case      the    Constitution

Bench had occasion to examine Rule 13-AA of                        Kerala

State    and      Subordinate      Services    Rules,       1958    which

empower the State to grant exemption for a specific

period      to     any    member     or     member        belonging    to

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing

the test referred to in Rule 13 and Rule 13-A. The

State of Kerala granted exemption to member of SC

and   ST    from     passing    of    the     test,       N.M.   Thomas,

respondent had filed writ petition in the High Court

asking      for    declaration       that     the    Rule     13-AA   as

unconstitutional.         The   grievance      of     the    respondent

was that by virtue of exemption granted to members

of the SC they have been promoted earlier than the

respondent, although they had not passed the test.

The High Court allowed the writ petition against

appeal. The appeal was allowed and Rule 13-AA was

held to be valid. The Constitution Bench judgment of

the Court was delivered by Chief Justice, A.N. Ray

with whom Justice K.K. Mathew, Justice M.H. Beg,

Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer and Justice S. Murtaza

Fazal Ali concurred by delivering separate opinions.

Two Judges, namely, Justice H.R. Khanna and Justice

A.C. Gupta delivered dissenting opinion. With regard

to extent of reservation upto 50% only two Judges,

namely, Justice Fazal Ali and Justice Krishna Iyer

has expressed the opinion. Justice Beg noticed the

Constitution Bench judgments of this Court in M.R.

Balaji and T.Devadasan, which had held that more

than   50%   reservation   for   backward   class   would

violate the principle of reasonableness. No opinion

of his own was expressed by Justice Beg. Justice

Fazal Ali also in his judgment had noted 50% ceiling

of reservation but observed that the above is only

rule of caution and does not exhaust all categories.

In paragraph 191 Justice Fazal Ali considered the

question and following was laid down:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                                  120</span><p id="p_304">


  “191. This means that the reservation
should be within the permissible limits
and should not be a cloak to fill all the
posts belonging to a particular class of
citizens and thus violate <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_297">Article 16(1)</a> of
the Constitution indirectly. At the same
time clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_298">Article 16</a> does not fix
any limit on the power of the Government
to make reservation. Since clause (4) is a
part of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_299">Article 16</a> of the Constitution it
is manifest that the State cannot be
allowed     to     indulge     in     excessive
reservation so as to defeat the policy
contained in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_300">Article 16(1).</a> As to what
would be a suitable reservation within
permissible limits will depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case and
no hard and fast rule can be laid down,
nor can this matter be reduced to a
mathematical formula so as to be adhered
to in all cases. Decided cases of this
Court have no doubt laid down that the
percentage    of   reservation     should   not
exceed 50 per cent. As I read the
authorities, this is, however, a rule of
caution    and    does    not    exhaust    all
categories. Suppose for instance a State
has a large number of backward classes of

recruitment under the Union of India. This Court had

noticed M.R. Balaji and held that what was laid down

     these 50 vacancies 9 would be reserved for
     the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, adding to
     that, the 36 carried forward from the two

     a percentage of 90. In the case before us

     of which 29 have gone to members of the
     Scheduled Castes and Tribes on the basis
     of reservation permitted by the carry
     forward rule. This comes to about 64.4% of
     reservation. Such being the result of the
     operation of the carry forward rule we
     must, on the basis of the decision

    would be competent to make under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_309">Article

    We should think that that is a matter for
    experts in management and administration.
    There might be posts or technical courses
    for which only the best can be admitted
    and others might be posts and technical
    courses for which a minimum qualification
    would   also  serve.   The  percentage   of
    reservations is not a matter upon which a
    court may pronounce with no material at
    hand. For a court to say that reservations
    should not exceed 40 per cent 50 per cent
    or 60 per cent, would be arbitrary and the
    Constitution does not permit us to be
    arbitrary. Though in the Balaji case [<a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_310">M.R.
    Balaji v. State of Mysore</a>, AIR 1963 SC 649
    : 1963 Supp (1) SCR 439] , the Court
    thought that generally and in a broad way
    a special provision should be less than 50
    per cent, and how much less than 50 per
    cent   would  depend   upon  the   relevant
    prevailing circumstances in each case, the
    Court confessed: “In this matter again, we
    are reluctant to say definitely what would
    be a proper provision to make.” All that
    the Court would finally say was that in

       the circumstances of the case before them,
       a   reservation   of  68   per   cent   was

<p id="p_337">154. The   Constitution,         the   paramount    law    of    the

country has given to the Indian citizens the basic

freedom and equality which are meant to be lasting

and    permanent.      The    Constitution   of    India   is    the

vehicle by which the goals set out in it are to be

achieved. The right from primitive society upto the

organised nations the most cherished right which all

human beings sought was the right to equality. The

Preamble      of      our    Constitution    reflects      a    deep

deliberations and precision in choosing ideal and

aspirations of people which shall guide all those

who    have      to    govern.    Equality    of     status     and

opportunity is one of the noble objectives of the

framers     of     the      Constitution.    The    doctrine     of

equality before law is part of rule of law which

pervades     the    Indian      Constitution.     Justice       Y.V.

Chandrachud    in   <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_330">Smt.     Indira   Nehru     Gandhi    vs.    Raj

Narain</a>, (1975) Supp.SCC 1 has referred to equality

basic structure of the Constitution. In paragraph

664 following was observed:

<p id="p_338">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">         “664.I consider it beyond the pale of

       Constitution on the score that they form a
       part of the basic structure of the
       Constitution, they are that: (i) Indian
       sovereign    democratic   republic;   (ii)
       Equality of status and opportunity shall
       be secured to all its citizens; (iii) The

       freely to profess, practise and propagate
       religion and that (iv) the nation oil all
       be governed by a Government of laws, not

Constitution are the provisions engrafted to realise

substantive equality where Articles 15(4) and 16(4)

15(1) and 16(1) are the fundamental rights of the

in Indra Sawhney in paragraph 641 has said that the

equality has been single greatest craving of all

the objectives and the intention of the framers of

reservation is to be consistent on the sub-clause

(1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_340">Article 10</a> it must confine to the reservation

of   minority    of   seats.   Following     are    the   part   of

speech    of    Dr.   B.R.   Ambedkar   in    the    Constituent

Assembly:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">            “ If honourable Members will bear
       these facts in mind--the three principles,
       we had to reconcile,--they will see that
       no better formula could be produced than
       the one that is embodied in sub-clause (3)
       of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_341">article 10</a> of the Constitution; they
       will find that the view of those who
       believe and hold that there shall be
       equality of opportunity, has been embodied
       in sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_342">Article 10.</a> It is a
       generic principle. At the same time, as I
       said, we had to reconcile this formula
       with    the    demand   made    by   certain
       communities that the administration which
       has    now--for   historical   reasons--been
       controlled by one community or a few
       communities,     that    situation    should
       disappear and that the others also must
       have an opportunity of getting into the
       public services. Supposing, for instance,
       we were to concede in full the demand of
       those communities who have not been so far
       employed in the public services to the
       fullest extent, what would really happen
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">                                                          137</span>


       is, we shall be completely destroying the
       first proposition upon which we are all
       agreed, namely, that there shall be an
       equality of opportunity. Let me give an
       illustration.   Supposing,  for   instance,
       reservations were made for a community or
       a collection of communities, the total of
       which came to something like 70 per cent.
       of the total posts under the State and
       only 30 per cent. are retained as the
       unreserved. Could anybody say that the
       reservation of 30 per cent. as open to
       general competition would be satisfactory
       from the point of view of giving effect to
       the first principle, namely, that there
       shall be equality of opportunity? It
       cannot be in my judgment. Therefore the
       seats to be reserved, if the reservation
       is to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of
       <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_343">Article 10</a>, must be confined to a minority
       of seats. It is then only that the first
       principle could find its place in the
       Constitution and effective in operation.”

the    Constituent   Assembly   for   balancing   the   draft

Articles 10(1) and 10(3) equivalent to Articles 16

and 16(4) have been referred to and relied by this

Court in Indra Sawhney as well as in other cases.


</p><p id="p_343">158. Shri Rohtagi submits that this Court in Balaji

that <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_346">Article 16</a> sub-clause (4) is not exception to

<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_347">Article 16(1</a>), the submission is that in view of the

above holding in N.M. Thomas and Indra Sawhney the

ceiling of 50% has to go. It is true that seven-

Judge Constitution Bench in N.M. Thomas held that

<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_348">Article 16(4)</a> is not an exception to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_349">Article 16(1)</a>

which was noticed in paragraph 713 of the judgment

of   Indra   Sawhney.   Justice   B.P.   Jeevan   Reddy   in

paragraph 733 said “At this stage, we see to clarify

one particular aspect. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_350">Article 16(1)</a> is a facet of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_351">Article 14</a>, just as <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_352">Article 14</a> permits reasonable

classification, so does <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_353">Article 16(1)”.</a> In paragraph

741 following was laid down:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">     “741. ....In our respectful opinion, the
     view     taken      by     the      majority
     in Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 380] is the
     correct one. We too believe that <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_354">Article
     16(1)</a>      does      permit       reasonable
     classification for ensuring attainment of
     the equality of opportunity assured by it.
     For assuring equality of opportunity, it
     may   well   be   necessary    in    certain
     situations to treat unequally situated
     persons unequally. Not doing so, would
     perpetuate   and   accentuate   inequality.
     <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_355">Article 16(4)</a> is an instance of such
     classification, put in to place the matter
     beyond controversy. The “backward class of

    clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_357">Article 16.</a> It is an

    permitted by clause (1)......”


</blockquote><p id="p_344">159. As laid down by the Constitution Bench in Indra

Sawhney,   we   proceed   on   the   premise     that   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_358">Article

<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_365">Article    15(4)</a>   was    referred     to   as     a    special

15(4)</a> like reservation of posts by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_367">Article 16(4)</a>

must be within the reasonable limitation. We again

quote the relevant observation from paragraph 34:

</p><pre id="pre_8">      “34. ...That    is       not  to   say   that

</pre><p id="p_347">       reservation should and must be adopted to
       advance   the   prospects   of   the   weaker
       sections of society, but in providing for
       special measures in that behalf care
       should be taken not to exclude admission
       to higher educational centres to deserving
       and   qualified     candidates    of    other
       communities.     A      special     provision
       contemplated    by   <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_368">Article    15(4)</a>    like
       reservation of posts and appointments
       contemplated by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_369">Article 16(4)</a> must be
       within reasonable limits. The interests of
       weaker sections of society which are a
       first charge on the States and the Centre
       have to be adjusted with the interests of
       the community as a whole. The adjustment
       of these competing claims is undoubtedly a
       difficult matter, but if under the guise
       of making a special provision, a State
       reserves    practically    all   the    seats
       available   in   all   the   colleges,   that
       clearly would be subverting the object of
       <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_370">Article 15(4).</a> In this matter again, we
       are reluctant to say definitely what would
       be a proper provision to make. Speaking
       generally and in a broad way, a special
       provision should be less than 50%; how
       much less than 50% would depend upon the
       present prevailing circumstances in each
       case...”

</p>
<p id="p_349">
</p><p id="p_350">162.     The 50% rule spoken in Balaji and affirmed in

Indra        Sawhney      is   to   fulfill     the    objective          of

equality        as     engrafted     in     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_371">Article   14</a>     of        which

Articles 15 and 16 are facets. The Indra Sawhney

itself gives answer of the question. In paragraph

807     of     Indra      Sawhney    held     that    what    is        more

reasonable than to say that reservation under clause

(4) shall not exceed 50% of the appointment. 50% has

been said to be reasonable and it is to attain the

objective       of     equality.     In   paragraph     807       Justice

Jeevan Reddy states:
</p>
<p id="p_351">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">       “807. We must, however, point out that
       clause    (4)     speaks      of    adequate
       representation   and    not    proportionate
       representation. Adequate representation
       cannot     be     read      as proportionate
       representation. Principle of proportionate
       representation   is    accepted    only   in
       Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution
       and that too for a limited period. These
       articles speak of reservation of seats in
       Lok Sabha and the State legislatures in
       favour of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                                        142</span>


    Castes proportionate to their population,
    but they are only temporary and special
    provisions. It is therefore not possible
    to accept the theory of proportionate
    representation though the proportion of
    population of backward classes to the
    total   population   would   certainly   be
    relevant. Just as every power must be
    exercised reasonably and fairly, the power
    conferred by clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_372">Article 16</a>
    should also be exercised in a fair manner
    and within reasonable limits — and what is
    more   reasonable   than   to    say   that
    reservation under clause (4) shall not
    exceed 50% of the appointments or posts,
    barring certain extraordinary situations

    as explained hereinafter. From this point of
    view, the 27% reservation provided by the
    impugned Memorandums in favour of backward
    classes is well within the reasonable
    limits. Together with reservation in favour
    of Scheduled Castes
    and Scheduled Tribes, it comes to a total of
    49.5%. In this connection, reference
    may be had to the Full Bench decision of the
    Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/1459986/" id="a_373">V. Narayana
    Rao v. State of A.P</a>. [AIR 1987 AP 53 : 1987
    Lab IC 152 : (1986) 2 Andh LT 258] ,
    striking down the enhancement of reservation
    from 25% to 44% for OBCs. The said
    enhancement had the effect of taking the
    total reservation under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_374">Article 16(4)</a> to
    65%.”


</blockquote><p id="p_352">163. In paragraph 808, Justice Jeevan Reddy referred

to speech of Dr. Ambedkar where he said that the

reservation should be confined (to a minority of

seats).   The   expression   minority   of   seats”.   When

translated into figure the expression less than 50%

comes into operation.
</p>
<p id="p_353">
</p><p id="p_354">164. To change the 50% limit is to have a society

which is not founded on equality but based on caste

rule. The democracy is an essential feature of our

Constitution and part of our basic structure. If the

reservation       goes   above     50%    limit     which   is    a

reasonable, it will be slippery slope, the political

pressure, make it hardly to reduce the same. Thus,

answer to the question posed is that the percentage

of   50%    has   been   arrived   at    on   the   principle    of

reasonability and achieves equality as enshrined by

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_375">Article 14</a> of which Articles 15 and 16 are facets.

       from the British yoke and who knew what
       domination of a foreign rule meant in the
       way of deprivation of basic freedoms and
       from the point of view of exploitation of

</p><p id="p_366">171. We recall the observation made by Justice R.V.

Raveendran in <a href="/doc/63489929/" id="a_379">Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs. Union of India

and others</a>, 2008(6) SCC 1, where His Lordship held

that any provision for reservation is a temporary

crutch, such crutch by unnecessary prolonged use,

should not become a permanent liability. In words of

Justice Raveendran paragraph 666 is as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">        “666. Caste has divided this country for
        ages. It has hampered its growth. To
        have   a   casteless    society   will   be
        realisation of a noble dream. To start
        with, the effect of reservation may
        appear    to    perpetuate    caste.    The
        immediate     effect     of     caste-based
        reservation has been rather unfortunate.
        In the pre-reservation era people wanted
        to get rid of the backward tag—either
        social    or    economical.     But    post
        reservation, there is a tendency even
        among   those   who   are   considered   as
        “forward”, to seek the “backward” tag,
        in the hope of enjoying the benefits of
        reservations. When more and more people
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">                                                          149</span>


         aspire for “backwardness” instead of
         “forwardness”      the      country     itself
         stagnates.    Be     that     as    it    may.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_81">         Reservation as an affirmative action is
         required only for a limited period to
         bring    forward      the     socially     and
         educationally backward classes by giving
         them a gentle supportive push. But if
         there is no review after a reasonable
         period and if reservation is continued,
         the country will become a caste divided
         society     permanently.        Instead     of
         developing    a    united      society    with
         diversity, we will end up as a fractured
         society   forever     suspicious     of   each
         other. While affirmative discrimination
         is a road to equality, care should be
         taken that the road does not become a
         rut in which the vehicle of progress
         gets entrenched and stuck. Any provision
         for reservation is a temporary crutch.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">         Such crutch by unnecessary prolonged
         use, should not become a permanent
         liability. It is significant that the
         Constitution     does     not    specifically
         prescribe a casteless society nor tries
         to   abolish    caste.     But   by    barring
         discrimination in the name of caste and
         by providing for affirmative action
         Constitution     seeks     to    remove    the
         difference in status on the basis of
         caste. When the differences in status
         among castes are removed, all castes
         will become equal. That will be a
         beginning for a casteless egalitarian
         society.”

education to more and more sections of society other

means and measures have to be forged. In view of the

privatisation           and     liberalisation      of   the      economy

public employment is not sufficient to cater the

needs       of     all.         More    avenues        for      providing

opportunities to members of the weaker sections of

the society and backward class to develop skills for

employment        not    necessary     the    public     service.      The

objectives engrafted in our Constituted and ideals

set    by   the    Constitution        for    the   society      and   the

Governments are still not achieved and have to be

pursued.     There        can     be   no    quarrel     that    society

changes, law changes, people changes but that does

not mean that something which is good and proven to

be beneficial in maintaining equality in the society

       was seen as an extension of the Rights,
       for it was the courts that would give the
       Rights force. The Judiciary was to be an
       arm of the social revolution, upholding
       the equality that Indians and longed for
       during colonial days, but had not gained-
       not   simply  because   the  regime   was
       colonial, and perforce repressive, but
       largely because the British had feared

that     judicial     function      is     both    creation        and

application of law. The principle of Indra Sawhney

is both creation application of law. In paragraph,

1705, Justice Mathew says: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_84">         “1705. The   judicial   function  is,   like
       legislation, both creation and application of

       determined by the general norms both as to
       procedure and as to the contents of the norm
       to be created, whereas legislation is usually
       determined by the Constitution only in the
       former respect. But that is a difference in

       decision is a stage in a process beginning
       with   the   establishment    of    the    first
       Constitution, continued by legislation and
       customs,   and   leading   to    the    judicial
       decisions. The Court not merely formulates
       already existing law          although it is
       generally asserted to be so. It does not only
       ‘seek’ and ‘find’ the law               existing
       previous to its decision, it does not merely
       pronounce the law which exists ready and
       finished prior to its pronouncement. Both in
       establishing the presence of the conditions
       and in stipulating the sanction, the judicial
       decision has a constitutive character. The
       law-creating   function  of   the    courts   is
       especially manifest when the judicial decision
       has the character of a precedent, and that
       means when the judicial decision creates a
       general norm. Where the courts are entitled
       not only to apply pre-existing substantive law
       in their decisions, but also to create new law
       for concrete cases, there is a comprehensible
       inclination to give these judicial decisions
       the character of precedents. Within such a
       legal system, courts are legislative organs in
       exactly the same sense as the organ which is
       called the legislator in the narrower and

judgment      of     Indra        Sawhney         is   shackle       to    the

legislature in enacting the law does not commend us.

When    the    law    is     laid    down         by   this    Court      that

reservation ought not to exceed 50% except in extra-

ordinary      circumstances          all      authorities          including

legislature and executive are bound by the said law.

There is no question of putting any shackle. It is

the law which is binding on all.

developed      in    the    national         interest.        In   paragraph

838, Indra Sawhney has noticed certain posts where

reservations are not conducive in public interest

     situations, it may not be advisable to

that since there is no indication in Articles 15 and

exclusion could have been made. The law as existing

today   is   one    which    has   been   laid   down   in   Indra

country.      The   State     while     framing     its   policy,

rights      which   the    Constitution    guarantees     to   the

</p><p id="p_415">199.       Shri Rohtagi submits that an Eleven-Judge

Bench of this Court in T.M.A. Pai foundation and

others versus State of Karnataka and others, (2002)

8 SCC 481, has struck down the law laid down by this

Court in St. Stephen’s College case, (1992) 1 SCC

558 which had held that aided minority educational

institutions although entitled to preferably admit

their community candidate but intake should not be

more than 50 percent. Shri Rohtagi submits that St.

Stephen&#x27;s College case has put a cap of 50 percent

which was nothing but recognition of Indra Sawhney

Principle.    Shri   Rohtagi   submits   that   the   Eleven-

Judge Bench in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case has set

aside the aforesaid cap of 50 percent. Mr. Rohtagi

relies on paragraph 151 of Kirpal,C.J. and paragraph

338 by Rumapal, J. of the judgment, which is to the

following effect: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">       “151. The right of the aided minority
       institution to preferably admit students of
       its   community,  when   <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_464">Article  29(2)</a> was
       applicable, has been clarified by this Court

over a decade ago in the St. Stephen&#x27;s
College case. While upholding the procedure
for admitting students, this Court also held
that aided minority educational institutions
were entitled to preferably admit their
community candidates so as to maintain the
minority character of the institution, and
that the state may regulate the intake in
this category with due regard to the area
that the institution was intended to serve,
but that this intake should not be more than
50% in any case. Thus, St. Stephen&#x27;s
endeavoured to strike a balance between the
two Articles. Though we accept the ratio of
St. Stephen&#x27;s, which has held the field for
over    a    decade,    we   have    compelling
reservations     in    accepting   the     rigid
percentage stipulated therein. As <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_465">Article 29</a>
and    <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_466">Article    30</a>   apply   not    only    to
institutions of higher education but also to
schools, a ceiling of 50% would not be
proper. It will be more appropriate that
depending upon the level of the institution,
whether it be a primary or secondary or high
school    or   a   college,   professional    or
otherwise,    and   on   the   population    and
educational needs of the area in which the
institution is to be located the state
properly balances the interests of all by
providing for such a percentage of students
of the minority community to be admitted, so
as to adequately serve the interest of the
community for which the institution was
established.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_416">388. I agree with the view as expressed by
the Learned Chief Justice that there is no
question of fixing a percentage when the

in fixing a percentage, the Court in St.

       denied   admission    into   any   educational
       institution maintained by the State or
       receiving aid from the State funds, solely
       on the basis of the ground of religion,
       race, caste, language or any of them. It
       does not operate to create a class interest
       or right in the sense that any educational
       institution has to set apart for non-

       to   any   individual   applicant,    a  fixed
       percentage    of   available   seats.   Unless
       Articles 30(1) and 29(2) are allowed to
       operate in their separate fields then what
       started with the voluntary &#x27;sprinkling&#x27; of
       outsiders, would become a major inundation
       and a large chunk of the right of an aided
       minority institution to operate for the
       benefit of the community it was set up to
       serve, would be washed away.”

       may be necessary to provide reservations
       in favour of Scheduled Tribes that exceed
       50% of the seats in panchayats located in
       Scheduled Areas. However, such exceptional

       are examining the quantum of reservations
       in favour of backward classes for the
       purpose of local bodies located in general
       areas. In such circumstances, the vertical
       reservations   in  favour   of  SC/ST/OBCs
       cannot exceed the upper limit of 50% when
       taken together. It is obvious that in
       order to adhere to this upper ceiling,

binding    on    all    courts    within    the
territory of India, and so, it must be
the constant endeavour and concern of
this Court to introduce and maintain an
element of certainty and continuity in
the   interpretation      of    law    in   the
country. Frequent exercise by this
Court of its power to review its
earlier decisions on the ground that
the   view    pressed     before    it    later
appears to the Court to be more
reasonable, may incidentally tend to
make   law     uncertain      and    introduce
confusion which must be consistently
avoided. That is not to say that if on
a subsequent occasion, the Court is
satisfied that its earlier decision was
clearly erroneous, it should hesitate
to correct the error; but before a
previous decision is pronounced to be
plainly erroneous, the Court must be
satisfied     with    a    fair    amount    of
unanimity amongst its members that a
revision of the said view is fully
justified.     It    is   not    possible    or
desirable, and in any case it would be
inexpedient to lay down any principles
which should govern the approach of the
Court in dealing with the question of
reviewing and revising its earlier
decisions. It would always depend upon
several relevant considerations: — What
is the nature of the infirmity or error
on which a plea for a review and
revision of the earlier view is based?
</p><p id="p_450">On the earlier occasion, did some
patent aspects of the question remain

           any previous decision of this Court
           bearing on the point not noticed? Is
           the Court hearing such plea fairly
           unanimous that there is such an error
           in the earlier view? What would be the
           impact of the error on the general
           administration of law or on public
           good? Has the earlier decision been
           followed on subsequent occasions either
           by this Court or by the High Courts?
</p><p id="p_451">           And, would the reversal of the earlier

           relevant    considerations    must    be
           carefully borne in mind whenever this
           Court is called upon to exercise its
           jurisdiction to review and revise its
           earlier decisions. These considerations
           become still more significant when the

       in the maxim “stare decisis et non quieta
       movere” which means to stand by decisions
       and not to disturb what is settled. This
       was aptly put by Lord Coke in his classic
       English version as “Those things which
       have been so often adjudged ought to rest
       in peace”. However, according to Justice
       Frankfurter, the doctrine of stare decisis
       is   not   “an   imprisonment    of  reason”
       (Advanced Law Lexicon, P. Ramanatha Aiyer,
       3rd  Edn.   2005,    Vol.4,   P.4456).   The
       underlying logic of the doctrine is to
       maintain      consistency      and     avoid
       uncertainty. The guiding philosophy is
       that a view which has held the field for a
       long time should not be disturbed only
       because another view is possible.

       the   changed   facts   and circumstances,

doubted. On the clear principle of stare decisis,

judgment       of    Indra    Sawhney     neither      need    to     be

We may again refer to paragraphs 809 and 810 of the

judgment      of   Indra   Sawhney   by     which   the   above

Bench.   We    have    observed    that       the   exceptional

circumstances as indicated in paragraph 810 of Indra

Sawhney were not exhaustive but illustrative. The

Constitution Bench, however, has given indication of

what could be the extra-ordinary circumstances for

exceeding     the   limit   of   50%.   The    Commission   has

noticed the majority opinion in Indra Sawhney. We

may notice paragraph 234-Chapter X of the Report

which is to the following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_466">

    do not prescribe percentage of reservation
    to be provided to each of the backward
    classes i.e. Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
    Tribes   and   Backward   Classes.   However,
    reservations to be provided to the Scheduled
    Castes and Scheduled Tribes has already been
    provided by the Government of India, i.e.
    15% Scheduled Castes and 7.5% for Scheduled
    Tribes. Excluding that 22.5% reservations,
    the existing Bus provisions for reservation
    for   Backward   Classes    is  27%.   Though

that year. In Indra Sawhney &#x27;s case (supra),
the Honourable the Supreme Court for the
first time, by majority, specified a ceiling
for   total     reservation   of  50%.   The
Honourable the Supreme Court considered this
issue while answering question Nos. 6(a),

       &quot;In doing so extreme caution is to be

</p><p id="p_473">225.       After noticing the above proposition of law

the Commission proceeded to deal with the subject.

In     paragraph   234   the   Commission   has   noted   the

Constitution Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_522">M. Nagaraj &amp; Ors. vs.

Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. (supra) observing that this

Court has again considered the aspect of ceiling of

with an assumption that in Nagaraj this Court has

ruled that for relaxation, i.e.,          50%, there should

be quantifiable and contemporary data. We may notice

the exact words of the Commission in paragraph 234

which is to the following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_126">       &quot;The Honourable the Supreme Court has again
       considered this aspect of ceiling of 50%
       reservation in its next decision in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_523">M.
       Nagaraj &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.
       Reported</a> in (2006) 8 SCC 212, wherein the

       validity of inserted clauses (4A) and (4B)
       by way of amendment to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_524">Article 16</a> of the
       Constitution. However, in Nagaraj,      the
       Honourable the Supreme Court has ruled that
       for the relaxation i.e. a ceiling of 50%
       there    should    be    quantifiable   and
       contemporary data (Emphasis supplied).”



</blockquote><p id="p_474">226.     The above view has again been reiterated by

the    Commission   n   paragraph   235   to   the   following

effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_127">           “235.......However, it is seen from
       Nagaraj that ceiling of 50% reservation may
       be   exceeded   by    showing  quantifiable

       as required by Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_525">Article 15</a> and
       Clause   (4)   of   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_526">Article   16</a>   of   the
       Constitution.”


</blockquote><p id="p_475">227. From the above, it is clear that the Commission

read the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_194">                                                                     197</span>


in     Nagaraj     laying      down    that     ceiling       of    50%

reservation may be exceeded by showing quantifiable

contemporary data relating to the backwardness. The

above reading of Constitution Bench judgment by the

Commission was wholly incorrect. We may again notice

the judgment of M. Nagaraj in the above respect. M.

Nagaraj was a case where Constitution (Eighty-fifth

Amendment) Act, 2001 inserting <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_527">Article 16(4A)</a> was

challenged on the ground that the said provision is

unconstitutional and violative of basic structure.

<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_528">Article    16(4A)</a>      which    was    inserted      by    the     above

Amendment provides:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">           “<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_529">Article 16(4A).</a> Nothing in this Article
       shall prevent the State from making any
       provision for reservation in matters of
       promotion, with consequential seniority, to
       any class or classes of posts in the
       services under the State in favour of the
       Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
       which, in the opinion of the State, are not
       adequately represented in the services under
       the State.”


</blockquote><p id="p_476">228.       The Constitution Bench proceeded to consider

the submission raised by the petitioner challenging

the    constitutional       validity    of    the    constitutional

provision.       The   Constitution     Bench       in    Nagaraj    has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_195">                                                            198</span>


noticed     the   maximum     limit      of   reservation   in

paragraphs 55 to 59. The Constitution Bench held

that majority opinion in Indra Sawhney has held that

rule of 50% was a binding rule and not a mere rule

of prudence.      Paragraph 58 of the Constitution Bench

judgment in Nagaraj is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_477">

</pre><p id="p_480">230.       The Constitution Bench noted its conclusion

in paragraphs 121, 122 and 123. In paragraph 123

following has been laid down:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_130">         “123. However, in this case, as stated
       above, the main issue concerns the “extent
       of reservation”. In this regard the State
       concerned will have to show in each case
       the existence of the compelling reasons,
       namely,   backwardness,    inadequacy   of
       representation and overall administrative
       efficiency before making provision for
       reservation. As stated above, the impugned
       provision is an enabling provision. The
       State is not bound to make reservation for
       SCs/STs in matters of promotions. However,
       if they wish to exercise their discretion
       and make such provision, the State has to
       collect    quantifiable    data    showing
       backwardness of the class and inadequacy
       of representation of that class in public
       employment in addition to compliance with
       <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_531">Article 335.</a> It is made clear that even if
       the State has compelling reasons, as
       stated above, the State will have to see
       that its reservation provision does not
       lead to excessiveness so as to breach the
       ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the
       creamy layer or extend the reservation
       indefinitely.”


</blockquote><p id="p_481">231.       The Constitution Bench in paragraph 123 held

that    provision   of   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_532">Article   16(4A)</a>   is   an   enabling

provision and State is not bound to make reservation

for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the

matters of promotion and however, if they wish to

exercise their discretion and make such provision,

the State has to collect quantifiable data showing

backwardness     of    the   class     and        inadequacy   of

representation.
</p>
<p id="p_482">
</p><p id="p_483">232.     The above observation regarding quantifiable

data was in relation to enabling power of the State

to grant reservation in promotion to the Scheduled

Caste and Scheduled Tribes. It is further relevant

to notice that in the last sentence of paragraph 123

it is stated: &quot;It is made clear that even if the

State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the

State    will   have    to   see     that    its     reservation

provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to

breach the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the

creamy     layer       or    extend         the      reservation

indefinitely”.
</p>
<p id="p_484">
</p><p id="p_485">233.     The Constitution Bench, thus, in the above

case clearly laid down that even reservation for

promotion, ceiling of 50% limit cannot be breached.

The Commission has completely erred in understanding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_198">                                                         201</span>


the ratio of the judgment, when the Commission took

the view that on the quantifiable data ceiling of

50% can be breached. There is no such ratio laid

down by this Court in M. Nagaraj.         Hence, the very

basis    of   the   Commission   to   proceed   to   examine

quantifiable data for exceeding the limit of 50% is

unfounded.

<p id="p_486">234.    Paragraph 236 of the Report of the Commission

contains a heading “QUANTIFIABLE DATA”. It is useful

to extract the entire paragraph 236 which is to the

following effect:

<p id="p_487">

<blockquote id="blockquote_132">          236. As per the Census of the year
       2011 population of Scheduled Castes and
       Scheduled    Tribes    in   the    State   of
       Maharashtra     is    11,81%     and    9.35%
       respectively. The percentage of Backward
       Classes, Maratha and Kunbi, have not been
       found to have been specified in the
       Census   of    the  year     2011.   On   the
       instructions     of   the    Government    of
       Maharashtra, the Gokhale Institute of
       Politics and Economics, Pune, conducted
       Socio- Economic Caste Census. It was the
       survey of rural population in the State
       of Maharashtra. On the detailed survey

       community with Kunbi community as 35.7%.
       Percentage of all the reserved Backward
       Classes to be 48.6%. The percentage of
       other Classes or the population, who have
       not disclosed their castes, is shown to
       be 15.7%, From this survey report though
       it relates to the rural area, total
       percentage    of  the    exiting   Backward
       Classes, Maratha and Kunbi, who claim to
       be backward, comes to 48.6% plus 35.7%
       equivalent    to  84.3%    of   the   total
       population. There is no dispute that
       large population of the Maratha and Kunbi
       castes as well as existing Backward
       Classes are inhabitants of the rural
       areas. 48.6% population of the existing
       reserved   category   including   Scheduled
       Castes, Scheduled Tribes and all Backward
       Classes have been already identified as
       socially and educationally backward. The
       Maratha    caste   has    been   identified
       socially, educationally and economically
       backward by this Commission. So as total
       84.3% population can be said to be of

       found above on appreciation of evidence
       collected/produced before it that 80% to

       85% backward Population within a ceiling
       of 50% will be injustice to them and as
       such it would frustrate the very purpose
       of the reservation policy arising out of
       <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_535">Article   15</a>  and   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_536">Article   16</a>    of  the
       Constitution. In the considered opinion
       of this Commission, this is the extra
       ordinary   situation,   which    has   been
       mentioned in the 2nd Term of Reference
       and as required by Indra Sawhney . 80% to
       85% backward population adverted to above
       speaks about quantifiable contemporary
       data, vide Nagaraj. If, accordingly,
       ceiling of 50% increased efficiency in
       administration could not be affected
       because all of them would compete. This
       Commission record facts findings that as
       required by the 2nd Term of Reference
       there    are    not    only    exceptional
       circumstances but also extra ordinary
       situations, which need to be applied for
       the grant of the reservation in the
       present context in view of Clause (4) of
       <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_537">Article 15</a> and Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_538">Article 16</a>
       of the Constitution.) This will enable
       the Government of Maharashtra to make
       special provision for the advancement of
       the Maratha community, which is certainly
       socially and educationally backward class
       and ultimately that will enable the
       Government   of   Maharashtra     to   make
       provision for reservation of appointment
       or posts in favour of the Maratha
       community in the services under the
       State.”


</blockquote><p id="p_489">236.     It is clear that the entire basis of the

Commission to exceed 50% limit is that since the

population of backward class is between 80% to 85%,

reservation to them within the ceiling 50% will be

injustice to them.

<p id="p_490">
</p><p id="p_491">237.      We may revert back to paragraph 810 where

Indra        Sawhney       has     given       illustration       which

illustration         is    regarding        certain    extra-ordinary

situations. The exact words used in paragraph 810

are:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_134">          “It might happen that in far flung and
       remote areas the population inhabiting
       those areas might, on account of their
       being out of the main stream of national
       life and in view of conditions peculiar to
       and characteristical to them, need to be
       treated   in   a   different   way,   some
       relaxation in this strict rule may become
       imperative. In doing so, extreme caution
       is to be exercised and a special case made
       out.”



</blockquote><p id="p_492">238.     Shri Rohtagi had submitted that the test laid

down    in    paragraph      810     is    only    geographical      test

which was an illustration. It is true that in Indra

Sawhney        the    expression      used     was    “far   flung   and

remote areas” but the social test which was a part

of     the     same       sentence        stated     “the    population

being out of the main stream of national life and in

view of conditions peculiar to and characteristical

to    them”.   Thus,   one   of    the    social   conditions   in

paragraph 810 is that being within the main stream

of    National   Life,    the     case    of   Maratha   does   not

satisfy the extra-ordinary situations as indicated

in paragraph 810 of Indra Sawhney .                   The Marathas

are in the main stream of the National Life. It is

not    even    disputed   that     Marathas     are    politically

dominant caste.
</p>
<p id="p_493">
</p><p id="p_494">239.     This Court in several judgments has noticed

that what can be the extra-ordinary situations as

contemplated in paragraph 810 in few other cases. We

have referred above the three-Judge Bench judgment

in <a href="/doc/1356187/" id="a_539">Union of India and others vs. Rakesh Kumar and

others</a>, (2010) 4 SCC 50, where three-Judge Bench

held that exceptional case of 50% ceiling can be in

regard to Panchayats in scheduled areas. The above

three-Judge      Bench    has      also    been    approved     and

reiterated by the Constitution Bench of this Court

in K.K. Krishnamurthi (supra). In the above cases

this    Court      was      examining       the    reservation       in

Panchayats.      In    the        context   of    Part   IX    of   the

Constitution, 50% ceiling principle was applied but

exception was noticed.
</p>
<p id="p_495">
</p><p id="p_496">240.    In the above context, we may also notice the

paragraph 163 of the impugned judgment of the High

Court where the High Court has also come to the

conclusion that the Maratha has made out a case of

extra-ordinary         situation         within   the    meaning     of

paragraph    610      of    Indra    Sawhney&#x27;s     case.      The   High

Court in paragraph 163 of judgment made following

observation:

<blockquote id="blockquote_135">         “163...We would curiously refer to the
       reports, which would disclose that it is
       for the first time in form of Gaikwad

       collected and in terms of Nagaraj, the
       quantifiable    data,    inadequacy    of
       representation are two key factors which
       would permit exceeding of reservation of
       50% by the State. ….”



</blockquote><p id="p_497">241.    The High Court has endorsed the opinion of the

Commission      that       when    the    population     of   backward

class is 85% if they would get only 50%, it would

not   be   valid.   In   paragraph   165   of   the   impugned

judgment following is the opinion of the High Court:

</p><pre id="pre_12">          “165....The       percentage      of    other
      classes    of    population     who    have   not
</pre><p id="p_498">      disclosed their caste have been shown to
      be   15.7%.     The     Commission      therefore
      concludes that though the survey report
      relates    to     rural     area,    the    total
      percentage of existing backward classes,
      Maratha and kunbi, who claim to be
      backward    comes      to    48.6%    +    35.7%,
      equivalent     to     84.3%    of    the    total
      population. The Commission has also made
      a reference to the census of the year
      1872 which calculates the population of
      Shudras and the census report of 1872
      from which the position emerge that more
      than 80% population was found backward in
      the   census     of    1872.    The   commission
      categorizes this as an extra-ordinary
      situation since the majority of the
      unequals are living with the minority of
      the equals. The figures available on
      record on the basis of 2011 census
      disclose that the State population is
      about    11.24      crores     out    of    which
      3,68,83,000 is the population of OBC
      (VJNT,    OBC    SBC)     The    statistics    of
      Ministry      of      Social      Justice     and
      Empowerment, Government of India has
      given the State wise percentage of OBCs
      in India and for Maharashtra it is 33.8%
      whereas    SC-ST     is    22%.    The    Gaikwad

      final.doc therefore deduced that the
      population of Marathas is 30%. Therefore,
      in terms of the population, if we look at
      the figures then the situation which
      emerges is that almost 85% of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_206">                                                    208</span>


       population is of the backward classes and
       to suggest that if 85% of people are
       backward and they get only a reservation
       of 50%, it would be traversity of
       justice. When we speak of equality –
       equality of status and opportunity, then
       whether this disparity would be referred
       to as achieving equality is the moot
       question. The situation of extra-ordinary
       circumstances as set out though by way of
       illustration in Indra Sawhney would thus
       get attracted and the theme of the Indian
       Constitution to achieve equality can be
       attained. Once we have accepted that the
       Maratha community is a backward class,
       then it is imperative on the part of the
       State to uplift the said community and if
       the State does so, and in extra ordinary
       circumstances, exceed the limit of 50%,
       we feel that this is an extra ordinary
       situation to cross the limit of 50%.”


</p><p id="p_499">242.       Again at page 453 of the judgment, the High

Court reiterated that extra-ordinary situations have

been culled out by the report since backward class

is 85%, Maratha being 30%.       Treating above to be

extra-ordinary situation following observations have

been made in paragraph 170:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_136">           “170...The extra-ordinary situations
       have been culled out as the report has
       declared that Maratha community comprise
       30% of the population of the State and
       this figure is derived on the basis of
       quantifiable   data.  The   extra-ordinary
       situation is therefore carved out for
       awarding an adequate representation to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_207">                                                               209</span>


       Maratha community who is now declared
       socially, educationally and economically
       backward. Based on the population of 30%,
       Commission has arrived at a conclusion
       that   the  total   percentage   of   State
       population which is entitled for the
       constitutional benefits and advantages as
       listed under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_540">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_541">Article
       16(4)</a> would be around 85% and this is a
       compelling     extra-ordinary     situation
       demanding extra-ordinary solution within
       the constitutional framework. ...”



</blockquote><p id="p_500">243.     From the above, it is clear that both the

Commission and the High Court treated the extra-

ordinary situations with regard to exceeding 50% for

granting separate reservation to Maratha, the fact

that    population      of    backward     class    is   85%   and

reservation     limit    is   only   50%.    The    above   extra-

ordinary circumstances as opined by the Commission

and approved by the High Court is not extra-ordinary

situation as referred to in paragraph 810 of Indra

Sawhney judgment. The Marathas are dominant forward

class and are in the main stream of National life.

The     above   situation      is    not    an     extra-ordinary

situation contemplated by Indra Sawhney judgment and

both Commission and the High Court fell in error in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_208">                                                               210</span>


accepting the above circumstances as extra-ordinary

circumstance for exceeding the 50 % limit. At this

stage,   we   may   notice   that   what   was    said   by   Dr.

Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly debates dated

30.11.1948     while    debating     draft       <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_542">Article      10</a><a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_543">/3

(Article 16</a>(4) of the Constitution). Dr. Ambedkar by

giving an illustration said :
</p>
<p id="p_501">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_137">        “Supposing, for instance, we were to
    concede in full the demand of those
    communities who have not been so far
    employed in the public services to the
    fullest extent,what would really happen
    is, we shall be completely destroying the
    first proposition upon which we are all
    agreed, namely, that there shall be an
    equality of opportunity. Let me give an
    illustration. Supposing, for instance,
    reservations were made for a community or
    a collection of communities, the total of
    which came to something like 70 per cent.
    of the total posts under the State and
    only 30 per cent. are retained as the
    unreserved. Could anybody say that the
    reservation of 30 per cent. As open to
    general competition would be satisfactory
    from the point of view of giving effect to
    the first principle, namely, that there
    shall be equality of opportunity? It
    cannot be in my judgment. Therefore the
    seats to be reserved, if the reservation
    is to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of
    <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_544">Article 10</a>, must be confined to a minority
    of seats. It is then only that the first
    principle could find its place in the
    Constitution and effective in operation.”

</blockquote><p id="p_502">244. The illustration given by Dr. Ambedkar that

supposing 70% posts are reserved and 30% may retain

as unreserved, can anybody say that 30% as open to

general competition would be satisfactory from point

of view of giving effect to the first principle of

equality, the answer given by Dr. Ambedkar was in

negative.     Thus,    Constituent       Assembly     by      giving

illustration has already disapproved principle which

is    now   propounded     by   the   High   Court.      We   cannot

approve the view of the High court based on the same

view taken by the Commission.

the    considered     opinion    that    neither    the       Gaikwad

Commission&#x27;s report nor the judgment of the High

Court has made out an extra-ordinary situation in

the case of Maratha where ceiling of 50% can be

exceeded.     We    have   already      noticed    the     relevant

discussion and conclusion of the Commission in the

above regard and we have found that the conclusions

that there is no case of extra-ordinary situation

three    State    Backward        Classes    Commissions     for    the

to be included in Other Backward Community which

claim was repeatedly negatived. He submits that the

report of National Backward Classes Commissions and

State Backward Classes Commissions could not have

been ignored by Gaikward Commission in the manner it

has dealt with the earlier reports. Shri Sancheti

submits      that        the      National      Backward     Classes

Commission as well as the State Backward Classes

Commission considered the contemporaneous data and

came to a conclusion at a particular time. Gaikward

Commission       which     was    appointed     in    2017   had    no

jurisdiction to pronounce that Maratha was backward

community from the beginning and all earlier reports

are     faulty.     Shri       Sancheti     submits   that   Maratha

The   majority      of     Legislature         belongs     to    Maratha

the people belonging to Maratha community. In 24 of

the purpose of sample survey five different Agencies

have been nominated. The Commission also conducted

public     hearing,      collected       representations        from

persons, numbering 195174. Out of representations,

193651     persons    are    in   favour    of   reservation      to

Maratha whereas 1523 were in favour of reservation

of     Maratha       community      by      creating        separate

percentage. The Commission also recorded evidence,

obtained information from the Government departments

and    other   organisations,        Universities      and     after

fixing parameters allocated 10 marks for socially

backward class, 8 marks out of 25 marks has been

allocated for educational backwardness, 7 marks to

the economically backward class and after following

the marking system held that Maratha community has

obtained more that 12.5 marks and has satisfied that

it    is   socially,        educationally    and    economically

backward class. 784 resolutions of Gram Panchayats

were in favour of granting reservation of OBC.                   It

The report of Gaikwad Commission is based on sample

Government formed opinion that Maratha community is

a   socially     and    educationally     backward    class     and

deserves a separate reservation in recognition of

judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_564">M.R. Balaji vs. The State

of Mysore and others</a>, AIR (1963) SC 649. In the

above   case,    this   Court   had   occasion   to   consider

Nagan Gowda Committee which has submitted a report

in 1961 and made a recommendation for reservation.

In pursuance of the report, the State of Mysore had

issued an order dated 31.07.1961 deciding to reserve

15% seats for Scheduled Castes and 3% for Scheduled

Tribes and 50% for backward class totaling to 68% of

seats available for admission to the Engineering and

Medical Colleges and to other technical institutions

in the State. The Constitution Bench elaborated the

extent of judicial review to an executive action. In

paragraph 35 of the judgment, the Constitution Bench

laid down following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_156">    “35. The petitioners contend that having
    regard to the infirmities in the impugned
    order, action of the State in issuing the
    said order amounts to a fraud on the
    Constitutional power conferred on the
    State by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_565">Article 15(4).</a> This argument is
    well-founded, and must be upheld. When it
    is said about an executive action that it
    is a fraud on the Constitution, it does
    not necessarily mean that the action is
    actuated by mala fides. An executive
    action which is patently and plainly
    outside the limits of the constitutional
    authority conferred on the State in that
    behalf is struck down as being ultra vires
    the State&#x27;s authority. If, on the other
    hand, the executive action does not
    patently    or    overtly    transgress    the
    authority    conferred    on    it    by   the
    Constitution, but the transgression is
    covert or latent, the said action is
    struck down as being a fraud on the
    relevant constitutional power. It is in
    this connection that courts often consider
    the substance of the matter and not its
    form and in ascertaining the substance of
    the matter, the appearance or the cloak,
    or the veil of the executive action is
    carefully scrutinized and if it appears
    that notwithstanding the appearance, the
    cloak or the veil of the executive action,
    in    substance     and    in     truth    the
    constitutional       power       has      been
    transgressed,    the   impugned    action   is
    struck    down    as    a   fraud    on    the
    Constitution. ….”

264(a). From the above, it is clear that what was

emphasised by the Court is that it is the substance

of the matter which has to be examined and not its

form, appearance, or the cloak, or the veil of the

executive action has to be carefully scrutinised.

<p id="p_553">265.     The next judgment which we need to notice is

the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/492135/" id="a_566">The State of Andhra

Pradesh and others vs. U.S.V. Balram</a>, etc., (1972) 1

SCC 660. The above case is also on basis of the

Commission&#x27;s report. The Commission for the backward

classes in the State of Andhra Pradesh appointed by

the State Government submitted a report. The High

Court held the enumeration of the backward classes

as well as reservation invalid. The State of Andhra

Pradesh filed the appeal. The grounds of challenge

were noticed in Paragraph 77 of the judgment. In

paragraph 83-A of the judgment this Court observed:

that   the   question   to   be   answered   is   whether   the

materials relied in the report are not adequate or

sufficient to support its conclusion. Following have

been laid down in paragraph 83-A:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_230">                                                               232</span><p id="p_554">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_157">       &quot;83-A. … But, in our opinion, the question
       is whether on the materials collected by
       the Commission and referred to in its
       report, can it be stated that those
       materials are not adequate or sufficient
       to support its conclusion that the persons
       mentioned in the list as Backward Classes
       are     socially     and     educationally
       backward? ....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_158">       ...Therefore, the proper approach, in our
       opinion, should be to see whether the
       relevant data and materials referred to in
       the report of the Commission justify its
       conclusions. ….”


</blockquote><p id="p_555">266.       Thus, one of the parameters of scrutiny of a

Commission&#x27;s report is that whether on the basis of

data and materials referred to in the report whether

conclusions arrived by the Commission are justified.


</p><p id="p_556">267.       In   Indra   Sawhney,     one   of   the    questions

framed    by    the   Constitution    Bench     to    answer   was

question No.9, which is to the following fact:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_159">          &quot;9. Whether the extent of judicial
       review is restricted with regard to the
       identification of Backward Classes and the
       percentage of reservations made for such
       classes   to   a   demonstrably   perverse
       identification    or     a    demonstrably
       unreasonable percentage?”

</blockquote><p id="p_557">268.       In paragraph 842 of Indra Sawhney following

was laid down:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_160">           “842. It is enough to say on this
       question that there is no particular or
       special standard of judicial scrutiny in
       matters arising under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_567">Article 16(4)</a> or for
       that matter, under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_568">Article 15(4).</a> The
       extent and scope of judicial scrutiny
       depends upon the nature of the subject-
       matter, the nature of the right affected,
       the   character    of   the    legal   and
       constitutional provisions applicable and
       so on. The acts and orders of the State
       made under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_569">Article 16(4)</a> do not enjoy any
       particular kind of immunity. At the same
       time, we must say that court would
       normally extend due deference to the
       judgment and discretion of the executive —
       a co-equal wing — in these matters. .....”


</blockquote><p id="p_558">269.       In   paragraph      798,     it   was   held    by   the

Constitution     Bench   in     Indra    Sawhney   that    opinion

formed with respect to grant of reservation is not

beyond      judicial          scrutiny       altogether.        The

Constitution Bench referred to an earlier judgment

of this Court in <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_570">Barium Chemicals v. Company Law

Board</a>,    AIR   1967     SC    295.     In   the   above    regard

paragraph 798 is extracted for ready reference:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_161">           “798. …It does not, however, mean that

       be repeated here. Suffice it to mention
       that the said principles apply equally in
       the case of a constitutional provision
       like <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_572">Article 16(4)</a> which expressly places
       the     particular      fact    (inadequate
       representation)    within   the  subjective
       judgment of the State/executive.”


</blockquote><p id="p_559">270.          Indra       Sawhney     having      referred      to   the

judgment of this Court in Barium Chemicals (supra)

for the scope and reach of judicial scrutiny. We

need     to     refer       the     test    enunciated     in    Barium

Chemicals.          The     Constitution         Bench     in    Barium

Chemicals had occasion to consider the expression

“if    in     the     opinion       of     the   Central     Government

occurring in <a href="/doc/727860/" id="a_573">Section 237</a> of Companies Act, 1956”.

Justice Hidayatullah laid down that no doubt the

formation of opinion is subjective but the existence

of the circumstances relevant to the inference as

the sine quo non for action must be demonstrable.

Following observations were made in paragraph 27:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_162">       “27. …No doubt the formation of opinion                  is
       subjective    but    the   existence                     of
       circumstances relevant to the inference                  as

       demonstrable. If the action is questioned
       on the ground that no circumstances
       leading to an inference of the kind
       contemplated by the section exists, the
       action might be exposed to interference
       unless the existence of the circumstances
       is made out. As my brother Shelat has put
       it trenchantly:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_163">         “It is not reasonable to say that the
       clause permitted the Government to say
       that   it  has   formed  the   opinion on
       circumstances which it thinks exist….”
         Since the existence of “circumstances”
       is a condition fundamental to the making
       of an opinion, the existence of the
       circumstances, if questioned, has to be
       proved at least prima facie.”

</blockquote><p id="p_560">271.     Justice Shelat with whom Justice Hidayatullah

has agreed in paragraph 63 laid down following:

       subjective process not lending itself even

the society who had no opportunities in the past to

be part of the State services or to share the power

<blockquote id="blockquote_167">           “694. The above material makes it
       amply clear that the objective behind
       clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_590">Article 16</a> was the sharing
       of State power. The State power which was
       almost exclusively monopolized by the
       upper castes i.e., a few communities, was
       now sought to be made broad-based. The
       backward communities who were till then
       kept out of apparatus of power, were
       sought to be inducted there into and since
       that was not practicable in the normal
       course, a special provision was made to
       effectuate the said objective. In short,
       the objective behind <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_591">Article 16(4)</a> is
       empowerment   of  the   deprived  backward
       communities – to give them a share in the

       governance of the community.”

    constitutional     invalidity      to    these
    enabling provisions. However, when the
    State fails to identify and implement the
    controlling factors then excessiveness
    comes in, which is to be decided on the
    facts of each case. In a given case, where
    excessiveness      results      in     reverse
    discrimination, this Court has to examine
    individual cases and decide the matter in
    accordance with law. This is the theory of
    “guided power”. We may once again repeat

Maratha      classes    are   9,321.    The    Maratha     Community

obviously has been competing in the open category

and    has     obtained       the    post     as    open    category

candidates.       The Chart also mentioned below each

class the percentage against the column of posts

filled    from   Maratha        class,    percentage      11.16%      has

been mentioned. Similarly, different percentage has

been mentioned against all other classes. When we

take the total number of posts, posts filled for

open    category,    it    is    mentioned      as     28,048   out   of

which    Marathas    are    9,321.       When    we    calculate      the

percentage of Maratha representation out of the open

category filled post, percentage comes out to 33.23

percent. Thus, the correct percentage of Maratha out

of the open category post is 33.23 percent which

indicates     that   more    than    33    percent       of   the   open

category      post   has    been     bagged       by     Maratha.     In

Maharashtra      while      considering          the      status      of

reservation, we have noticed that 52 percent posts

are reserved for different categories and only 48

percent posts are available for open category. Out

of 48 percent posts available for open category,

Marathas have obtained 33.23 percent. The percentage

given by the Commission in below Maratha class i.e.

11.86% is obviously wrong and erroneous. The Maratha

who    have   been   competing      in    open       category   cannot

claim    any   post   in     the   reserved      category          of   52

percent. Thus, the representation has to be computed

taking into the seats of open category. Similarly,

while computing the percentage of Marathas in Grade

B, C and D, similar mistakes have been committed by

the Commission. In Grade-B, total posts filled from

open category were 31193 out of which Marathas were

9057,    percentage     of      which    comes    out     to       29.03

percent. In Grade-C, total posts filled from open

category were 4,13,381 out of which Marathas were

1,53,224, percentage of which comes out to 37.06

percent and for Grade-D, total posts filled form

open category were 99592 out of which Marathas were

36387,     percentage      of   which    comes    out        to    36.53

</pre><p id="p_607">294. The above representation of Marathas in public

services in Grade-A, B, C and D are adequate and

satisfactory. One community bagging such number of

posts in public services is a matter of pride for

the community and its representation in no manner

can be said to not adequate in public services. The

Constitutional pre-condition that backward class is

not   adequately          represented      is   not     fulfilled.   The

State Government has formed opinion on the basis of

the     above       figures      submitted        by      the    Gaikwad

Commission.         The    opinion    of    the       State   Government

being       based    on    the   report,        not    fulfilling    the

Constitutional requirement for granting reservation

to Maratha community becomes unsustainable.

make it abundantly clear that they are adequately

represented in the services. The Commission although

noted all the figures correctly in all the columns

but   committed       error   in     computing     the    percentage

adding posts available for open category as well as

posts      available   for    reserved        categories.       Maratha

cannot claim to compete for the reserved category

posts;     hence,   there     is   no     question   of    computing

their representation including the reserved category

posts.     The   representation          of   Marathas    has    to   be

against open category posts, hence, their percentage

has   to    be   determined     as    compared     to    total    open

category     filled    posts,      and    the   representation        of

Marathas in most of the Grades is above 30 percent.

This is the basic error committed by the Commission

in computing the percentage due to which it fell in

error in finding their representation in services

inadequate.

<p id="p_622">304. There is one more fundamental error which has

been committed by the Commission. The Constitution

adequately represented in the public services. The

Commission labored under misconception that unless

Maratha community is not represented equivalent to

its proportion, it is not adequately represented. We

may notice what has been said by the Commission in

paragraph     219     while      recording       its    conclusion

emerging from the analysis of information contained

in   Table   A,B,C    and   D.   In     paragraph      219(c),   the

Commission states: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_171">         “219(C)...The obvious conclusion that
     emerges from the above information is that
     in none of the four grades the strength of
     Maratha Class employees is touching the
     proportion to their population in the
     State which is based on various sources is
     estimated at an average 30%. So also,
     their presence in administration is more

is required by the State for providing reservation

representation       but    adequate      representation.        The

fundamental error committed by the Commission.

the recommendation without scrutinizing the report

with regard to correct percentage of representation

precondition as mandated by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_601">Article 16(4)</a> being not

fulfilled with regard to Maratha class, both the

Gaikwad        Commission’s       report     and      consequential

legislation      are    unsustainable.       We    thus    hold    that

Maratha class was not entitled for any reservation

under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_602">Article 16(4)</a> and grant of reservation under

<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_603">Article    16(4)</a>       is   unconstitutional       and     cannot      be

<p id="p_629">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_173">    “18. A community with a history of such
    origin and close association with the
    ruling classes, a community, many of whose
    members,   from   its   inception   enjoyed
    important economic and political rights
    and positions of power and influence and
    eventually became rulers and members of
    ruling classes at different levels cannot
    in any way be thought to have suffered any
    social disadvantages. The Bench is aware
    that in what is identified as a ruling
    class/caste, every member of it does not
    rule, but the fact that those who rule
    come from a distinct caste community
    imparts a certain amount of prestige and
    self-confidence even to those from the
    same caste/community who personally belong
    to the ruling functionaries and to the
    totality of that caste/community. It is
    significant to note that Marathas have
    sought and received recognition of as of
    Kshatriya Varna category and therefore
    does not secure them status or caste
    upgradation    Examples   are    Vanniakula
    Kshatriya in Tamil Nadu, the adoption of
    the umbrella name &quot;Kshatriya&quot; by all BCs
    in Gujarat, Paundra- Kshatriya (an SC) in
    West Bengal and so on. But no community

<p id="p_630">19. The modern history of Maharashtra is
witness to the continued dominance of
Marathas in its society and polity as
evident from the fact, for example, that
in   the    post-Independence   period, the
community provided the largest number of
Chief Ministers. During the full Bench
hearing on 14.12.99, the Bench had put the
question to the representatives of the
Maratha Community as to why despite there
being    so    many  Chief    Ministers and
important Ministers in the State, some of
whom also became important Ministers in
the Centre, none of them got or moved to
get Marathas included in the list of BCs
is eloquent testimony not only of the fact
that Marathas are not a backward class but
also of the wisdom and objectivity of
these Chief Ministers. The only ground
raised by the representatives of the
community in support of their claim for
inclusion in the list of BCs what the fact
of the origin of Marathas from Kunbis and
the alleged use of the name Maratha by
some members of Kunbi caste in some areas
of the State. The Bench is of the view
that since there, undoubtedly, is a
distinct class/community Called &quot;Maratha&quot;
and since it is obviously an advanced
community in society and polity as already
noted, it cannot be included in the list
of Backward Classes. The Bench cannot
accept the claim of the representatives of
the community that many known Maratha
leaders including one whose name they
mentioned have got caste certificates as
&quot;Kunbi&quot; as a valid ground for inclusion of
Marathas in the list of BCs with Kunbis.
</p><p id="p_631">The Bench has no ground to believe that
any known Maratha leaders would have
sought such certificates, nor have those
who have made this allegations presented
any evidence in support of this claim. But
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_262">                                                     262</span>


       even if, for argument&#x27;s sake, claim or
       argument is it does not prove that Maratha
       is the same as Kunbi or synonym of Kunbi.
</p><p id="p_632">       Leaving aside the allegations made by some
       of the representatives of the community,
       the Bench is aware that some shortsighted
       individuals belonging to different non-
</p><p id="p_633">       backward castes unfortunately resort to
       seeking    and    securing    fake    caste
       certificates and in the context of the
       well-known     qualities     of    India&#x27;s
       administrative system, elements are not
       rare which entertain such requests and
       deliberately     issue     false      caste
       certificates. This menace, like different
       forms of corruption, has become more and
       more threatening. In certain Advices, the
       Commission has advised the Central and
       State Governments how this menace could be
       extirpated. But false caste-certificates
       and false caste-identities based on them
       cannot change the reality of caste-
</p><p id="p_634">       identities as they occur in society.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_635">
</p><p id="p_636">       22. In view of the above facts and
       position, the Bench finds that Maratha is
       not a socially backward community but is a
       socially    advanced    and    prestigious
       community and therefore the Request for
       Inclusion of &quot;Maratha&quot; in the Central List
       of Backward Classes for Maharashtra along
       with Kunbhi should be rejected. In fact
       &quot;Maratha&quot; does not merit inclusion in the
       Central list of Backward Classes for
       Maharashtra either jointly with &quot;Kunbhi&quot;
       or under a separate entity of it&#x27;s own.”

India</a>, (2015) 4 SCC 697, has categorically laid down

in paragraph 49 that a decision which impacts the

Constitution      must    be    taken     on     contemporaneous

to    present    status       since       object       is     to    take

affirmative actions in present or in future to help

the    particular    community.       Three    National       Backward

Classes Commissions reports as noted above in the

year 1955, 1980 and 2000, were the reports regarding

the status of the community as was found at the

relevant        time.         Similarly,           three           State

Committee/Commissions         in   the    year     1961,     2001    and

2008 also were reporting the status of Marathas at

the relevant time when the report was submitted. The

term of the reference of the Gaikwad Commission was

not to examine as to whether earlier reports of the

National      Commissions      for       Backward       Classes      or

Committee/Commissions of the State earlier in not

recommending     Maratha      to   be    included      in    OBC    were

correct or not. Terms of reference which is a part

of    the   report   clause    (1)      and   clause    (3)    clearly

indicate      that    the     Commission         was    to     collect

contemporaneous data. Quantifiable data collected by

the State which have been referred in the report

were of the data collected period after 2014. The

open to the State to collect relevant data to find

out as to whether a particular caste or community is

to be included in the list of other backward classes

or excluded from the same despite any decision to

the contrary taken earlier. The Constitution Bench

in Indra Sawhney has also laid down for periodical

review    which   is   for   the    purpose    and    object    that

those    communities    who    were    earlier       backward    and

advanced should be excluded and those communities

who were earlier advanced and might have degraded

into backward class should be included. Thus, the

State was fully entitled to appoint backward classes

report.

is to be included in OBC”.                    The Commission has not

adverted     to     this         aspect       of    the      matter.            The

Commission ought to have also focused on comparative

analysis as to what happened in the recent years

that   Marathas      have        become       backward       from       forward

class. In this context, we may also refer to the

judgment of this Court in Ram Singh (supra) where

National    Backward           Classes    Commission         has       rejected

the claim of Jat to be included in other backward

communities        with    regard        to    several           States.        The

National     Commission            recommended             that        Jat       is

politically       dominant        class       and     need       not      to     be

included in OBC. The Union disregarding the said

report had issued a notification including Jat as

OBC in the different States in the Central List. It

was    challenged         in     this     Court       by     way     of        writ

petition.     This        Court     held       that        the     report        of

National Backward Classes Commission could not have

been disregarded and ought to have been given due

weight.     This     Court       held     that      Jat      community           is

politically organised class which was rightly not

In paragraph 55 following was laid down:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_175">         “55. The perception of a self-proclaimed
       socially backward class of citizens or
       even the perception of the “advanced
       classes” as to the social status of the
       “less fortunates” cannot continue to be a
       constitutionally permissible yardstick for
       determination of backwardness, both in the
       context of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the
       Constitution. Neither can backwardness any
       longer be a matter of determination on the
       basis of mathematical formulae evolved by
       taking into account social, economic and
       educational indicators. Determination of
       backwardness   must   also  cease   to   be
       relative: possible wrong inclusions cannot
       be the basis for further inclusions but
       the gates would be opened only to permit
       entry of the most distressed. Any other
       inclusion would be a serious abdication of
       the constitutional duty of the State.
       Judged by the aforesaid standards we must
       hold that inclusion of the politically
       organised classes (such as Jats) in the
       List of Backward Classes mainly, if not
       solely,   on  the   basis  that   on   same
       parameters other groups who have fared
       better have been so included cannot be

effect; writ petition was filed in the High Court

challenging the Ordinance and inclusion of Maratha

interim order in Writ Petition No.2053 of 2014 on

placed before the Court for staying the Ordinance

submissions of the parties above facts have been

repeated and it has been submitted that those facts

reflects on backward class or classes both in favour

and against such backward class. We have noticed

that the Commission has taken erroneous view that

the representation of Maratha community in public

obtained     by      the    Commission         itself    indicate       that

students of Maratha community have succeeded in open

competition and got admissions in all the streams

including Engineering, Medical Graduation and Post-

Graduation        Courses      and      their     percentage      is     not

negligible.       The      computation     of     percentage       by    the

Commission       against       Maratha     is    since     out    of    open

category seats, since 50% seats are for reserved

category and only 50% are open, the percentage of

the Maratha, thus, shall substantially increase as

per table given by the Commission itself.

of 97, 89 posts filled from open category, there are

16   IAS   belong        to    Maratha      community.            When    we

compute     the     percentage         of        IAS,    IPS    and     IFS,

percentage of Maratha out of the posts filled from

open category candidates comes to 15.52, 27.85 and

regarding engagement of Maratha in Higher Academic

and Educational Fields of University Assignments in

the State in paragraph 226. The Table D has been

compiled by the Commission. In the said paragraph

where    Marathas       occupied   all     categories      of   posts,

including Head of Department, Professor, Associate

Professor    and    Assistant      Professor,      the     Commission

has in the Chart also noted the number of Marathas

occupying different posts in several Universities.

It is true that in some of the Universities there

may not be Maratha community in one or two posts but

Chart indicates that there are sufficient number of

Maratha in different Universities occupying posts of

HOD,    Professor,      Associate     Professor      and    Assistant

Professor.

regarding     Maratha       students      occupying        Engineering,

occupying posts of Higher Academic in Universities,

mere    fact   that     their       occupation      of    posts   is    not

equivalent      to     the    proportion       of   their    population

cannot lead to the conclusion that they are socially

and educationally backward. We are conscious that

the Commission has conducted sample survey collected

representations and other information, data and has

allotted       marks     on     social       and     educational        and

economic backward class and in the marking Marathas

were found to be backward. However, data and facts

which have been collected by the Commission noted

above    clearly       indicate      that    Marathas       are   neither

socially       nor      educationally          backward       and       the

conclusion recorded by the Gaikwad Commission on the

basis of its marking system, indicator and marking

is    not   sufficient        to    conclude       that    Marathas     are

socially and educationally backward.

</p><p id="p_677">330. The case of the appellant is that after 102 nd

Amendment to the Constitution which came into force

with    effect    from     15.08.2018,      the     Maharashtra

Legislature had no competence to enact Act, 2018.

After the Constitution 102nd Amendment, the States

have no power to identify socially and educationally

backward classes. The Constitution 102nd Amendment

had    brought    change   in   the   regime      already    in

existence for backward class to fall it in line with

Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_614">Article

366(26C)</a> says that the phrase SEBCs “means” those

backward classes which are so deemed under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_615">Article

342A</a>, for the purposes of this Constitution. The

expression “for the purposes of this Constitution”

is used in Articles 15(4) and 16(4), 338B, 342A and

in other Articles of the Constitution of India. In

view of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_616">Article 342A</a> the SEBCs are those who are

specified by the President by public notification

for the purposes of a State or Union Territory under

sub-clause(1) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_617">Article 342A.</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_618">Article 342A</a> being

interpreted     exactly     in    the   same    manner.      The

Parliament inserted phrase “Central List” in clause

(2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_619">Article 342A</a> only to emphasize the fact that

after   Constitution    102nd    Amendment,    the   only   list

Central List drawn by the President.

<p id="p_678">331. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that

Maharashtra Legislature had no competence to enact

2018 Legislation after Constitution 102nd Amendment.

Learned senior counsel, Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan,

reliance on Select Committee report of Rajya Sabha

is unwarranted.

<p id="p_679">332.       The above submissions of the appellant have

been stoutly refuted by the learned counsel for the

State of Maharashtra as well as other States. Under

Articles 15(4) and 16(4), the Union and the States

have co-equal powers to advance the interest of the

socially      and    educationally      backward      classes;

therefore, any exercise of power by the Union cannot

socially       and    educationally            backward       classes.     The

expression       “for       the    purpose      of     the    Constitution”

can,    therefore,          only    to     be    construed       with     the

contours    of       the    power    that       Union    is    entitled    to

exercise       with     respect      to    entities,          institutions,

authorities and public sector enterprises under the

control    of    the       Union.    The       power    to    identify    and

empower socially and educationally backward classes

and determining the extent of reservation required

is    vested    in     the    State       by    our     Constitution      and

recognised       by        judicial       pronouncements          including

Indra     Sawhney.          The     expression           “Central        List”

occurring       in      <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_621">Article         342A(2)</a>        relates      to     the

identification          under      <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_622">Article       342A(1)</a>       wherein     the

Central     List           will     include       the        socially      and

educationally backward classes for the purposes of

the    Central       Government.         Any     other       interpretation

would allow to whittle down the legislative power of

the State. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_623">Article 342A</a> must be interpreted in the

historical       context.          It     is     submitted       that      the

regard to Central List. The expression Central List

Committee           report      and     other     materials         throw

considerable light on the intention of Parliament

for inserting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_624">Article 342A</a> in the Constitution. The

Constitutional amendment has to be interpreted in

the light of the Parliamentary intention. The power

of the State Government to legislate cannot be taken

away without amendment of Articles 15 and 16. The

Parliament          has   not   even    exercised       its    power   to

occupy the field of a State by clearly using the

expression &#x27;Central List&#x27; in sub-clause (2). If the

Constitution 102nd Amendment is interpreted in the

manner         as     appellants        are     interpreting,          the

Constitutional Amendment shall be violative of the

constitute      a     permanent      body    for     entertaining,

examining the requests for inclusion of any class
of citizens as a backward class in the Lists and
hear complaints of over-inclusion or under-
inclusion of any backward class in such lists and
tender such advice to the Central Government as it
deems appropriate. Now, in order to safeguard the

Classes with constitutional status at par with the
National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the

competence of the Legislature to enact the impugned

Legislation.”           The     High      Court         noticed       the

List in sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_649">Article 342A</a> is not in

vacuum but it must take its due meaning in reference

to the context. The High Court held that Parliament

lists    operating       in    various    States,       firstly,      for

providing       reservation         prescribed     by    the    Central

Government in Central services and the other list

for providing reservation by the respective State

Governments, the Parliament intended that it would

retain    the    power    to   include       or   exclude      from   the

Central List. The High Court, further, held that had

the Parliament intended to deprive the State of its

power, it would have specifically mentioned so. The

Assembly       as    external         aid     to     the    constitutional

interpretation             is     not       admissible.           Mr.        Gopal

the use made by the learned Judges below
of the speeches made by the members of the
Constituent Assembly in the course of the
debates on the draft Constitution is
unwarranted. That this form of extrinsic
aid to the interpretation of statutes is
not admissible has been generally accepted
in England, and the same rule has been
observed in the construction of Indian
statutes — see Administrator-General of
Bengal v. Prem Nath Mallick [22 IA 107,
118] . The reason behind the rule was
explained   by   one   of  us   in Gopalan
case [1950 SCR 88] thus:
</p>
<p id="p_719">  “A speech made in the course of the
debate on a bill could at best be
indicative of the subjective intent of the
speaker, but it could not reflect the
inarticulate mental process lying behind
the majority vote which carried the bill.</p>
<p id="p_720">Nor is it reasonable to assume that the
minds of all those legislators were in
accord,”

or, as it is     more   tersely   put   in   an
American case—


  “Those who did not speak may not have
agreed with those who did; and those who
spoke   might  differ   from   each other
— United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight
Association [169 US 290, 318] .”

  This rule of exclusion has not always
been adhered to in America, and sometimes
distinction is made between using such
material to ascertain the purpose of a
statute and using it for ascertaining its

    adopted   in  Canada  and  Australia  —
    see Craies on Statute Law, 5th Ed., p.

</p><p id="p_722">351. It is relevant to notice that in paragraph 16

it was also observed that rule of exclusion has not

always   been   upheld   to   in   America   and    sometime

distinction is made between using such material to

ascertaining purpose of a statute and using it for

ascertaining    its   meaning.     The   judgment     itself

indicated that the said material is sometime used to

ascertain the purpose of a statute. The law has been

explained and elaborated in subsequent judgments of

this Court which we shall notice hereinafter. One

more judgment on which reliance has been placed by

Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan is the judgment of this

<blockquote id="blockquote_191">           “1088. ...Speaking for myself, why
       should we not look into them boldly for

       intention? What is the rationale for
       treating them as forbidden or forbidding
       material. The Court in a constitutional
       matter, where the intent of the framers of
       the Constitution as embodied in the
       written document is to be ascertained,
       should look into the proceedings, the

       reject them as unhelpful, if they throw no
       light or throw only dim light in which
       nothing   can   be  discerned.  Unlike   a

       instrument of Government, it is drafted by
       people who wanted it to be a national
       instrument    to    subserve    successive
       generations.   The   Assembly  constituted

</p><p id="p_734">355. Justice K.K. Mathew in paragraph 1598 had held

that the debates in the Constituent Assembly can be

looked into to understand the legislative history of

a     provision     of   the   Constitution       including   its

derivation, that is, the various steps leading up to

and     attending     its   enactment,      to    ascertain   the

intention     of     the    makers   of     the    Constitution.

Following was laid down in paragraph 1598:

</p><p id="p_735">           “1598. If    the    debates   in   the

       its derivation, that is, the various steps
       leading up to and attending its enactment,
       to ascertain the intention of the makers
       of the Constitution, it is difficult to
       see why the debates are inadmissible to
       throw light on the purpose and general
       intent of the provision. After all,
       legislative history only tends to reveal
       the legislative purpose in enacting the
       provision and thereby sheds light upon
       legislative intent. It would be drawing an
       invisible distinction if resort to debates
       is    permitted   simply    to  show   the
       legislative history and the same is not
       allowed to show the legislative intent in
       case of latent ambiguity in the provision.

report of the Commission or Committee which proceed

the     enactment    is   not      permissible       aid   to

      or   a   committee  which   preceded   the

ascertain   true    meaning   of   literal   words    in   the

statute reference to the report are held legitimate

external aid. In paragraph 33 following was laid

down:

<blockquote id="blockquote_193">          “33. The trend certainly seems to be

<blockquote id="blockquote_196">         The statutory objective is primarily to
       be collected from the provisions of the

       it only in case of an ambiguity — it is
       the plainest of all the guides to the
       general objectives of a statute. But it
       will not always help as to particular
       provisions. As to the statutory objective
       of these, a report leading to the Act is
       likely to be the most potent aid; and, in

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_197">         “65. Mr. Palkhivala read out to us an

       government did not want the “let and

    it is impermissible to read down the
    amplitude of that power so as to make it
    limited. The principle of reading down
    cannot be invoked or applied in opposition
    to the clear intention of the legislature.
    We suppose that in the history of the
    constitutional    law,   no   constitutional
    amendment has ever been read down to mean
    the exact opposite of what it says and
    intends. In fact, to accept the argument
    that we should read down <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_668">Article 31-C</a>, so

    unquestionably    made   with   a    view  to
    empowering the legislatures to pass laws
    of a particular description even if those
    laws violate the discipline of Articles 14
    and 19, it seems to us impossible to hold
    that we should still save <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_672">Article 31-C</a>
    from the challenge of unconstitutionality

    observed that the basic purpose of all

    external aids such as reports of Special
    Committee preceding the enactment, the
    existing state of law, the environment
    necessitating enactment of a legislation
    and the object sought to be achieved, etc.

       to the real intention of the legislature
       in enacting a statute. The Court was of
       the view that such a denial would deprive
       the   Court    of   a    substantial   and
       illuminating aid to construction and,
       therefore, the Court decided to depart
       from the earlier decisions and held that
       reports of committees which preceded the
       enactment of a law, reports of Joint
       Parliamentary Committees and a report of a
       commission    set   up    for   collecting
       information can be referred to as external
       aids of construction.

       background of the statutory provisions and
       it can also refer to committee report or

regarding      adversely     affecting     the    rights   of    the

amendment.        Shri    Thawarchand     Gehlot,    Minister     of

Social Justice and Empowerment proposed the Bill.

Several    members    expressed     their       apprehension    that

Bill is not in the interest of the powers of the

State. Shri B.K. Hari Prasad speaking on the Bill

stated following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_227">           “SHRI B.K. HARIPRASAD: Sir, repealing

    of the Supreme Court are being negated.
    So, this Commission would not help the
    Backward Classes and would take away the
    powers of the States too. They want to
    centralize all the powers, as they have
    done in other cases. This cannot happen
    in the case of OBCS. As I have already
    said, though the Act was passed in
    Parliament way back in 1993 for purposes
    of employment, etc. and way back in 2007
    for    education,    nothing   has    been
    implemented so far. If they centralize
    all         things like        employment,
    identification of castes, etc., they
    would be doing gross injustice to the
    OBCS. They should think twice before
    scrapping   the   powers  of  the   States
    because, as I have already mentioned, it
    is the States which identify various
    castes and communities. They know better
    than the people sitting here in Delhi.
    Hence, amending <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_703">Article 342</a> and equating
    identification of OBC List to the SC/ST
    List should not be done. ...”

speech that Amendment Bill cast threat to federalism

and the State interest. In his statement (translated

from Hindi) he said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_228">         “......that this will be a big threat
    to the federalism of the country and what
    will happen to the rights of the States?
    Here I want to say that at least this

    through the House to the country that
    about five and a half thousand castes and

       half thousand castes and categories are
       under OBC in the States List. The work of
       their identification (SIC) and the power
       that Parliament has, is for five and a
       half thousand Central List only, the
       rights of the States will be safe with
       them and therefore, they have done the
       work   of    strengthening   the   federal
       structure through this amendment. For the
       first time, we have created the system
       that if the work of filling up the OBC
       posts will not be done, then the report of
       the OBC Commission will be placed before
       the Parliament. This should be the demand
       of democracy of the country that if the
       lower class people do not get justice,
       then all those documents should come
       before   the   Parliament  with   reasons.
       Provision to do the same has been made in
       this OBC Commission.”

has    referred   to   State   List   and   Central    List    and

stated     (translated    from    Hindi)    that      powers    to

identify OBC are remained with the State.
</p>
<p id="p_769">       “Shri Dilip Kumar Tirkey (Odisha) :
</p>
<p id="p_770">       Sir, you gave me an opportunity to speak
       on the very important Amendment Bill, for
       this, I thank you. Sir, in our country,
       reservation for OBC was given about 24
       years ago but there is a clear provision
       in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_704">Article 14-15</a> of the Constitution that
       the States can make special provision for
       the socio-economic backward classes. Our
       party BJD is in support of National
       Commission to be made for OBC and we are.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_328">                                              328</span><p id="p_771">


supporting it but we have some issues and
concerns and I would like to present them
before the House. Sir, as per the present
system, every State has its own OBC list
and on that basis, they get reservation.
</p><p id="p_772">If, in a State, any caste falls under OBC
list then it is not mandatory that it
falls under the Central or other States
list. The logic behind this is that there
are different castes in every state and
these different castes have different
conditions. Now, after formation of the
National Commission, one Central list will
be made and only Centre shall notify them.
</p><p id="p_773">Sir, this is the opinion of our party that
the power of notification of OBC castes
should remain with the States only because
only the concerned state thoroughly knows
the fact of number of castes in their
States and what is their condition. Only
the government knows thoroughly. They may
face    problems   with    central    list.
</p><p id="p_774">Therefore, I would like to appeal to
Hon&#x27;ble Minister and the House to add such
a provision in the Bill whereby the work
of adding or deleting any caste from the
OBC list should be strictly done only on
the recommendation of the state government
to which it relates to. Sir, you can make
national list after the uniformity comes
gradually.   When   S.C.,   S.T,   National
Commission was formed, it also took much
time. In my opinion, after the separate
S.C., S.T. Commission was formed, it got
the status of Constitutional body in 2003.
Therefore, 1 would like to appeal to the
House and the government to reconsider and
think on this point. Further, I would like
to add one more thing that in the
observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,
there was a provision of review after
every 10 years so that other castes are
not left, therefore, it should be reviewed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_329">                                                                  329</span>


       after every 10 years. In my opinion, do
       the needful keeping it in view also, thank
       you.”


</p><p id="p_775">379.    Similar    apprehension      was     expressed    by     T.K.

Rangarajan and Shri Pradeep Tamta that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_705">Article 342A</a>

takes    away    the    existing    powers    of   the   State    to

notify list of SEBC. After the debate, the Bill was

presented and passed in Rajya Sabha.

the debate stated that apprehension expressed by the

members that power of the State shall be affected

and federal structure shall be damaged is incorrect.

He stated that the power of the State shall not be

affected    in    any     manner,    the     State&#x27;s     power    to

include and exclude in its list of OBC shall still

will be defined. Hon&#x27;ble members were
feared   that   the    rights    the   State
Commissions have at present that might be
reduced and the federal system will be
violated, pertaining to this I am to say
that it will not at all happen. There is
no provision anywhere in the Articles to
reduce their rights in any way. States
have constituted OBC Commission in their
respective territories since long ago.

constituted and when it submitted its
report, at that time also many States had
constituted such Commission. The State
List deals with work concerned with OBC
category and notifies them. Thereafter, on
the basis of Mandal Commission Report as

       verdict in 1992-1993, on that ground also
       many States had constituted OBC Commission

       present as many as 30-31 States have
       constituted such Commissions. Complete
       list of it is with me. Right to include or

Municipalities Act, 1920, provided that

Government &#x27;after consulting the Municipal
Council&#x27; may determine the wards in which
reserved seats shall be set apart. While
setting aside the reservation made in
respect of one of the wards on the ground
that the Local Government had failed to
discharge its statutory obligation of
consulting the Municipal Council, Justice
K. Subba Rao, who then adorned the Bench
of the Madras High Court, observed : &quot;The
word &#x27;consult&#x27; implies a conference of two
or more persons or an impact of two or
more minds in respect of a topic in order
to enable them to evolve a correct, or at
least, a satisfactory solution.&quot; In, order
that the two minds may be able to confer
and produce a mutual impact, it is
essential that each must have for its
consideration full and identical facts,
which can at once constitute both the
source   and   foundation  of  the   final
decision.”

after consultation with the Governor of the State.

It is submitted that expression the “socially and

given meaning and it is only list issued by public

notification under sub-clause (1) which is the list

of backward classes of a State or Union territory.

No other list is contemplated. Hence, the State has

no authority or jurisdiction to identify backward

Constitution (Sixty Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991. The

democracy      and    pragmatic     federalism.         Justice     Dipak

    while   carrying    out   this    essential
    function, they are duty-bound to ensure

    fundamental principles which form the
    foundational base of the Constitution.
    Although, primarily, it is the literal

theory   of    purposive    interpretation     has   gained

importance    where   the   Courts   shall   interpret   the

Constitution in the purposive manner so as to give

effect to its intention. In paragraphs 149, 150, 155

and 156 following was laid down:

</p><p id="p_843">  “149. Having       stated    the    principles
relating to constitutional interpretation
we, as presently advised, think it apt to
devote      some      space     to     purposive
interpretation in the context, for we
shall   refer     to    the   said   facet   for
understanding the core controversy. It
needs    no   special     emphasis    that   the
reference to some precedents has to be in
juxtaposition with other concepts and
principles. As it can be gathered from the
discussion as well as the authorities
cited above, the literal rule is not to be
the primary guiding factor in interpreting
a constitutional provision, especially if
the resultant outcome would not serve the
fructification of the rights and values
expressed in the Constitution. In this
scenario,     the      theory    of    purposive
interpretation has gained importance where
the     courts       shall     interpret     the

Constitution is an organic and living document which

needs to be interpreted with cardinal principals and

objectives     of     the      Constitution.         The    shift   from

literal to purposive method of interpretation has

been     now    more        and      more,    being       adopted   for

interpreting          a     constitutional           document.      The

Constitution     Bench         in    State   (NCT    of    Delhi)   case

(supra) has also noticed one more principle which is

to be applied for interpretation of a constitutional

document       that       is        constitutional        culture   and

pragmatism.      In            paragraphs     165,    166     and   169

following was held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_255">         “165. The constitutional courts, while
       interpreting      the      constitutional
       provisions, have to take into account the
       constitutional culture, bearing in mind
       its flexible and evolving nature, so that
       the provisions are given a meaning which
       reflect the object and purpose of the
       Constitution.
</blockquote><p id="p_854">  166. History reveals that in order to
promote   and  nurture    this  spirit  of
constitutional culture, the courts have
adopted    a    pragmatic    approach   of
interpretation which has ushered in an era
of “constitutional pragmatism”.
</p>
<p id="p_855">  169. Further, the Court also highlighted
that a balance between idealism and
pragmatism is inevitable in order to
create a workable situation ruling out any
absurdity that may arise while adopting
either one of the approaches: (Supreme

discretion upon high functionaries and,

arbitrariness. This is how idealism         and

  interpretation of the Constitution that
  was   postulated     by    the   Constituent
  Assembly,   which     did    not   feel   the
  necessity of filling up every detail in

         possible to do so.””


</p><p id="p_858">405. Justice Dipak Misra in the Constitution Bench

further laid down in paragraph 284.11:
</p>
<p id="p_859">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_256">         “284.11. In the light of the contemporary
       issues, the purposive method has gained
       importance over the literal approach and the
       constitutional courts, with the vision to
       realise the true and ultimate purpose of the
       Constitution not only in letter but also in
       spirit and armed with the tools of ingenuity
       and creativity, must not shy away from
       performing this foremost duty to achieve
       constitutional functionalism by adopting a
       pragmatic   approach.  It   is,   in  a  way,
       exposition of judicial sensibility to the
       functionalism of the Constitution which we
       call constitutional pragmatism. The spirit
       and conscience of the Constitution should not
       be lost in grammar and the popular will of
       the people which has its legitimacy in a
       democratic set-up cannot be allowed to lose
       its purpose in simple semantics.”


</blockquote><p id="p_860">406. In the above judgment the Constitution Bench

laid    down   that    the   purposive    method      has   gained

importance     over    the   literal   approach.      One    of   us

(Justice       Ashok    Bhushan)       while    delivering         a
concurring     judgment   in   the    Constitution        Bench

judgment of State (NCT of Delhi) (supra) has also

laid down that the Constitutional interpretation has

to be purposive taking into consideration the need

of   time    and   constitutional    principles.     It    was

further held that the intent of Constitution Framers

and object and purpose of Constitutional amendment

always throw light on the Constitutional provisions.

Following was laid down in paragraph 537:
</p>
<p id="p_861">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_257">       “537. From the above discussions, it is
     apparent that constitutional interpretation
     has to be purposive taking into consideration
     the    need    of    time    and    constitutional
     principles.     The    intent    of    Constitution
     Framers     and     object    and     purpose    of
     constitutional amendment always throw light
     on the constitutional provisions but for
     interpreting      a   particular    constitutional
     provision, the constitutional scheme and the
     express language employed cannot be given a
     go-by.   The     purpose   and    intent   of   the
     constitutional provisions have to be found
     from the very constitutional provisions which
     are up for interpretation. We, thus, while
     interpreting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_776">Article 239-AA</a> have to keep in
     mind the purpose and object for which the
     Sixty-ninth     Constitution    (Amendment)    Act,
     1991 was brought into force. After noticing
     the above principles, we now proceed further
     to examine the nature and content of the
     constitutional provisions.”

of this Court on principles of interpretation of

Constitution.      In      Abhiram        Singh      vs.     C.C.
</p>
<p id="p_863">Commachen(Dead) By Legal Representatives and others,

(2017) 2 SCC 629, Justice Madan B. Lokur, with whom

Justice   T.S.   Thakur,      CJ   and   Justice   S.A.     Bobde,

concurred   noticed     the   conflict     between   a     literal

interpretation or purposive interpretation. It was

held that interpretation has, therefore, to consider

not only the context of the law but the context in

which the law is enacted. Justice Lokur extracted

Bennion on Statutory Interpretation in paragraph 38

to the following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_864">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_258">    “38. In Bennion on Statutory
    Interpretation[6th Edn. (Indian Reprint) p.
    847] it is said that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_259">    “General judicial adoption of the term
    “purposive construction” is recent, but the
    concept is not new. Viscount Dilhorne,
    citing Coke, said that while it is now
    fashionable   to   talk  of   a   purposive
    construction of a statute the need for such
    a construction has been recognized since
    the seventeenth century. [Stock v. Frank
    Jones (Tipton) Ltd., (1978) 1 WLR 231 at p.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_260">    234]    In    fact   the    recognition   goes
    considerable further back than that. The
    difficulties over statutory interpretation
    belong to the language, and there is
    unlikely to
    be anything very novel or recent about
    their solution … Little has changed over
    problems of verbal meaning since the Barons
    of the Exchequer arrived at their famous
    resolution in Heydon case [Heydon Case,
    (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a : 76 ER 637] .
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_261">    Legislation is still about remedying what
    is thought to be a defect in the law. Even
    the     most     “progressive”     legislator,
    concerned to implement some wholly normal
    concept    of   social   justice,   would   be
    constrained to admit that if the existing
    law accommodated the notion there would be
    no need to change it. No legal need that is
    ….”

</blockquote><p id="p_865">408. Approving the purposive construction the Court

also held that a pragmatic view is required to be

taken   and   the   law   interpreted   purposefully.   In

paragraph 39 following was observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_262">        “39. We see no reason to take a
    different view. Ordinarily, if a statute is
    well drafted and debated in Parliament
    there is little or no need to adopt any
    interpretation   other   than   a   literal
    interpretation of the statute. However, in
    a welfare State like ours, what is intended
    for the benefit of the people is not fully
    reflected in the text of a statute. In such
    legislations, a pragmatic view is required
    to be taken and the law interpreted
    purposefully and realistically so that the
    benefit reaches the masses. …”
</blockquote><p id="p_866">409. Justice T.S. Thakur delivering his concurring

opinion in paragraph 74 held that an interpretation

which has the effect of diluting the constitutional

objective should be avoided and the purpose of the

constitution be kept in mind. In paragraphs 74, 76

and 77 following was observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_263">         “74. The upshot of the above discussion
    clearly is that under the constitutional
    scheme mixing religion with State power is
    not permissible while freedom to practice,
    profess and propagate religion of one&#x27;s
    choice is guaranteed. The State being
    secular in character will not identify
    itself with any one of the religions or
    religious denominations. This necessarily
    implies that religion will not play any
    role in the governance of the country which
    must at all times be secular in nature. The
    elections to the State Legislature or to
    Parliament or for that matter or any other
    body in the State is a secular exercise
    just as the functions of the elected
    representatives must be secular in both
    outlook and practice. Suffice it to say
    that    the    constitutional   ethos   forbids
    mixing      of     religions    or    religious
    considerations with the secular functions
    of the State. This necessarily implies that
    interpretation of any statute must not
    offend the fundamental mandate under the
    Constitution. An interpretation which has
    the effect of eroding or diluting the
    constitutional objective of keeping the
    State    and     its   activities   free   from
    religious considerations, therefore, must
be avoided. This Court has in several
pronouncements     ruled      that      while
interpreting   an  enactment,    the   Courts
should     remain    cognizant      of    the
constitutional goals and the purpose of the
Act    and    interpret    the     provisions
accordingly.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_867">  76. Extending the above principle further
one can say that if two constructions of a
statute were possible, one that promotes the
constitutional   objective   ought    to   be
preferred over the other that does not do so.</p><pre id="pre_26">

Court    held  that    as    the    vehicle of
transforming the nation&#x27;s life, the Court
should respond to the nation&#x27;s need and
interpret the law with pragmatism to further
public welfare and to make the constitutional
animations a reality. The Court held that
Judges should be cognizant of the
constitutional goals and remind themselves of
the purpose of the      Act while interpreting
any legislation. The Court said: (SCC p. 486,
para 35)


    “35. The   Judges,      therefore,   should
    respond to the human situations to meet
    the felt necessities of the time and
    social needs, make meaningful the right
    to   life   and    give    effect  to   the
    Constitution    and   the    will  of   the
    legislature. This Court as the vehicle of
    transforming the nation&#x27;s life should
          respond   to   the  nation&#x27;s    needs   and
          interpret the law with pragmatism to

</p><p id="p_871">410. Applying the above principles laid down by the

Constitution Benches of this Court on interpretation

of a Constitution, in the fact of the present case,

we need to discern the intention of Parliament in

inserting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_778">Article 342A.</a> We have already found that

reports   of   the   Parliamentary    Committee   and   the

statement made by the Minister while moving the Bill

are   relevant       aids   for   a     construction     of

constitutional       provision.       The   Parliamentary

Committee report makes it clear that after obtaining
the     clarification        from       the    Ministry              that    the

Constitutional         Amendment       is    not    intended          to    take

away the right of identification of backward class

from a State. It submitted its report to the effect

that    rights    of     State     Backward        Classes       Commission

shall        continue       unhindered.            The      Parliamentary

Standing      Committee      further        noticed       that       the    list

which is contemplated under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_779">Article 342A</a> is only

Central       List     of    the       backward          classes       for     a

particular State for the purposes of services under

the Government of India and its organizations.

Commission to identify the backward classes. We have

was    made     by   the    Minister       of      Social    Justice       and

Empowerment in the background of several members of

the    Parliament       expressing        their      apprehension         that

the    Constitution        102nd       Amendment         shall    take    away

rights of the States to identify backward classes in

each    State.       The   Minister       of       Social    Justice       and

Empowerment for allaying their apprehension made a

categorical          statement         that        the     Constitutional

Parliamentary       intention      discernible       from    Select

Committee report and statement of Ministry of Social

not to take away the power of the State to identify

the Central List which was to govern the services

the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_265">           “26.-(1) In the foregoing provisions of

</blockquote><p id="p_884">418.    The   Government        of   India    has    also   issued   a

Scheduled Castes List under the Government of India
Scheduled      Castes       Order          1936.       The      Constitution

framers were, thus, well aware with the concept of

Scheduled Casts and Scheduled Tribes and hence the

same    scheme      regarding       SC       was       continued       in    the

Constitution        by      way    of        <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_789">Article          341</a>      of    the

Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_885">
</p><p id="p_886">419. The expression &#x27;backward class&#x27; does not find

place   in    the   Government         of        India    Act,       1935.   The

Constitution        framers       recognising             that        backward

classes of citizens need affirmative action by the

State   to    bring      them     in       the    main    stream       of    the

society      has    engrafted          a    special           provision      for

backward classes. Under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_790">Article 16(4)</a> the State was

empowered to make any provision for reservation of

appointment or posts in favour of any backward class

of citizens not adequately represented in services.

When the Constitution empowers the State to make any

provision, the provision may embrace all aspects of

measures     including       identification              of    the    backward

classes. The Constitution Bench of this Court in

Indra     Sawhney     has    accepted            and     recognised          this
position.       It is both the States and Union who are

entitled to identify backward classes of citizens

and    to    take   measures.      Indra       Sawhney       had,   thus,

issued      directions    to    Union    as    well     as    States   to

constitute permanent body for identification and for

taking necessary measures. The power to identify the

backward classes was with the State and there are no

intentions that the power of the State as occurring

in Articles 15(4) and 16(4) in any manner has been

taken    away    by    the     Constitutional         amendment.       The

power given to the State under Articles 15(4) and

16(4) are for the benefit of backward classes of

citizens. Any limitation or limitation of such power

cannot be readily inferred and has to be expressly

provided by the Constitution.              The submission of the

petitioner      that     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_791">Article      342A</a>      which        relates    to

socially and educationally backward class should be

read    in    the   Constitutional        scheme       as     delineated

under       Articles     341    and     342,     thus,       cannot    be

accepted.

as occurring in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_792">Article 342A (2).</a> In pursuance of

the direction issued by the Constitution Bench of

this    Court   in   Indra   Sawhney,   the   Parliament   has

enacted the National Commission for <a href="/doc/637725/" id="a_793">Backward Classes

Act</a>, 1993 clearly indicates that the Parliamentary

enactment      was    related     to     services     under     the

Government of India and the Act, 1993 was not to

govern    or    regulate      identification         of   backward

classes by the concerned State. The States had also

enacted   “State      Legislation”      constituting      Backward

Classes   Commission.      In    the    State   of   Maharashtra,

Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission, act

are   two    lists    of    Backward   Classes,      one    “Central

expressed that Constitutional amendment is only with

<p id="p_893">

</p><p id="p_894">424. We may also look into the use of expression

“Central List” under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_805">Article 342A</a> in contradiction

to the words, “list of Scheduled Castes”, “list of

Scheduled Tribes” as occurring in Articles 341(2)

and 342(2) which are to following effect:

uses expression “list of Scheduled Castes” specified

in notification. Similarly, <a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_807">Article 342(2)</a> also uses

expression &#x27;list of Scheduled Tribes&#x27; specified in

educationally        backward      classes.       If    it   is   to    be

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_809">Article 342A</a> also, the same expression, which was

necessary      to   be    used    i.e.    “list    of    socially      and

been in line of the expression occurring in <a href="/doc/1581845/" id="a_810">Article

341(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_811">342(2).</a> It is, thus, clear that an extra

educationally backward classes&#x27;. When the statute or

Constitution uses an additional word it has to be

presumed that the use of additional word is for a

purpose     and   object   and   it   is    not    superfluous   or

redundant.

no   word     shall   be    treated        as     superfluous    and

which was being prepared prior to the Constitution

Amendment, under Act, 1993.

<p id="p_902">
</p><p id="p_903">428. We may also deal with the submission of the

petitioner that the word &#x27;Central List&#x27; was used in

sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_813">Article 342A</a> to refer the public

notification specifying the socially educationally
backward classes issued by the President of India

under     sub-clause   (1).   The    expression      “list   of

socially     and    educationally        backward       classes&#x27;

specified in notification under              sub-clause (1) is

already    there   under   sub-clause    (2)    which   clearly

meant and referred to notification issued under sub-

clause (1), hence, there was no necessity for use of

an additional word &#x27;Central&#x27; in sub-clause (1) which

was wholly superfluous and redundant. We are of the

view that the word &#x27;Central&#x27; was used for a purpose

and object, the use of the &#x27;Central&#x27; was only with

the intent to limit the list issued by the President

to Central services. Sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_814">Article 342</a>

and sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_815">Article 342A</a> has to be given

harmonious     construction    and      we    read   both    the

Articles together to find out purpose and intent of

the list issued by the President under sub-clause

(1). It is the &#x27;Central List&#x27; which could be amended

by the Parliament by exercising power under sub-

clause (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_816">Article 342A.</a>
</p><p id="p_904">429.       A question may be asked that when under 1993

Act “Central List” was prepared by Government of

India and the “State list” was prepared by States,

what     was    the    necessity     to   bring     the   102nd

Constitutional Amendment if the same regime of two

lists i.e. “Central list” and “State list” was to

continue? For answering the question we first look

into    the    1993   Act   to   understand   the   nature   of

exercise undertaken under the Act regarding “Central

List” and change in the exercise, if any, after 102 nd

Constitutional Amendment.

exercise of the Government of India under the 1993

Act. All the lists which were issued after 1993 Act

by the Government of India were by executive orders

issued from time to time. For what purpose, 102nd

Constitutional Amendment was made? Answer is not for

to seek.

<p id="p_908">
</p><p id="p_909">432. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the

list of “the Scheduled Castes” was to be specified

by   His   Majesty   in    Council    as    per   clause    26    of

Schedule I of the Government of India Act, 1935,

which   was   also   an   executive     function.     The     legal

regime of the list of Scheduled caste saw a sea

in <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_823">Article 341</a> and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_824">342.</a> What was the change brought

by   Constitution       of    India    regarding      the     list     of

Scheduled Caste can be well understood when we look

into    the   debates    of    the    Constituent          Assembly    on

Draft Articles 300A and 300B which corresponds to

Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India.

17.09.1949 in following words: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_277">          &quot;...The object of these two articles, as
       I stated, was to eliminate the necessity of
       burdening the Constitution with long lists
       of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.</blockquote><p id="p_911">
</p><p id="p_912">       It is now proposed that the President, in
       consultation with the Governor or Ruler of
       a State should have the power to issue a
       general   notification     in   the    Gazette
       specifying all the Castes and tribes or
       groups thereof deemed to be Scheduled
       Castes   and   Scheduled    Tribes   for   the
       purposes of the privileges which have been
       defined for them in the Constitution. The
       only limitation that has been imposed is
       this: that once a notification has been
       issued    by     the     President,     which,
       undoubtedly,   he    will    be   issuing   in
       consultation with and on the advice of the
       Government of each State, thereafter, if
       any elimination was to be made from the
       List so notified or any addition was to be
       made, that must be made by Parliament and
      not by the President. The object is to
      eliminate any kind of political factors
      having a play in the matter of the
      disturbance in the Schedule so published by
      the President.”


</p><p id="p_913">434. The main object of the Constitutional provision

was   to   “eliminate   any    kind   of    political       factors

having a play in the matter of the disturbance in

the Scheduled so published by the President.”


</p><p id="p_914">435. We have to read the same objective for change

of the statutory regime of backward class under 1993

Act into Constitutional regime by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_825">Article 342A.</a> To

eliminate any kind of political factor to play with

regard     to   list    of    backward      class        issued   by

Government of India from time to time under 1993

Act, the Constitution Amendment was brought as was

brought by Constituent Assembly by Draft <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_826">Article 341</a>

and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_827">342.</a> Now, by virtue of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_828">Article 342A</a>, the list

once issued by the President under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_829">Article 342A(1)</a>

cannot     be   tinkered      with    except        by     way     of

Parliamentary    enactment.     Thus,      the   above     was    the

objective of the Constitutional Amendment and not

the taking away the power of the States to identify
the    Backward          Class     in   State       with      regard      to

reservation for employment in the State services and

reservation         in     educational       institution          in     the

States.     A    laudable          objective       of     keeping       away

political pressure in amending the list of Backward

class issued by President once has been achieved,

hence,      it      cannot        be    said       that       the       102nd

Constitutional Amendment was without any purpose if

the power of State to identify Backward classes in

their State was to remain as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_915">
</p><p id="p_916">436. The above also sufficiently explain the stand

taken by Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment

on the floor of House. The Minister clarified that

the Constitutional Amendment is not to take away the

power of the State to identify the Backward Classes

in    the   State    for    purposes       of     the    State    and    was

confined to “Central List” which was being prepared

by the Government of India as in earlier regime.

Learned      Attorney            General     in         his   submission

forcefully       carried          the      same     stand        regarding

interpretation of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_830">Article 342A.</a> We see no reason to
reject the submission of learned Attorney General

for India and learned senior counsel appearing for

the States that the 102nd Constitutional Amendment

was not intended to take away the power of the State

regarding      identification         of     Backward    Class    for

services in the State or educational institutions in

the State.

occurring in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_831">Article 366(26C).</a> <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_832">Article 366</a> is the

        for the purposes of this Constitution;’.”


</blockquote><p id="p_920">438. When we look into the definition as inserted by

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_835">Article      366(26C</a>),     it    is    clear     that    definition

Constitution. When we have interpreted <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_837">Article 342A</a>

to mean that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_838">Article 342A</a> refers to &#x27;Central List&#x27;

which is prepared for services under the Government

of India and organisations under the Government of

India, the definition given under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_839">Article 366(26C)</a>

which specifically refer to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_840">Article 342A</a> has to be

read together and list of backward classes which is

definition under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_841">Article 366(26C).</a> Since, the 26C

has been inserted in the context of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_842">Article 342A</a>, if

the context is list prepared by the State and it is

State List, definition under (26C) shall not govern.

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_843">Article 366(26C</a>), thus, has to be read contextually

with <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_844">Article 342A</a> and for no other purpose.



</p><p id="p_921">439. The interpretation which we have put on <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_845">Article

342A</a> is in full accord with intention of the framers

of    the    Constitution.        Dr.    B.R.       Ambedkar       in    the

Constituent      Assembly        had     said       that    a   backward

community       is     to   be    determined         by     each        local
Government. The determination, i.e., identification

of the backward classes was, thus, left to the local

Government as was clearly and categorically stated

by Dr. Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly debates.

It is most relevant for the present discussion to

quote the exact words used by Dr. Ambedkar while

answering the debate on draft sub-clause, <a href="/doc/298655/" id="a_846">Article

10(3)</a>     which    is    <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_847">Article        16(4)</a>    of   the    present

Constitution:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_279">       &quot;Somebody asked me: “What is a backward
       community”? Well, I think anyone who reads
       the language of the draft itself will find
       that we have left it to be determined by each
       local Government. A backward community is a
       community which is backward in the opinion of
       the Government.”


</blockquote><p id="p_922">440.    The   framers    of    the     Constitution,     thus,    had

contemplated that determination of backward class as

occurring     in   draft       <a href="/doc/298655/" id="a_848">Article    10(3</a>),      i.e,   present

<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_849">Article 16(4)</a> is to be done by the local Government.

The     constitutional        scheme,    thus,     was   framed    in

accordance     with     the    above     background.     After    the

Constitution, it is for the last 68 years backward

class was being identified by the respective State
Governments and they were preparing their respective

lists and granting reservation under Articles 15(4)

and 16(4) as per their decision. The Constitution

Bench of Indra Sawhney did recognise and held that

each State Government is fully competent to identify

backward classes and this is why the Indra Sawhney

directed for appointment of a permanent body both by

the Union as well as by the State and consequently

Commissions        were   constituted       National       Backward

Classes   Commission        and    State        Backward    Classes

Commission.    To     reverse     the   entire     constitutional

scheme regarding identification of backward classes

by the State which was continuing in the last 68

years,    a    clear       and     explicit        Constitutional

Amendment,    was     necessary.        There    is   no    express

indication in the 102nd Constitutional Amendment that

the   power   of    the   State   is    being     taken    away   for

identification of the backward classes.
</p>
<p id="p_923">
</p><p id="p_924">441. We are not persuaded to interpret <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_850">Article 342A</a>

against the intention of the Parliament which is

reflected in the Parliamentary Committee report and
the statement made by the Minister on the floor of

the   House.      The     statement        of    the    Minister        on    the

floor of the House was clear and categorical, we

cannot     put      an     interpretation              which      was        never

intended     by     the     Parliament           and    which       may      have

serious consequences with the rights of the States

which    neither         Parliament        intended         nor   wanted       to

bring. We, thus, hold that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_851">Article 342A</a> was brought

by      Constitution            102nd           Amendment         to          give

constitutional status to National Backward Classes

Commission       and      for   publication            of    list       by    the

President      of   socially       and       educationally           backward

classes which was to be Central List for governing

employment        under      Government           of     India       and       the

organisations          under    it.        The    expression         &#x27;Central

List&#x27; used in sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_852">Article 342A</a> has

been used for the purpose and object which cannot be

ignored nor lost sight. The definition clause under

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_853">Article 366(26C)</a> has to be read contextually with

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_854">Article    366(26C)</a>        which      is    referred         under      <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_855">Article

366(2C)</a> itself. Thus, the definition is relevant in

the context of &#x27;Central List&#x27; and the definition is
not governing to list prepared by the State which

was not under contemplation in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_856">Article 342A.</a>


</p><p id="p_925">442. We do not find any merit in the challenge to

the Constitution 102nd         Amendment. The Constitution

102nd Amendment does not violate any basic feature of

the    Constitution.     The    argument     of   the    learned

counsel for the petitioner is that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_857">Article 368</a> has

not    been   followed    since     the    Constitution     102 nd

Amendment was not ratified by the necessary majority

of the State. The Parliament never intended to take

the rights of the State regarding identification of

backward classes, the Constitution 102nd                Amendment

was not covered by Proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_858">Article 368</a> sub-clause

(2),    hence,    the    same      did     not    require    any

ratification. The argument of procedural violation

in passing the 102nd Constitutional Amendment cannot

also be accepted. We uphold the Constitution 102nd

Amendment interpreted in the manner as above.


</p><p id="p_926">443. The High Court in the impugned judgment has

correctly     interpreted         the     Constitution      102nd

(15)Conclusions.
</p>
<p id="p_928">
</p><p id="p_929">444. From our foregoing discussion and finding we

arrive at following conclusions:
</p>
<p id="p_930">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_280">    (1) The greatest common measure of agreement in

    six     separate     judgments   delivered     in   Indra

    Sawhney is:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_281">      (i)Reservation under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_859">Article 16(4)</a> should not

           exceed 50%.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_282">          (ii)For   exceeding   reservation   beyond     50%,

           extra-ordinary    circumstances    as   indicated

           in paragraph 810 of Justice Jeevan Reddy

           should exist for which extreme caution is

           to be exercised.</blockquote><p id="p_931">


    (2) The 50% rule spoken in Balaji and affirmed

    in Indra Sawhney is to fulfill the objective of

    equality as engrafted in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_860">Article 14</a> of which
Articles     15   and     16     are   facets.      50%   is

reasonable and it is to attain the object of

equality. To change the 50% limit is to have a

society which is not founded on equality but

based on caste rule.
</p>
<p id="p_932">
(3) We are of the considered opinion that the

cap on percentage of reservation as has been

laid down by Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney

is with the object of striking a balance between

the rights under <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_861">Article 15(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_862">15(4)</a> as well

as    Articles    16(1)    and    16(4)   .   The   cap   on

percentage is to achieve principle of equality

and with the object to strike a balance which

cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable.


(4)    Providing reservation for advancement of

any socially and educationally backward class in

public services is not the only means and method

for improving the welfare of backward class. The

State ought to bring other measures including

providing educational facilities to the members

of backward class free of cost giving concession
in     fee,     providing      opportunities       for     skill

development to enable the candidates from the

backward class to be self-reliant.
</p>
<p id="p_933">
</p><p id="p_934">(5) There       can     be    no    quarrel   that       society

changes, law changes, people changes but that

does not mean that something which is good and

proven to be beneficial in maintaining equality

in the society should also be changed in the

name of change alone.</p><pre id="pre_27">



(6)    When    the     Constitution        Bench   in     Indra

Sawhney       held    that    50%     is   upper    limit     of

</pre><p id="p_935">reservation under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_863">Article 16(4</a>), it is the law

which is binding under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_864">Article 141</a> and to be

implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_936">
(7)    We find that the Constitution Bench judgment

in    Indra   Sawhney    is    also   fully   applicable      in

reference to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_865">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution

of India.
</p>
<p id="p_937">
(8)    The setting aside of 50% ceiling by eleven-

Judge Bench in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case as was
laid down by St. Stephen’s case i.e. 50% ceiling

in admission in aided Minority Instructions has

no bearing on the principle of 50% ceiling laid

down     by     Indra        Sawhney       with     respect     to

reservation. The judgment of T.M.A. Pai was in

reference to rights of minority under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_866">Article 30</a>

and    is     not   relevant        for    Reservation       under

Articles 16(4) and 15(4) of the Constitution.


(9)    The    Constitution        (Eighty-first      Amendment)

Act, 2000 by which sub-clause (4B) was inserted

in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_867">Article 16</a> makes it clear that ceiling of 50%

“has now received constitutional recognition”.


(10)    We fully endorse the submission of Shri

Rohtagi that extraordinary situations indicated

in    paragraph     810      were   only    illustrative       and

cannot be said to be exhaustive. We however do

not agree with Mr. Rohtagi that paragraph 810

provided only a geographical test. The use of

expression “on being out of the main stream of

national      life”,    is    a   social    test,    which    also
needs to be fulfilled for a case to be covered

by exception.
</p>
<p id="p_938">
(11)    We do not find any substance in any of the

10 grounds urged by Shri Rohatgi and Shri Kapil

Sibal for revisiting and referring the judgment

of Indra Sawhney to a larger Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_939">
(12) What was held by the Constitution Bench in

Indra Sawhney on the relevance and significance

of the principle of stare decisis clearly binds

us. The judgment of Indra Sawhney has stood the

test of the time and has never been doubted by

any    judgment   of    this   Court.   The    Constitution

Bench judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney

neither needs to be revisited nor referred to a

larger Bench for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_940">

(13) The Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj does

not    contain    any    ratio   that   ceiling       of   50%

reservation       may    be      exceeded      by      showing

quantifiable      contemporary      data      relating     to

backwardness.      The    Commission     has        completely
misread    the     ratio       of     the       judgment,      when     the

Commission        took         the        view         that      on     the

quantifiable        data           ceiling       of      50%     can     be

breached.

<p id="p_941">
(14) The       Commission          and    the    High     Court       found

existence of the extra-ordinary situations with

regard to exceeding 50% ceiling in respect to

grant of separate reservation to Maratha because

the    population        of    backward          class    is     80%    and

deference.        However,    one      of     the       parameter      of

scrutiny of Commission’s report as approved by

this Court is that on the basis of data and

not socially and educationally backward class.


(23) The elementary principle of interpreting

the Constitution or statute is to look into the

words used in the statute, when the language is

clear, the intention of the Legislature is to

be gathered from the language used. The aid to

interpretation is resorted to only when there

is some ambiguity in words or expression used

in    the     statute.     The    rule     of     harmonious

construction,      the     rule    of    reading       of    the

provisions      together    as    also    rule    of    giving

effect to the purpose of the statute, and few

other principles of interpretation are called

in    question    when     aids   to     construction        are

necessary in      particular context.

and         objective      interpretation              of      a

constitutional      document      is    adopted   since      the

Constitution is not to be interpreted in static

and    rigid     manner,    the    Constitution         is    an
organic and living document which needs to be

interpreted        with   cardinal        principals     and

objectives of the Constitution.             The shift from

literal to purposive method of interpretation

has been now more and more, being adopted for

interpreting a constitutional document.


(25)The law is well settled in this county that

Parliamentary Committee reports including speech

given   by   the    Minister   in   the    Parliament    are

relevant materials to ascertain the intention of

Parliament     while      construing        constitutional

provisions.

(26) We are of the considered opinion that the

consultation by the State on all policy matters

affecting     the      socially     and      educationally

backward classes is now mandatory as per sub-

clause(9)     of    <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_881">Article     338B</a>      which   mandatory

requirement    cannot     be   by-passed     by   any   State

expression ‘consultation’. It is true that the

expression ‘consultation’ is not to be read as

concurrence      but     the    ‘consultation’             has     to    be

effective        and     meaningful.           The         object        of

consultation is that ‘consultee’ shall place the

relevant       material        before       person         from     whom

‘consultation’         is     asked     for     and    advice           and

opinion      given     by     consulting        authority          shall

</p><p id="p_958">(27)    It     is,   thus,     clear     as     sun        light    that

Parliamentary intention discernible from Select

Committee report and statement of Minister of

Social       Justice    and     Empowerment           is    that        the

intention       of      the     Parliament           for     bringing

Constitutional amendment was not to take away

the    power    of     the    State    to     identify       backward

class in the State.
</p><p id="p_959">(28)    When       the    Parliamentary               intention         is

discernable and admissible as aid to statutory

interpretation,          we    see         no    reason         not     to

interpret      <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_883">Article    342A</a>        in    manner        as    per    the

intention of the Parliament noticed above.


(29)    We are of the view that word ‘Central’ in

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_884">Article     342A    (2)</a>       was     used      for       purpose      and

object. The use of ‘Central’ was only with the

intent to limit the list issued by the President

to Central services. It is well settled rule of

interpretation       that      no     word      in    a    statute      or

Constitution is used without any purpose. Word

‘Central’ has to be given meaning and purpose.


(30) When we have interpreted <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_885">Article 342A</a> to

mean that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_886">Article 342A</a> refers to &#x27;Central List&#x27;

which     is   prepared         for        services        under       the

Government of India and organisations under the

Government of India, the definition given under

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_887">Article    366(26C)</a>       which       specifically             refer   to

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_888">Article 342A</a> has to be read together and list of

backward classes which is not Central List shall
    not be governed by the definition under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_889">Article

    366(26C).</a> Since, the (26C) has been inserted in

    the context of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_890">Article 342A</a>, if the context is

    list prepared by the State and it is State List,

    definition under (26C) shall not govern.
</p>
<p id="p_960">
    (31)    We,   thus,     hold    that     Article       342A   was

    brought by Constitution 102nd Amendment to give

    constitutional        status    to      National        Backward

above Articles, it is necessary to refer to the cardinal

principles of interpretation of the Constitution. Constitution is

intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently to be

adapted to the various crises of human affairs. We must not

forget that it is the Constitution we are expounding 1.                  The

Constitution is a living and organic document which requires

to be construed broadly and liberally.                    I am reminded of

                                                                          3 | Page
the word of caution by Benjamin Cardozo who said that “a

Judge is not a knight errant roaming at will in pursuit of his

own ideal of beauty or of goodness. Judge is not to innovate

at pleasure”.2 Rules which are applied to the interpretation of

other     statutes,      apply     to     the    interpretation       of    the

Constitution3.       It may be desirable to give a broad and

generous construction to the constitutional provisions, but

while doing so the rule of “plain meaning” or “literal”

interpretation, which remains “the primary rule”, has also to

be kept in mind. In fact, the rule of “literal construction” is

the safe rule even while interpreting the Constitution unless

the language used is contradictory, ambiguous, or leads

really to absurd results4. The duty of the judicature is to act

upon the true intention of the legislature, the mens or

sententia       legis.    (See:      <a href="/doc/91294/" id="a_905">G.     Narayanaswami              v.    G.

of construction is that the intention of the legislature must be

found in the words used by the legislature itself 9.                      Oliver

Wendell Holmes Jr. has famously said in a letter , “I do not care

what their intention was. I only want to know what the words

mean.”10       If the language of the meaning of the statute is

plain, there is no need for construction as legislative intention

is revealed by the apparent meaning11.                    Legislative intent

must be primarily ascertained from the language used in

statute itself.12


</p><p id="p_992">7.     In his book Purposive Interpretation in Law,13 Aharon

Barak says that constitutional language like the language of

any legal text plays a dual role. On the one hand, it sets the

limits of interpretation. The language of the Constitution is

not clay in the hands of the interpreter, to be molded as he or

she sees fit. A Constitution is neither a metaphor nor a non-

binding recommendation. On the other hand, the language

of the Constitution is a source for its purpose.                    There are

other sources, to be sure, but constitutional language is an

important and highly credible source of information. The fact

external to it does not mean that we can give a Constitution a

meaning that is inconsistent with its explicit or implicit

language. Interpretation cannot create a new constitutional

text. Talk of Judges amending the Constitution through their

interpretation of the Constitution is just a metaphor.       The

claim that a constitutional text limits but does not command

is true only for the limited number of cases in which, after

exhausting all interpretive tools, we can still extract more

than one legal meaning from the constitutional language and

must therefore leave the final decision to judicial discretion.

In these exceptional cases, language provides a general

direction but does not draw a precise map of how to reach

the destination. Usually, however, constitutional language

sets not only the limits of interpretation, but also its specific

content.14

</p><p id="p_1000">10. In the 183rd Report of the Law Commission of India,

Justice M. Jagannadha Rao observed that a statute is a will of

legislature conveyed in the form of text. It is well settled

principle of law that as a statute is an edict of the legislature,

the conventional way of interpreting or construing the statute

is to see the intent of the legislature.       The intention of

legislature assimilates two aspects. One aspect carries the

concept of ‘meaning’ i.e. what the word means and another

aspect conveys the concept of ‘purpose’ and ‘object’ or

‘reason’ or ‘approach’ pervading through the statute.         The

process of construction, therefore, combines both liberal and

purposive approaches. However, necessity of interpretation

would arise only where a language of the statutory provision

is ambiguous, not clear or where two views are possible or

where the provision gives a different meaning defeating the

object of the statute.   He supported his view by referring to

two judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/1586918/" id="a_912">R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay</a> 18

and <a href="/doc/1723469/" id="a_913">Grasim Industries Ltd. v. Collector of Customs,

meaning of the words used in the provision if the words of the

statute are clear and unambiguous.
</p>
<p id="p_1001">
</p><p id="p_1002">11. The words of a statute, when there is a doubt about

their meaning, are to be understood in the sense in which

they best harmonise between the subject of the enactment

and the object which the legislature has used. Their meaning

is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological

propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the

subject or in the occasion on which they are used, and the

object to be attained.20


</p><p id="p_1003">12. It is a recognised rule of interpretation of statutes that

the expressions used therein should ordinarily be understood

in a sense in which they best harmonise with the object of the

statute, and which effectuate the object of the legislature 21.

However, the object-oriented approach cannot be carried to

the extent of doing violence to the plain language used by re-

writing the section or structure words in place of the actual

words used by the legislature22.             The logical corollary that

reputed authors is that the primary rule of construction is

literal construction. If there is no ambiguity in the provision

which is being construed there is no need to look beyond.

Legislative intent which is crucial for understanding the

object and purpose of a provision should be gathered from

the language.        The purpose can be gathered from external

sources but any meaning inconsistent with the explicit or

implicit language cannot be given.

Lords observed that the intention of legislature is a ‘slippery

phrase’.      What the legislature intended can be legitimately

ascertained from that which it has chosen to enact, either in

express words or by reasonable and necessary implication. A

construction which furthers the purpose or object of an

enactment is described as purposive construction.                          A

purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives

effect to the legislative purpose by (a) following the literal

meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in

accordance with the legislative purpose or (b) applying a

strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in

accordance with the legislative purpose. 24              If that is the case,

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_286">      “The word ‘deemed’ is sometimes used to impose for
      the purposes of a statute an artificial construction of a
      word or phrase that would not otherwise prevail.
      Sometimes it is used to put beyond doubt a particular

or accompanied it.     The use of the word ‘deemed’ in the

definition clause as well as in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_944">Article 342</a> A puts it beyond

doubt that it is only those backward classes which are

specified in the notification that may be issued by the

President, who can claim to be socially and educationally

backward classes for the purposes of the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_1026">23. There is no equivocacy in the legislative language used

in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_945">Article 342</a> A.   The ordinary meaning that flows from a

simple reading of <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_946">Article 342</a> A is that the President after

consultation with the Governor of a State or Union Territory

may issue a public notification specifying socially and

educationally backward classes.       It is those socially and

educationally backward classes who shall be deemed as

socially and educationally backward classes in relation to that

State or Union Territory for the purposes of the Constitution.

There is no obscurity in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_947">Article 342</a> A (1) and it is crystal clear

that there shall be one list of socially and educationally

backward classes which may be issued by the President.

Restricting the operation of a list to be issued under <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_948">Article

342</a> A (1) as not being applicable to States can be done only

by reading words which are not there in the provision.

According to Aharon Barak, “the structure of the Constitution

can be given implicit meaning to what is written between the

lines of the text, but it cannot add lines to the text. To do so

would be to fill a gap or lacuna, using interpretative

doctrines”.37 There is no reason for reading <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_949">Article 342</a> A (1)

in any other manner except, according to the plain legal

meaning of the legislative language. The words ‘Central list’

is used in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_950">Article 342</a> A (2) have created some controversy in

construing <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_951">Article 342</a> A. To find out the exact connotation of

a word in a statute, we must look to the context in which it is

used38.    No words have an absolute meaning, no words can

be defined in vacuo, or without reference to some context 39.

Finally, the famous words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

“the word is not a crystal transparent and unchanged; it is a

skin of a living thought and may vary in colour and content

according to the circumstances and the time in which it is

used”.40

provision can lead to the following deduction: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_287">        a. There is a notification issued by the President

           under clause (1).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_288">        b. The         notification   specifies      socially    and

           educationally backward classes.

           by any subsequent notification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_291">        e. The list notified is referred to as “Central list”.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1030">25. I find it difficult to agree with the submissions made on

behalf of the Respondents that the use of words ‘central list’

would restrict the scope and amplitude of the notification to

be issued under <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_955">Article 342</a> A (1). There is only one list that

can be issued by the President specifying the socially and

educationally backward classes and only those classes are

treated as socially and educationally backward classes for the

purposes of the Constitution. Taking cue from the National

Commission       for    <a href="/doc/637725/" id="a_956">Backward      Classes     Act</a>,   1993,   the

Respondents argued that the words ‘Central list’ is with

reference only to appointments to Central services and

admission in Central educational institutions.              Reading

                                                                 20 | Page
‘Central list’ in that manner would be curtailing the width of

<a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_957">Article 342</a> A (1). If so read, the sweep of Sub-Clause (1) shall

be minimized. Moreover, to achieve the said meaning, words

which are not in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_958">Article 342</a> A (1) have to be read into it.

Contextually, the words Central list in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_959">Article 342</a> A (2) can be

only with reference to the list contained in the notification

which may be issued under <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_960">Article 342</a> A (1). It is well settled

law that the provisions of the Constitution have to be

harmoniously construed and it is apparent from <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_961">Article 342</a> A

(1) and (2) that there is no scope for any list of socially and

educationally backward classes, other than the list to be

notified by the President.     As the other expressions ‘for the

purposes of the Constitution’ and ‘unless the context

otherwise requires’ have been dealt with by Justice Bhat, I

have nothing more to add to the construction placed by him

on the said expressions. To avoid any confusion, I endorse

the conclusion of Justice Ashok Bhushan on question Nos. 1, 2

and 3 and the final order proposed in Para No. 444 of his

judgment.        Insofar as question Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are

concerned, I am in agreement with the opinion of Justice S.

S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
</p>
<p id="p_1043">
</p><p id="p_1044">1.      Franklin D. Roosevelt, the great American leader, once said that “The test of
our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have
much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.”In these batch
of appeals arising from a common judgment of the Bombay High Court 1, this court
is called to adjudicate upon the extent to which reservations are permissible by the
state, the correctness of its approach in designating a community2 as a “Backward
Class” for the purposes of the Constitution, and, by an enactment 3 (hereafter
referred to as “the SEBC Act”) defining who could benefit from, and the extent of
reservations that could be made in various state established facilities and
educational institutions, and in the public services of the State of Maharashtra.

A Brief Prelude




1In WP No 937/2017; 1208/2019; 2126/2019, PIL No. 175/2018 and connected batch of cases.

2The Maratha community (hereafter “the Marathas”).

appointments in the public services and posts under the State (for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes)
SEBC Act, 2018 i.e., Maharashtra Act No. LXII of 2018 (for short ‘SEBC Act’).

</p><p id="p_1045">2.      Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, when he spoke on November 25, 1949, in the
Constituent Assembly of India at the time of the adoption of the Constitution,
presciently said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_292">       “From January 26, 1950, onwards we are going to enter into a life of
      contradictions. In politics, we will have equality, one man, one vote,
      one vote and one value. In society and economy, we will still have
      inequality. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our
      social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one
      man-one value.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1046">3.      The quest for one person, one value, of true equality, and of fraternity of
Indians, where caste, race, gender, and religion are irrelevant, has produced mixed
results. As long as there is no true equality, of opportunity, of access, and of the
true worth of human beings, and as long as the world is “broken up into fragments
by narrow domestic walls”4 the quest remains incomplete. The present judgment is
part of an ongoing debate, which every generation of Indians has to grapple with,
and this court confront, at different points in time.
</p><p id="p_1047">4.    The Maratha community, in the State of Maharashtra repeatedly sought
reservations through diverse nature of demands through public meetings, marches
etc, by members of the community. It also led to representatives and organizations
of the community taking the demands to the streets, resulting in the State of
Maharashtra promulgating an Ordinance for the first time in the year 2014, which
granted reservation to the community in public employment and in the field of
education. Later, the Ordinance was given the shape of an Act 5, which was
challenged before the Bombay High Court.6 The court, after considering the rival
submissions, including the arguments of the state stayed the operation of the
enactment. The State Government then set up a backward class commission to

ascertain the social and educational status of the community. Initially, the
commission was headed by Justice S. B. Mhase. His demise led to the appointment
of Justice MG Gaikwad (Retired) as chairperson of the commission; it comprised
of 10 other members.The Committee headed by Justice Gaikwad was thus
reconstituted on 3rd November, 2017. By its report dated 13.11.2018 (the Gaikwad
Commission Report)7, the Commission, on the basis of the surveys and studies it
commissioned, and the analysis of the data collected during its proceedings,
recommended that the Maratha class of citizens be declared as a Socially and
Educationally Backward Class (“SEBC” hereafter). This soon led to the enactment
of the SEBC Act, giving effect to the recommendations of the Gaikwad
Commission, resulting in reservation to the extent of 16% in favour of that
community; consequently, the aggregate reservations exceeded 50%.
</p><p id="p_1050">5.  The SEBC Act was brought into force on 30 th November, 2018. Close on its
heels a spate of writ petitions was filed before the Bombay High Court,
challenging the identification of Marathas as SEBCs, the conclusions of the
Commission, which culminated in its adoption by the State of Maharashtra and
enactment of the SEBC Act, the quantum of reservations, and the provisions of the
Act itself, on diverse grounds. All writ petitions were clubbed together and
considered. By the impugned judgment, the High Court turned down the challenge
and upheld the identification of Marathas as SEBCs, and further upheld the reasons
presented before it, that extraordinary circumstances existed, warranting the breach
of the 50% mark, which was held to be the outer limit in the nine-judge decision of
this court in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_963">Indra Sawhney v. Union of India8</a> (hereafter variously “Indra
Sawhney” or “Sawhney”).

the judgment of B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., this limit could be exceeded under
extraordinary circumstances and in conditions for which separate justification has
to be forthcoming by the State or the concerned agency. However, there is
unanimity in the conclusion by all seven judges that an outer limit for reservation
should be50%. Undoubtedly, the other two judges, Ratnavel Pandian and P.B.
Sawant, JJ. indicated that there is no general rule of 50% limit on reservation. In
these circumstances, given the general common agreement about the existence of
an outer limit, i.e. 50%, the petitioner’s argument about the incoherence or
uncertainty about the existence of the rule or that there were contrary observations
with respect to absence of any ceiling limit in other judgments (the dissenting

is not an argument compelling a review or reconsideration of Indra Sawhney rule.
</p><p id="p_1063">11. The respondents had urged that discordant voices in different subjects
(Devadasan, N.M. Thomas and Indra Sawhney) should lead to re-examination of
the ratio in Indra Sawhney. It would be useful to notice that unanimity in a given
bench (termed as a “supermajority”) – denoting a 5-0 unanimous decision in a
Constitution Bench cannot be construed as per se a strong or compelling reason to
doubt the legitimacy of a larger bench ruling that might contain a narrow majority
(say, for instance with a 4-3 vote, resulting in overruling of a previous unanimous
precedent). The principle of stare decisis operates both vertically- in the sense that
decisions of appellate courts in the superior in vertical hierarchy, bind tribunals and
courts lower in the hierarchy, and horizontally- in the sense that a larger bench
formation ruling, would be binding and prevail upon the ruling of a smaller bench

formation. The logic in this stems from the raison d’etre for the doctrine of
precedents, i.e. stability in the law. If this rule were to be departed from and the
legitimacy of a subsequent larger bench ruling were to be doubted on the ground
that it comprises of either plurality of opinions or a narrow majority as compared
with a previous bench ruling (which might be either unanimous or of a larger
majority, but of lower bench strength), there would uncertainty and lack of clarity
in the realm of precedential certainty. If precedential legitimacy of a larger bench
ruling were thus to be doubted, there are no rules to guide the courts’ hierarchy or
even later benches of the same court about which is the appropriate reading to be
adopted (such as for instance, the number of previous judgments to be considered
for determining the majority, and consequently the correct law).
</p><p id="p_1067">12. In view of the above reasoning, it is held that the existence of a plurality of
opinions or discordant or dissident judgments in the past – which might even have
led to a majority (on an overall headcount) supporting a particular rule in a
particular case cannot detract from the legitimacy of a rule enunciated by a later,
larger bench, such as the nine-judge ruling in Indra Sawhney.
</p><p id="p_1068">13. So far as the argument that Indra Sawhney was concerned only with
reservations under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_972">Article 16(4)</a> is concerned, this Court is inclined to accept the
submissions of the petitioner. The painstaking reasoning in various judgments, in
Indra Sawhney, including the judgments of Pandian and Sawant, JJ. would show
that almost all the previous precedents on both <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_973">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_974">16(4)</a> were
considered15.
</p><p id="p_1069">14. The tenor of all the judgments shows the anxiety of this Court to decisively
rule on the subject of reservations under the Constitution – in regard to backward
classes and socially and educationally backward classes. This is also evident from

(socially and educationally backward classes) which was held to be wider than
“backward classes” though the later expression pointed to social backwardness.
Such conclusions cannot be brushed aside by sweeping submission pointing to the
context of the adjudication in Indra Sawhney.
</p><p id="p_1070">15. The argument on behalf of the States –that a decision is to be considered as a
ratio only as regards the principles decided, having regard to the material facts, in
the opinion of this Court, the reliance upon a judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1624536/" id="a_984">Krishena
Kumar and Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. 16 in the opinion of this Court is
insubstantial. The reference of the dispute, i.e. notification of various backward
classes for the purpose of Union public employment under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_985">Article 16(4)</a> and the
issuance of the OM dated 1990 no doubt provided the context for the Court to
decide as it did in Indra Sawhney. However, to characterize its conclusions and the
considerations through the judgments of various judges, as not ratios but mere
obiter or observations not binding upon the states is an over-simplification. The
OM did lead to widespread protests and discontent. Initially, the writ petitions were
referred to a five-judge bench which, upon deliberation and hearing felt that the
matter required consideration by a larger bench (presumably in view of the
previous ruling by the seven judges in N.M. Thomas where two judges had
expressly stated that there was no ceiling on reservation and the later five judge
judgment in K.C. Vasanth Kumar where one judge had expressed a similar
reservation). It was for the purpose of decisively declaring the law that the nine-
judge bench was formed and the question formulated by it. Not only did the judges
who constituted a majority speak about this rule; even the two other judges who

did not agree with the 50% ceiling rule, dealt with this aspect. This is evident from
the judgment of Sawant, J17:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_295">      “518. To summarise, the question may be answered thus. There is no
      legal infirmity in keeping the reservations under Clause (4) alone or
      under Clause (4) and Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_986">Article 16</a> together, exceeding
      50%. However, validity of the extent of excess of reservations over
      50% would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case
      including the field in which and the grade or level of administration
      for which the reservation is kept. Although, further, legally and
      theoretically the excess of reservations over 50% may be justified, it
      would ordinarily be wise and nothing much would be lost, if the
      intentions of the framers of the Constitution and the observations of
      Dr. Ambedkar, on the subject in particular, are kept in mind. The
      reservations should further be kept category and gradewise at
      appropriate percentages and for practical purposes the extent of
      reservations should be calculated category and gradewise..”
</blockquote><p id="p_1072">16.     Likewise, Pandian, J., after elaborate discussion,18recorded his conclusions
in this manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_296">    “189. I fully share the above views of Fazal Ali, Krishna Iyer,
    Chinnappa Reddy, JJ holding that no maximum percentage of
    reservation       can       be       justifiably  fixed  under
    Articles 15(4) and/or 16(4) of the Constitution.”
</blockquote><p id="p_1073">17. Both show that the extent of whether a 50% limit is applicable, was
considered by all the judges. Therefore, the arguments on behalf of the States and
the contesting respondents in this regard are unmerited. Likewise, to say that
whether a 50% limit of reservation existed or not was not an issue or a point of
reference, is without basis; clearly that issue did engage the anxious consideration
of the court.

</p><p id="p_1076">18.   The States had argued that providing a ceiling (of 50%) amounts to
restricting the scope of Part III and Part IV of the Constitution. A provision of the
constitution cannot be “read down” as to curtail its width, or shackle state power,
which is dynamic. The state legislatures and executives are a product of
contemporary democratic processes. They not only are alive to the needs of the
society, but are rightfully entitled to frame policies for the people. Given the
absence of any caste census, but admitted growth of population, there can be no
doubt that the proportion of the backward classes has swelled, calling for greater
protection under Articles 15 (4) and 16 (4). Also, every generation has aspirations,
which democratically elected governments are bound to meet and consider, while
framing policies. In view of these factors, the fixed limit of 50% on reservations,
requires to be reconsidered. Counsel submitted that whether reservations in a given
case are unreasonable and excessive, can always be considered in judicial review,
having regard to the circumstances of the particular case, the needs of the state and
by weighing the rights, in the context of the states’ priorities, having regard to their
obligations under the Directive Principles of State Policy, which are now deemed
as fundamental as the rights under Part III of the Constitution. The court’s
flexibility in testing whether a measure is reasonable or not can always be retained
and moulded appropriately.
</p><p id="p_1077">19. <a href="/doc/1166220/" id="a_987">Lt. Col Khajoor Singh v. Union of India</a> (supra) is an authority for the
approach that this court should adopt, when it is asked to reconsider a previous
precedent of long standing. The court observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_297">     “We are of opinion that unless there are clear and compelling
     reasons, which cannot be denied, we should not depart from the

      deliberation and full hearing, was erroneous, go back upon its
      previous ruling, particularly on a constitutional issue.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1078">20.    In Keshav Mills (supra) the court elaborated what considerations would
weigh with it, when a demand for review of the law declared in a previous
judgment is made:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_298">      “..Frequent exercise by this Court of its power to review its earlier
      decisions on the ground that the view pressed before it later appears
      to the Court to be more reasonable, may incidentally tend to make law
      uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently
      avoided. …it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles which
      should govern the approach of the Court in dealing with the question
      of reviewing and revising its earlier decisions. It would always depend
      upon several relevant considerations: What is the nature of the
      infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and revision of the
      earlier view is based? On the earlier occasion, did some patent
      aspects of the question remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the
      Court not drawn to any relevant and material statutory provision, or
      was any previous decision of this Court bearing on the point not
      noticed? Is the Court hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is
      such an error in the earlier view? What would be the impact of the
      error on the general administration of law or on public good? Has the
      earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either by this
      Court or by the High Courts? And, would the reversal of the earlier
      decision lead to public inconvenience, hardship or mischief? These
      and other relevant considerations must be carefully borne in mind
      whenever this Court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to
      review and revise its earlier decisions.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1079">21.    Identical observations were made in Jindal Stainless (supra). In Union of
India v Raghubir Singh19, a Constitution Bench articulated the challenges often
faced by this court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_299">     “….The social forces which demand attention in the cauldron of

       while permitting necessary scope for judicial creativity and
       adaptability of the law to the changing demands of society. The
       question then is not whether the Supreme Court is bound by its own
       previous decisions. It is not. The question is under what circumstances
       and within what limits and in what manner should the highest Court
       over-turn its own pronouncements.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1080">22.      What the respondents seek, in asking this court to refer the issue to a larger
bench, strikes at the very essence of equality. The review of precedents undertaken
by Indra Sawhney not only spanned four turbulent decades, which saw several
amendments to the Constitution, but led to a debate initiated by five judges in M.R.
Balaji, (and followed up in at least more than 10 decisions) later continued by
seven judges in N.M. Thomas. This debate- i.e., between Balaji and Indra
Sawhney, saw the court’s initial declaration that a 50% ceiling on reservations
should be imposed, which was questioned in three judgments, though not in
majority decisions of various benches. Therefore, to decisively settle this important
issue- among other issues, the nine-judge bench was constituted. Indra Sawhney
decisively ruled that reservations through special provisions should not exceed
50% by a 7-2 majority. Two judges did not indicate any limit on reservations, they
did not also indicate any clear guiding principle about what should be the court’s
approach, when a party complains that reservations are excessive or unreasonable.
Indra Sawhney is equally decisive on whether reservations can be introduced for
any new class, or the quantum of reservations, when introduced, or changed, can
be the subject matter of judicial review, for which according to the majority of
judges, the guiding principle would be the one enunciated in <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_988">Barium Chemicals v.
Company Law Board20</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_1081">

</p><p id="p_1082">23.     The salience of the issue under consideration is that equality has many
dimensions. In the context of Articles 15 (4) and 16 (4,) and indeed the power of
classification vested in the state, to adopt protective discrimination policies, there
is an element of obligation, or a duty, to equalize those sections of the population
who were hitherto, “invisible” or did not matter. The reach of the equalizing
principle, in that sense is compelling. Thus while, as explained by this court in
<a href="/doc/191551270/" id="a_989">Mukesh Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand21</a> there is no right to claim a direction that
reservations should be provided (the direction in that case being sought was
reservation in promotions in the state of Uttarakhand), the court would intervene if
the state acts without due justification, but not to the extent of directing
reservations.22Equally, the states’ obligation to ensure that measures to uplift the
educational and employment opportunities of all sections, especially vulnerable
sections such as scheduled castes and STs and backward class of citizens, is
underscored- not only in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_990">Article 15 (4)</a> but also by <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_991">Article 46</a>, though it is a
directive principle.23 It is wrong therefore, to suggest that Indra Sawhney did not
examine the states’ obligations in the light of Directive Principles; it clearly did- as
is evident from the express discussion on that aspect in several judgments.24

<p id="p_1084">24.     Protective discrimination, affirmative action, or any other term used by this
court, means the measure of the state to ensure that past inequities are not carried
on as today’s burdens, that full (and one may add, meaningful) opportunities are
given to all in participation in governance structures: access to public institutions
(through special provisions under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_994">Article 15 (4))</a> and adequate representation
(through reservations under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_995">Article 16 (4)).</a> They are tools in the repertoire of the
states to empower those hitherto barred from sharing power- and all that went with
it, of bringing first hand perspectives in policy making, of acting as pathbreakers,
of those breaking the glass ceiling- in short, imparting dimensions in democratic
governance which were absent.25
</p><p id="p_1085">25. A constant and recurring theme in the several judgments of Indra Sawhney
was the concept of balance. This expression was used in two senses- one, to
correct the existing imbalance which existed, due to past discriminatory practices
that kept large sections of the society backward; two, the quest for achieving the
balance between the guarantee of equality to all, and the positive or affirmative
discrimination sanctioned by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_996">Article 15 (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_997">16 (4).</a> 26 B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J (for
himself and four other judges) held that (para 808, SCC reports):
</p><p id="p_1086">    “It needs no emphasis to say that the principal aim of Articles 14 and
    16 is equality and equality of opportunity and that clause (4) of
Ahmadi, JJ (in Paras 648-49, 695, 747, Paras 834-835 and Para 860- all SCC references).


25The idea of empowerment is articulated in the judgment of Jeevan Reddy, in Indra Sawhney firstly in Para 694:
“The above material makes it amply clear that the objective behind clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_998">Article 16</a> was the sharing of State
power. The State power which was almost exclusively monopolised by the upper castes i.e., a few communities, was
now sought to be made broad-based. The backward communities who were till then kept out of apparatus of power,
were sought to be inducted thereinto and since that was not practicable in the normal course, a special provision
was made to effectuate the said objective. In short, the objective behind <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_999">Article 16(4)</a> is empowerment of the
deprived backward communities — to give them a share in the administrative apparatus and in the governance of
the community.” and then, in Para 788. that “the object of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1000">Article 16(4)</a> was “empowerment” of the backward
classes. The idea was to enable them to share the state power.”


26This theme of balance occurs 49 times in various judgments. All the judges deal with it; although
Pandian and Sawant, JJ, reject the numerical ceiling of 50%, their judgments acknowledge the need to

balance has to be maintained between the competing values and the rival claims
and interests so as to achieve equality and freedom for all.” (Ref. Para 255, SCC

means that lines have to be drawn, and at times re-drawn- depending on “the
cauldron of change”28. It has been remarked that decisions dealing with
fundamental concepts such as the equality clause are “heavily value-laden, and
necessarily so, since value premises (other than the values of &quot;equality&quot; and
&quot;rationality&quot;) are necessary to the determination that the clause requires.”29
</p><p id="p_1094">28. Interpretation of the Constitution, is in the light of its uniqueness, Dr.
Aharon Barak, the distinguished former President of the Israeli Supreme Court
remarked, in his work:30
    “Some argue that giving a modern meaning to the language of the
    constitution is inconsistent with regarding the constitution as a source
    of protection of the individual from society31. Under this approach, if
    the constitution is interpreted in accordance with modern views, it will
    reflect the view of the majority to the detriment of the minority. My
    reply to this claim is inter alia, that a modern conception of human
    rights is not simply the current majority’s conception of human rights.
    The objective purpose refers to fundamental values that reflect the
    deeply held beliefs of modern society, not passing trends. These beliefs
    are not the results of public opinion polls or mere populism; they are
    fundamental beliefs that have passed the test of time, changing their
    form but not their substance.”

Constitution, the word of this court is final. Undoubtedly its role is as a co-equal
branch of governance; nevertheless, its duty to interpret the law and say what its

with, involve making choices. These choices are not made randomly, or
arbitrarily32, but based on a careful analysis of the rights involved, the remedies
proposed by the legislative or executive measure, the extent of limits imposed by
the Constitution, and so on. The history of the legislation or the measure, or indeed
the provision of the Constitution plays a role in this process. Interpretation involves
an element of line drawing, of making choices. This court’s decisions are replete
with such instances. The doctrine of classification is the first instance where this
court drew a line, and indicated a choice of interpretation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1007">Article 14;</a> likewise,

interpretation of a provision of this constitution, and a limit indicated by a decision,
it is on the basis of principle and principle alone.

for application by courts, that would strike the just balance between the
aspirational rights – and the corresponding duty of the states to introduce
affirmative measures to combat inequality (under Articles 15 [4] and 16 [4]) on the
one hand, and the principle of equality and its command against practising
inequality in proscribed areas (caste being one, in both Articles 15 and 16). It was

governments. This court remarked in <a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_1010">R.C. Poudyal v. Union of India35</a> that

      “124. … In the interpretation of a constitutional document, “words
      are but the framework of concepts and concepts may change more
      than words themselves”. The significance of the change of the
      concepts themselves is vital and the constitutional issues are not
      solved by a mere appeal to the meaning of the words without an
      acceptance of the line of their growth. It is aptly said that “the
      intention of a Constitution is rather to outline principles than to
      engrave details”.”

</p><p id="p_1101">31.    The idea of a definitive and objective principle, in the form of a 50% ceiling
on limitation, emerges on an overall reading of Indra Sawhney. The argument
made by the respondents was that this court should not go by such a ceiling limit,
but rather, while exercising its judicial review power, proceed on a case-by-case
approach, and resting its conclusions on fact dependent exercises, using other
criteria, such as reasonableness, proportionality, etc. for judging excessive
reservations. However, what constitutes reasonableness and what is proportionate
in a given case, would be unchartered and indeterminate areas. It is one thing to try
persuading the court to discard a known principle, in the light of its loss of
relevance, yet for that argument to prevail, not only should the harm caused by the
existing principle be proved, but also a principle that is sought to be substituted,
should have clarity, or else, the argument would be one asking the court to take a
leap in the dark. It is not enough, therefore to resort to observations such as “the
length of the leap to be provided depends upon the gap to be covered” 36 or the
proportionality doctrine (deployed to judge validity of an executive or legislative
measure), because they reveal no discernible principle. Reasonableness is no

doubt a familiar phrase in the constitutional lexicon; yet there is considerable
subjectivity and relativity in its practise. Again, to quote Dr. Barak there are “zones
of reasonableness”37. This places the court in a difficult situation, where the state’s
choices require greater deference, and a corresponding narrowing of judicial
review, given that the standard of review is the one indicated in Barium Chemicals.
The South African Constitutional Court voiced a similar idea, in connection with
an affirmative action program, when it observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_303">     “The fairness of a measure differentiating on any prohibited ground
     depends not only on its purpose, but on the cumulative effect of all
     relevant factors, including the extent of its detrimental effects on non-
     designated groups”.38

</blockquote><p id="p_1103">32.    In another case, City Council of Pretoria v. Walker, 39Sachs J.(of the South
African Constitutional Court)remarked that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_304">      &quot;[p]rocesses of differential treatment which have the legitimate
      purpose of bringing about real equality should not be undertaken in a
      manner which gratuitously and insensitively offends and marginalises
      persons identified as belonging to groups who previously enjoyed
      advantage.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1104">33.    In that case, the question for judicial review was whether a local authority in
a period of transition, could impose a lower flat rate tariff in one locality (inhabited
by the historically discriminated black community, with poor infrastructure) and a
higher metered tariff in a locality with better infrastructure, inhabited by the white
community. Sachs J. held that this was not unfair discrimination against the
applicant, a white resident, but rather a failure on the part of the local authority to
put down a basis for the differential levy of tariffs, rooted in substantive equality:

      general application which would be justiciable according to the
      criteria of reasonableness and justifiability”.

</p><p id="p_1107">34.     Upon examination of the issue from this perspective, the ceiling of 50% with
the “extraordinary circumstances” exception, is the just balance- what is termed as
the “Goldilocks solution”40- i.e. the solution containing the right balance that
allows the state sufficient latitude to ensure meaningful affirmative action, to those
who deserve it, and at the same time ensures that the essential content of equality,
and its injunction not to discriminate on the various proscribed grounds (caste,
religion, sex, place of residence) is retained. This court in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_1012">M. Nagaraj v. Union</a> of
India41observed that “a numerical benchmark is the surest immunity against
charges of discrimination.” To dilute the 50% benchmark further, would be to
effectively destroy the guarantee of equality, especially the right not to be
discriminated against on the grounds of caste (under Articles 15 and 16).

reconsideration, and ought to be referred to a larger bench, is hereby rejected.

Affirmative Action and the Reservation Paradigm

Special Provisions

</p><p id="p_1109">36.     Before parting with this section, this opinion would dwell upon affirmative
action, and possibilities under the Constitution, from a larger perspective. Most
debates, and precedents in the country have centred round the extent of reservation

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Goldilocks. The term was used by Justice Elena Kagan in
her dissent, in Arizona Free Enterprise Club&#x27;s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U.S. 721 (2011) “the
difficulty then, is finding the Goldilocks solution-not too large, not too small, but just right.” This term is
also used to denote a proper balance, in management parlance.

and administration of quotas (reservations) under Articles 15 (4) and 16(4). The
term “special provision” in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1013">Article 15 (4)</a> is of wider import, than reservations.
Unlike the United States of America which – in the absence of a provision enabling
such special provisions, and which has witnessed a turbulent affirmative action
policy jurisprudence, the 1960s and 1970s witnessing the framing of policies and
legislation, and the subsequent narrowing of minority and racial criteria, to support
affirmative action, our Constitution has a specific provision.
</p><p id="p_1111">37. During the hearing, it was pointed out that there are not enough
opportunities for education of backward classes of citizens, and that schools and
educational institutions are lacking. It was argued by the states that sufficient
number of backward classes of young adults are unable to secure admissions in
institutions of higher learning.
</p><p id="p_1112">38. It would be, in this context, relevant to notice that two important
amendments to the Constitution of India, which have the effect of transforming the
notion of equality, were made in the last 15 years. The first was the eighty sixth
amendment – which inserted <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1014">Article 21A42-</a> which had the effect of enjoining the
state to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group 6-
</p><p id="p_1113">14. The second was the Constitution Ninety Third Amendment Act, which inserted
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1015">Article 15 (5)43</a> enabling the state to make special provisions “for the advancement
of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled
Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their
admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions,
whether aided or unaided.” The transformative potential of these provisions (both

of which have been upheld by this court – in <a href="/doc/32468867/" id="a_1018">Pramati Educational &amp; Cultural
Trust v. Union of India44</a>) is yet to be fully realized. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1019">Article 21A</a> guarantees
minimum universal education; whereas <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1020">Article 15(5)</a> enables access to backward
classes of citizens admissions, through special provisions by the state, in private
educational institutions. The Right to Education Act, 2009 provides a broad
statutory framework for realization of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1021">Article 21A.</a>
</p><p id="p_1114">39. The availability of these constitutional provisions, however does not mean
that those belonging to backward class of citizens would be better off or would
reap any automatic benefits. Here, it is relevant to consider that often, any debate
as to the efficacy or extent of reservation, invariably turns to one stereotypical
argument- of merit. Long ago, in his important work 45– Marc Galanter had dealt
with the issue of merit in this manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_305">      “Let us take merit to mean performance on tests (examinations,
      interview, character references or whatever) thought to be related to
      performance relevant to the position (or other opportunity) in
      question and commonly used as a measure of qualification for that
      position. (In every case it is an empirical question whether the test
      performance is actually a good predictor of performance in the
      position, much less of subsequent positions for which it is a
      preparation.) Performance on these tests is presumably a composite
      of native ability, situational advantages (stimulation in the family
      setting, good schools, sufficient wealth to avoid malnutrition or
      exhausting work, etc.), and individual effort. The latter may be
      regarded as evidence of moral desert, but neither native ability nor
      situational advantages would seem to be. The common forms of
      selection by merit do not purport to measure the moral desert
      dimension of performance. Unless one is willing to assume that such
      virtue is directly proportionate to the total performance, the argument
      for merit selection cannot rest on the moral deservingness of
      individual candidates…..”

      inequities in myriad ways. Those who are fortunate to make their
      escape from these all-pervasive dragnets by managing to attain at
      least the minimum of attainments in spite of the paralysing effects of

      neither scientific nor realistic. Marks in one-time oral or written test
      do not necessarily prove the worth or suitability of an individual to a

       There were observations earlier in the judgment of Chinnappa Reddy, J, in
K.C. Vasant Kumar (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_1119">       Anatole France had – in his ironic (and iconic) observations remarked once,
that

       “In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep
       under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.”



</p><p id="p_1120">41.     The previous rulings in Vasant Kumar (supra), and the comments of Dr.
Amartya Sen in his work “Merit and Justice” were considered in some detail, in
the recent ruling in <a href="/doc/18096795/" id="a_1022">B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India46</a>,
      ““Merit” must not be limited to narrow and inflexible criteria such as
      one&#x27;s rank in a standardised exam, but rather must flow from the
      actions a society seeks to reward, including the promotion of equality
      in society and diversity in public administration.”

This court also noted that merit as we understand - i.e. performance in standardised
tests, is largely dependent upon neutral factors, which discriminate in favour of
those who are privileged.

between those who have no access to the means of achieving the goal of

competitive evaluations like tests, and those who have all the wherewithal for it.

that everything is perfectly fair now and asks the question of how the candidate
fares in examinations that test only a narrow range of skills, mainly of linear-type

and centuries old inequalities, the burdens of which continue to plague those who
labour under disadvantage, and through the so called “level playing field” of a
common exam, or evaluation, privileges those who had, and continue to have,
access to wealth, power, premium education and other privileges, thus
consolidating these advantages. Merit is a resource attractor. Those with it,
accumulate more of it, more wealth and acquire more power. They use that money
and power to purchase more increments of merit for themselves and their children.

that the US has now become a sorting machine“that promises mobility on the basis

of the commonality democracy requires” (p. 155)He further says that first, all are
told that although the promise of a mobile society based on merit is better than a
hereditary hierarchy, it is important to comprehend that this promise does not come
with any attendant promise to attenuate inequality in society. On the contrary, this
promise legitimizes “inequalities that arise from merit rather than birth” (p.

adequacy or otherwise of scholarships, quantum disbursed, eligibility criteria (the
maximum family income limit of ₹ 2,50,000/- possibly excludes large segments of
beneficiaries, given that even Group D employment in the Central Government can
result in exclusion of any scholarships to children of such employees), and
reconsideration about introducing other facilities, such as incentivising
scholarships, grants and interest free or extremely low interest education loans to
widen the net of recipients and beneficiaries. States and the Union government
may also revisit the threshold limits and their tendency to exclude otherwise
deserving candidates. For instance, even if an SC/ST or SEBC household has an
income of ₹ 6,00,000/- year, the denial of scholarship to a deserving student from
that background cannot equate her or him with another candidate, whose family

The wider possibilities of affirmative action- USA, South Africa and Canada

The US Experience

</p><p id="p_1150">57.     In the US, in Fullilove v. Klutznick,68 the US Supreme Court rejected a
challenge to the constitutionality of a federal law demanding preferential treatment
of minority-owned businesses through a racial quota system. The challenged law 69
prescribed pre-conditions for receipt of state and local government public works
grants upon the private entity&#x27;s assurance that at least 10% of the amount of each
grant would be spent on contracts with minority business enterprises (MBEs).
Public contracts normally were awarded to the lowest bidder; the provision
operated to grant public works contracts to the lowest bidder who complied with
the 10% set-aside (quota) goal. The executive policy framed pursuant to the Act
imposed upon those receiving grants and their prime contractors an affirmative
duty to seek out and employ available, qualified, and bona fide MBEs. As the
objective of the MBE provision was to overcome longstanding barriers to minority
participation in public contracting opportunities, the set-aside provision i.e.
condition favoured a higher MBE bid as long as the higher price reflected inflated
costs resulting from past disadvantage and discrimination. The administrative
program therefore authorized the Economic Development Agency to waive the
minority participation requirement where a high minority business bid is not
attributable to the present effects of past discrimination. The plaintiffs in Fullilove

 were non-minority associations of construction contractors and subcontractors.
 They alleged that enforcement of the Public Works Act&#x27;s MBE requirement caused
 economic injury to the non-minority business plaintiffs. In addition, the plaintiffs
 asserted that the MBE 10% quota provision violated the equal protection clause of
 the fourteenth amendment and the equal protection element of the due process
 clause of the fifth amendment.
</p><p id="p_1152"> 58. The US Supreme Court held that the interference with the business
 opportunities of non-minority firms caused by the 10% set-aside program did not
 render the Act constitutionally defective. The Court rejected the alleged equal
 protection violation on the grounds that the Act ensured equal protection of the
 laws by providing minority businesses an equal opportunity to participate in
 federal grants. The later decision Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Penal70 held that
 federal affirmative action programs are now subject to strict scrutiny, just as state
 and local programs were since 1989. The court held that “federal racial
 classifications, like those of a state, must serve a compelling governmental
 interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.”

 South Africa

</p><p id="p_1153">59.     Under South Africa’s Constitution of 1998, Chapter 2, <a href="/doc/419534/" id="a_1024">Article 9(3)</a> dealing
 with &quot;Equality&quot; reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_308">      &quot;The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against
      any one on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex,
      pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual
      orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture,

      fairness,&quot; and it needs &quot;to redress the imbalances of the past to
      achieve broad representation”.
</p><p id="p_1156">60.    In furtherance of these provisions, in October 1998, the Employment Equity
Act was legislated. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1025">The Act</a> starts with the premise that &quot;pronounced
disadvantages&quot; created by past policies cannot be redressed by a simple repeal of
past discriminatory laws, and there was a need to enforce &quot;employment equity to
redress the effects of discrimination,&quot; and &quot;achieve a diverse workforce broadly
representative&quot; of the people of South Africa. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1026">The Act</a> has two purposes: (1) to
promote &quot;equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment through the
elimination of unfair discrimination,&quot; and (2) to implement &quot;affirmative action
measures to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated
groups, in order to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational
categories and levels in the workforce.&quot; Designated groups are defined as black
people (who include Africans, Coloureds and Indians), women, and people with
disabilities.
</p><p id="p_1157">61. Affirmative action measures for designated groups must include
identification and removal of barriers adversely affecting them, actions to further
diversity, reasonable accommodations to ensure equal opportunity and equitable
representation, and efforts at training to retain and develop them. Representation is
extended to all occupational categories and levels in the workforce and this is to be
ensured through preferential treatment and numerical goals, but not with quotas.
The Employment Equity Plan itself must state the objectives to be achieved each
year, the affirmative action measures with timetables and strategies to be
implemented to accomplish them, and the procedure to evaluate the plan. Each
plan ought not to be for a period of less than one year, and not longer than five
years. (At the expiration of one plan, another may follow.) While preferential
treatment is meant for only suitably qualified people, such suitability may be a

product of formal qualifications, prior learning, relevant experience, or capacity to
acquire, within a reasonable time, the ability to do the job.
</p><p id="p_1158">62. Under the Employment Equity Act, employers must consult with their
employees and representative trade unions, after which an audit of employment
policies and practices in the workplace must be undertaken. Analysis of the
information garnered in the audit is meant to assist in developing demographic
profiles of the work force, and identifying barriers to the employment or
advancement of designated groups. Under-representation of designated groups in
all categories of work must also be identified. Quotas are expressly prohibited
under <a href="/doc/993879/" id="a_1027">Section 15(3)</a> of the Act. In 2003, the Black Economic Empowerment Act
was legislated. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1028">This Act</a> has as its purpose the &quot;economic empowerment of all
black people, including women, workers, youth, people with disabilities and people
living in rural areas&quot;. To measure compliance with black economic empowerment
(BEE) requirements, the Department of Trade and Industry uses a balanced
scorecard, consisting of three broad components. The scorecard will be used for
government procurement, public-private partnerships, sale of state-owned
enterprises, when licenses are applied for, and for any other relevant economic
activity. Strategies aimed at levelling the playing field may include the elimination
of employment barriers such as adapting testing requirements to compensate for
educational disadvantage or lack of work experience 71; reviewing recruitment,
selection and promotion procedures to ensure fairness in job competition72;
accelerated and corrective training; and the transformation of work environments
that exclude or otherwise disadvantage designated groups, e.g. measures aimed at

Canada

</p><p id="p_1160">63.     In Canadian National Railway Co v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights
Commission)74, Dickson J. reasoned that the purpose of an affirmative action
programme is to break a continuing cycle of systemic discrimination. The goal is
not to compensate past victims or even to provide new opportunities for specific
individuals who have been unfairly refused jobs or promotion in the past, but to
ensure that future applicants and workers from the affected groups will not face the
same insidious barriers that blocked their forebears.
</p><p id="p_1161">64. In Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Ontario (Ministry of Health) 75, the
Ontario Court of Appeal interpreted the affirmative action provisions of the
Ontario Human Rights Code 1990 and the Canadian Human Rights Act 1985, to
reinforce the important insight that substantive equality requires positive action to
ameliorate the conditions of disadvantaged groups. One of the important purposes
of the provisions is to protect affirmative action programmes from being
challenged as violating the formal equality provisions contained elsewhere in the
Code or Act. Affirmative action, according to the court, is aimed at
      “achieving substantive equality by enabling or assisting
      disadvantaged persons to acquire skills so that they can compete
      equally for jobs on a level playing field with those who do not have
      the disadvantage. The purpose of<a href="/doc/187697/" id="a_1029"> s. 14(l)</a> is not simply to exempt or
      protect affirmative action programs from challenge. It is also an
      interpretative aid that clarifies the full meaning of equal rights by
      promoting substantive equality”.76

Possibilities for Affirmative Action other than Reservation in India

</p><p id="p_1164">65.   The US practice of encouraging diversity by incentivising it by for instance,
the award of government contracts to firms that have a good record of recruiting

policies in Madhya Pradesh. Other States such as UP, Bihar, Karnataka, AP and
Telangana have followed a policy of affirmative action in awarding contracts and
in that manner protecting SC and ST entrepreneurs’ entry into trade, business and
other public works as contractors. Recently, Karnataka enacted a legislation,
namely, the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Act,
2016, which reserves 24.1% for SC and ST contracts in all Government works,
public contracts up to ₹ 50 lakh. This law aims to ensure the presence of SC and
ST contractors and to get the award of Government work without rigid tender
process. Orissa, too provides for a price preference to SC/ST entrepreneurs to the
extent of 10% of contracts of a certain value.
</p><p id="p_1165">66.   There is empirical evidence, in India, in different sectors that access to
productive employment is confined to a few sections of the workforce, among the
most backward of classes, while the rest eke out a living in the informal economy.
The faultlines of division between those who are employed in good jobs and those
who are “excluded” run deep, and are based on caste, religion, region, and other
sectarian divisions all of which overlap with class and gender, such that even
within the small section of the workforce which is productively employed in
decent jobs, some groups are better represented than others, placed higher than
others, while some castes and communities are practically absent in the top
echelons of the private corporate sector. While private employers firmly believe
that jobs should be allocated on the basis of individual merit, their views about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_400">                                          38</span>


how merit is distributed overlaps strongly with existing stereotypes around caste,
religion, gender and regional differences.
</p><p id="p_1166">67.   A method by which the private sector can substantively contribute to
alleviate discrimination and inequality, is through its corporate social responsibility
(CSR) programmes. CSR has been compulsory in India since 2013. These
initiatives have taken two major forms: education of the under-privileged either
through special schools or other programmes to support school-going children, and
support to poor women through home-based work or micro-finance. While these
measures are significant, there are other spheres where CSR could be directed,
with even greater benefits. The definition and scope of CSR needs to be broadened
to include measures to counteract the natural tendencies towards exclusion of
certain groups. Private sector managements need to show sensitivity to societal
patterns of exclusion and must consciously make an attempt not to fall prey
dominant social stereotypes, which penalize people due to their birth into
stigmatizing jobs, even if they might be individually qualified and competent.
</p><p id="p_1167">68.   In addition to being sensitized to the problem of under-representation at the
time of employment (by actively pursuing policies to promote and/or by equal
opportunity employment policies), private companies can also pay attention to
supplier diversity in matters of procurement. By encouraging supplies from firms
owned by SCs, STs, or those from backward class or deprived classes, the large
organized private sector in India could give a huge boost to the micro, medium and
small enterprises owned by entrepreneurs from such marginalized groups. Indeed,
this is also one of the planks used in the USA, for instance, where minority-owned
businesses are not only given active financial incentives by the government, but
larger firms are expected to source a part of their supplies from minority-owned
businesses. Given that typically, SC, ST and backward class individuals owned
micro enterprises are likely to employ greater proportion of persons from these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_401">                                       39</span>


communities (as compared to enterprises owned by upper-caste groups), an active
supplier diversity programme would also boost employment.
</p><p id="p_1168">69.   In view of all these developments, it is time that the states and the Union
government gather data about the extent and reach of the existing schemes for
employment, and in the field of education, take steps to ensure greater access, by
wherever necessary, increasing funding, increasing the number and extent of
coverage of scholarships, and setting up all manner of special institutions which
can train candidates aspiring for higher education, to increase their chances of
entry in admission tests, etc. Likewise, innovative employment incentives to the
private sector, especially in the manner of employment in contracts or projects
awarded by the state or its instrumentalities, need to be closely examined and
implemented. These welfare measures can also include giving tax incentives to
schemes that fund scholarships and easy (or interest free) loans to SC, ST and
SEBC students, which can enhance their access to educational institutions. Today,
even if an SC, or SEBC candidate secures admission in a common entrance
examination for a medical seat, in a private institution, the amounts charged as
annual fees would exclude most of such candidates (even those who are ineligible
to government scholarships, as being marginally above the threshold of ₹
2,50,000/- per annum annual family income). Other incentives, such as awarding
marks while evaluating private entities for the purpose of public tenders, and
giving them appropriate scores or advantage, if their workforce employs defined
percentages of SC/ST or SEBC individuals, etc. too would make a substantial
difference.

II. Contentions of parties
</p><p id="p_1199">74.    The appellants argue that the Maharashtra SEBC Act (which was enacted
and brought into force on 30.11.2018), could not have been enacted, and is clearly
void. It is argued that on a plain reading of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1043">Article 342A</a> read with <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1044">Article
366(26C</a>), it is clear that States were denuded of their power to identify backward
classes and the task was to be performed exclusively by the National Commission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_407">                                                         45</span>


for Backward Classes set up under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1045">Article 338B (hereafter “NCBC”).</a> Mr. Arvind
Datar, Mr. Shyam Divan and Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel
emphasized that the expression “for the purposes of this Constitution” under
<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1046">Article 366(26C)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1047">Article 342A(1)</a> can only imply that the States’ jurisdiction
and power to identify a community as a backward class stood denuded.
Consequently, it is only upon the recommendation of the NCBC that any
community can henceforth be included in the list of SEBCs. It was submitted that
by virtue of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1048">Article 342A</a>, even the Union or the Central Government ceases to
have any power to modify, add to or delete from the list so notified under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1049">Article
342A(1).</a> It is Parliament alone which can make such modification, deletion or
alteration. The term ‘Central List’ in <a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_1050">Article 342(2)</a> is not the list published by the
Union for the affairs of the Union. The Constitution has used the word “Union”
wherever the reference is made to the Government of India or Central Government,
i.e., Articles 53, 73, 79, 309, List I of Schedule VII whereas the word ‘Central
Government’ has been used recently in certain amendments which is not the
expression used in the Constitution originally adopted. Thus, the reference to
“Central List” means only the List in relation to states and union territories, for the
purpose of the Constitution notified under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1051">Article 342A (1).</a>
</p><p id="p_1200">75. Learned senior counsel argued that the decision in Indra Sawhney (supra)77
had required the setting up of permanent Commissions for identifying communities
or castes such as backward classes to enable their notification by their respective
governments. In the light of this recommendation and having regard to the
principal existing provision under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1052">Article 340</a>, Parliament had enacted the National
Commission for <a href="/doc/637725/" id="a_1053">Backward Classes Act</a>, 1993 (hereafter “the NCBC Act”). That
enactment used the expression, “Central list” in <a href="/doc/948118/" id="a_1054">Section 2(c)</a><a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1055">78</a>.
77Paras 847, 855 (c) and 859 (13)- SCC report.
78Defined as “lists” means lists prepared by the Government of India from time to time for purposes of making
provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of backward classes of citizens which, in the opinion
of that Government, are not adequately represented in the services under the Government of India and any local or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_408">                                                         46</span>


</p><p id="p_1201">76.      Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that while amending the
Constitution, the expression “Central List” meant the List to be published by the
President on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, after consultation with
the Governors, i.e., the aid and advice of the State Governments. Thus, having
regard to plain language of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1056">Article 366(26C)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1057">Article 342A</a> as well as the
provisions in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1058">Article 338B (7</a><a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_1059">), (8)</a> and <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_1060">(9</a>), there is no question of the State
Governments or State Legislatures retaining any power to identify backward
classes. That power is with the President.
</p><p id="p_1202">77. It was submitted by Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayan, learned senior counsel that
the object which impelled the Constitution (102 nd<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1061">Amendment) Act</a>, 2018 appears
to be to set up a national body for evolving scientific criteria of uniform
application with regard to the identification of communities as backward classes. It
was submitted that the frequent demands by various communities to be included in
the list of backward classes to garner/gain access to State funded institutions and
for public employment meant that States either succumb to such pressure or apply
ad-hoc criteria and set up ad-hoc bodies which did not or could not consider issues
in a dispassionate and holistic manner. Learned counsel relied upon the decision of
this Court in <a href="/doc/33182715/" id="a_1062">Ram Singh &amp;Ors. v. Union of India</a> (supra) 79 to say that demands
made by such communities led to States providing special reservation, which
became the subject matter of judicial scrutiny.
</p><p id="p_1203">78. Learned counsel also referred to agitations for inclusion of communities in
other States such as Rajasthan which also led to repeated litigation. It was,
other authority within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India;

79“54. The perception of a self-proclaimed socially backward class of citizens or even the perception of the
&quot;advanced classes&quot; as to the social status of the &quot;less fortunates&quot; cannot continue to be a constitutionally
permissible yardstick for determination of backwardness, both in the context of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the
Constitution. Neither can any longer backwardness be a matter of determination on the basis of mathematical
formulae evolved by taking into account social, economic and educational indicators. Determination of
backwardness must also cease to be relative; possible wrong inclusions cannot be the basis for further inclusions
but the gates would be opened only to permit entry of the most distressed. Any other inclusion would be a serious
abdication of the constitutional duty of the State.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_409">                                         47</span>


therefore, argued that to avoid these instances, and to ensure that a national
standard for considering the relevant indicia for backwardness is constitutionally
applied, an amendment to the Constitution was made. Learned counsel urged that
the position adopted by the States, i.e., that they were not denuded of executive and
legislative power and that the amendment only sought to give additional
constitutional status to the existing NCBC is unfounded. It was pointed out that
before the coming into force of the Constitution (102nd<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1063">Amendment) Act</a>, 2018,
<a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1064">Article 340</a> existed under the original Constitution. Parliament, in exercise of its
legislative power, enacted the NCBC Act. The NCBC had existed for 27 years and
had conducted surveys and identified several communities as backward. The lists
published by it were in existence and were in use by the Central Government for its
purposes, including in public employment. Undoubtedly, not all communities
included in the States’ lists were part of the NCBC list. However, the list was
broadly common to a large extent. Learned counsel emphasized that there was no
necessity for bringing any constitutional amendment if the new Commission were
to be given constitutional status and the lists published by it, made binding only on
the Central Government which was to acquire such high degree of status that it
could be modified by Parliament alone. It was submitted that surely, State
interference with the Central list did not warrant such a drastic measure as a
constitutional amendment.
</p><p id="p_1204">79. Mr. Sankaranarayanan submitted that although there are passages in the
report of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, Parliament had discussed the
amendment and taken into account the views of certain individuals; the fact
remains that it is the text of the Constitution as amended, which is to be
interpreted. Learned counsel relied upon the decisions reported as <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_1065">State of
Travancore-Cochin v. Bombay Company Ltd80</a>; Aswini Kumar Ghose &amp;Anr. v.

Arabinda Ghose &amp; Anr.81and <a href="/doc/45852197/" id="a_1066">P.V. Narasimha Rao v. State82</a>. He also referred to the
decision in <a href="/doc/1195357/" id="a_1067">Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. &amp;Anr83.It</a> was
submitted that the consistent opinion of this Court has been the one adopted in
<a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_1068">Pepper v. Hart84</a>, which permits reference to the statements made in the House at
the time of the introduction of Bill as an aid to construction of legislation which is
ambiguous or obscure, and not in any other circumstances. It was thus submitted
that the intention of the amendment was to ensure that a uniform standard and one
aware of looking at backwardness in an objective manner, was to be adopted and
applied, for the purposes of the Constitution. This also was aimed at eliminating
the mischief that led to the introduction of communities as a consequence of
protests – having been triggered by political considerations on the eve of elections.
</p><p id="p_1205">80. The submissions articulated on behalf of the respondent States by Mr. Mukul
Rohatgi, Mr. Kapil Sibal, Dr. A.M. Singhvi and Mr. Naphade, Additional
Advocates General and Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the various
States, was that the interpretation suggested by the appellants is drastic. It was
emphasized that the States’ responsibility under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1069">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1070">16(4)</a> to make
special provisions including reservations is undeniable. In the absence of any
amendment to these provisions, learned counsel submitted that the Constitution
(102nd<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1071">Amendment) Act</a>, 2018 cannot be so interpreted as to denude the States of
their powers altogether. Learned counsel submitted that pursuant to the
recommendations and directions in Indra Sawhney (supra), not only was the
NCBC Act enacted; in addition, different States also set up permanent
commissions to identify communities as backward classes for the purpose of
Constitution. Those Commissions were set up in exercise of legislative powers

traceable to one or the other Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution. The plenary legislative power of the States remains unaltered. That
being the case, this Court should not accept the appellants’ submission that Articles
338B and 342A place fetters upon the exercise of such legislative power as well as
executive power of the States.
</p><p id="p_1209">81. Learned counsel submitted that this Court should closely examine the
contents of the report of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, and the
statements made by the Government, particularly that the power and jurisdiction of
the States would remain unaffected. It was further urged that this Court can and
should and ought to have looked into the contents of these reports to discern the
true meaning and intent behind the Constitution (One Hundred and <a href="/doc/402812/" id="a_1072">Second
Amendment) Act</a>, 2018, which was not to disrupt the existing legislative
arrangement between the Centre and the State. In this regard, learned counsel
placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/9416991/" id="a_1073">Kalpana Mehta and Ors. v.
Union of India and Ors</a>.85,and submitted that the Court can take aid of reports of
Parliamentary Committees for the purpose of appreciating the historical
background of statutory provisions, and also to resolve the ambiguity in the
legislation.
</p><p id="p_1210">82. It was submitted that if the matter were to be considered in the true
perspective and the report of the Select Committee, examined as an aid to
interpretation of the Constitution (102nd<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1074">Amendment) Act</a>, 2018, especially <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1075">Article
342A</a>, it would be apparent that the Parliament never intended, by the amendment,
to disturb the existing order and denude the States of their executive or legislative
power to identity backward classes while making special provisions under Articles
15(4) and 16(4). It was submitted that Indra Sawhney (supra) only created a larger
movement for the setting-up of Commissions by the Union and the States. Learned
counsel emphasized that even while identifying the communities for the purpose of
85(2018) 7 SCC 1

the Central List, the views of the States were always ascertained. Parliament
merely sought to replicate the amendment by which collection of data has been
undertaken under <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1076">Article 338 (in relation to SCs).</a> The introduction of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1077">Article 338B</a>
was in line with the introduction of Articles 338A and 338 – which enables the
setting-up of National Commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes(the latter through another amendment which was brought into force on
19.02.2004).
</p><p id="p_1211">83. It was submitted that Articles 366(26C), 338B and 342A(1) have to,
therefore, be read harmoniously in the light of the expression “Central List” which
occurs in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1078">Article 342A(2).</a> This would be in keeping with the debates and
assurances held out in the Select Committee report that States’ power would
continue to remain unaffected. It was submitted that such construction would result
in a harmonious interpretation of all provisions of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1212">84. The learned Attorney General, appearing on account of notice issued by this
Court, urged that the 102nd Amendment did not bring about a radical change in the
power of identification of backward classes, in relation to states, and that this
power continues to remain with states. He submitted that the comparison by the
appellants, with the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1079">Article 338</a> and the Presidential power
under <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_1080">Article 341</a> and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1081">Article 342</a>, is inapt, because those were original provisions
of the Constitution, having a historical background. It was submitted that the states’
responsibilities to uplift the lot of weaker sections, apparent from the directive
principle under <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_1082">Article 46</a>, is through affirmative policies under Articles 15(4) and
16(4). To alter this balance, which had existed from the beginning of the coming
into force of the Constitution, is too drastic, and nothing in the debates leading to
the 102nd Amendment, or in any material, such as the Select Committee Report,
suggests that end.
</p><p id="p_1213">85. The learned Attorney General also submitted that the object of the 102 nd
amendment was to ensure that a commission with constitutional status would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_413">                                           51</span>


periodically examine the needs of socially and educationally backward classes
(“SEBC” hereafter), and suggest inclusion or exclusion of such classes, in a list for
the purposes of Central Government, or central public sector corporation
employment, and extension of other benefits under union educational and other
institutions, under Articles 15 (4) and 16 (4). In case such a list is drawn and
published under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1083">Article 342A (1</a>), it is only Parliament that has the power to
modify it. This does not, in any manner disturb or take away the states’ power to
identify or include communities as backward classes of citizens for the purposes of
benefits that they wish to extend to them, through state policies and legislation, or
for reservation in state employment under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1084">Article 16 (4).</a> He highlighted that the
term “Unless the context otherwise requires” is the controlling phrase, which
precedes the definition of various terms under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1085">Article 366</a> of the Constitution.
Therefore, if the context is different- as is evident from <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1086">Article 342A (2</a>), by the use
of the term “Central List”, that should be given meaning, and the interpretation
based on that meaning should prevail in the construction of the entire provision
(i.e. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1087">Article 342A</a>).
</p><p id="p_1214">86. The learned Attorney General further argued that this court had specifically
recognized the states’ power to identify, make special provisions, and reservations,
in Indra Sawhney. He urged that the 102nd Amendment was not meant to limit this
constitutional obligation of the states, but rather to streamline the method of
identification of socially and educationally backward class of citizens, for the
purpose of central employment, and centrally funded and sponsored schemes,
institutions and facilities. It was urged that this is apparent from the use of the
expression “Central List” in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1088">Article 342A (2</a>), which has to guide the interpretation
of the list referred to in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1089">Article 342A (1).</a>

III. Provisions relating to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, in the
Constitution of India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_414">                                                        52</span>


</p><p id="p_1215">87.     Before proceeding with the interpretation of the provisions of the 102 nd
Amendment, it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the provisions that existed
for the identification of SCs and STs. Before the Constitution was framed, the
Government of India Act, by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1090">Section 26</a> defined SCs 86. One Dr. J.H. Hutton, a
Census Commissioner of India, framed a list of the depressed classes
systematically, and that list was made the basis of an order promulgated by the
British Government in India called the Government of India (Scheduled Castes)
Order, 1936. This court, in one of its decisions noticed that such list became the
basis for the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950.87 <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1091">Article 338</a> as
originally enacted, provided for appointment of a special officer for the SCs and
STs to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the SCs and
STs under the Constitution and to report to the President on their working. In 1990,
this position changed, and the Constitution (Sixty Fifth) Amendment Act was
enacted to create a five-member commission under <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1092">Article 338.</a> The statement of
objects88 envisioned that such a commission would be

       “a more effective arrangement in respect of the constitutional
       safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes than a single
       Special Officer as at present. It is also felt that it is necessary to
       elaborate the functions of the said Commission so as to cover
       measures that should be taken by the Union or any State for the
       effective implementation of those safeguards and other measures for
       the protection, welfare and socio-economic development of the
       Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.”
</p><p id="p_1216">88.     The composite Commission for SCs and STs was bifurcated by another
amendment- the Constitution (Eighty Ninth Amendment) Act, 2003, which inserted

86&quot; the scheduled castes &quot; means such castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes,
being castes, races, tribes, parts or groups, which appear to His Majesty in Council to correspond to the classes of
persons formerly known as &quot; the depressed classes&quot;, as His Majesty in Council may specify”

commissions were set up at the national level, to examine and make suitable
recommendations in respect of identification of other backward classes. These
were the Kaka Kalelkar Commission90 and the B.P. Mandal Commission91. The
Kalelkar Commission, after an exhaustive survey and study, through its report,
identified 2399 backward groups and recommended several measures for their
advancement, as steps that could be taken by the Union and the states. The Mandal
Commission report identified individuals belonging to 3,743 different castes and
communities, as “backward”.

</p><p id="p_1256">91.    The consistent view while interpreting Articles 341 and 342 has been that
the power which the Constitution conferred is initially upon the President, who,
after the introduction of the 65 th and 89th Amendments and the insertion of Articles
338 and 338A, is aided in the task of identification of the SCs and STs, by two
separate Commissions, to include or exclude members claiming to be SCs or STs.
The view of this Court has been that once a determination has been done, no court
can, by interpretive process, or even the executive through its policies, include
members of other communities as falling within a particular class or described
community or even in any manner extend the terms of the determination under
Articles 341 or 342. The power to further include, or modify contents of the
existing list (of SC/STs) is with Parliament only [by reason of Article341 (2) and
<a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_1112">Article 342 (2)]</a> This position has been consistently followed in a series of
decisions. Likewise, in the interpretation as to which communities are categorized
as SCs or STs, this Court has been definite, i.e. that only such classes or
communities who specifically fall within one or the other lists, that constitute SCs
or such STs for the purpose of this Constitution under <a href="/doc/382320/" id="a_1113">Article 366(24)</a> and <a href="/doc/924700/" id="a_1114">Article
366 (25).</a> This has been established in the decision of this Court in Bhaiya

      against the constitutional mandate under Articles 341 and 342 of the
      Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_1263">      38. It is an unquestionable principle of interpretation that interrelated
      statutory as well as constitutional provisions have to be harmoniously
      construed and understood so as to avoid making any provision
      nugatory and redundant. If the list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled
      Tribes in the Presidential Orders under Articles 341/342 is subject to
      alteration only by laws made by Parliament, operation of the lists of
      Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes beyond the classes or
      categories enumerated under the Presidential Order for a particular
      State/Union Territory by exercise of the enabling power vested by
      <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1118">Article 16(4)</a>would have the obvious effect of circumventing the
      specific constitutional provisions in Articles 341/342. In this regard, it
      must also be noted that the power under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1119">Article 16(4)</a> is not only
      capable of being exercised by a legislative provision/enactment but
      also by an Executive Order issued under <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_1120">Article 166</a> of the
      Constitution. It will, therefore, be in consonance with the
      constitutional scheme to understand the enabling provision under
      <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1121">Article 16(4)</a> to be available to provide reservation only to the classes
      or categories of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes enumerated in the
      Presidential Orders for a particular State/Union Territory within the
      geographical area of that State and not beyond. If in the opinion of a
      State it is necessary to extend the benefit of reservation to a
      class/category of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes beyond those
      specified in the Lists for that particular State, constitutional discipline
      would require the State to make its views in the matter prevail with the
      central authority so as to enable an appropriate parliamentary
      exercise to be made by an amendment of the Lists of Scheduled
      Castes/Scheduled Tribes for that particular State. Unilateral action by
      States on the touchstone of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1122">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution could be a
      possible trigger point of constitutional anarchy and therefore must be
      held to be impermissible under the Constitution.”
VI.    Pre-102nd Amendment position in the Constitution in relation to SEBCs
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_423">                                         61</span>


</p><p id="p_1264">92.    The original Constitution did not contain any special provision of like
manner as Articles 341 and 342. It did not define SEBCs. The only reference to
SEBCs was in <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1123">Article 340</a>, which enabled the Central Government to setup a
Commission for recommending measures for the progress and upliftment of
backward classes of citizens. That provision is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_323">      “340. Appointment of a Commission to investigate the conditions of
      backward classes
      (1) The President may by order appoint a Commission consisting of
      such persons as he thinks fit to investigate the conditions of socially
      and educationally backward classes within the territory of India and
      the difficulties under which they labour and to make recommendations
      as to the steps that should be taken by the Union or any State to
      remove such difficulties and to improve their condition and as to the
      grants that should be made for the purpose by the Union or any State
      the conditions subject to which such grants should be made, and the
      order appointing such Commission shall define the procedure to be
      followed by the Commission
      (2) A Commission so appointed shall investigate the matters referred
      to them and present to the President a report setting out the facts as
      found by them and making such recommendations as they think proper
      (3) The President shall cause a copy of the report so presented
      together with a memorandum explaining the action taken thereon to
      be laid before each House of Parliament”
</blockquote><p id="p_1265">93.    After the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1806386/" id="a_1124">Champakam Dorairajan v. State of
Madras96, Article</a> 15 was amended and <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1125">Article 15 (4)</a> was introduced. The term
“socially and educationally backward class of citizens” was inserted, conferring
power upon the State to make special provisions for their advancement. This term
“socially and educationally backward” has been held to also provide colour the
term “backward class” in the decision in Indra Sawhney – as indeed in the earlier
decision in NM Thomas (supra). This court noticed that ‘backward class’ of

which also results in educational backwardness.
</p><p id="p_1267">94. Indra Sawhney in para 859 (13)97, had issued directions with regard to the
desirability of setting up Commissions by the Central and State Governments, to
ascertain the position and identification of backward class of citizens, evaluation of
rational criteria and periodic review of such lists. Pursuant to this direction,
Parliament introduced the NCBC Act, 1993. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1126">This Act</a> defined ‘Central List’ under
<a href="/doc/948118/" id="a_1127">Section 2(c)</a>. The terms of this enactment make it clear that the lists of backward
class of citizens prepared by the Commission and recommended to the Central
Government were to be for the purposes of providing reservations in employment
under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1128">Article 16(4</a>), and for reservations and other ameliorate measures that the
Central Government can initiate and introduce under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1129">Article 15(4).</a> Acting on the
recommendations of this court, post Indra Sawhney, several State Governments
appeared to have enacted other laws for setting up commissions for backward class
and backward caste groups98. In four States – Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Punjab and
Haryana, the Commissions were set up by executive action.

<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1130">Article 366(26C</a>), <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1131">Article 338B</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1132">Article 342A.</a> The Statement of Objects and
Reasons for the introduction of these provisions – referred to compendiously as the
102nd Amendment – do not indicate any concrete purpose for the insertion of those
provisions, except the general comment that Parliament wished to confer
constitutional status on the Commission for determination of SEBCs.

VII. The Constitution 123rd Amendment Bill, the 102nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1142">Amendment Act</a> and
report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee
</p><p id="p_1270">96.    Learned counsel for the respondents as indeed the appellants referred
extensively to the deliberations recorded in and assurances given, and reflected in
the Report of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, submitted to the
Parliament at the time when the 123 rd amendment bill was introduced. A brief
reference of this can now be made. The introduction (to the Report dated (July
2017) disclosed that in all, seven meetings were held by the Select Committee.
The committee comprised 25 members, with a Secretariat of 7 officials. It took
note of statements made by three representatives of the Ministry of Social Justice,
two from the Department of Legal Affairs and three from the Legislative
Department.
</p><p id="p_1271">97. The Report noted the background of introduction of the 123 rd Amendment
Bill including the amendments to <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1143">Article 338</a> and the introduction of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1144">Article 338B.</a>
It traces the history of the Backward Class Commissions set up under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1145">Article 340</a>,
the office memoranda which led to the Judgment in Indra Sahwney, as well as the
direction by this Court in that Judgment regarding setting up of commissions. It
further noted the existing legal regime i.e., the NCBC Act, and noted that several
experts felt that there was no change or amendment needed to alter the existing
regime for identification of backward classes. In Para 20 of the Report, it was
noted that in the Fifth Consultation Meeting, the members had raised the concern
as to whether <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1146">Article 342A(1)</a> would exclude state consultation. The relevant para
reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_324">      “18. It was also submitted that the powers and functions of the State
      Government and the State Backward Classes Commissions with
      regard to identification, exclusion and inclusion of classes in the State
      List should be clarified. Further, the process of consultation with the
      Governor should also be clarified in the Bill.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_426">                                          64</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_325">      19. In response to the above issues raised, the Ministry clarified that
      sub-clause (9) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1147">article 338B</a> does not in any way interfere with the
      powers of the State Governments to prepare their own list. The
      Committee was further informed that classes so included in the State
      Backward Classes List do not automatically come in the Central List
      of OBCs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_326">      20. In its fifth meeting representatives/Members raised a concern
      about clause (1) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1148">Article 342A</a>, whether the list would be issued by
      the President after consultation with the State Government or
      consultation with only Governor of the State. It was clarified by the
      Ministry that clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_1149">Article 154</a> and <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_1150">Article 163</a> of the
      Constitution clearly state that the Governor shall act on the advice of
      the Council of Ministers. It is also clarified that under the above
      Constitutional provisions, the Governor shall exercise his authority
      either directly or indirectly through officers of respective State
      Government. <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_1151">Article 341</a> of Constitution provides for consultation
      with Governor of State with respect to Scheduled Castes and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1152">Article
      342</a> of the Constitution provides consultation of President with
      Governor of State in respect of Scheduled Tribes. As is the practice,
      at not time has the State Government been excluded in the
      consultation process. It is always invariably the State Government
      which recommends to the President the category of
      inclusion/exclusion in Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
      Similar provision is provided for in the case of conferring of
      constitutional status for backward classes for inclusion in Central list
      of socially and educationally backward classes. Consultation with
      Governor thereby implies consultation with the State Government.”
</blockquote><p id="p_1272">98.    In its clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill, the Committee noted the
apprehension with respect to setting up of a new Commission in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1153">Article 342B</a>
instead of creating it under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1154">Article 340.</a> In this context, a clarification was issued
that <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1155">Article 340</a> enabled setting up of adhoc bodies like the Kaka Kalelkar
Commission and Mandal Commission, whereas <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1156">Article 338B</a> sought to confer
Constitutional status on a multi-member permanent body. Paras 31-34 of the
Report discussed the membership of the composition of the Commission under
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1157">Article 338B</a> and also whether the NCBC Act would be repealed. Interestingly,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_427">                                         65</span>


Para 47 reflects the discussion regarding an amendment by which new Sub-<a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_1158">Article
10</a> was proposed to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1159">Article 338B.</a> It read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_327">      “47. The Committee discussed the amendment wherein in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1160">article 338B</a>
      a new sub-clause (10) was proposed to be inserted. This sub-clause
      (10) would read as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_328">      ‘Notwithstanding anything provided in clause 9, the State Government
      shall continue to have powers to identify Socially and Educationally
      Backward Classes’.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1273">99.    The Committee was satisfied, in the Report with the clarification issued by
the concerned Ministry in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_329">      “48. It was clarified by the Ministry of Social Justice and
      Empowerment to the Committee that the proposed amendment does
      not interfere with the powers of the State Governments to identify the
      Socially and Educationally Backward Classes. The existing powers of
      the State Backward Classes Commission would continue to be there
      even after the passage of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-
      third Amendment) Bill, 2017.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1274">100. Para 50-53 (of the Report) set out proposals to amend <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1161">Article 342A</a> which
limited it to making provisions for reservations in appointments or posts under the
Government of India or under the authority of the Government of India and also
consequential amendment to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1162">Article 342A (2).</a> Further, a proposed <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1163">Article 342A(3)</a>
sought to empower the State Government - i.e. the Governor which could by public
notification, specify SEBCs for the purposes of reservation of posts under the State
or under any authority of the State. A like amendment was proposed, i.e., <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1164">Article

<p id="p_1275">101. The other set of amendments discussed were firstly, to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1165">Article 342A(1)</a> that
with respect to a State or Union Territory, the President could make inclusions
“with prior recommendation of the State Government, given due regard to such

enabling the State to issue public notifications - like in the case of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1168">Article 342A(1)</a>

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1169">Article 342A (4).</a>
</p><p id="p_1276">102. Other amendments with respect to placing the report of the Commission
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1170">Article 338B</a> before both Houses of Parliament, consultation with the
governor to be based upon advice given to the governor by the state commission
for backward classes, and amendment of the list under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1171">Article 342A (1)</a> being only
through a law based upon recommendations of the Commission under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1172">Article 338A</a>

suggested.

<blockquote id="blockquote_332">     55. The Ministry clarified that the aspect of reservation of posts under
     that State or under any other authority of the State or under the

     State was beyond the purview of the instant Bill and hence the
     amendments proposed are not allowed.

    consultation by the President with Governor of State in respect of
    Scheduled Tribes. As is the practice at no time has the State
    Government been excluded in the consultation process. It is always
    invariably the State Government which recommends to the President
    the category of inclusion /exclusion in Scheduled Castes and
    Scheduled Tribes. Similar provision is provided for in the case of
    conferring of constitutional status for backward classes for inclusion
    in Central list of SEBC. Consultation with Governor thereby implies
    consultation with the State Government.

    retrograde to the interest of the socially and educationally backward

     Commission for Scheduled Tribes may be taken into consideration.
     The Committee is of the view that while framing the rules for
     composition of the proposed Commission and selection of its
     Chairperson it should be ensured that the persons belonging to
     socially and educationally backward classes be given due
     representation to inspire confidence amongst the socially and
     educationally backward classes. It may further be ensured that at
     least one-woman member is part of the Commission.</blockquote><p id="p_1280">

VIII Extrinsic aids to interpretation of statutes: the extent to which they can be
relied upon

</p><p id="p_1282">106. The parties presented rival submissions with respect to interpretation of the
words of the statute in the light of the reports of the Select Committee report as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_431">                                                         69</span>


well as the debates in Parliament at the time of introduction of the amendment, or
the law as enacted. The appellants asserted that such debates are of limited
assistance only as external aids in the case of an ambiguity and had relied upon a
line of decisions starting with <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_1184">State of Travancore-Cochin v. Bombay Trading
Company</a> (supra) and culminating in P.V. Narasimha Rao (supra). On the other
hand, the respondent States alluded to the larger bench decision of this Court in
Kalpana Mehta (supra) which emphatically held that Standing Committee reports
and statements made on the floor of House can be limited extrinsic aids for
considering and interpreting express terms of a statute, or even the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1283">107. In the present case, the Statement of Objects and Reasons do not throw
much light on why the provisions of the 102nd<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1185">Amendment Act</a> were introduced. No
doubt, there are certain passages in the Select Committee Report suggestive of the
fact that the power of identification carved out through the newly inserted Articles
338B and 342A would not in any manner disturb the powers of the State to carry
on their work in relation to special provisions or reservations for backward classes
(through appropriate measures, be it legislative or executive). A holistic reading of
the report also suggests that the Select Committee reflected both points of view and
recorded the assurances given by the Ministry that the State’s power would not be
disturbed. At the same time, in conclusion, it was emphatically stated that the
States’ concerns would be given due regard and that the exercise would be in line
with the existing procedure under Articles 341 and 342.99 The report also contains
notes of dissent, which highlight that the amendments would deprive the States of
their existing power to identify, and provide reservations and other special
provisions for the benefit of SEBCs.
</p>
<p id="p_1284">99“57. The Ministry also clarified to the Committee that the phrase “for the purpose of this Constitution” as
provided under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1186">article 342A</a> is on lines similar to articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution. The setting
up of the proposed Commission will not be retrograde to the interest of the socially and educationally backward
classes. The <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1187">article 342A</a> will provide for a comprehensive examination of each case of inclusion/exclusion from the
Central List. The ultimate power for such inclusion/exclusion would stand vested with the Parliament.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_432">                                           70</span>


</p><p id="p_1285">108. There cannot be a disagreement with the proposition that where the
provisions of the statute or its wordings are ambiguous, the first attempt should be
to find meaning, through internal aids, in the statute itself. Failing this, it is open to
the court to find meaning, and resolve the ambiguity, by turning to external aids,
which include the statements of objects and reasons, as well as Parliamentary
reports, or debates in Parliament. To this Court, it appears that the task of
interpreting the provisions of 102ndAmendment does not begin by relying on
external aids such as Statement of Objects and Reasons (which throw practically
no light on the meaning of the provisions), or even the Select Committee Report.
The task of interpretation is first to consider the overall scheme of the provisions,
and secondly, after considering the provision, proceed to resolve any perceived
ambiguity, if found, by resorting to aids within the statute. It is at the third stage,
when such resolution is impossible, that external aids are to be looked into. Thus,
in a seven-judge bench decision, this court, in <a href="/doc/184521/" id="a_1188">State of Karnataka v. Union</a> of
India100administered the following caution, while outlining the court’s task of
interpreting the Constitution:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_343">      “The dynamic needs of the nation, which a Constitution must fulfil,
      leave no room for merely pedantic hair-splitting play with words or
      semantic quibblings. This, however, does not mean that the Courts,
      acting under the guise of a judicial power, which certainly extends to
      even making the Constitution, in the sense that they may supplement it
      in those parts of it where the letter of the Constitution is silent or may
      leave room for its development by either ordinary legislation or
      judicial interpretation, can actually nullify, defeat, or distort the
      reasonably clear meaning of any part of the Constitution in order to
      give expression to some theories of their own about the broad or basic
      scheme of the Constitution. The theory behind the Constitution which
      can be taken into account for purposes of interpretation, by going
      even so far as to fill what have been called the &quot;interstices&quot; or spaces
      left unfilled, due perhaps to some deliberate vagueness or

1001978 (2) SCR 1.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_433">                                          71</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_344">      indefiniteness in the letter of the Constitution, must itself be gathered
      from express provisions of the Constitution. The dubiousness of
      expressions used may be cured by Court by making their meanings
      clear and definite if necessary in the light of the broad and basic
      purposes set before themselves by the Constitution makers. And, these
      meanings may, in keeping with the objectives or ends which the
      Constitution of every nation must serve, change with changing
      requirements of the times. The power of judicial interpretation, even if
      it includes what may be termed as &quot;interstitial&quot; law making, cannot
      extend to direct conflict with express provisions of the Constitution or
      to ruling them out of existence.”
</blockquote><p id="p_1286">109. The primary duty of this court, while interpreting a constitutional
provision(in the present case, an amendment to the Constitution, no less) was
underlined thus, in <a href="/doc/1608984/" id="a_1189">GVK Industries Ltd. v. Income Tax Officer101</a>

      “37. In interpreting any law, including the Constitution, the text of the
      provision under consideration would be the primary source for
      discerning the meanings that inhere in the enactment. However, in
      light of the serious issues it would always be prudent, as a matter of
      constitutional necessity, to widen the search for the true meaning,
      purport and ambit of the provision under consideration. No provision,
      and indeed no word or expression, of the Constitution exists in
      isolation—they are necessarily related to, transforming and in turn
      being transformed by, other provisions, words and phrases in the
      Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_1287">      38. Our Constitution is both long and also an intricate matrix of
      meanings, purposes and structures. It is only by locating a particular
      constitutional provision under consideration within that constitutional
      matrix could one hope to be able to discern its true meaning, purport
      and ambit. As Prof. Laurence Tribe points out:
      “[T]o understand the Constitution as a legal text, it is essential to
      recognize the … sort of text it is: a constitutive text that purports, in
      the name of the people…, to bring into being a number of distinct but
      inter-related institutions and practices, at once legal and political,
      and to define the rules governing those institutions and practices.”

</p><p id="p_1289">      (See Reflections on Free-Form Method in Constitutional
      Interpretation. [108 Harv L Rev 1221, 1235 (1995)]).”

</p><p id="p_1290">     39. It has been repeatedly appreciated by this Court that our
     Constitution is one of the most carefully drafted ones, where every
     situation conceivable, within the vast experience, expertise and
     knowledge of our framers, was considered, deliberated upon, and
     appropriate features and text chosen to enable the organs of the State
     in discharging their roles. While indeed dynamic interpretation is
     necessary, if the meaning necessary to fit the changed circumstances
     could be found in the text itself, we would always be better served by
     treading a path as close as possible to the text, by gathering the plain
     ordinary meaning, and by sweeping our vision and comprehension
     across the entire document to see whether that meaning is validated
     by the constitutional values and scheme.”
In examining provisions of the Constitution, courts should adopt the primary rule,
and give effect to the plain meaning of the expressions; this rule can be departed,
only when there are ambiguities. <a href="/doc/1903935/" id="a_1190">In Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India</a> 102 after
quoting from <a href="/doc/91294/" id="a_1191">G. Narayanaswami v. G. Panneerselvam103</a> this court held that

      “201. … We endorse and reiterate the view taken in the above quoted
      paragraph of the judgment. It may be desirable to give a broad and
      generous construction to the constitutional provisions, but while doing
      so the rule of “plain meaning” or “literal” interpretation, which
      remains “the primary rule”, has also to be kept in mind. In fact the
      rule of “literal construction” is the safe rule unless the language used
      is contradictory, ambiguous, or leads really to absurd results.”

</p><p id="p_1291">110. Whilst dealing the task of the court, and the permissible extent to which it
can resort to internal and extrinsic aids to construction of a statute, this court
remarked, in <a href="/doc/1510325/" id="a_1192">Pushpa Devi v. Milkhi</a> Ram104that:
</p><p id="p_1292">      “18. It is true when a word has been defined in the interpretation

</p><p id="p_1296">       in the body of the statute unless the context requires otherwise. “The
       context”     as    pointed    out    in     the    book Cross-Statutory
       Interpretation (2nd edn. p. 48) “is both internal and external”. The
       internal context requires the interpreter to situate the disputed words
       within the section of which they are part and in relation to the rest of
       the Act. The external context involves determining the meaning from
       ordinary linguistic usage (including any special technical meanings),
       from the purpose for which the provision was passed, and from the
       place of the provisions within the general scheme of statutory and
       common law rules and principles.
</p><p id="p_1297">       19. The opening sentence in the definition of the section states “unless
       there is anything repugnant in the subject or context”. In view of this
       qualification, the court has not only to look at the words but also to
       examine the context and collocation in the light of the object of the
       Act and the purpose for which a particular provision was made by the
       legislature.”

</p><p id="p_1298">111.    Again, in Karnataka State Financial Corporation. v. N. Narasimahaiah105it
was observed that:
</p>
       “42. Interpretation of a statute would not depend upon a contingency.<p id="p_1299">
</p><p id="p_1300">       It has to be interpreted on its own. It is a trite law that the court would
       ordinarily take recourse to the golden rule of literal interpretation. It
       is not a case where we are dealing with a defect in the legislative
       drafting. We cannot presume any. In a case where a court has to
       weigh between a right of recovery and protection of a right, it would
       also lean in favour of the person who is going to be deprived
       therefrom. It would not be the other way round. Only because a
       speedy remedy is provided for that would itself (sic not) lead to the
       conclusion that the provisions of the Act have to be extended although
       the statute does not say so. The object of the Act would be a relevant
       factor for interpretation only when the language is not clear and when
       two meanings are possible and not in a case where the plain language
       leads to only one conclusion.”

       “The Constitution is a logical whole, each provision of which is an
       integral part thereof, and it is, therefore, logically proper, and indeed
       imperative, to construe one part in the light of the provisions of the
       other parts.”

       “28. In considering the validity of a constitutional amendment the
       changing and the changed circumstances that compelled the
       amendment are important criteria. The observations of the U.S.
       Supreme Court in Maxwell v. Dow [176 US 581 : 44 L Ed 597, 605
       (1899)] are worthy of note: (L Ed p. 605)
       “… to read its language in connection with the known condition of
       affairs out of which the occasion for its adoption may have arisen,
       and then to construe it, if there be therein any doubtful expressions, in
       a way so far as is reasonably possible, to forward the known purpose
       or object for which the amendment was adopted ….”

</p><p id="p_1311">115. Recollecting these principles, this court is mindful of the first circumstance
that the 102ndAmendment brought in an entirely new dimension - an attempt to
identify backward classes, firstly by inserting Sub-<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1201">Article (26C)</a> into the definition
clause under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1202">Article 366.</a> This insertion, in the opinion of the court, accords with
the statutory scheme of defining terms for the purposes of the Constitution. This
term “for the purposes of this Constitution” occurs twelve times111 in the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1312">116. The interpretation of the definition in relation to the Constitution, is truly
indicative that for the purpose of the entire constitution, the meaning ascribed in
the definition clause – in this case, by <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1203">Article 366 (26C</a>), has to prevail. While
interpreting whether members of SCs/ STs who communities find mention in the
Presidential notification in two states, could claim reservation benefits in both
states, this court had occasion to consider a parimateria provision, i.e. Articles 366

     where Venkatarama Aiyer, J. reiterated that the rule of construction is
     well settled and where there are in an enactment two provisions which
     cannot be reconciled with each other, these should be so interpreted
     that, if possible, effect could be given to both. It, however, appears to
     us that the expression ‘for the purposes of this Constitution’ in <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_1206">Article
     341</a> as well as in <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1207">Article 342</a> do imply that the Scheduled Caste and
     the Scheduled Tribes so specified would be entitled to enjoy all the
     constitutional rights that are enjoyable by all the citizens as such.</blockquote><p id="p_1313">
</p><p id="p_1314">     Constitutional right, e.g., it has been argued that right to migration or
     right to move from one part to another is a right given to all — to
     Scheduled Castes or Tribes and to non-scheduled castes or tribes. But
     when a Scheduled Caste or Tribe migrates, there is no inhibition in
     migrating but when he migrates, he does not and cannot carry any
     special rights or privileges attributed to him or granted to him in the
     original State specified for that State or area or part thereof. If that
     right is not given in the migrated State it does not interfere with his
     constitutional right of equality or of migration or of carrying on his
     trade, business or profession. Neither <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1208">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_1209">, 16</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_1210">, 19</a> nor <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1211">Article 21</a>
     is denuded by migration but he must enjoy those rights in accordance
     with the law if they are otherwise followed in the place where he
     migrates. There should be harmonious construction, harmonious in
1121990 SCC (3) 130.

the sense that both parts or all parts of a constitutional provision
should be so read that one part does not become nugatory to the other
or denuded to the other but all parts must be read in the context in
which these are used. It was contended that the only way in which the
fundamental rights of the petitioner under Articles 14, 19(1)(d), 19(1)
</p><p id="p_1316">(e) and 19(1)(f) could be given effect to is by construing <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1212">Article 342</a> in
a manner by which a member of a Scheduled Tribe gets the benefit of
that status for the purposes of the Constitution throughout the
territory of India. It was submitted that the words “for the purposes of
this Constitution” must be given full effect. There is no dispute about
that. The words “for the purposes of this Constitution” must mean
that a Scheduled Caste so designated must have right under Articles
14, 19(1)(d), 19(1)(e) and 19(1)(f) inasmuch as these are applicable
to him in his area where he migrates or where he goes. The expression
“in relation to that State” would become nugatory if in all States the
special privileges or the rights granted to Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled Tribes are carried forward. It will also be inconsistent with
the whole purpose of the scheme of reservation. In Andhra Pradesh, a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe may require protection because
a boy or a child who grows in that area is inhibited or is at
disadvantage. In Maharashtra that caste or that tribe may not be so
inhibited but other castes or tribes might be. If a boy or a child goes
to that atmosphere of Maharashtra as a young boy or a child and
goes in a completely different atmosphere or Maharashtra where this
inhibition or this disadvantage is not there, then he cannot be said to
have that reservation which will denude the children or the people of
Maharashtra belonging to any segment of that State who may still
require that protection. After all, it has to be borne in mind that the
protection is necessary for the disadvantaged castes or tribes of
Maharashtra as well as disadvantaged castes or tribes of Andhra
Pradesh. Thus, balancing must be done as between those who need
protection and those who need no protection, i.e., who belong to
advantaged castes or tribes and who do not. Treating the
determination under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution to be
valid for all over the country would be in negation to the very purpose
and scheme and language of <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_1213">Article 341</a> read with <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1214">Article 15(4)</a> of the
Constitution.

<p id="p_1317">14. Our attention was drawn to certain observations in <a href="/doc/131048455/" id="a_1215">Elizabeth
Warburton v. James Loveland</a> [1832 HL 499] . It is true that all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_441">                                           79</span>


     provisions should be read harmoniously. It is also true that no
     provision should be so read as to make other provisions nugatory or
     restricted. But having regard to the purpose, it appears to us that
     harmonious construction enjoins that we should give to each
     expression —”in relation to that State” or “for the purposes of this
     Constitution” — its full meaning and give their full effect. This must
     be so construed that one must not negate the other. The construction
     that reservation made in respect of the Scheduled Caste or Tribe of
     that State is so determined to be entitled to all the privileges and
     rights under the Constitution in that State would be the most correct
     way of reading, consistent with the language, purpose and scheme of
     the Constitution. Otherwise, one has to bear in mind that if
     reservations to those who are treated as Scheduled Caste or Tribe in
     Andhra Pradesh are also given to a boy or a girl who migrates and
     gets deducted (sic inducted) in the State of Maharashtra or other
     States where that caste or tribe is not treated as Scheduled Caste or
     Scheduled Tribe then either reservation will have the effect of
     depriving the percentage to the member of that caste or tribe in
     Maharashtra who would be entitled to protection or it would denude
     the other non-Scheduled Castes or non-Scheduled Tribes in
     Maharashtra to the proportion that they are entitled to. This cannot
     be logical or correct result designed by the Constitution.”

</p><p id="p_1318">117. This Constitution Bench decision was followed in another decision, again by
five judges in Action     Committee     on      Issue   of   Caste   Certificate   to

<blockquote id="blockquote_349">     “16. We may add that considerations for specifying a particular caste
     or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes/Schedule
     Tribes or backward classes in a given State would depend on the

    nomenclature is specified in two States but the considerations on the
    basis of which they have been specified may be totally different. So
    also the degree of disadvantages of various elements which constitute
    the input for specification may also be totally different. Therefore,
    merely because a given caste is specified in State A as a Scheduled
    Caste does not necessarily mean that if there be another caste bearing
    the same nomenclature in another State the person belonging to the
    former would be entitled to the rights, privileges and benefits
    admissible to a member of the Scheduled Caste of the latter State “for
    the purposes of this Constitution”. This is an aspect which has to be
    kept in mind and which was very much in the minds of the
    Constitution-makers as is evident from the choice of language of
    Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution.”

</p><p id="p_1322">118. The recent judgment in <a href="/doc/50417182/" id="a_1217">Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board</a> (supra) reiterated the

previous two Constitution Bench judgments. It is useful to notice the partly
concurring judgment of Bhanumati, J. who observed that

    “80. Clause (24) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1218">Article 366</a> defines “Scheduled Castes” and
    clause (25) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1219">Article 366</a> defines “Scheduled Tribes”. The latter
    means
    “such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such
    tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1220">Article 342</a> to be
    “Scheduled Tribes” for the purposes of this Constitution”.
</p><p id="p_1323">    81. <a href="/doc/281651/" id="a_1221">Article 341(1)</a> of the Constitution empowers the President, in
    consultation with the Governor of the State concerned, to specify
    Scheduled Castes by public notification. Equally, <a href="/doc/1874527/" id="a_1222">Article 342(1)</a> of the
    Constitution empowers the President
    “with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State,
    after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification,
    specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within
    tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of this
    Constitution be deemed to be “Scheduled Tribes” in relation to that
    State or Union Territory, as the case may be”.

    <a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_1223">Article 342(2)</a> of the Constitution empowers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_443">                                          81</span>


       “Parliament, by law, to include in or exclude from the list of
       “Scheduled Tribes” specified in a notification issued under clause (1),
       any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or
       tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the
       said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.”
       Until the Presidential Notification is modified by appropriate
       amendment by Parliament in exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1581845/" id="a_1224">Article
       341(2)</a> of the Constitution, the Presidential Notification issued under
       <a href="/doc/281651/" id="a_1225">Article 341(1)</a> is final and conclusive and any caste or group cannot
       be added to it or subtracted by any action either by the State
       Government or by a court on adducing of evidence. In other words, it
       is the constitutional mandate that the tribes or tribal communities or
       parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities specified
       by the President, after consultation with the Governor in the public
       notification, will be “Scheduled Tribes” subject to the law made by
       Parliament alone, which may, by law, include in or exclude from the
       list of “Scheduled Tribes” specified by the President. Thereafter, it
       cannot be varied except by law made by Parliament.
</p><p id="p_1324">       82. The President of India alone is competent or authorised to issue
       an appropriate notification in terms of Articles 341(1) and 342(1).
       Cumulative reading of Articles 338, 341 and 342 indicate that:
</p><p id="p_1325">       (a) Only the President could notify castes/tribes as Scheduled

       Constitution and shall be exhaustive.
</p><p id="p_1326">       (b) Once a notification is issued under clause (1) of Articles 341 and
       342 of the Constitution, Parliament can by law include in or exclude

       notification, any caste or tribe but save for that limited purpose the

</p><p id="p_1327">119.    These three Constitution Bench judgments, Marri (supra), Action
Committee (supra) and Bir Singh (supra) therefore, have set the tone as it were, for
the manner in which determination by the President is to be interpreted, having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_444">                                          82</span>


regard to the definition clause in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1227">Article 366</a>, which has to apply for interpreting
the particular expression in a consistent manner, for the purpose of the
Constitution. Thus, the expression SCs in relation to a State for the “purpose of
this Constitution”, means the member of a SC declared to be so under the
Presidential Notification. The terms of such Presidential Notification insist that
such a citizen ought to be a resident of that concerned State or Union Territory.
This aspect is of some importance, given that there are a large number of
communities which are common in several States. However, the decisions of this
Court are uniform since Marri (supra) stated that it is only the citizens residing in a
particular state who can claim the benefit of reservation – either of that State or of
the Centre for the purposes of the Constitution in relation to that State. Necessarily,
therefore, the resident of State A is entitled to claim reservation benefits under
Articles 15(4) and 16(4) if he or she resides (the residential qualification that needs
to be fulfilled is that specified by the concerned State) in that State, (i.e. A) and
none else. As a sequitur, if such a person or community or caste (of state A) is also
described as a Scheduled Caste in State B, for the purposes of State services or
admission to State institutions, he cannot claim the benefits of reservation as a
scheduled caste in such B State. However, Bir Singh (supra) has made it clear that
for the purposes of Union employment and admissions to Union institutions the
position is different because SCs living within the territory of India in relation to
one State or the other, are deemed to be SCs or STs for the purposes of this
Constitution in relation for the purposes of Union employment.
</p><p id="p_1328">120. The interpretation of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, read with

Articles 366 (24) and 366 (25), have to, in our opinion, be the guiding factors in
interpreting <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1228">Article 366 (26C</a>), which follows a similar pattern, i.e. of defining, for
the purpose of the entire constitution, with reference to the determination of those

communities who are notified as SEBCs, under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1229">Article 342A (which again uses the
expression “for the purpose of this constitution”).</a>
</p><p id="p_1329">121. Quite similarly, when <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1230">Article 366</a> was amended by the Forty Sixth

amendment Act, and <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1231">Article 366(29A)</a> was introduced to <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1232">Article 366</a>, this Court
considered the previous amendments, which are the 6 thAmendment to the
Constitution and the 46thAmendment which amended <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_1233">Article 269</a> and <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1234">Article 286</a>,
besides introducing Entry 92A to the Union List. The Court went on to hold in a
five-judge bench decision in 20th <a href="/doc/767586/" id="a_1235">Century Finance Corpn. Ltd. v. State of
Maharashtra114</a>, that the interpretation adopted by this Court led to the inexorable
conclusion that a limitation was placed upon the States’ power of taxation. <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1236">Article
366(29A)</a> on the one hand, expanded the specie of sale which could be the
legitimate subject of taxation by the State, but at the same time, on the other hand,
the amendment also introduced limitations upon the State power which was
subjected to controls by Parliament. Therefore, in the context of the amendment the
expression“sale” underwent alteration, partly allowing and partly restricting states’
power to tax goods. This court, after recounting the history of the previous
litigation, held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_350">     “19. Following the decisions referred to above, we are of the view
     that the power of State Legislatures to enact law to levy tax on the
     transfer of right to use any goods under Entry 54 of List II of the
     Seventh Schedule has two limitations — one arising out of the entry
     itself; which is subject to Entry 92-A of List I, and the other flowing
     from the restrictions embodied in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1237">Article 286.</a> By virtue of Entry 92-A
     of List I, Parliament has power to legislate in regard to taxes on sales

     purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
     <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_1238">Article 269</a> provides for levy and collection of such taxes. Because of
     these restrictions, State Legislatures are not competent to enact law
     imposing tax on the transactions of transfer of right to use any goods
     which take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.</blockquote><p id="p_1330">

</p><p id="p_1332">     (a) outside the State; and (b) in the course of import of goods into the

     of the State Legislature by virtue of clause (3) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1240">Article 286.</a> Although
     Parliament has enacted law under clause (3)(a) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1241">Article 286</a> but no

     <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1242">Article 286.</a> When such law is enacted by Parliament, the State
     Legislature would be required to exercise its legislative power in

     limitations on the powers of State Legislatures on levy of sales tax on
     deemed sales envisaged under sub-clause (d) of clause (29-A) of
     <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1243">Article 366</a> of the Constitution.”
</p><p id="p_1333">122. In a similar manner, the expression, “unless the context otherwise
provides”[which is the controlling expression in <a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1244">Article 366(1)]</a> was interpreted by
an earlier Constitution Bench in Builders’ <a href="/doc/1627898/" id="a_1245">Association of India v. Union</a> of
India115when the amendment to <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1246">Article 366</a> was considered:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_351">     “32. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to understand what
     sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1247">Article 366</a> of the Constitution
     means. <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1248">Article 366</a> is the definition clause of the Constitution. It says
     that in the Constitution unless the context otherwise requires, the
     expressions defined in that article have the meanings respectively
     assigned to them in that article. The expression ‘goods’ is defined in
     clause (12) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1249">Article 366</a> of the Constitution as including all
     materials, commodities and articles.”

After discussing the previous decisions in respect of the unamended provisions, the
court stated that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_352">     “The emphasis is on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in
     some other form). The latter part of clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1250">Article 366</a> of the
     Constitution makes the position very clear. While referring to the transfer, delivery
     or supply of any goods that takes place as per sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29-</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_353">     A), the latter part of clause (29-A) says that “such transfer, delivery or supply of
     any goods” shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making the
     transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom
     such transfer, delivery or supply is made. Hence, a transfer of property in goods

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_447">                                          85</span>


under sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) is deemed to be a sale of the goods involved
in the execution of a works contract by the person making the transfer and a
purchase of those goods by the person to whom such transfer is made. The object
of the new definition introduced in clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1251">Article 366</a> of the Constitution
is, therefore, to enlarge the scope of ‘tax on sale or purchase of goods’ wherever it
occurs in the Constitution so that it may include within its scope the transfer,
delivery or supply of goods that may take place under any of the transactions
referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (f) thereof wherever such transfer, delivery or
supply becomes subject to levy of sales tax. So construed the expression ‘tax on
the sale or purchase of goods’ in Entry 54 of the State List, therefore, includes a
tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract also. The tax leviable by virtue of
sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1252">Article 366</a> of the Constitution thus becomes
subject to the same discipline to which any levy under entry 54 of the State List is
made subject to under the Constitution. The position is the same when we look at
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1253">Article 286</a> of the Constitution. Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1254">Article 286</a> says that no law of a
State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of
goods where such sale or purchase takes place — (a) outside the State; or (b) in
the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the
territory of India. Here again we have to read the expression “a tax on the sale or
purchase of goods” found in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1255">Article 286</a> as including the transfer of goods
referred to in sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1256">Article 366</a> which is deemed to be
a sale of goods and the tax leviable thereon would be subject to the terms of
clause (1) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1257">Article 286.</a> Similarly the restrictions mentioned in clause (2) of

principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in any of
the ways mentioned in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1259">Article 286</a> would also be attracted to a

had to interpret “agricultural income”, a term defined in <a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1274">Article 366(1)</a> as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_354">     “366. Definitions.—In this Constitution, unless the context otherwise
     requires, the following expressions have the meanings hereby
     respectively assigned to them, that is to say—
 (1) ‘agricultural income’ means agricultural income as defined for the
     purposes of the enactments relating to Indian income tax;”

</blockquote><p id="p_1337">124. Noticing that the definition (<a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1275">Article 366 (1) (1))</a> itself referred to the term as
defined by the Income tax Act, and after considering the definition in the existing
enactment, this court held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_355">     “30. The expression “agricultural income”, for the purpose of
     abovementioned entries, means agricultural income as defined for the
     purpose of the enactments relating to Indian income tax vide <a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1276">Article
     366(1)</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, the definition of “agricultural
     income” in <a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1277">Article 366(1)</a> indicates that it is open to the income tax
     enactments in force from time to time to define “agricultural income”
     in any particular manner and that would be the meaning not only for
     tax enactments but also for the Constitution. This mechanism has been
     devised to avoid a conflict with the legislative power of States in
     respect of agricultural income.”

i.e. “goods” which reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_1339">     “(12) “goods” includes all materials, commodities, and articles”.

</p><p id="p_1342">126. This court expansively interpreted the definition and held that the it includes
software programmes, observing that the term “goods” included intangible
property:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_356">       “27. In our view, the term “goods” as used in <a href="/doc/83773/" id="a_1280">Article 366(12)</a> of the
       Constitution and as defined under the said Act is very wide and
       includes all types of movable properties, whether those properties be
       tangible or intangible. We are in complete agreement with the
       observations made by this Court in Associated Cement Companies
       Ltd. [(2001) 4 SCC 593] A software program may consist of various
       commands which enable the computer to perform a designated task.
       The copyright in that program may remain with the originator of the
       program. But the moment copies are made and marketed, it becomes
       goods, which are susceptible to sales tax. Even intellectual property,
       once it is put on to a media, whether it be in the form of books or
       canvas (in case of painting) or computer discs or cassettes, and
       marketed would become “goods”. …… The term “all materials,
       articles and commodities” includes both tangible and
       intangible/incorporeal property which is capable of abstraction,
       consumption and use and which can be transmitted, transferred,
       delivered, stored, possessed, etc. The software programs have all
       these attributes.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1343">127.    It is therefore, apparent that whenever the definition clause, i.e. <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1281">Article 366</a>
has arisen for interpretation, this court has consistently given effect to the express
terms, and in the broadest manner. Whenever new definitions were introduced, full
effect was given, to the plain and grammatical terms, often, limiting existing
legislative powers conferred upon the states.
</p><p id="p_1344">128. Before proceeding to examine whether the term “the Central List” in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1282">Article

necessary to consider some decisions that have interpreted amendments which
introduced entirely new provisions, either affecting state’s legislative powers, or
limiting fundamental rights.

enact a law providing for appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries, in the context
of provisions of the Constitution (Ninety-First Amendment) Bill, 2003 which was
passed by both the Houses of Parliament and after receiving the assent of the
President, became a provision of the Constitution. It introduced <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_1285">Article 164(1-A</a>),
which had the effect of limiting the total number of Ministers in the Council of
Ministers in a State, including the Chief Minister, to fifteen per cent of the total
number of members of the Legislative Assembly of that State; the minimum
number of ministers was to be 12. The state assembly sought to create offices that
had the effect of exceeding the number mandated (15%). Upon a challenge, it was
argued that the state had legislative competence to enact the law, by virtue of
<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_1286">Article 194.</a> That argument was repelled by this court, which held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_357">     “36. As rightly pointed out by the petitioners, the existence of a
     dedicated article in the Constitution authorising the making of law on
     a particular topic would certainly eliminate the possibility of the
     existence of the legislative authority to legislate in <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1287">Article 246</a> read
     with any entry in the Seventh Schedule indicating a field of legislation
     which appears to be closely associated with the topic dealt with by the
     dedicated article. For example, even if the Constitution were not to
     contain Entries 38, 39, 40 in List II the State Legislatures would still
     be competent to make laws w.r.t. the topics indicated in those three
     entries, because of the authority contained in Articles 164(5), 186,
     194, 195, etc. Therefore, to place a construction on those entries
     which would have the effect of enabling the legislative body
     concerned to make a law not within the contemplation of the said
     articles would be plainly repugnant to the scheme of the
     Constitution.”

topic. In the case on hand, the relevant portion of the text of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_1291">Article

the “powers, privileges and immunities” of the House, its Members
and committees.
</blockquote><p id="p_1347">40. The question therefore is — Whether the text of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_1292">Article 194(3)</a> and
Entry 39 is wide enough to authorise the legislature to make the Act?
</p><p id="p_1348">41. In view of the fact that the text of both <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_1293">Article 194(3)</a> and the
relevant portion of Entry 39 are substantially similar, the meaning of
the clause “the powers, privileges and the immunities of a House of
the legislature of a State … and of the Members of a House of such
legislature” must be examined.”
                                    ***
“43. <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_1294">Article 194</a> deals exclusively with the powers and privileges of
the legislature, its Members and committees thereof. While clause (1)
declares that there shall be freedom of speech in the legislature
subject to the limitations enumerated therein, clause (2) provides
immunity in favour of the Members of the legislature from any legal
proceedings in any court for anything said or any vote given by such
Members in the legislature or any committees, etc. Clause (3) deals
with the powers, privileges and immunities of a House of the
Legislature and its Members with respect to matters other than the
ones covered under clauses (1) and (2).
</p><p id="p_1349">44. Thus, it can be seen from the scheme of <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_1295">Article 194</a> that it does not
expressly authorise the State Legislature to create offices such as the
one in question. On the other hand, <a href="/doc/1762713/" id="a_1296">Article 178</a> speaks about the
offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. <a href="/doc/139447/" id="a_1297">Article 179</a> deals with the
vacation of those offices or resignations of incumbents of those offices
whereas Articles 182 and 183 deal with the Chairman and Deputy
Chairman of the Legislative Council wherever the Council exists. In
our opinion, the most crucial article in this Chapter is <a href="/doc/290816/" id="a_1298">Article 187</a>
which makes stipulations even with reference to the secretarial staff of
the legislature. On the face of such elaborate and explicit
constitutional arrangement with respect to the legislature and the
various offices connected with the legislature and matters incidental
to them to read the authority to create new offices by legislation
would be a wholly irrational way of construing the scope of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_1299">Article

the legislature to make a law which has no rational connection with

or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to
in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_1303">article 30</a>”. This court held that on a true construction, special
provisions for admission to such category of candidates, even in private
educational institutions, was permissible. The court inter alia, held that:

provisions, and in the case of municipalities, the Constitution had, through
amendment, and introduction of <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_1323">Article 243X</a>, authorized states to authorize

“53. Before dealing with the specific circumstances of, and the
decision in, each of these cases, it is necessary that a few provisions
which figure prominently be dealt with. <a href="/doc/493558/" id="a_1325">Article 246(4)</a> of the
Constitution, as it stood on 26-1-1950, allowed Parliament to “make
laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India
not included in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule”. The Seventh
Amendment Act brought about a number of changes affecting Union
Territories, some of which have already been noticed by us. The other
changes brought about by it are also relevant; it caused <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_1326">Article 246</a> to
be changed to its present form where Parliament is empowered to
make laws with respect to “any part of the territory of India not
included in a State”. The word “State” has not been defined in the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/1062009/" id="a_1327">Article 1(3)</a> defines the territory of India as comprising:
</p><p id="p_1357">(a) the territories of the States; (b) the Union Territories specified in
the First Schedule; and (c) such other territories as may be acquired.
The word “Union Territory” has been defined in <a href="/doc/1906805/" id="a_1328">Article 366(30)</a> to
mean “any Union Territory specified in the First Schedule and
includes any other territory comprised within the territory of India but
not specified in that Schedule
</p><p id="p_1358">54. Though not defined in the Constitution, the word “State” has been
defined in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_1329">General Clauses Act</a>, 1897 (hereinafter called “the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_1330">General Clauses Act</a>”). <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_1331">Article 367</a> of the Constitution states that the

and subject to any adaptations and modifications made under <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1333">Article
372</a>, apply for the interpretation of the Constitution. Therefore, on a
plain reading of the provisions involved, it would appear that the
definition of “State” in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_1334">General Clauses Act</a> would be applicable
for the purposes of interpreting the Constitution. <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_1335">Article 372</a> is the
saving clause of the Constitution which enables all laws in force
before the commencement of the Constitution to continue in the
territory of India. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1336">Article 372-A</a>, which, once again, owes its origin to
the Seventh Amendment Act, empowers the President to make further
adaptations in particular situations.

     for the bestowal of such privileges. In the case of Municipalities
     within States, they have to be specifically delegated the power to tax
     by the State Legislature concerned. In Union Territories which do not
     have Legislative Assemblies of their own, such a power would have to

     all taxation must fall within either of two categories: State taxation or

     be noted that <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1338">Section 154</a> of the 1935 Act was similarly worded. The
     fact that <a href="/doc/1630360/" id="a_1339">Article 289(1</a>), which in its phraseology is different from
     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1340">Section 155</a> of the 1935 Act having been drafted by the Drafting
     Committee to meet specific objections, does not contain words similar
     to those in <a href="/doc/1759908/" id="a_1341">Article 285(1</a>), will not in any way further the case of the
     appellant, because the phrase “Union taxation” will encompass
     municipal taxes levied by Municipalities in Union Territories.”
It is noteworthy that the court was inter alia, guided by the definition of “State” in
<a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_1342">Article 367</a> of the Constitution of India.

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1345">342A</a>
</p><p id="p_1362">132. What is noticeable in the lines of decisions preceding this section, including
those dealing with constitutional amendments- is that whenever the definition
clause (<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1346">Article 366</a>) arose for consideration, the court gave full effect to the
substantive amendments as well as the definition (as in the case of Builders
Association [supra] and Twentieth Century Leasing [supra]), as well as the newly
introduced provisions (as in the case of Bimolangshu Roy [supra] and Ashoka

Kumar Thakur [supra]). In Williamson Financial Services (supra)and New Delhi
Municipal Council (supra), this court gave full effect to the plain meaning of the
definition clause, in <a href="/doc/1406257/" id="a_1347">Article 366 (1) (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_1348">(30)</a> respectively.
</p><p id="p_1363">133. In this background, the crucial point to be decided is - did Parliament, acting
in its constituent capacity, whereby any amendment needed a special majority of
two thirds of its members present and voting, in both the Houses separately, wish
to bring about a change in status quo or not?
</p><p id="p_1364">134. Parliament was aware that the procedure for identification of SCs and STs,
culminated with the final decision by the President on the aid and advice of the
Union Council of Ministers. This position in law underwent little change, despite
the Constitution (Sixty Fifth) and Constitution (Eighty Ninth)<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1349">Amendment Act</a>s,
which set up commissions for SCs and STs, replacing the provisions of the original
constitution which had created an authority called the “Special Officer”. Through
the amended Articles 338 and 338A, consultation with the states in the matter of
inclusion or exclusion, was and continues to be given due consideration. It is also
possible for states to initiate the process and propose the inclusion (or deletion of)
new communities or castes, by sending their proposals, duly supported by relevant
material, for consideration. This constitutional procedure, so to say, culminating in
the final word of Parliament was well known, in relation to SCs and STs. The
states were, and are, bound to consult these two commissions, for SCs and STs
(under Articles 338 and 338A).Till the 102 nd Amendment, when it came to
backward classes, or SEBCs, the Constitution was silent- definitionally, as well as
the manner by which their identification could take place.
</p><p id="p_1365">135. The interpretive exercise carried out in Indra Sawhney saw this court
enjoining the Central and State governments to set up some permanent
mechanisms in the form of commissions, to identify SEBCs through a systematic
and scientific manner and carry on regular periodic reviews. The respondent states
emphasize that pursuant to this direction, state enactments were framed and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_457">                                          95</span>


brought into force. The arguments on their behalf as well as the Attorney General
was that given these directions by a nine-judge bench, it could not be inferred that
the 102nd Amendment was ever intended to bring about such a drastic change as to
exclude the state’s role altogether, in the task of making special provisions under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1350">Article 15 (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1351">Article 16 (4</a>), in regard to identification of SEBCs.
</p><p id="p_1366">136. It is correct that Indra Sawhney clearly voiced the need for the Central
Government and the states to take measures for setting up permanent commissions
or bodies, if need be through legislation, to carry out the task of identification of
communities as SEBCs for the purposes of Articles 15 and 16. However, that
articulation or even direction, could not have, in the opinion of this court, been an
injunction never to depart from the existing mechanisms of setting standards for
identification of such classes, nor was it to be a direction in perpetuity, that status
quo remain forever. It cannot be seriously assumed that if Parliament were so
minded, it cannot bring about changes at all to the Constitution, in regard to how
identification of backward classes is to take place. The existence of the provision in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1352">Article 368</a>, enabling amendments, and the inapplicability of the proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1353">Article
368(2)</a> in relation to the kind of changes to the Constitution, brought about by
introduction of Articles 366 (26C), <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1354">Article 338B</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1355">Article 342A</a>, negates this
argument.
</p><p id="p_1367">137. A reading of the Select Committee’s Report (in relation to the 102 nd
Amendment) bears out that various changes to the proposed amendments were
suggested on the ground that on a fair and reasonable interpretation of its terms,
State’s powers to make reservations could be impacted. The Central Government’s
representatives and officials assured that the State’s role in the process of backward
class identification and listing, would be maintained. None of the amendments
proposed, expressly preserving the state power, were accepted. The dissenting
members were aware that a fair and reasonable interpretation of the terms of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_458">                                         96</span>


amendment clearly ousted the State’s powers to identify backward classes of
citizens. This emerges on a reading of a note by Shri Sukhendu Shekhar Roy, a
Member of Parliament who relied on extracts of the judgment in Indra Sawhney
and observed that the amendments prescribed “for the unitary authority which in
effect shall encroach upon the jurisdiction of the States in the matter of identifying
and specifying the socially and educationally backward classes”. Three Members,
Shri Digvijaya Singh, Shri B.K. Hariprasad, and Shri Hussain Dalwai, submitted a
joint note of dissent which dealt with the powers of the commission under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1356">Article
342A</a>, and also suggested changes in its composition. Shri Sharad Yadav, another
Member of Parliament, was of the view that there was no need of any inclusion or
exclusion of the castes and approval thereof should not be left to the Governor,
Parliament and President as it will be a step backward. Dr.Dalip Kumar Tirkey,
Member of the Rajya Sabha, proposed sub-articles (3) and (4) to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1357">Article 342A</a>,
enabling the State to publish a list which could be modified by State Assemblies.
Ms. Kanimozhi in her long letter of dissent, also highlighted the effect of a
proposed amendment and insertion of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1358">Article 342A</a> which had the effect of ousting
the states’ power, which they had hitherto exercised to identify SEBCs.
</p><p id="p_1368">138. The debates in Parliament also witnessed members voicing apprehensions
that the power hitherto enjoyed by the states, would be whittled down drastically.
These fears were allayed by the concerned Minister who piloted the Bill before
both Houses of Parliament. Extracts of these statements have been set out in
extenso in the judgment of Ashok Bhushan, J.; they are not reproduced here, for the
sake of brevity.
</p><p id="p_1369">139. These materials show that there was on the one hand, an assumption that the
changes ushered by the amendments would not disturb any part of states’ powers;
however, a sizeable number- 8 members, after a careful reading of the terms of the
amendment, dissented, saying that state power would be adversely impacted. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_459">                                         97</span>


these circumstances, the debate which ensued at the time of passing of the Bill into
the 102nd Amendment was by way of an assurance by the Minister concerned that
the existing power of the states would not be affected. To the same effect, are
debates on the floor of the Houses of Parliament. Given all these circumstances, it
is difficult to accept the contention that the Select Committee’s Report, to the
extent it holds out an assurance, should be used as a determinative external aid for
interpretation of the actual terms of the 102nd Amendment. Likewise, debates and
statements cannot be conclusive about the terms of the changes brought about by
an amendment to the Constitution. The duty of the court always is to first interpret
the text, and only if there is ambiguity in the meaning, to resort first to internal
aids, before seeking external aids outside the text.
</p><p id="p_1370">140. It would be useful to recollect that this Court had, through a seven-judge

bench, held that the words of the statute are to be construed on their own terms and
that the task of interpretation should not be determined by statements made by
Ministers and Members of Parliament. In Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing (supra) it
was held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_359">     “No one may speak for the Parliament and Parliament is never before
     the Court. After Parliament has said what it intends to say, only the
     Court may say what the Parliament meant to say. None else. Once a
     statute leaves Parliament House, the Court&#x27;s is the only authentic
     voice which may echo (interpret) the Parliament. This the court will
     do with reference to the language of the statute and other permissible
     aids.”
</blockquote><p id="p_1371">141. This aspect was highlighted somewhat more vividly in a recent decision of
this Court in <a href="/doc/179738554/" id="a_1359">Shivraj Singh Chauhan v. Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative
Assembly122</a>, where it was held that:

      June 1949) made by individual members of the Constituent Assembly.
      Each speech represents the view of one individual in the Assembly
      which taken as a whole formed a kaleidoscope of competing political
      ideologies. There may arise instances where the court is of the
      independent opinion that the views raised by individual Members of
      the Constituent Assembly in their speeches lay down considerations
      that warrant examination and approval by the Court. The general rule
      however, would be to examine the decisions taken by Constituent
      Assembly taken by majority vote. The votes of the Constituent
      Assembly represent equally the views of all the members of the
      Assembly and are the final and dispositive expressions of the
      constitutional choices taken in framing our Constitution.”
</p><p id="p_1373">142. The use of external aids such as speeches and parliamentary reports was
commented upon earlier, rather strongly, by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, CJ in the
decision reported as <a href="/doc/898251/" id="a_1360">DTC Mazdoor Congress v. Delhi Transport Corporation</a>:123

      “Construction or interpretation of legislative or rule provisions
      proceeds on the assumption that courts must seek to discover and
      translate the intention of the legislature or the rule-making body. This
      is one of the legal fictions upon the hypothesis of which the framework
      of adjudication of the intention of a piece of legislation or rule
      proceeds. But these are fictional myths to a large extent as experience
      should tell us. In most of the cases legislature, that is to say, vast
      majority of the people who are supposed to represent the views and
      opinions of the people, do not have any intention, even if they have,
      they cannot and do not articulate those intentions. On most of these
      issues their is no comprehension or understanding. Reality would
      reveal that it is only those who are able to exert their view- points, in
      a common parliamentary jargon, the power lobby, gets what it wants,
      and the machinery is of a bureaucratic set up who draft the legislation
      or rule or law. So, there- fore, what is passed on very often as the will
      of the people in a particular enactment is the handy work of a
      bureaucratic machine produced at the behest of a power lobby
      control- ling the corridors of power in a particular situation. This
      takes the mythical shape of the &#x27;intention of the people&#x27; in the form of
      legislation. Again, very often, the bureaucratic machine is not able to
      correctly and properly transmute what was intended to be conveyed.

      In such a situation, is it or is it not better, one would ponder to ask,
      whether the courts should attribute to the law-making body the
      knowledge of the values and limitations of the Constitution, and
      knowledge of the evils that should be remedied at a particular time
      and in a situation that should be met by a particular piece of
      legislation, and the court with the experience and knowledge of law,
      with the assistance of lawyers trained in this behalf, should endeavour
      to find out what will be the correct and appropriate solution, and
      construe the rule of the legislation within the ambit of constitutional
      limitations and upon reasonable judgment of what should have been
      expressed. In reality, that happens in most of the cases. Can it be
      condemned as judicial usurpation of law-making functions of the
      legislature thereby depriving the people of their right to express their
      will? This is a practical dilemma which Judges must always, in cases
      of interpretation and construction, face and a question which they
      must answer.”
</p><p id="p_1374">143. The polyvocality of parliamentary proceedings where the views expressed
by Ministers or Parliamentarians may not be common or unanimous and the danger
of attributing a particular intention to the terms of a statute, through the words of a
Minister or other functionary which may be at odds with the plain words, cannot be
lost sight of.
</p><p id="p_1375">144. In the decision reported as BBC Enterprises v.Hi-Tech Xtravision Ltd.,124 the
court cautioned against the use of the purposive interpretation rule, saying that

      “the courts should now be very reluctant to hold that Parliament has
      achieved nothing by the language it used, when it is tolerably plain
      what Parliament wished to achieve.”
</p><p id="p_1376">145. This caution was accepted in <a href="/doc/53127/" id="a_1361">Balram Kumawat v. Union of India</a> 125 where it
was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_360">      “26. The courts will therefore reject that construction which will
      defeat the plain intention of the legislature even though there may be
      some        inexactitude        in       the       language      used.

Parliament in 1993. The scheme of that enactment showed that the NCBC was
tasked with making recommendations for various purposes; especially, (by <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_1377">Section
9</a> (1)) to “examine requests for inclusion of any class of citizens as a backward
class in the lists and hear complaints of over-inclusion or under-inclusion of any

backward class in such lists and tender such advice to the Central Government as
it deems appropriate”. By all accounts, that commission embarked on its task and
identified SEBCs in all the 31 states and union territories in India. According to the
information available127, as many as 2479 castes and communities have been
notified as backward classes, throughout the entire country, in relation to each state
and union territory. It is nobody’s case that the statutory commission – NCBC was
not functioning properly, or that there was any interference with its work. Nor is
there any suggestion that states voiced resentment at the decisions or
recommendations of the NCBC. Given these, the important question that hangs in
the air- if one can say so- is why did Parliament have to go to such great lengths, to
merely confer constitutional status, upon the NCBC, and at the same time, tie the
hands of the Union Government, robbing it of the flexibility it always had, of
modifying or amending the list of OBCs for the purposes of the Union Government
and Central public sector employment, and for purposes of schemes and admission
to institutions, under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1378">Article 15(4).</a>
</p><p id="p_1380">148. It was asserted by the Attorney General and the states, that the move to
amend the Constitution was only to empower the Central Government to publish a
list, for union employment and Central PSU posts. That power always existed-
under the NCBC Act. Concededly, the states were not interfering with those lists.
The Union always had and exercised power to add or vary the contents of such lists
for central posts, PSUs and institutions, whether it enacted a law or not. There is no
reason why rigidity had to be imparted to the position with regard to preparation of
a list, by taking away the flexibility of the President to amend the lists, and
requiring it to approach Parliament, after initially publishing a list under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1379">Article
342A.</a> Again, if this court’s direction in Indra Sawhney is the reason, then there is
no enabling legislation in all states, for setting up commissions. Rather, to require

is mystifying.
</p><p id="p_1381">149. The interpretation suggested by the respondents, and by Ashok Bhushan, J.,
that the power of the states, which existed till the 102 nd Amendment was made,
continues unimpeded, is not borne out. Such an interpretation amounts to saying
that Parliament went to great lengths by defining, for the first time, the term
SEBC128 in the Constitution, and provided for one notification under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1381">Article
342Aissued</a> by the President, which would “specify the socially and educationally
backward classes which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be
socially and educationally backward classes in relation to that State or Union
territory”, and then, restricted the width of the term “ deemed for purposes of this
Constitution” by giving primacy to the term “Central List”. Such an interpretation
restricts the specification of a community as backward, in relation to that State or
Union territory, only for purposes of the Central List, i.e., for purposes of central
government employment and Central Institutions. Such an interpretation with
respect, is strained; it deprives plain and grammatical meaning to the provisions
introduced by the 102nd Amendment, has the effect of tying the hands of the
Central Government, and at the same time, grants the states unlimited latitude in
the manner of inclusion of any class of citizens as backward.
</p><p id="p_1382">150. The claim that the interpretation suggested by the respondents is pragmatic
and conforms to the doctrine of purposive interpretation, with respect, cannot be
accepted. It completely undermines the width and amplitude of the following:
</p><p id="p_1383">      (a) The deeming fiction introduced by the 102nd Amendment, while inserting

</p><p id="p_1385">         (b) The use of the term “means” which has been interpreted to imply an
             exhaustive definitional expression, in several decisions of this court 129, as
             a device to place the matter beyond the pale of interpretation, to ensure
             that the only meaning attributable is the one directed by the provision.
             Thus, SEBCs are, by reason of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1385">Article 366 (26C)</a> only those deemed to be
            so under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1386">Article 342A.</a>
</p><p id="p_1386">         (c) The emphasis is on the community- upon being included, under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1387">Article
             342A</a>, for the purposes of this Constitution being “deemed to be”
             socially and educationally backward classes, in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1388">Article 366 (26C).</a> Thus,
             for all purposes under the Constitution, such communities are deemed to
             be SEBCs.
</p><p id="p_1387">         (d) The logical corollary is that such inclusion is for the purposes of the
             constitution, to enable state and central government benefits, i.e. welfare
             measures, special provisions under Articles 15 (4) and 15 (5), as well as
             employment, under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1389">Article 16 (4).</a> The enactment of this provision
             excludes all other methods of identification, by any other body - either
             the state, or any state commission or authority.
</p><p id="p_1388">         (e) The use of the expression for the purposes of this Constitution, - in
             <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1390">Article 342A (1</a>), also emphasizes the idea that for all purposes, i.e under
             <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1391">Article 15 (4</a><a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1392">), 15 (5</a>), and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1393">16 (4</a>), only the communities or classes
             deemed to be SEBCs under Article342A would be treated as such, in
             relation to the State or Union territory concerned.

</p><p id="p_1391">      (f) <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1395">Article 338 (10)</a> was amended, to delete references to backward class of
          citizens. It originally stated that scheduled castes also included references
          &quot;to such other backward classes as the President may, on receipt of the
          report of a Commission appointed under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_1396">article 340</a>, by
          order specify and also&quot;. These expressions were omitted and an entirely
          new provision, exclusively for purpose of socially and educationally
          backward classes, was inserted (<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1397">Article 338B</a>), which has to
          independently consider all aspects relating to SCBCs, in a manner
         identical to SCs and STs.
</p><p id="p_1392">151. If all these factors are kept in mind, there can be no room for doubt that “the
Central List” in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1398">Article 342A (2)</a> is none other than the list published in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1399">Article
342A(1)</a> for the purposes of the Constitution. This means that after the introduction
of these provisions, the final say in regard to inclusion or exclusion (or
modification of lists) of SEBCs is firstly with the President, and thereafter, in case
of modification or exclusion from the lists initially published, with the Parliament.
</p><p id="p_1393">152. This sequitur is the only reason why change was envisioned in the first
placeby Parliament, sitting in its constituent capacity, no less, which is to alter the
entire regime by ensuring that the final say in the matter of identification of SEBCs
would follow the same pattern as exists, in relation to the most backward classes
among all citizens, (i.e. the SCs and STs, through Articles 338, 338A, 341 and
</p><p id="p_1394">342). Too much cannot be read into the use of the expression the Central list for
the simple reason that it is a list, prepared and published by the President, on the
aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers. The term Central is no doubt,
unusual, but it occurs in the Constitution in several places. At the same time, the
Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister advices the President and
provides information relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and
proposals for legislation (<a href="/doc/220543/" id="a_1400">Article 78</a>). Similarly, <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_1401">Article 77</a> uses the term “the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_468">                                                         106</span>


Government of India”. Given that these terms are used interchangeably, and mean
the same, “the Central List” carries no other signification than the list notified
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1402">Article 342A(1</a>), by the President at the behest of the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_1395">153. It is noticeable that <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_1403">Article 367</a> of the Constitution of India incorporates, by

     “24. Thus, it is clear that the definition of Central Government, which
     means the President is not controlled by the second expression “and
     shall include the Administrator”. The ordinary or popular meaning of
     the words “the President” occurring in <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_1413">Section 3(8)(b)</a> has to be
     given and the second part of the definition shall not in any way
     control or affect the first part of the definition as observed above. In
     the definition of Central Government, an Administrator shall be read
     when he has been authorised or delegated a particular function under
     the circumstances as indicated above. No statutory rules or any
     delegation has been referred to or brought on record under which the
     Administrator is entitled or authorised to make nomination in the
     Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Thus, in
     the present case, the definition of Central Government, as occurring
     in <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_1414">Section 3(3)</a> of the 1963 Act has to be read as to mean the President
     and not the Administrator. The issue is answered accordingly.”

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1415">Article 342A (1)</a> does not use the expression “Central Government”. Nevertheless,
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1416">Article 342A (2)</a> uses the expression “Central List” which has led to an elaborate
interpretive discourse. If the logic of <a href="/doc/216211/" id="a_1417">Article 367 (1)</a> of the Constitution, together
with <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_1418">Section 3</a> (8) (b) of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_1419">General Clauses Act</a>, were to be applied, “Central
List” necessarily refers to the list under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1420">Article 342A (1</a>), which is prepared by the
President, for the purpose of the Constitution. The other interpretation, with
respect, would be unduly narrow and restrictive; it would have the effect of adding
words such as to the effect that the Central List, would “apply in relation to the
Central Government”. Such an addition of terms, with respect, cannot be resorted
to, when interpreting a Constitutional amendment, The amended provisions clearly
state that the determination is for the purpose of the Constitution and that SEBCs
(per <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1421">Article 366 (26C)</a> are deemed to be as determined in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1422">Article 342A;</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1423">Article
342A</a> states that the President shall by notification publish SEBCs in relation to
states and union territories, for the purpose of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1405">154. There are other compelling reasons too, why the restrictive interpretation of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1424">Article 342A</a>, limiting the exercise of identification for the purpose of central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_470">                                        108</span>


employment and central benefits(and not made applicable to states) is to be
avoided as opposed to the interpretation based on the plain language of the new
provisions, which has to be adopted.
</p><p id="p_1406">155. Parliament, through the 102ndAmendment clearly intended that the existing
legal regime for identification of communities as SCs and STs and for their
inclusion in the list of SCs and STs under Articles 341 and 342, which had hitherto
existed, ought to be replicated in relation to identification of SEBCs. To achieve
that, Parliament inserted <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1425">Article 338B</a> – which is a mirror image of Articles 338
and 338A. The tasks assigned to the new Commission for Backward Classes which
is envisioned as a multi-member Commission, are radically different from the
duties which were assigned by Parliament in the NCBC Act. Under <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_1426">Section 9</a> of
the erstwhile NCBC Act, which was repealed just before the commencement of the
102nd amendment, the NCBC was to examine requests for inclusion of any class of
citizens as backward classes in the list and the advice of the Commission was
ordinarily binding upon the Central Government. <a href="/doc/1519126/" id="a_1427">Section 11</a> provided for a
periodical revision of lists. As noticed by Ashok Bhushan, J., <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1428">Article 338B</a>
envisions a larger role for the new Commission. This Commission not only advises
the Central Government but also the States. It is impossible to read <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1429">Article 338B</a> in
isolation from the pre-existing parimateria provisions; it must be interpreted in the
light of the other two provisions which had existed all this while – Articles 338 and
338A. Those provisions clearly contemplate the same consultative role with the
Commission on policy matters, of the Central Government as well as the State
Governments. This is evident from sub-<a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_1430">article (9)</a> of these Articles. Thus, the
Commission – under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1431">Article 338B</a> is not only assigned a constitutional role but is
also expected to act as an expert and engage with experts in the determination of
the communities. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1432">Article 338B(5)</a> uses the term “SEBC” no less than on six
occasions. The expression also occurs in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1433">Article 338B(9).</a> Thus, for the purposes of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_471">                                         109</span>


the Constitution, the Commission newly established under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1434">Article 338B</a>, i.e., the
National Commission for Backward Classes shall be the only body to whom both
the Central Government and the State Governments have to turn, in all matters of
policy. Necessarily, the question of matters of policy would also include
identification of castes or communities as backward classes.
</p><p id="p_1407">156. If the intention of the Parliament in amending the Constitution were to
merely confer or clothe the National Commission with constitutional status, the
matter would have ended by inserting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1435">Article 338B.</a> To that end, the argument of
the respondents is understandable. Short of the task of identification, (which could
have continued with the states), if the amendment had not inserted <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1436">Article 342A</a>,
the States would have been duty bound to consult the Commission under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1437">Article
338B.</a> The interpretation by Ashok Bhushan, J. to that extent might have been
acceptable. However, that the Constitution was amended further to introduce
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1438">Article 342A</a>, containing the phraseology that it does, adding an entirely new
dimension which the court has to interpret, after considering the light of the
previous authorities, as also whenever new provisions were added to the
Constitution and more importantly, when such amendments were also
accompanied by changes in the definition clause.
</p><p id="p_1408">157. The previous part of this judgment has discussed various authorities which
had considered one or the other clauses of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1439">Article 366</a>, i.e the NDMC case, Tata
Consultancy (supra), Willamson Financial Services (supra). The NDMC case was
decided by a nine-judge bench; in all the other decisions, this court gave the fullest
latitude to the expressions in the definition clause while interpreting them in the
peculiar facts of the case. Similarly, when constitutional amendments introduced
new definitions such as in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1440">Article 366(29A</a>), judicial interpretation leaned in favour
of giving literal meaning to the terms used which had led to change in the existing
tax regime. Such changes too limited the State’s legislative powers. Thus, for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_472">                                        110</span>


instance, in the Constitution bench judgments in Builders Association (supra) and
in 20th Century Leasing (supra), this Court had decisively ruled that the taxing
power of the States was explained by the amendment but at the same time was
limited in more than one manner by the express terms which had introduced a new
entry in the Central or Union legislative field. Furthermore, the principles on which
taxation could be resorted to by the States too had to be defined by the Union
Government. In other cases, whenever constitutional amendments brought about
changes in the existing status quo like in Kihoto Hollohan (supra) or limited the
legislative power constraining the state from expanding its council of ministers
beyond a certain percentage as with the introduction of <a href="/doc/578636/" id="a_1441">Article 164(1A)</a>in
Bimolangshu Roy(supra). This Court gave full literal effect to the terms of the
amendment after understanding the rationale for the change.
</p><p id="p_1409">158. In Ashok Kumar Thakur (supra) and N. Nagraj (supra) the changes brought
through Constitutional Amendments were the subject matter of interpretation. In
Nagaraj, they were also the subject matter of challenge on the ground that the
amendments violated the basic structure of the Constitution. There too, the Court
interpreted the terms of the amendment by adopting a plain and literal meaning and
not by cutting down or reading down any term or phrase. In Ashok Kumar Thakur
(supra), the introduction of the new and radical <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1442">Article 15(5)</a> enabled States to
make special provisions for socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens, in unaided private educational institutions.
</p><p id="p_1410">159. Given the weight of such precedents- which point to this court(i) giving full
effect to newly added provisions, (ii) by adopting the literal meaning in the
definition, set out in the Constitution (iii) as well as in the amendments to the
definition clause, and (iv) all of which noticed the changes brought about through
the amendments, and gave them plain effect, it is difficult to accept that the power
of amendment of the Constitution, in accordance with the special procedure set out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_473">                                       111</span>


in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1443">Article 368</a> – was used to about bring cosmetic changes conferring constitutional
status to NCBC. The conferment of constitutional status – as was noticed
previously, is achieved by only inserting <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1444">Article 338B.</a> However, the fact that it
mirrors the previous two provisions of Articles 338 and 338A and borrows from
that pattern clearly suggests that the new Commission is to have an identical role
much like the Commissions that advice the Central Government and Parliament
with respect to all matters pertaining to SCs and STs. Therefore, the new
Commission is expected to play a decisive role in the preparation of lists, which
the Constitution set apart as one list, deemed to be the list of SEBCs for the
purposes of Constitution in relation to every State and Union Territory. The
interplay between Articles 366(26C) and 338B is therefore crucial. The term
“deemed to be for the purposes of this Constitution” and a reference to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1445">Article
342A</a> would necessarily mean that even the provision under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1446">Article 338B</a>, is to be
interpreted in the same light. In other words, were the intention merely to confer
constitutional status, that would have been achieved by an insertion of the
provision in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1447">Article 338B</a> without any other amendment, such as being in the
definition clause under 366 or the insertion of 342A.
</p><p id="p_1411">160. The change brought about by the 102 ndAmendment by introducing Sub-
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1448">Article (26C)</a> to <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1449">Article 366</a> and inserting a new provision - <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1450">Article 342A</a>, to my
mind, brings about a total alignment with the existing constitutional scheme for
identification of backward classes, with the manner and the way in which
identification of SCs and STs has been undertaken hitherto, by the Central
Government culminating in Presidential notifications. That task is aided by two
Commissions - respectively for SCs and STs, much as in the case of the new
National Commission for Backward Classes which will undertake the task of
aiding and advising the Central Government for issuing the notification for the
purposes of the Constitution under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1451">Article 342A.</a> The pattern of finality and a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_474">                                         112</span>


single list, in relation to every State and UT – which exists in relation to SCs and
STs (Articles 341 and 342) now has been replicated with the introduction of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1452">Article
342A.</a>
</p><p id="p_1412">161. There have to be strong, compelling reasons for this Court to depart from the
interpretation which has been hitherto placed on the definition clause. As has been
demonstrated in more than one case, the interpretation of the definition clause in its
own terms in respect of the original constitutional provisions as well as the new
terms brought in by way of amendment (which also brought in substantive
amendments) have consistently shown a particular trend. If one keeps in mind the
interpretation of Articles 341 and 342 from the earliest decision in Bhayalal
(supra) and Bir Singh (supra), the only conclusion is that the task of examining
requests or demands for inclusion or exclusion is in the first instance only with the
President [<a href="/doc/1874527/" id="a_1453">Article 342(1)].</a> In this task, the President, i.e. the Central Government
is aided by the work of the Commissions set up under Articles 338 and 338A.
Upon the publication of the list containing the notification under Articles 341(1)
and 342(1), for the purposes of the Constitution in relation to the concerned State
or the concerned UT, the list of SCs and STs is conclusive. Undoubtedly, these
were the original provisions. Yet, one must be mindful of a crucial fact, which is
that the task for making special provisions under <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1454">Article 15</a> and for making
reservations under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1455">Article 16(4)</a> extends to the States. The power exercised by the
President in relation to every State vis-à-vis SCs and STs has been smooth and by
all accounts, there has been no resentment or friction. Once the concerned
community or caste is reflected in the list of one or the other State or Union
Territory, the extent of the benefits to be provided to members of such community
is a matter that lies entirely in the States’ domain. The amendment or modification
of any State list, can be undertaken only by Parliament, not even by the President.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_475">                                        113</span>


</p><p id="p_1413">162. Much like in the case of the alignment of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1456">Article 338B</a> with the other two
previously existing provisions of the Constitution, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1457">Article 342A</a> aligns the function
(of identification of SEBCs and publishing the list, by the President) with Articles
341 and 342. These three sets of consecutive provisions, share their umbilical cord
with the definition clause [<a href="/doc/382320/" id="a_1458">Article 366(24)</a> in relation to SCs; <a href="/doc/924700/" id="a_1459">Article 366(25)</a> in
relation to STs and the new 366(26C) in relation to SEBCs]. This two-way linkage
between the definition clause with the substantive provisions is not without
significance. As has been held in Marri Chandra Shekar (supra); Action
Committee (supra) and Bir Singh (supra), the expression “for the purposes of the
Constitution” has to be given fullest weight. Therefore, whenever lists are prepared
under these three provisions in relation to States or UTs, the classes and castes
included in such list and no other are deemed to be castes or classes falling within
the one or the other category (SCs, STs, SEBCs) in relation to the particular State
or UT for the purposes of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1414">163. If one were to, for the sake of argument, consider the deliberations before
the Select Committee reflected in its report, it is evident that amendments at three
places were moved to place the matter beyond controversy and clarify that States’
jurisdiction and power to identify SEBCs would remain undisturbed. To achieve
this, proposed Articles 342A(3) &amp; (4) were introduced. These proposed
amendments were not accepted; and were dropped. No doubt, the rationale for
dropping (the amendments) was the impression given in the form of an assurance
that the express terms of the amendment did not divest the States of their power.
Further, paras 56 and 57 of the Select Committee report clearly state that the
Governor acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State and
that Articles 341 and 342 provide for consultation with the Governor in relation to
SCs and STs of the concerned States. The assurance held out was that, “at no time
has the State been excluded in the consultation process. It is by way of the State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_476">                                           114</span>


Government invariably which recommends to the President the category of
inclusion/exclusion in the SCs and STs. Similar provision is provided for in the
case of conferring of constitutional status to backward classes for inclusion in
Central List of SEBCs in consultation with Governor” thereby implying
consultation with the State Government. It was also stated in para 57 (of the
report)that “the expression ‘for the purpose of this Constitution’ is identical to that
phrase in <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_1460">Article 341</a> and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1461">Article 342</a>.”
</p><p id="p_1415">164. The deliberations of the Select Committee report only show that the existing
pattern of identification and inclusion of SCs and STs which entailed the active
involvement of the States was sought to be replicated for the purpose of preparing
the list, of OBCs, by the President. It was emphasised during the course of
arguments, an aspect that finds due reflection in the draft judgment of Ashok
Bhushan, J. that the term, “the Central List” is of crucial significance because it in
fact controls the entire provision, i.e., <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1462">Article 342A</a>, that it is in line with the Select
Committee Report as well as Parliamentary debates and that this Court has to give
it a purposive interpretation. In my respectful opinion, an isolated consideration of
the expression, “the Central List” containing classes and communities which are
deemed to be backward for the purpose of the Constitution, would undermine the
entire constitutional scheme. Parliamentary intent, on the contrary, clearly was to
replicate the existing pattern for inclusion in the list of SCs and STs for SEBCs – (a
term that had not been defined in the Constitution till then). Yet another way of
looking at the matter is that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1463">Article 342A(1)</a> is the only provision which enables
the publication of one list of SEBCs. This provision clearly talks of publication of
a list through a Presidential notification for the purpose of the Constitution after the
process of identification. It is this list which contains members of classes or
communities which can be called as SEBCs by virtue of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1464">Article 366(26C).</a> In other
words, the subject of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1465">Article 342A(1)</a> determines the subject of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1466">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_477">                                         115</span>


366(26C)</a>which in turn controls and guides the definition of the term “SEBCs” for
the entire Constitution. This is achieved by using emphatic terms such as “means”
and “deemed to be”. A similar emphasis is to be found in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1467">Article 342A(1)</a> which
uses “shall for the purposes of the Constitution”. In both cases, i.e. Articles
366(26C) and 342A(1), there are no words limiting, or terms indicative of
restriction as to the extent to which such inclusion is to operate. Thus, like in the
case of Articles 341 and 342, those classes and castes included in the list of SEBCs
in relation to every State and every UT are:

</p><p id="p_1416">(i)    For the purposes of the Constitution;
</p>
<p id="p_1417">(ii)   deemed to be SEBCs in relation to concerned State or Union Territory.

</p><p id="p_1418">165. The width and amplitude of the expression “shall be deemed to be” of the
expression cannot be diluted or cut down in any manner whatsoever. If one
understands that this list in fact identifies SEBCs for the purposes of the
Constitution, all that follows in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1468">Article 342A(2)</a> is that such list can only be
amended by Parliament. The Court, therefore, has to see the object and content of
the entire Article to determine what it means. So viewed, firstly it is linked with
<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1469">Article 366(26C)</a> and the use of the terms “means” and “deemed” in the definition
is decisive, i.e., that there can be no class or caste deemed for the purposes of
Constitution other than those listed under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1470">Article 342A.</a> Secondly, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1471">Article 342A(1)</a>
is the only provision conferring power by which identification is undertaken by the
President in the first instance. This identification and publication of the list
containing the cases and communities is in relation to each State and each Union
Territory. Third, after publication of this notification, if changes are brought about
to it by inclusion or exclusion from that list, (called the “Central List” of SEBCs
for the first time), Parliament alone can amend it. It is important that the expression
“the Central List” is clarified by the phrase “socially and educationally backward
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_478">                                         116</span>


classes specified in a notification under Clause (1)” which is reinforced
subsequently by the use of the term “aforesaid notification”. Thus, the subject
matter of initial identification and publication of the list for the purposes of the
Constitution is by the published President alone (under the aid and advice of the
Union Council of Ministers) and any subsequent variation by way of inclusion or
exclusion can be achieved only through an amendment by law, of that list.
</p><p id="p_1419">166. If one interprets the entire scheme involving Articles 366(26C), 342A(1) and
342A(2), the irresistible conclusion that follows is that the power of publishing the
list of SEBCs, in relation to every State and Union Territory for the purposes of the
Constitution is with the President only. Such notification is later called as the
Central List by <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1472">Article 342A(2);</a> it can only be amended by the Parliament. The
contrary interpretation virtually reads into the provisions of the Constitution
amendments which were proposed and expressly rejected in the proceedings of the
Select Committee; it also has the effect of reading in what certain dissenting
members had proposed. Furthermore, by the interpretive process of taking into
account the deliberations before the Select Committee, and speeches on the floor of
the Parliament this Court would be reading into the Constitution provisions which
no longer exist i.e., that the State can continue to carry out identification of SEBCs.
This exercise would be contrary to the express terms.
</p><p id="p_1420">167. Therefore, the above expressions, having regard to the precedents of this
Court with respect to (i) interpretation of the definition clause under <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1473">Article 366;</a>
</p><p id="p_1421">(ii) interpretation of new definitions inserted in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1474">Article 366</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1475">(iii)</a> interpretation
of amendments made to the Constitution which inserted new provisions, where the
Court always leant in favour of giving fullest effect to the substantive provisions,
this court has to adopt the same approach, to usher change, by plain, literal
construction. This court never whittled down the terminology through extrinsic
aids such as speeches made on the floor of the Parliament or Select Committee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_479">                                        117</span>


reports. In this instance, doing so would be giving effect to what Parliamentarians
said or Ministers said, ignoring thereby, the plain terms of the Constitution. As
stated earlier, the Court cannot assume that Parliament merely indicated a cosmetic
change by conferment of constitutional changes which could have been best
achieved by introducing <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1476">Article 338B.</a>
</p><p id="p_1422">168. Besides the judgment in Kihoto Hollohan (supra), this court, in
<a href="/doc/400294/" id="a_1477">Raghunathrao Ganpatrao v. Union of India133</a>, dwelt on the duty of this court, to
discern the meaning, and give effect to amendments to the Constitution. The court
quoted from Walter F. Murphy, who in Constitutions, Constitutionalism and
Democracy explained what an ‘amendment’ meant:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_365">     “Thus an amendment corrects errors of commission or omission,
     modifies the system without fundamentally changing its nature — that
     is, an amendment operates within the theoretical parameters of the
     existing Constitution.”

       This court then observed as follows:</blockquote><p id="p_1423">

</p><p id="p_1424">     “86. In our Constitution, there are specific provisions for amending
     the Constitution. The amendments had to be made only under and by
     the authority of the Constitution strictly following the modes
     prescribed, of course subject to the limitations either inherent or
     implied. The said power cannot be limited by any vague doctrine of
     repugnancy. There are many outstanding interpretative decisions
     delineating the limitations so that the constitutional fabric may not be
     impaired or damaged. The amendment which is a change or
     alteration is only for the purpose of making the Constitution more
     perfect, effective and meaningful. But at the same time, one should
     keep guard over the process of amending any provision of the
     Constitution so that it does not result in abrogation or destruction of
     its basic structure or loss of its original identity and character and
     render the Constitution unworkable. The court is not concerned with
     the wisdom behind or propriety of the constitutional amendment
     because these are the matters for those to consider who are vested

      with the authority to make the Constitutional amendment. All that the
      court is concerned with are (1) whether the procedure prescribed by
      <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1478">Article 368</a> is strictly complied with? and (2) whether the amendment
      has destroyed or damaged the basic structure or the essential features
      of the Constitution.”

</p><p id="p_1425">169. In his article Statutory Interpretation and Constitutional Legislation
(sourced from the Cambridge Repository’s Interpreting Constitutional Legislation
David Feldman134 states that at times, there is no clear indication why a statute or
amendment is introduced:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_366">    “Statutes usually carry on their faces no indication of the mischief at
    which they are aimed; they do not tell a story. Looking at the statute
    as a whole will not always help: many statutes are collections of knee-</blockquote><p id="p_1426">
    jerk reactions to a number of different stimuli, and the degree of
    coherence is further reduced where changes in government policy are
    given effect by amending earlier legislation drafted to give effect to
    different policies.”

The article then goes on to emphasize that the context, and the pre-existing regime
has to be considered, while interpreting the amendment or provision:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_367">      “Constitutional provisions establishing the state and its main
      institutions will often not be a response to a particular mischief. A
      state’s institutional design is more likely to reflect a political theory
      and idea of good government, as in the USA., or to be a result of
      gradual accretion, as in the UK, than to be a reaction to an
      identifiable problem. On the other hand, problems arising in the pre-
      constitutional period may have directly influenced the choice of
      political theory, and so have indirectly affected the distribution of
      responsibilities between institutions, the powers allocated to each
      institution, their relationships with each other, their powers, and
      forms of accountability.”

substantive amendments by the 102nd Amendment, the statement of objects and

 reasons is not precise. Even the Select Committee Report only voices that
 constitutional status is to be conferred upon the new Commission which would
 undertake its task and that the pattern existing with respect to SCs and STs would
 be followed. In these circumstances, given that the limited interpretation would
 virtually continue the status quo, this Court has to take into account the state of
 affairs which existed at the time of introduction of the amendment.
</p><p id="p_1428"> 171. The rationale for the amendment, highlighting the need for provisions such
 as <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1480">Article 338B</a><a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1481">, 342A</a> read with <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1482">Article 366(26C)</a> is that Parliament had the
 experience of about 71 years’ working of the Constitution and the system with
 respect to matters regarding identification of the most backward classes of
 communities, i.e., SCs and STs. By the 102nd Amendment, one commission for
 SEBCs was set up to meet the aspirations and expectations of the population of the
 country who might have become SEBCs for various reasons, to voice their
 concerns directly for consideration by the National Commission under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1483">Article
 338B</a>, which could then become the subject matter of inclusion under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1484">Article
 342A.</a>
</p><p id="p_1429">172. An offshoot of the 102ndAmendment possibly would be that dominant
 groups or communities, once included, as SEBCs by states would, due to their
 relative “forward” status, likely take a disproportionate share of state benefits of
 reservation in employment and admission benefits to state institutions. Their
 inclusion can well result in shrinkage of the real share of reservation benefits for
 the most backward. This consequence can be avoided, if a commission or body,
 such as the one under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1485">Article 338B</a> evolves and applies rational and relevant
 criteria.
</p><p id="p_1430"> 173. The existence of a permanent body, which would objectively, without being
 pressurised by the dust and din of electoral politics, consider the claims for
 inclusion, not based on ad-hoc criteria, but upon uniformly evolved criteria, with
 the aid of experts, in a scientific manner, be in consonance with the constitutional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_482">                                         120</span>


objectives of providing benefits to SEBCs, having regard to relative regional and
intra state levels of progress and development. Given all these factors, this Court is
of the opinion that the 102ndAmendment, by inserting 366(26C), 342A, 338B and
342A aligned the mechanism for identification of SEBCs with the existing
mechanism for identification of SCs/STs.
</p><p id="p_1431">174. At this stage, a word about <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1486">Article 338B</a> is necessary. Earlier, it was noticed
that this provision mirrors Articles 338 and 338A and sets out various provisions
for setting up a National Commission which is like its counterparts, in relation to
SCs and STs (Articles 338 and 338A). The consultative provisions under Articles
338B(7) and 338B(9) in the opinion of this Court, only imply that in matters of
identification, the States can make their recommendations. However, by reason of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1487">Article 342A</a>, it is the President, i.e. the Union Government only, whose decision is
final and determinative. The determination made for inclusion or exclusion can be
amended through a law made by Parliament alone. Given that <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1488">Article 338(B)(9)</a>
enjoins the State/UT to consult the Commission on all major policy matters
affecting SEBCs, this consultation cannot imply that the States’ view would be of
such weight, as to be determinative or final and submit. The States can by virtue of
<a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_1489">Article 338(7)</a> consider the report of the Commission and are obliged to table the
recommendations relating to them before their legislature. The State can even
voice its reservations and state why it cannot accept the report. Further, given the
imperative and categorical phraseology of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1490">Article 342A</a>, the final decision of
whether to include any caste or community in the list of SCBCs is that of the
Union Government, i.e. the President.
</p><p id="p_1432">175. This Court is also of the opinion that the change brought about by the 102 nd
Amendment, especially <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1491">Article 342A</a> is only with respect to the process of
identification of SEBCs and their list. Necessarily, the power to frame policies and
legislation with regard to all other matters, i.e. the welfare schemes for SEBCs,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_483">                                                     121</span>


setting up of institutions, grants, scholarships, extent of reservations and special
provisions under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1492">Article 15(4</a><a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_1493">), 15(5)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_1494">16(4)</a> are entirely with by the State
Government in relation to its institutions and its public services (including services
under agencies and corporations and companies controlled by the State
Government). In other words, the extent of reservations, the kind of benefits, the
quantum of scholarships, the number of schools which are to be specially provided
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1495">Article 15(4)</a> or any other beneficial or welfare scheme which is conceivable
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1496">Article 15(4)</a> can all be achieved by the State through its legislative and
executive powers. This power would include making suggestions and collecting
data – if necessary, through statutory commissions, for making recommendations
towards inclusion or exclusion of castes and communities to the President on the
aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1497">Article 342A.</a> This will
accord with the spirit of the Constitution under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1498">Article 338B</a> and the principle of
cooperative federalism135 which guides the interpretation of this Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1433">176. The President has not thus far prepared and published a list under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1499">Article

Re: Point No. 6 Whether, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1509">Article 342A</a> of the Constitution abrogates States
power to legislate or classify in respect of “any backward class of citizens” and
thereby affects the federal policy / structure of the Constitution of India?


</p><p id="p_1435">177. In W.P.938/2020, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Amol. B. Karande
urged that the provisions of the 102 nd Amendment, especially <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1510">Article 366(26C)</a> and
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1511">Article 342A</a> violate the essential features or the basic structure of the Constitution.
It was argued that these provisions impact the federal structure by denuding the
State of its power to fully legislate in favour of SEBCs under Entry 25 and Entry
41 of List II, and provide for reservations in favour of SEBCs. It was argued that
the power to identify and make suitable provisions in favour of SEBCs has always
been that of the States. This constitutional position was recognized in Indra
Sawhney (supra), when the Court required the State Government to set up
permanent Commissions. Through the impugned provisions, the President has now
been conferred exclusive power to undertake the task of identification of SEBCs
for the purposes of the Constitution. It was submitted that this strikes at the root of
the federal structure because it is the people who elect the members of the State
legislatures, who frame policies suitable for their peculiarly situated needs, having
regard to the demands of the region and its people.
</p><p id="p_1436">178. Learned counsel argued that the original Constitution had set apart the power
to identify SCs and STs and conferred it upon the President – after which,
amendment could be carried out by the Parliament. However, such a power was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_485">                                         123</span>


advisably retained so far as the States were concerned, with their executives and
legislatures. The deprivation of the States’ power strikes at the root of its
jurisdiction to ensure that its residents get suitable welfare measures in the form of
schemes applicable to SEBCs as well as reservations.
</p><p id="p_1437">179. Learned counsel relied upon certain passages of the judgment of this Court
in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_1512">Kesavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala136</a> to support the argument that without
submitting the amendment for rectification under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1513">Article 368(2</a>), to
the extent it denuded the State legislatures of their powers to make laws in respect
of various fields under the State List too, the amendment would be void.
</p><p id="p_1438">180. The Learned Attorney General who represented the Union argued that there
is no question of the 102nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1514">Amendment Act</a> or any of its provisions violating any
essential feature of the Constitution. It was submitted that unless the amendment in
question directly affects (i.e. takes away the legislative power altogether in the list
rather than a part of its content by amending any of the provisions in List II or List
III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution), there is no need for seeking
rectification of a majority of the statutes. The Attorney General relied upon a
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_1515">Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan137</a>.
</p><p id="p_1439">181. Two issues arise with respect to the validity of provisions inserted by the
102nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1516">Amendment Act</a>. The first is a facial challenge inasmuch as the petitioner
urges that without following the procedure indicated in the proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1517">Article
368(2</a>), i.e. seeking approval or ratification of atleast one half of the legislative
assemblies of all the States, the amendment is void. In this regard what is
noticeable is that direct amendments to any of the legislative entries in the three
lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution requires ratification. Thus, the
insertion of substantive provisions that might impact future legislation by the State
in an indirect or oblique manner would not necessarily fall afoul of the

136 1973 Supp. SCR 1
1371965 SCR (1) 933
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_486">                                         124</span>


Constitution for not complying with the procedure spelt out in the proviso to
<a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1518">Article 368(2).</a> In Sajjan Singh (supra), this Court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_368">     “The question which calls for our decision is: what would be the
     requirement about making an amendment in a constitutional provision
     contained in Part III, if as a result of the said amendment, the powers
     conferred on the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1519">Article 226</a> are likely to be
     affected?”

The Sajjan Singh court repelled the challenge, holding that

     “… Thus, if the pith and substance test is applied to the amendment
     made by the impugned Act, it would be clear that Parliament is
     seeking to amend fundamental rights solely with the object of
     removing any possible obstacle in the fulfilment of the socio-economic
     policy in which the party in power believes. If that be so, the effect of
     the amendment on the area over which the High Courts&#x27; powers
     prescribed by <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1520">Article 226</a> operate, is incidental and in the present
     case can be described as of an insignificant order. The impugned Act
     does not purport to change the provisions of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1521">Article 226</a> and it cannot
     be said even to have that effect directly or in any appreciable
     measure. That is why we think that the argument that the impugned
     Act falls under the proviso, cannot be sustained.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1440">182. The majority judgment, therefore decisively held that an interpretation
which hinges on indirect impact of a provision, the amendment of which needs
ratification of the states, does not violate the Constitution and that unless the
amendment actually deletes or alters any of the Entries in the three lists of the
Seventh Schedule, or directly amends an Article for which ratification is necessary,
recourse to the proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1522">Article 368 (2)</a> was not necessary.
</p><p id="p_1441">183. More recently, this issue was gone into in Kihoto Hollohan, where a
challenge on the ground that all provisions of an amendment which introduced the
Tenth Schedule were void for not following the procedure under the proviso to
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1523">Article 368</a>, were questioned. The Court proceeded to analyse every provision of
the Tenth Schedule and held that para 7, which excluded the jurisdiction of all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_487">                                        125</span>


Courts, had the effect of divesting the jurisdiction of Courts under Articles 226 and
32 of the Constitution. In other words, the direct result of the amendment was to
bar the jurisdiction of High Courts and thus, it directly impacted Chapter 5 of Part
VI; a ratification was required by a majority of the States. Since that procedure was
not followed, para 7 was held to be violative of the basic structure of the
Constitution. The Court applied the doctrine of severability and held that the other
parts of the amendment, contained in the Tenth Schedule did not need any such
ratification and that para 7 alone would be severed on the ground of its being
contrary to express constitutional provisions. This court ruled as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_369">     “59. In Sajjan Singh case [(1965) 1 SCR 933 : AIR 1965 SC 845] a
     similar contention was raised against the validity of the Constitution
     (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964 by which <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_1524">Article 31-A</a> was again
     amended and 44 statutes were added to the Ninth Schedule to the
     Constitution. The question again was whether the amendment
     required ratification under the proviso to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_1525">Article 368.</a> This Court
     noticed the question thus: (SCR p. 940)
              xxxxxx                xxxxxx                    xxxxxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_370">     76. The test of severability requires the Court to ascertain whether the
     legislature would at all have enacted the law if the severed part was
     not the part of the law and whether after severance what survives can
     stand independently and is workable. If the provisions of the Tenth
     Schedule are considered in the background of the legislative history,
     namely, the report of the ‘Committee on Defections’ as well as the
     earlier Bills which were moved to curb the evil of defection it would
     be evident that the main purpose underlying the constitutional
     amendment and introduction of the Tenth Schedule is to curb the evil
     of defection which was causing immense mischief in our body politic.
     The ouster of jurisdiction of courts under Paragraph 7 was incidental
     to and to lend strength to the main purpose which was to curb the evil
     of defection. It cannot be said that the constituent body would not
     have enacted the other provisions in the Tenth Schedule if it had
     known that Paragraph 7 was not valid. Nor can it be said that the rest
     of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule cannot stand on their own even
     if Paragraph 7 is found to be unconstitutional. The provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_488">                                         126</span>


     Paragraph 7 can, therefore, be held to be severable from the rest of
     the provisions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_371">     77. We accordingly hold on contentions (C) and (D):
     That there is nothing in the said proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1526">Article 368(2)</a> which
     detracts from the severability of a provision on account of the
     inclusion of which the Bill containing the amendment requires
     ratification from the rest of the provisions of such Bill which do not
     attract and require such ratification. Having regard to the mandatory
     language of <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1527">Article 368(2)</a> that ‘thereupon the Constitution shall
     stand amended’ the operation of the proviso should not be extended to
     constitutional amendments in a Bill which can stand by themselves
     without such ratification.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_372">     That accordingly, the Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act,
     1985, insofar as it seeks to introduce the Tenth Schedule in the
     Constitution of India, to the extent of its provisions which are
     amenable to the legal-sovereign of the amending process of the Union
     Parliament cannot be overborne by the proviso which cannot operate
     in that area. There is no justification for the view that even the rest of
     the provisions of the Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act,
     1985, excluding Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule become
     constitutionally infirm by reason alone of the fact that one of its
     severable provisions which attracted and required ratification under
     the proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1528">Article 368(2)</a> was not so ratified.
     That Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule contains a provision which is
     independent of, and stands apart from, the main provisions of the
     Tenth Schedule which are intended to provide a remedy for the evil of
     unprincipled and unethical political defections and, therefore, is a
     severable part. The remaining provisions of the Tenth Schedule can
     and do stand independently of Paragraph 7 and are complete in
     themselves workable and are not truncated by the excision of
     Paragraph 7.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1442">184. As far as the question of whether the amendment has the effect of violating
the basic or essential features so far as it impacts the federal structure of the
Constitution is concerned, what is noticeable is that past decisions have
emphasized that a mere change brought about through amendments howsoever
serious the impact, cannot per se be regarded as violative of the basic structure. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_489">                                         127</span>


Raghunathrao Ganpatrao (supra)138 the deletion of Articles 291 and 362 of the
Constitution, by amendment, was questioned on the ground that they affected the
basic structure, or essential features of the Constitution. This court rejected the
argument and held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_373">      “107. On a deep consideration of the entire scheme and content of the
      Constitution, we do not see any force in the above submissions. In the
      present case, there is no question of change of identity on account of
      the Twenty-sixth Amendment. The removal of Articles 291 and 362 has
      not made any change in the personality of the Constitution either in
      its scheme or in its basic features, or in its basic form or in its
      character. The question of identity will arise only when there is a
      change in the form, character and content of the Constitution. In fact,
      in the present case, the identity of the Constitution even on the tests
      proposed by the counsel of the writ petitioners and interveners,
      remains the same and unchanged.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1443">185. In N. Nagaraj (supra), this aspect was analysed in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_374">    “For a constitutional principle to qualify as an essential feature, it
    must be established that the said principle is a part of the
    constitutional law binding on the legislature. Only thereafter, the
    second step is to be taken, namely, whether the principle is so
    fundamental as to bind even the amending power of the Parliament,
    i.e. to form a part of the basic structure. The basic structure concept
    accordingly      limits     the     amending      power       of    the
    Parliament……………………….
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_375">             xxxxxx                   xxxxxx                    xxxxxx

      ……………..The values impose a positive duty on the State to ensure
      their attainment as far as practicable. The rights, liberties and
      freedoms of the individual are not only to be protected against the
      State, they should be facilitated by it. They are to be informed.</blockquote><p id="p_1444">
</p><p id="p_1445">      Overarching and informing of these rights and values is the principle
      of human dignity under the German basic law. Similarly, secularism is
      the principle which is the overarching principle of several rights and
      values under the Indian Constitution. Therefore, axioms like

138Ref. f.n. 104
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_490">                                         128</span>


     secularism, democracy, reasonableness, social justice etc. are
     overarching principles which provide linking factor for principle of
     fundamental rights like Articles 14, 19 and

     These principles are beyond the amending power of the Parliament.

</p><p id="p_1446">     xxxxxx                     xxxxxx                    xxxxxx

     Under the Indian Constitution, the word &#x27;federalism&#x27; does not exist in
     the preamble. However, its principle (not in the strict sense as in
     U.S.A.) is delineated over various provisions of the Constitution. In
     particular, one finds this concept in separation of powers under
     Articles 245 and 246 read with the three lists in the seventh schedule
     to the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_1447">     To conclude, the theory of basic structure is based on the concept of
     constitutional identity. The basic structure jurisprudence is a pre-
     occupation with constitutional identity.

</p><p id="p_1448">            xxxxxx                    xxxxxx                     xxxxxx

     The word &#x27;amendment&#x27; postulates that the old constitution survives
     without loss of its identity despite the change and it continues even
     though it has been subjected to alteration. This is the constant theme
     of the opinions in the majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati. To
     destroy its identity is to abrogate the basic structure of the
     Constitution. This is the principle of constitutional sovereignty.”

</p><p id="p_1449">186. Along similar lines, Krishna Iyer, J. had remarked as to what kind of an
amendment would be abhorrent and violate the basic structure in <a href="/doc/693176/" id="a_1529">Maharao Sahib
Shri Bhim Singhji v. Union of India139</a> in the following terms:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_376">     “Therefore, what is a betrayal of the basic feature is not a mere
     violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1530">Article 14</a> but a shocking, unconscionable or
     unscrupulous travesty of the quintessence of equal justice.”

</blockquote><p id="p_1450">187. By these parameters, the alteration of the content of state legislative power
in an oblique and peripheral manner would not constitute a violation of the concept
139(1981) 1 SCC 166
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_491">                                         129</span>


of federalism. It is only if the amendment takes away the very essence of
federalism or effectively divests the federal content of the constitution, and
denudes the states of their effective power to legislate or frame executive policies
(co-extensive with legislative power) that the amendment would take away an
essential feature or violate the basic structure of the Constitution. Applying such a
benchmark, this court is of the opinion that the power of identification of SEBCs
hitherto exercised by the states and now shifted to the domain of the President (and
for its modification, to Parliament) by virtue of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1531">Article 342A</a> does not in any
manner violate the essential features or basic structure of the Constitution. The
102nd Amendment is also not contrary to or violative of proviso to <a href="/doc/1389240/" id="a_1532">Article 368 (2)</a>
of the Constitution of India. As a result, it is held that the writ petition is without
merit; it is dismissed.

<p id="p_1451">Conclusions

</p><p id="p_1452">188.    In view of the above discussion, my conclusions are as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_377">       (1) Re Point No. 1: Indra Sawhney (supra) does not require to be referred to
          a larger bench nor does it require reconsideration in the light of
          subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social
          dynamics of the society, for the reasons set out by Ashok Bhushan, J. and

   contemplated by Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney’s case. I agree
   with the reasoning and conclusions of Ashok Bhushan, J. on this point.
(3) Re Point No. 3: I agree with Ashok Bhushan, J. that the State
   Government, on the strength of Maharashtra State Backward
   Commission Report chaired by M.C. Gaikwad has not made out a case of
   existence of extraordinary situation and exceptional circumstances in the
    State to fall within the exception carved out in Indra Sawhney.
(4) Re Point No 4:Whether the Constitution One Hundred and Second
   Amendment deprives the State Legislature of its power to enact a
   legislation determining the socially and economically backward classes
   and conferring the benefits on the said community under its enabling
    power?; and
(5) Re. Point No. 5 Whether, States’ power to legislate in relation to “any
   backward class” under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) is anyway abridged by
   <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_1533">Article 342(A)</a> read with <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_1534">Article 366(26c)</a> of the Constitution of India.
   On these two interrelated points of reference, my conclusions are as
    follows:
</p><p id="p_1455">(i) By introduction of Articles 366 (26C) and 342A through the 102 nd
Constitution of India, the President alone, to the exclusion of all other
authorities, is empowered to identify SEBCs and include them in a list to be
published under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1535">Article 342A (1</a>), which shall be deemed to include SEBCs
in relation to each state and union territory for the purposes of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1456">(ii) The states can, through their existing mechanisms, or even statutory
commissions, only make suggestions to the President or the Commission
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1536">Article 338B</a>, for inclusion, exclusion or modification of castes or
communities, in the list to be published under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1537">Article 342A (1).</a>
</p><p id="p_1457">(iii) The reference to the Central List in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1538">Article 342A (2)</a> is the one notified
by the President under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1539">Article 342A (1).</a> It is to be the only list for all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_493">                                   131</span>


purposes of the Constitution, in relation to each state and in relation to every
union territory. The use of the term “the Central List” is only to refer to the
list prepared and published under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1540">Article 342A (1</a>), and no other; it does not
imply that the states have any manner of power to publish their list of
SEBCs. Once published, under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1541">Article 342A (1</a>), the list can only be
amended through a law enacted by Parliament, by virtue of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1542">Article 342A (2).</a>
</p><p id="p_1458">(iv) In the task of identification of SEBCs, the President shall be guided by
the Commission set up under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1543">Article 338B;</a> its advice shall also be sought by
the state in regard to policies that might be framed by it. If the commission
prepares a report concerning matters of identification, such a report has to be
shared with the state government, which is bound to deal with it, in
accordance with provisions of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1544">Article 338B.</a> However, the final
determination culminates in the exercise undertaken by the President (i.e. the
Central Government, under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1545">Article 342A (1</a>), by reason of <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_1546">Article 367</a> read
with <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_1547">Section 3</a> (8) (b) <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_1548">General Clauses Act</a>).

</p><p id="p_1459">(v) The states’ power to make reservations, in favour of particular
communities or castes, the quantum of reservations, the nature of benefits
and the kind of reservations, and all other matters falling within the ambit of
Articles 15 and 16 – except with respect to identification of SEBCs, remains
undisturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_1460">(vi)   The Commission set up under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1549">Article 338B</a> shall conclude its task
expeditiously, and make its recommendations after considering which, the
President shall expeditiously publish the notification containing the list of
SEBCs in relation to states and union territories, for the purpose of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_1461">(vii) Till the publication of the notification mentioned in direction (vi), the
existing lists operating in all states and union territories, and for the purposes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_494">                                        132</span>


      of the Central Government and central institutions, continue to operate. This
      direction is issued under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_1550">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India.

   (6) Re Point No. 6: <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1551">Article 342A</a> of the Constitution by denuding States power
   to legislate or classify in respect of “any backward class of citizens” does not
   affect or damage the federal polity and does not violate the basic structure of the
   Constitution of India.
