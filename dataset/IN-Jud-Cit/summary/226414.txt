The appellant, Hindustan Lever Ltd, advertised its toothpaste "New Pepsodent" as "102% better than the leading toothpaste" in print, visual, and hoarding media.
The advertisement showed Pepsodent as 102% superior in killing germs compared to the toothpaste used by one of the boys in the advertisement.
The respondents, Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. and Miss Pallavi S. Desai, filed an injunction application against the appellant, alleging that the claim of anti-bacterial superiority was false and misleading.
The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission directed a panel of experts to give its opinion on the issue and passed a temporary interim injunction against the appellant from making any reference directly or indirectly in the appellant's advertisement claiming anti-bacterial superiority and also from making any "specific quantum" of anti-bacterial superiority until its claim of such anti-bacterial superiority is fully established.
The appellant contended before the Commission that the protocols adopted for testing the germ content were not uniform and that the complainant's protocols were not the correct ones.
Whether the order passed by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was a purely discretionary order and was also an interim order pending the passing of a final order of temporary injunction and is not liable to be interfered with in this appeal?
The Court held that the order passed by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was a purely discretionary order and was also an interim order pending the passing of a final order of temporary injunction and is not liable to be interfered with in this appeal.
The Court further held that any expression of opinion by this Court on merits at this preliminary stage could cause prejudice to the claims and contentions of one or other of the parties.
Therefore, the appeal was dismissed and there was no order as to costs.
