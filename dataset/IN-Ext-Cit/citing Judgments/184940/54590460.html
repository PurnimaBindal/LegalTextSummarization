                 I.A. 8355/2022

</p><p id="p_2">                 1.      This application has been filed by the defendant no. 1 seeking
                 amendment in the written statement to the effect that the ownership of
                 the plaintiffs in the copyright is disputed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                 2.      In the application, it is explained that the occasion of filing of
                 the amendment arose as the plaintiffs had filed certain agreements of
                 assignment in its favour in a sealed cover. These agreements were
                 disclosed to the defendants only pursuant to an order dated 14.01.2022
                 of this Court. The defendant no.1 is seeking to withdraw its admission
                 to the fact of the plaintiffs being the owner of the copyright in their
                 subject work, and to now dispute such ownership claimed by the
                 plaintiff on the basis of the Assignment Agreements, on the ground
                 that the Assignment Agreements are not enforceable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 3.      In support of the application, the learned senior counsel for the
                 defendant no.1/applicant places reliance on the judgment of the
                 Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/315007/" id="a_1">Om Prakash Gupta v. Ranbir B. Goyal</a>, (2002) 2
                 SCC 256, to submit that as the disclosure of the Assignment
                 Agreements was made subsequent to the filing of the suit, amendment
                 in the written statement ought to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                 4.      Placing reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
                 <a href="/doc/1849903/" id="a_2">Baldev Singh and Others v. Manohar Singh and Another</a>, (2006) 6
                 SCC 498, he further submits that the test to be applied to an
                 amendment in the Plaint, vis-a-vis to one made in a written statement

                 is substantially different; it is more liberal in case of an amendment
                 sought to be made in the written statement, inasmuch as, adding a new
                 ground of defence or substituting or altering a defence can be allowed
                 in a written statement as it does not amount to altering or substituting
                 a new cause of action.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                 5.      On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs,
                 placing reliance on the judgments of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/307092/" id="a_3">Heeralal v.
                 Kalyan Mal &amp; Ors</a>., (1998) 1 SCC 278; <a href="/doc/596572/" id="a_4">Gautam Sarup v. Leela Jetly
                 &amp; Ors</a>, (2008) 7 SCC 85; and <a href="/doc/123653482/" id="a_5">Ram Niranjan Kajaria v. Sheo Prakash
                 &amp; Ors</a>, (2018) 10 SCC 203, submits that an application seeking
                 amendment in the written statement so as to amount a withdrawal of
                 an earlier admission made, cannot be allowed. He submits that the
                 defendant no.1 is not merely trying to explain an admission made in
                 its written statement but is, in fact, wishing to withdraw the same.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                 6.      He further submits that the plea of the defendant no.1 that the
                 amendment was necessitated only upon the Assignment Agreements
                 being disclosed to the defendant no. 1, is also incorrect, inasmuch as,
                 these Assignment Agreements had been filed along with the Plaint,
                 albeit in a sealed cover; the defendant no. 1 never sought an inspection
                 of these documents prior to filing of the written statement. In fact, the
                 defendant no.1 went ahead and in unequivocal terms accepted the
                 copyright ownership of the plaintiffs in the work.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                 7.      He submits that, therefore, the plea of the agreements being
                 disclosed later is merely a ruse for supporting the withdrawal of the

                 statement.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                 8.      I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsels
                 for the parties. In the written statement filed by the defendant no.1, the
                 copyright ownership of the plaintiffs in its work, which is the subject
                 matter of the Plaint, was unequivocally admitted by the defendant
                 no.1. In this regard the following paragraphs from the Plaint and the

                                            that in a claim for injunction for
                                            copyright infringement, the Court ought
                                            to be mindful of these exceptions that
                                            have been prescribed within the scope
                                            of the Act, and the same cannot be
                                            ignored by assuming the existence of
                                            &quot;exclusivity&quot; in the favour of the
                                            Plaintiffs. In the case at hand, although
                                            it is not disputed that the Plaintiffs are
                                            owners of the Copyright in their works,
                                            this exclusivity is subject to the
                                            provisions mentioned under <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_18">section 52</a>
                                            of the Act, which specifically limit the

                                            schema. The Supreme Court in the case
                                            of <a href="/doc/184940/" id="a_19">Academy of General Education,

                                            it is specifically denied that the
                                            Defendant No. 1 has infringed upon any
                                            of the rights of the Plaintiffs. It is
                                            reiterated that the actions of the
                                            Defendant No. 1 are squarely covered
                                            under the exception created for
                                            research purposes under <a href="/doc/1247029/" id="a_23">Section

                                            regard, the Defendant No. 1 craves
                                            leave of the Hon‟ble Court to rely upon
                                            paragraphs 28 to 64 of the Preliminary
                                            Submissions above for the sake of
                                            brevity. Moreover, it is reiterated that
                                            based on the available data, it is evident
                                            that the Plaintiffs and especially
                                            Plaintiff No.1, have faced no monetary
                                            damage of loss of business due to the
                                            actions of the Defendant No. 1. Further,
                                            it is reiterated that the relevant market
                                            of publishers such as the Plaintiffs has

<p id="p_25">                 10.     Clearly, the said order did not direct opening of the sealed
                 cover, as this was not the prayer made by the defendant no.1.
                 However, the fact remains that the Assignment Agreements were duly
                 shared with the defendant no.1. This, however, cannot come to the aid
                 of the defendant no. 1 to contend that the amendment now sought to
                 be made is based on this subsequent event.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                 11.     The submission of the learned senior counsel for the defendant
                 no.1 that the amendment has been occasioned on account of disclosure
                 of the Assignment Agreements that were earlier kept in a sealed cover
                 at the behest of the plaintiffs, also cannot be accepted. Though the
                 plaintiffs had filed these agreements in a sealed cover, the defendant
                 no.1 did not seek inspection of the same prior to the filing of the
                 written statement. It can be presumed that the defendant no.1 did not
                 feel any necessity to inspect the said documents though they were on
                 record and were relied upon by the plaintiffs in support of their claim.
                 On the other hand, the defendant no.1 went ahead to categorically and
                 unequivocally admit to the copyright ownership of the plaintiffs. The
                 plea of the defendant no.1 that these agreements were later disclosed,
                 though may be correct, but such later disclosure was on own account
                 of and because of actions/in-actions of the defendant no.1 alone. The

                 claim liberty to withdraw from its admission made in the written
                 statement. It is not as if these agreements were later filed by the
                 plaintiffs and, therefore, would qualify as a subsequent event. As
                 noted hereinabove, the agreements were already on record and it was
                 for the defendant no.1 to seek inspection thereof prior to the filing of
                 the written statement, in case, they felt it was necessary to do so. The
                 judgment in Om Prakash Gupta (supra), therefore, also cannot be of
                 any assistance to the defendant no.1/applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                 12.     Further, the amendments now sought to be made in the written
                 statement by the defendant no.1, do not merely state that on inspection
                 of these Assignment Agreements, certain deficiencies have been found
                 which may put the ownership of the plaintiffs in the copyright to any
                 jeopardy, but only seek to withdraw the unequivocal admission
                 regarding the plaintiffs&#x27; being the copyright owners of the subject
                 work. The amendment is not in nature of a clarification or an
                 explanation to the admission made in the written statement; it seeks a
                 complete withdrawal of the said admission.

<p id="p_28">                 13.     In Heeralal (supra), the Supreme Court has held that by way of
                 an amendment, an admission of the defendants cannot be allowed to
                 be withdrawn, if such withdrawal amounts to totally displacing the
                 case of the plaintiff and would cause him irretrievable prejudice. The
                 Supreme Court, in Gautam Sarup (supra), reiterated that a categorical
                 admission cannot be resiled from but, in a given case, it may be
                 explained or clarified; a defendant is entitled to take an alternative
                 plea, however, such a plea cannot be mutually destructive of each

<p id="p_29">                 14.     In Ram Niranjan Kajaria (supra), the Supreme Court held that
                 an amendment in the written statement can be sought for introduction
                 of new facts or for explanations or clarification of an admission or for
                 taking an alternative position, however, a categorical admission made
                 in the pleadings cannot be permitted to be withdrawn by way of an
                 amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                 15.     In the present case, as is evident from the written statement filed
                 by the defendant no.1, the defendant no.1 has categorically admitted to
                 the copyright ownership of the plaintiffs in the work. In the
                 amendment that is now sought, the defendant no.1 does not seek to
                 only clarify or explain the said admission, but seeks to withdraw the
                 same in full, while challenging the ownership of the plaintiff in the
                 copyright work. Applying the above principles as laid down by the
                 Supreme Court, such withdrawal of admission cannot be allowed to be
                 made by the defendant no.1.

                 on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Baldev Singh (supra), also
                 cannot be accepted. The Supreme Court was considering a case where
                 a plea of limitation was sought to be raised as an additional defence by
                 the defendants. It was held that adding a new ground or substituting or
                 altering a defence does not amount to altering or substituting a new
                 cause of action. However, the present is not a case of merely adding a
                 new ground, or substituting, or altering a defence; it is to withdraw a
