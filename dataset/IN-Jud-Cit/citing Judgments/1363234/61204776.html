JUDGMENT
</pre>	
<p id="p_1">(T.MATHIVANAN, J.)		

		Invoking the provisions of Clause 15 of Letters Patent,  this memorandum of grounds of  Writ Appeal  is preferred  by the Government challenging the order, dated 9.6.2010  and made in the writ petition in W.P.No.10323 of 2008 on the file of this Court.  
</p>		
<p id="p_2">		2. The respondent  herein  has filed a writ  petition in W.P.No.10323 of 2008 under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India  to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus   calling for the records  of the first appellant in Letter No.17689/H2/2007-6, dated  24.3.2008 and quash the same  and consequently, directing  the respondents to apply the principle for determining  the  seniority  between general candidates  and reserved candidates laid down  by the Apex Court in the decision reported in   AIR 1996 SC 1189  while implementing  G.O.3(D)  No.2 Commercial Taxes  and Registration (H2)  Department, dated   12.3.2007  by  reworking  the panels   for promotion  and refixing   consequential seniority  in the posts of Sub Registrar Grade II,  Sub Registrar Grade I and District Registrar  and further antedate  the date of promotion of the  petitioner as Sub Registrar   Grade I  and promote  the  petitioner as District Registrar with all consequential benefits from the date on which his junior  reserved  candidate  was promoted.  
</p>		
<p id="p_3">		3. This writ petition  was resisted  by the appellants/respondents  by filing their counter affidavit. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">		4. After   hearing both sides,  the learned Single Judge of this Court   had proceeded to  allow the writ petition   and the impugned Letter, dated 24.3.2008  was set aside. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">		5. Challenging the above order, dated  9.6.2010, the appellants being the respondents in the above  writ petition  stand before this Court  with this writ appeal.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">		6. According to the  respondent/petitioner,  he had joined  in the Registration Department  as  a Junior Assistant  on  1.3.1974  and subsequently,  promoted to the post of Assistant.   The next  higher post  is   Sub Registrar-Grade II.  The Special Rules  for the said post stipulates   that  a person should have   put   in  8 years of total service   including  two years as Assistant.  He had completed   two years of service  as Assistant   on 18.7.1979 and  completed   8 years  of total service   as required   under Rules  for  promotion to the post of  Sub Registrar Grade II  on 28.2.1982.  Therefore,  he was eligible to be  empanelled  for promotion   to the post  of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II  for the year1982-83 itself.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">		7. The appellants/respondents while effecting   promotion from the post of Assistant  to the post of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II, had  considered the persons on the basis of  seniority  in the grade of Assistant and not  in the grade of Junior Assistant.   
</p>
<p id="p_8">		8. In these circumstances,  a similarly placed person had filed an Original Application in O.A.No.392 of 1989   before the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal seeking a direction  for inclusion of  his name in the list  of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II  prepared for the years  1975-1983  on the basis of seniority in the post of Junior Assistant.  This petition was allowed  on  27.8.1993 and the Tribunal had  directed the appellants/respondents  to consider  the applicant for promotion  on the basis of combined seniority  of  Junior Assistants  and other  eligible categories.   
</p>
<p id="p_9">		9. A Special Leave Petition  preferred  by the Government of Tamil Nadu before the Supreme Court of India against the above said order was also dismissed  and in consequence thereof,  the order passed in O.A.No.392 of 1989   was implemented    in respect of the applicant therein, vide, G.O.Ms.No.350, dated 31.10.1994.  
</p>
<p id="p_10">		10. The Respondent/Petitioner belongs to General category.  When promotions are effected  to the post of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II, communal reservation was followed.  By applying such rules of reservation, the members  of the reserved  community  are given  accelerated  promotion ahead of  seniors  belonging  to the general category.   When the senior candidates belonging to general category get promoted,  he automatically retains their seniority over their junior candidates belonging to reserved category, despite the fact that  the latter was promoted   much earlier   on the basis of  communal  reservation.   This proposition is laid down by the Apex Court in  <a href="/doc/757653/" id="a_3">Ajit Singh Januja vs. State  of  Punjab</a>  (AIR  1996 Supreme Court 1189) and  this principle is known as Catch Up rule. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">		11. Some of the persons, who had  similarly  placed  like that  of  the respondent/petitioner  had also filed Original Applications before the Tribunal and the same were allowed   by a common order  by relying on the earlier order, dated 27.8.1993 passed  in O.A.No.392 of 1989, whereas a batch of writ petitions   filed  by the Government  as against the said order were also  dismissed  by this Court  on 24.2.2005.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">		12. The first appellant/first respondent  by the Government Order in G.O. (3D)  No.2, dated  12.3.2007   had decided to extend the benefit  of  the order  in O.A.No.392 of 1989  to all similarly placed persons.  
</p>
<p id="p_13">		13. In  this connection,   the respondent/petitioner  had made  a detailed  representation  on  7.4.2007  for  early implementation  of  G.O.(3D) No.2, dated  12.3.2007 and also to follow  the law laid down  by the Apex Court  in Ajit Singh's case.   
</p>
<p id="p_14">		14. Since  his  representation  was not considered  by the appellants/respondents, the respondent/petitioner  had filed the writ petition in W.P.No.24302 of 2007   seeking a direction  to the first appellant/respondent  to consider  and  pass appropriate orders  on the petitioner's representation, dated  7.4.2007. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">		15. After hearing both sides, this Court  in its order, dated  19.7.2007  had directed the first appellant/respondent  to consider the above representation on merits and in accordance with law.   But  unfortunately, after the lapse of several days,  the first appellant/respondent  had passed an order  on  24.3.2008 rejecting the representation made  by the petitioner, dated 7.4.2007  for  refixation of his seniority  and consequential promotion.  Hence,  the respondent   had approached this Court  with the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_16">		16. The appellants/respondents have contended that  the Sub Registrar-Grade-II  is being filled up  by  both direct recruitment  as well as  by recruitment by transfer.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">		17. The then existing Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Registration Subordinate Service, prescribes  eight  years of service including  two years  as Assistant as one of the qualifications to be appointed as  Sub Registrar-Grade-II by recruitment by transfer. Subsequently, the said Rule  was  amended by the Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.33, Commercial Taxes and Religious Endowments Department, dated  24.2.1999 to the  effect that   one must have served as Assistant   in the Religious Department for a period of not less than two years on  duty. Even before the said amendment, the panels of Sub Registrars-Grade-II  were drawn taking into account the seniority   in the post of Assistant only.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">		18. The appellants have also admitted that one Thiru. V. Narayanan  had filed an original application before the Administrative Tribunal  in O.A.No.392 of 1989  and the Tribunal while passing the order  on  27.8.1993  had issued a  direction that  the applicant's case should be dealt with, with reference to his  seniority  in the combined cadre of Junior Assistant, Typist, Steno-Typist and Assistant  based on the date of initial appointment   in the category or  entry into service  and that his seniority  should be determined   with reference to his place and his promotion also be considered  with reference to such seniority  and his pay  should be fixed  as if he was promoted  when his immediate junior on this basis  was promoted   subject to drawal of such pay from the date of appointment   to the post of Sub Registrar.  
</p>
<p id="p_19">		19. They have also  admitted that the Special Leave Petition filed  by the Government before the Apex Court  was also dismissed on 23.9.1994 on the ground of delay.  Ultimately, the order  of the Tribunal, dated  27.8.1993  and made in O.A.No.392 of 1989   was implemented in G.O.Ms.No.350, Commercial Taxes and Religious Endowments Department, dated 31.10.1994. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">		20. The appellants/respondents  have also admitted the fact that consequent to the above said order of the Government,  some of the individuals  and the Tamil Nadu Registration Department Ministerial Service Association  had filed writ petitions  before this Court  praying to extend the benefit of the order passed  by the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal in  O.A.No.392 of 1989. While disposing the above said writ petitions,  this Court had directed  the appellants to consider  the representation of the petitioner therein  in the light of the order passed  by the Tribunal in O.A.No.392 of 1989, dated  27.8.1993  and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">		21. In pursuant to the  direction of this Court,  the Government had  decided to extend the benefit of the order of the Administrative Tribunal, dated  27.8.1993 passed in O.A.No.392 of 1989 to the similarly  placed  persons  and ordered accordingly in G.O.(3D) No.2 Commercial Taxes and Registration Department,  dated  12.3.2007.   
</p>
<p id="p_22">		22. As per the direction of this Court, dated 19.7.2007 and made in W.P.No.24302 of 2007 filed  by the respondent/petitioner seeking a direction to the appellants/respondents  to consider his representation, dated 7.4.2007, the Government had examined  the request of the respondent/petitioner and rejected the same vide Letter No.17689/H2/2007-6, dated 24.3.2008.  
</p>
<p id="p_23">		23. In  this connection,  the appellants/respondents have contended that the request of the respondent/petitioner  for revision of seniority  was also examined  by virtue of the orders  issued in G.O(3D) No.2, Commercial Taxes  and Registration Department, dated   12.3.2007 and since none of the  juniors belonging to the   General Category (O.C. Turn)  has been appointed/promoted   as Sub Registrar-Grade-II  prior to the date of promotion of the petitioner, his request  was turned down. 
</p>

<p id="p_24">		24. The appellants/respondents have also made reference to the decision of the Apex Court  in  <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_4">Indra Sawhney vs Union of India</a> ((1992) Supp (3) SCR  217 : (1992 AIR SCV 3682).
</p>
<p id="p_25">		25. In this case, the Apex Court has observed that, We also hold that the reservation of appointments or post under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_5">Article 16(4)</a> is confined  to initial appointment  only and cannot extend to provide reservation in the matter of promotion.  If the Government feels that for ensuring adequate representation  of Backward Class of citizens in the service, class/category, it is necessary  to provide for direct recruitment therein, it shall be open to do so. But the reservation in the matter of promotion  was permitted for the period of five years  from the date of judgment, i.e., from 16.11.1992 to 15.11.1997.

</p><p id="p_26">		26. Based on Indra Sawhney, the appellants/respondents have contended that  the respondent/petitioner  had joined  as Junior Assistant  on  1.3.1974  and was promoted as Assistant  on 19.3.1977. He was subsequently, appointed as  Sub Registrar-Grade-II  by recruitment by transfer on 1.2.1990 and was promoted  as  Sub Registrar-Grade-I  on  11.11.1997.  His name was included in the panel of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II for the year 1989-90 as Sl.No.12 in O.C. turn. The persons junior to the petitioner belonging  to the same community  have not been promoted  as Sub Registrar-Grade-II prior to the date of petitioner's promotion. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">		 27. As  the Supreme Court  had upheld all the panels drawn  following the rule of reservation prior to 16.11.1992 and permitted  to follow the same upto  15.11.1997  and as the petitioner got  promotion  prior to 15.11.1997, the judgment cited  by the petitioner will not apply to this case. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">		28. It is also the case of the appellants/respondents that as per  Rule 35(1)  of the General rules  for Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service,  application for the revision of seniority  of a person in a service, class, category or grade  shall be submitted  to the appointing authority within a period of three years from the date of appointment  to such service, class, category or grade  or within a period of three years from the date of order of fixing seniority, as the case may be. But the petitioner did not submit  his representation  within three years  either from the date of his promotion  or from the date in which  the order of  the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal   was  implemented.   Hence, his representation, dated  7.4.2007  was rejected as it did not satisfy  the time limit  as specified  in the Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">		29. Besides this, the appellants/respondents  have further contended that though  the petitioner was eligible  to be considered for promotion as Sub Registrar-Grade-II for the year 1982-83, he did not reach  the zone of selection  for promotion  then. As per Rule 2(a)(i_  of the Tamil Nadu Registration Subordinate Service Rules, appointment  to the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-I shall be made from Sub Registrar -Grade-II.  In the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II, appointment is being made  by direct recruitment and by recruitment by transfer from Ministerial Service. Sub Registrar-Grade-I  is the promotional post and promotion is being made from the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II, which is the feeder category, to the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-I from the same service. Hence, the petitioner's seniority could  be reckoned  only from this position in the seniority  list of the Sub Registrar-Grade-II and not his seniority in Ministerial Service. 
</p>
<p id="p_30">		30. Eventually,  the appellants have made stress on the point that since the respondent/petitioner  has got promotion prior to 15.11.1997 and persons junior  to  the petitioner belonging  to his community have not been promoted  prior to the date of petitioner's promotion,  they have urged to dismiss the writ petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">		31. The learned Single Judge of this Court placing reliance mainly upon Ajit Singh's Case  has allowed the writ petition with the following observation:-
</p>
<p id="p_32">		With regard to the submission made  by the learned Additional Government Pleader  that the dictum laid down in AJITH SINGH's case cannot be made applicable   to the facts of this case  since the promotion of  Sub Registrar-Grade-I  was given to the petitioner  prior to 15.11.1997 i.e.,k within the period of five years from the date of Judgment in INDRA SAWHNEY's case,  I am not inclined  to accept the same, because  the actual issue involved  in the present case is, after reaching  the higher promotional post, whether any  further accelerated  promotion could  be  given to  the juniors  by applying  the communal roster system, so far  as the Backward Class community candidates  are concerned,  by placing the juniors above  the  senior general category candidates. The dictum laid down in  AJITH SINGH's case  clearly says that, such a  promotion, by placing the roster  point  promotee above the senior general category candidate, will  be violative of Articles 14 and 16(1)  of the Constitution of  India.  As contended  by the learned counsel for the petitioner, there would be only  accelerated  promotion, but not  accelerated seniority. Therefore, in  my  considered  opinion, the relief sought for by the petitioner has to be allowed. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">		32. Mr.R. Ravichandran, learned Additional Government Pleader  appearing for the appellants, while advancing his  arguments   has highlighted   the following  points  in support of  his contentions:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">		a. None of the juniors  belonging to General Category  were neither appointed  nor  promoted  as Sub Registrar prior  to the date of promotion  of the  respondent/petitioner and that the request of the respondent/petitioner  for revision of seniority  was examined by virtue  of  order issued in G.O.(3D) No.2 Commercial Taxes and Registration Department, dated 12.3.2007 and rejected. 									
</p><p id="p_35">		b. <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_6">In Indra Sawhney vs Union of India</a> (1992) Supp. (3) SCR 217  : (1992) AIR SCV 3682),the Supreme Court  had upheld  all panels drawn following  the rule of reservation  prior to 16.11.1992 and permitted to follow the same upto 15.11.1997  and as the respondent got promotion  prior to 15.11.1997, the request of the respondent was not justified for  consideration. 
</p>
<p id="p_36">		c. As per Rule  35(1) of  the General Rules for Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service, the respondent had not  submitted   his  representation within a period of three years from the date of order  of fixing the seniority. Instead, he had submitted his representation only on 7.4.2007 after a period of  12 years   and his representation also did not satisfy  the rule regarding the time limit  as specified in the Tamil Nadu  State and Subordinate Service Rules and on account of this reason, the impugned Letter, dated  24.3.2008 in Lr.No.17689/H2/2007-6 was certainly in accordance  with law as well as within the ambit of  the decision of the Apex Court   in  <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_7">Indra Sawhney vs Union of India</a>, cited supra. 
</p><p id="p_37">													33. Mr.Ravichandran, learned Additional Government Pleader  has also contended that as per the then existing  Special Rules,  for  Tamil Nadu Registration Subordinate Service, eight years of service  including two years as Assistant   as one of the qualifications for consideration    for appointment  as Sub Registrar-Grade-II   by  recruitment by transfer   was very much essential.  Thereafter, by virtue of  G.O.Ms.No.33 Commercial Taxes  and Religious  Endowments Department, dated  24.2.1989, the said Rule was amended   to the effect that  one must have served  as Assistant  in the Registration Department, for a period not less than  two years on duty.   
</p>
<p id="p_38">		34. He has also  pointed out that  even  before the said amendment, the panels of  Sub Registrar-Grade-II  were drawn  only on the basis of  seniority  in the post of  Assistant only.   However,  he has  fairly conceded  that  in view of the order   of the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal, dated  27.8.1993 and made in  O.A.No.392 of 1989, the said order was implemented   in the  Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.350 Commercial Taxes and Religious Endowments Department, dated  31.10.1994, after the dismissal of the Special Leave Petition filed by the Government against the said order.   
</p>
<p id="p_39">		35. It is manifested  from the records that  the Government  had decided  in view of the direction of this Court  as well as the order passed by the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal  in O.A.No.392 of 1989, dated 27.8.1993 to extend the benefit of the order  of the  Administrative Tribunal, to the similarly placed  persons  and  accordingly, the Government had passed the order in G.O.(3D) No.2 Commercial Taxes  and Registration (H2) Department, dated 12.3.2007. 
</p>
<p id="p_40">		36. The learned Additional Government Pleader  has also indicated that Rule 35(f)  of the General Rules  for revision of seniority, which prescribes  the limitation period  of three years was not considered  by the learned Single  Judge  and therefore, he has urged  to set aside the impugned order.  
</p>
<p id="p_41">		37. It is also significant to note here that the learned Additional Government Pleader has submitted that the promotions to the reserved category had been made  in accordance with the  judgment of the Apex Court  in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_8">Indra Sawhney vs Union of India</a>, cited supra,  and that the respondent/petitioner  was not  having any competency  to question the act of the appellants.  
</p>
<p id="p_42">		38. On the other hand, Mr.Karthic Rajan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/petitioner  has submitted that the law laid down  by  the Apex Court   in  Ajit Singh's case  (AIR 1996 Supreme Court 1189) still holds good  in so far as the members of other backward classes are concerned, because they are the  beneficiaries of accelerated promotions.  
</p>
<p id="p_43">		39. Mr.Karthic Rajan, has  made  a classic example  with reference to the injustice  done  to the respondent/petitioner.  He has adverted to that the respondent/petitioner, who had joined as  Junior Assistant   on  1.3.1974,  was promoted  as  Assistant  on  19.3.1977.  He had completed  eight years of total service  including  two years in the post of  Assistant   on 28.2.1982 and as such  he was eligible  to be considered for promotion as Sub Registrar for the year 1982-83. But  the petitioner was promoted as Sub Registrar-Grade-II only on 1.2.1990 and later on as Sub Registrar-Grade-I on  11.11.1997. 
</p>
<p id="p_44">		40. According to Mr. Karthic Rajan, one  Syed Azizullah, who belonged to backward community  was promoted  as  Sub Registrar-Grade-II in the year 1986  by applying the communal roster. In the case of the respondent/petitioner, upon his petitioner's  promotion to the same grade of Sub Registrar-Grade-II  in 1990, he ought to have been placed  over and above the reserved candidate even though he was promoted  four years earlier.
</p>
<p id="p_45">		41. Secondly,  Mr.Karthic Rajan has contended that  one Mrs.T. Vijayalakshmi, who had joined  as Junior Assistant  on 11.3.1974  was promoted  as  Sub Registrar-Grade-II  by applying the communal reservation. Thereafter,  she was further promoted    as Sub Registrar-Grade-I and District Registrar on 2.2.2001 itself due to her seniority  position   obtained due  to accelerated  promotion by virtue of reservation.   
</p>
<p id="p_46">		42. In order to fortify his contention, he has furnished a comparative chart/tabular column showing the service  particulars of the respondent  with that of  his junior  Mrs. T. Vijayalakshmi, which is shown as  under:-
</p>

			
<p id="p_47">Name

</p><p id="p_49">116, dt. 22.6.2010
																					
</p><p id="p_50">		43. From the above tabular column, it is explicit that  the respondent/petitioner  is  senior to Mrs.T.Vijayalakshmi, a reserved category candidate.  But she was promoted   ahead of the respondent  as Sub Registrar-Grade-II by applying the rule of reservation. 
</p>
<p id="p_51">		44. It  is also made clear that  the respondent/petitioner, a General Category candidate,  was subsequently promoted as Sub Registrar-Grade-II in the normal course after four years from the date of promotion of the junior, who is the reserved category candidate. 
</p>
<p id="p_52">		45. With reference to this, Mr. Karthic Rajan has contended that the seniority in the grades  of Sub Registrar-Grade-II or Grade-I were not finalised or crystallised since the issue of manner of promotion  to the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II  was  the subject matter of  litigation and on the basis of the  order passed  by this Court in individual cases, the appellants took a  policy decision, vide G.O.(3D) Commercial Taxes and Registration Department, dated 12.3.2007, which clearly directs that the seniority of similarly  placed persons  holding the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II is to be revised in line   with the orders  passed  by this Court with regard to  the manner of preparation of panel  for the said post. 
</p>
<p id="p_53">		46. Obviously, till 2007,  the seniority in the grade of Sub Registrar was not drawn and was in a state of flux.  In fact, no  seniority  list was published  and communicated  in the manner known to law. 
</p>
<p id="p_54">		47. As pointed out by Mr. Karthic Rajan, the seniority  of Sub Registrar-Grade-II   was never finalised   and was in a state of flux.   The appellants/respondents vide G.O.Ms.No.(3D) No.2, dated  12.3.2007 directed the revision of seniority based on certain  orders  of  this Court  with regard to the manner  of  preparation  of panel for promotion to the post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II, which instigated the respondent/petitioner to make a representation to the appellants, dated 7.4.2007 to apply the principle of Catch Up rules  while recasting  the seniority  as directed in the Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.(3D) No.2, dated 12.3.2007. 
</p>
<p id="p_55">		48. Under these circumstances, the representation  made by the respondent/petitioner was rejected  on 24.3.2008 and immediately thereafter,  on 22.4.2008, he had filed a writ petition in W.P.No.10323 of 2008 challenging the rejection of the order and hence, the contention of bar  on the ground of limitation does not arise in this case.   
</p>
<p id="p_56">		49. Though the appellants/respondents had  raised such a contention of bar of limitation  in their counter affidavit, it was not at all urged before the learned Single Judge and that the learned Single Judge  had also rightly  rejected  the contentions put forth  on behalf of the  appellants/respondents after upholding the principle of Catch Up rules as decided by the Apex Court   in Ajit Singh's case. 
</p>
<p id="p_57">		50. With regard to the issue of limitation of three years we find that  it may be appropriate  to make reference  to the decision  in <a href="/doc/408851/" id="a_9">Daman Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (1985 (2) SCC 670). 
</p>
<p id="p_58">		51. In paragraph No.13 of the above decision,  the Apex Court  has observed that, ....... It is no unusual for parties and counsel  to raise  innumerable grounds  in  the petitions and memoranda  of appeal etc., but, later, confine themselves, in the course of argument to a few only of those  grounds, obviously  because the rest  of  the grounds are considered  even by them  to be untenable.  No party or counsel  is thereafter entitled to make a grievance  that the grounds  not argued  were not  considered.  If  indeed  any ground  which was argued  was not considered  it should be open to the party  aggrieved  to draw the attention of the court making  the order to it by filing  a proper application   for review or clarification.

</p><p id="p_59">		52. The observation made  by the Apex Court  would clarify  the proposition  that  though the appellants had raised  the contention of  bar of limitation in their counter statement, they had failed to urge the issue before the learned Single Judge while advancing arguments  during the hearing of the writ petition and therefore, the appellants are totally dis-entitled  to question the order of the learned Single Judge on the issue of limitation.  
</p>
<p id="p_60">		53. Similar  view has also been taken  by the  Division Bench of this Court   in the writ appeal in W.A.No.93 of 2007, dated  5.6.2007 (<a href="/doc/1685293/" id="a_10">P. Saraswathi vs. District Elementary Educational Officer</a>). 
</p>
<p id="p_61">		54. From the materials available on record, we find that the respondent/petitioner had not questioned  the accelerated promotion  granted to the junior  reserved category candidates ahead of him.  He had only  questioned  the grant of accelerated seniority, which is totally impermissible.   
</p>
<p id="p_62">		55. It is also to be pointed out that Indra Sawhney's case deals only with  the issue of  accelerated promotion and not on the issue of  accelerated seniority.   
</p>
<p id="p_63">		56. On the other hand, in Ajit Singh and others (II)  vs State of Punjab  and others ((1999) 7 SCC 209), the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court  has  considered the issue  as to whether  the accelerated promotion   could be coupled with accelerated seniority.   
</p>
<p id="p_64">		57. In this case, the following three issues  were arisen for consideration.  
</p>
<p id="p_65">		a. Can the roster-point  promotees (reserved category)  count  their seniority  in the promoted  category  from the date of their continuous officiation  vis-a-vis  general candidates   who were senior  to them in the lower category  and who were later  promoted  to the same level? 
</p>
<p id="p_66">		b. <a href="/doc/113526/" id="a_11">Have Union of India vs. Virpal Singh</a> ((1995) 6 SCC 684) and  <a href="/doc/757653/" id="a_12">Ajit Singh Januja vs. State of Punjab</a> ((1996) 2 Scc 715) been correctly  decided  and  has <a href="/doc/1361237/" id="a_13">Jagdish  Lal  vs. State of Haryana</a> ((1997) 6 SCC 538) been correctly decided? 
</p>
<p id="p_67">		c. Whether the catch-up principles  contended  for by the general candidates  are tenable?
</p>
<p id="p_68">		58. While referring to the contentions raised by a Senior Counsel Shri D.D.Thakur, the Constitution Bench with regard to the interpretation  of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_14">Article 16(4)</a>  has observed  in paragraph Nos.17 and 18  as  under:-
</p>
<p id="p_69">	17. We shall at the outset deal with the contention raised by Shri D. D. Thakur, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the reserved candidates that <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_15">Article 16(4)</a> must be interpreted keeping in mind the conditions prevailing fifty years ago when the Constitution was drafted and when <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_16">Article 16(4)</a> was incorporated in the Constitution. Learned counsel submitted that the founding fathers were conscious that a special provision for reservation was a necessary to see that the backward classes of citizens were adequately represented in the services. Hence an interpretation whichwould advance the said objective must be applied. Reliance was also placed on the Statement of Objects and Reasons in connection with the incorporation of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_17">Article 16(4-A).</a> In fact, all the learned counsel appearing for the reserved candidates contended that the said officers could not be treated as equals to the general candidates and that their backwardness and past social oppression must be borne in mind. 
</p><p id="p_70">	18. Nobody can deny that the above approach is the proper one while dealing with the reserved classes. The primary purpose of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_18">Article 16(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_19">Article 16(4-A)</a> is due representation of certain classes in certain posts. However, we must bear in mind and not ignore that there are other provisions, namely, Articles 14, 16(1) and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_20">Article 335</a> of the Constitution which are also very important. The Constitution has laid down in Articles 14 and 16(1) the permissible limits of affirmative action by way of reservation under Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A). While permitting reservations at the same time, it has also placed certain limitations by way of Articles 14 and 16(1)so that there is no reverse discrimination. It has also incorporated <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_21">Article 335</a> so that the efficiency of administration is not jeopardised. 
</p>
		
<p id="p_71">		59. Further,  in paragraph No.67, the Constitution Bench has observed  as under:-
</p>	
<p id="p_72">		67. Learned Senior Counsel Shri K. Parasaran contended that Indra Sawhney (<a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_22">Indra Sawhney v. Union of India</a>, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385) permitted reservations in promotions for a further period of 5 years and that during that period <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_23">Article 16(4-A)</a> was incorporated in Part III of the Constitution and, therefore, the concept of seniority attached to the roster promotion, as per certain rulings then in force, must be deemed to continue and deemed to be permissible in view of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_24">Article 16(4-A).</a> We may point out that Indra Sawhney (<a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_25">Indra Sawheny v. Union of India</a>, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1 :(1992) 22 ATC 385) did not have to go into issues relating to seniority and on the other hand it referred to the principle of balancing <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_26">Article 16(4)</a> against the rights of the individual under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_27">Article 16(1).</a> It is, therefore, not possible to accept that the 5-year rule and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_28">Article 16(4-A)</a> would keep out the applicability of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_29">Article 16(1)</a> to test the validity of any circular, order or rulewhich conferred seniority on the roster-point promotees. 


</p><p id="p_73">		60. With regard to  the Prospectivity of  Ajit Singh's case, (Ajit Singh and others (II) vs. State of Pubjab and others ((1999) 7 SCC 209), the Constitution Bench in paragraph Nos.91 and 92  has observed as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_74">		91. We have accepted, while dealing with Points 1 and 2 that the reserved candidates who get promoted at two levels by roster points (say) from Level 1 to Level 2 and Level 2 to Level 3 cannot count their seniority at Level 3 as against senior general candidates who reached Level 3 before the reserved candidates moved up to Level 4. The general candidate has to be treated as senior at Level 3. 					
</p><p id="p_75">		92. Where before 1-3-1996, i.e. the date of Ajit Singh judgment (<a href="/doc/757653/" id="a_30">Ajit Singh Januja v.State of Punjab</a>, (1996) 2 SCC 715 : 1996 SCC (L&amp;S) 540 : (1996) 33 ATC 239) at Level 3, there were reserved candidates who reached there earlier and also senior general candidates who reached there later (but before the reserved candidate was promoted to Level 4) and when in spite of the fact that the senior general candidate had to be treated as senior at Level 3 (in view of Ajit Singh (<a href="/doc/757653/" id="a_31">Ajit Singh Januja v.State of Punjab</a>,(1996) 2 SCC 715 : 1996 SCC (L&amp;S) 540 : (1996) 33 ATC239)), the reserved candidate is further promoted to Level 4- without considering the fact that the senior general candidate was also available at Level 3- then, after 1-3-1996, it becomes necessary to review the promotion of the reserved candidate to Level 4 and reconsider the same (without causing reversion to the reserved candidate who reached Level 4 before 1-3-1996). As and when the senior reserved candidate is later promoted to Level 4, the seniority at Level 4 has also to be refixed on the basis of when the reserved candidate at Level 3 would have got his normal promotion, treating him as junior to the senior general candidate at Level 3. <a href="/doc/162840/" id="a_32">Chander Pal v. State of Haryana</a> ((1997) 10 SCC 474 : 1997 SCC (L&amp;S) 1624) has to be understood in the manner stated above. 
</p>

<p id="p_76">		61. The principle laid down in Ajit Singh and others (II) vs. State of Pubjab and others ((1999) 7 SCC 209) has been reiterated  in  the very recent judgment in <a href="/doc/1267814/" id="a_33">S.Panneer Selvam and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others</a> ((2015) 10 SCC 292). 
</p>
<p id="p_77">		62. In the above cited decision,  the Division Bench of the Apex Court  headed  by Hon'ble Mr.Justice T.S. Thakur, has laid down the following proposition:-
</p>
<p id="p_78">		In the absence of a policy decision by the Government of Tamil Nadu, the accelerated promotion would not entitled to accelerated seniority.

</p><p id="p_79">		63. In so far as the present  case on hand  is concerned,  though the respondent/petitioner  is a senior general category candidate, the junior reserved category candidate  had obtained  promotion earlier  to him  as Sub Registrar-Grade-II  and Grade I  by applying the rule of reservation. The respondent/petitioner  by  the application of catch-up rule shall have to be  treated as senior  to the junior reserved category candidate   in the promotional post of Sub Registrar-Grade-II and Grade-I. Now the respondent/petitioner  has retired on account of his superannuation.  
</p>
<p id="p_80">		64. Under these circumstances,  as submitted  by Mr.Karthic Rajan, the appellants/Government may be directed to refix  the seniority  by applying the catch-up rule and grant notional promotion   from the date of his junior had secured promotion  as detailed in the tabular column as shown above  with all consequential benefits  including the refixation of pension  and arrears of pension.   
</p>
<p id="p_81">		65. We have carefully considered  the submissions made  by Mr.R. Ravichandran, learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the appellants and Mr.Karthic Rajan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 
</p>
<p id="p_82">		66. Having regard to the related facts and circumstances and after having gone through  the decision of the Apex Court, which includes  the decision of the Constitution Bench in Ajit Singh and others (II) vs. State of Pubjab and others ((1999) 7 SCC 209),  we are of considered view that  the impugned order  does not require our interference to exercise the power of  appellate jurisdiction.   
</p>
<p id="p_83">		67. Accordingly, the writ appeal filed  by the appellants/Government  is dismissed  and the order impugned in this writ appeal is confirmed. 
</p>
<p id="p_84">		68. Since the respondent/petitioner  has retired  from service  on account of  attaining  superannuation, the appellants  are directed to  refix the seniority  by applying the principle of catch-up rule  and grant notional promotion  to the respondent/petitioner from the date of  his junior reserved category candidate had secured promotion  as  detailed in the tabular column shown above  with all consequential benefits including the refixation of  pension  and arrears of pension within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_85">	In the result, the writ appeal is dismissed. Connected M.P. is also dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs.
