                                              PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>
                                 2

22.03.2011


Present :   Sh. P. K. Verma, APP for the State.
            Convict in JC with his counsel Sh. Ram Niwas.


1.          It is submitted by counsel for convict that convict

Rizwan is aged about 40 years and is having elder and ailing

mother, illiterate wife, two small children and one mentally

retarded younger brother to look after. His mother is stated to

be mentally disturbed after the death of her husband.                      It is

further submitted that convict is in JC for the last five years.

Convict Rizwan is the sole bread winner of the family and is

having only one kidney. His family will be on the verge of

starvation in his absence. Counsel for convict requests that

lenient view may be taken against the convict.

2.          On the other hand, Sh. P.K. Verma, Ld. APP for the

State states that the convict planned the incident, in which,

he murdered a small child of 2Â½ of age in front of his mother.

Ld. APP has vehemently submitted that convict be awarded

maximum punishment.

3.          Security of persons and property of the people is a

paramount function of the State which could be achieved

through machinery of criminal law. Protection of society and

                                            State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                             PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>
                                 3

stamping out criminal proclivity must be the object of law

which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.

The facts and given circumstances in each case, the nature of

crime, the manner in which it was planned and committed,

the motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the

convicts. The nature of weapons used and all other attending

circumstances are relevant facts which would enter into the

area   of   consideration.   Undue    sympathy          to       imposed

inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice

system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of

law and society could not long endure under such serious

threats. It is, therefore, the duty of every court to award

proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence

and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc.



4.          It was observed in case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee @

Dhana Vs. State of West Bengal, 1995 AIR SCW 510 as under

:-

       "Of course, it is not possible to lay down any cut
       and dry formula relating to imposition of
       sentence but the object of sentencing should be
       to see that the crime does not go unpunished
       and the victim of crime as also the society has
       the satisfaction that justice has been done to it

                                           State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                            PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>
                                 4

      in imposing sentences, in the absence of specific
      legislation. Judges must consider variety      of
      factors and after considering all those factors
      and taking an overall view of the situation
      impose sentence which they consider to be an
      appropriate one. Aggravating factors cannot be
      ignored and similarity mitigating circumstances
      have also to be taken into consideration.

      In our opinion, the measure of punishment in a
      given case must depend upon the atrocity of the
      crime; the conduct of the criminal and the
      defenceless and unprotected state of the victim.
      Imposition of appropriate punishment is the
      manner in which the courts respond to the
      society's cry for justice against the criminals.
      Justice demands that courts should impose
      punishment fitting to the crime so that the
      courts reflects public abhorrence of the crime.
      The courts must not only keep in view of the
      rights of criminal but also the rights of the victim
      of crime and the society            at large while
      considering      imposition      of     appropriate
      punishment."


5.         It   was   also   observed   in   case       of      Jashubha

Bharatsing Gohil Vs. State of Gujrat, (1994) 4 SCC 353

that the protectiion of the society and deterring the criminal is

avowed object of law and that is required to be achieved by

imposing appropriate sentence.



6.         It was held in the case of Siddarama &amp; others

Vs. State of Karnataka, (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 72 :-


                                             State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                              PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>
                               5



     "the object should be to protect the society and
     to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed
     object to law by imposing appropriate sentence.
     It is expected that the courts would operate the
     sentencing system so as to impose such
     sentence which reflects the conscience of the
     society and the sentencing process has to be
     stern where it should be.

     Imposition of sentencing without considering its
     effect on the social order in many cases may be
     in reality a futile exercise. The social impact of
     the crime e.g. where it relates to offences
     relating to narcotic drugs or psychotropic
     substances which have great impact not only on
     the health fabric but also on the social order and
     public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se
     require exemplary treatment. Any liberal
     attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking
     too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse
     of time or personal inconveniences in respect of
     such      offences    will    be     result   wise
     counterproductive in the long run and against
     societal interest which needs to be cared for an
     strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt in
     the sentencing system."


7.        It was observed in the case of Shivaji @ Dadya

Shankar Alhat Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2008 (4) RCR

(Criminal) 202 as under :-


     "Proportions between crime and punishment is a
     goal respected in principles, and in spite of
     errant notions, it remains a strong influence in
     the determination of sentences. The practice of
     punishing all serious crimes with equal severity

                                          State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                           PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>
                                6

      is now unknown in civilized societies, but such a
      radical departure from the principle of
      proportionality has disappeared from the law
      only in recent times. Even now for a single grave
      infraction drastic sentences are imposed.
      Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity
      for any serious crime is unwarranted and
      unwise. But in fact, quite apart from those
      considerations     that    make      punishment
      disproportionate punishment has some very
      undesirable practical consequences."


8.        In case State of Punjab Vs. Prem Sagar and

Others (2008) 7 SCC 550 it was observed that the Indian

Judicial System has not been able to develop legal principles

as regards sentencing. It was further observed that whether

the court while awarding sentence would take recourse to the

principle of deterrence or reform or invoke the doctrine of

proportioonality   would   depend    upon      the         facts         and

circumstances of each case and while doing so nature of

offence said to have been committed by the accused plays an

important role. A wide discretion is conferred on the court but

said discretion must exercise judicially while sentencing an

accused. It would depend upon the circumstances in which

the crime has been committed and the mental state and the

age of the accused is also relevant. It was observed as under :



                                          State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                           PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>
                          7

"In our judicial system, we have not been able to
develop legal principles as regards sentencing.
The superior courts except making observations
with regard to the purport and object for which
punishment is imposed upon an offender, have
not issued any guidelines. Other developed
countried have done so.


Whether the court while awarding sentence
would take recourse to the principle of
deterrence or reform or invoke the doctrine of
proportionality would no doubt depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case. While
doing so, however, the nature of the offence
said to have been committed by the accused
plays an important role. The offences which
affect public health must be dealt with severely.
For the said purpose, the courts must notice the
object for enacting <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_8">Article-47</a> of the Constitution
of India.


A sentence is a judgment on conviction of a
crime. It is resorted to after a person is
convicted of the offence. It is the ultimate goal
of any justice delivery system. Parliament,
however, in providing for a hearing a sentence,
as would appear from sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1986933/" id="a_9">Section
235</a>, sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1575348/" id="a_10">Section 248</a>, <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_11">Section 325</a>
and also <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section 360</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">361</a> of the Code of
Criminal procedure, has laid down certain
principles. The said provisions lay down the
principle that the court in awarding the sentence
must take into consideration a large number of
relevant factors; sociological backdrop of the
accused being one of them. Although a wide
discretion has been conferred on the court but
said discretion must exercise judicially. It would
depend upon the circumstances in which the
crime has been committed and the mental state.
Age of the accused is also relevant."

                                    State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                     PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>
                                 8




9.         The punishment provided under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Section 302</a> IPC is

death or life imprisonment as a penalty for murder. The<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> Indian

Penal Code</a> has under gone multi facet changes for the last

three decades which indicates that the Parliament has taken

note of contemporary criminological thought and movement.

The<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17"> Indian Penal Code</a> reflects a definite swing towards life

imprisonment. Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can

only be imposed for "special reasons". As provided in <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_18">Section

354</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19">CrPC</a>. It indicates that reformation and rehabilitation

of offenders and no deterrence, are now among the foremost

objects of the administration of criminal justice in the country.

<a href="/doc/324405/" id="a_20">Section 354(3)</a> CrPC. is a part emerging picture of acceptance

by the legislature of the new trends in criminology. The

personality of an offender revealed by his age, characte4r,

antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of

the offender to reform must necessarily play the most

prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded. A

judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the

circumstances, situations and the reactions and choose the


                                            State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                             PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>
                                   9

appropriate sentence to be imposed. The former rule that the

normal punishment for murder is death is no longer operative

and it is now within the discretion of the court to pass either

the sentence prescribed in <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_22">Section 302</a> IPC.

10.        In case Bachan Singh Vs. State of Punjab, AIR

1980 SC 899          it was observed that a real and abiding

concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to

taking a life through law's instrumentality. The ought not to be

done save in the rarest of rare cases when the alternative

option is unquestionably foreclosed.

11.        In case Machhi Singh Vs. State of Punjab, AIR

1983, SC 957 the guidelines are laid down which are to be

kept in view, considering the question whether the case

belongs to the rarest of rare category. It was observed that

the following question may be asked and answered as a test

to determine the 'rarest of rare' case in which death sentence

can be inflicted:-

                     1. Is there something uncommon
                        about the crime which renders
                        sentence of imprisonment for
                        life inadequate and calls for
                        death sentence?
                     2. Are the circumstances of the
                        crime such that there is no
                        alternative but to impose death

                                             State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                              PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23">IPC</a>
                               10

                    sentence even after according
                    maximum weightage to the
                    mitigating circumstances which
                    speak    in    favour of   the
                    offender?


12.       In the case of Machhi          Singh (Supra) the

guidelines were culled out which are to be applied to the facts

of each individual case where the question of imposition of

death sentence arises. The following preposition emerges

from the Bachan Singh's case :-

             i. The extreme penalty of death need not
                  be inflicted except in gravest cases of
                  extreme culpability.
             ii. Before opting for the death penalty the
                  circumstances of the 'offender' also
                  required to be taken into consideration
                  along with the circumstances of the
                  'crime'.
             iii. Life imprisonment is the rule and death
                  sentence is an exception. Death
                  sentence must be imposed only when
                  life imprisonment appears to be an
                  altogether    inadequate     punishment
                  having     regard    to   the   relevant
                  circumstances of the crime, and
                  provided, and only provided, the option
                  to impose sentence of imprisonment for
                  life cannot be conscientiously exercised
                  having regard to the nature and
                  circumstances of the crime and all the
                  relevant circumstances.
             iv. A balance sheet of aggravating and
                  mitigating circumstances has to be
                  drawn up and in doing so the mitigating
                  circumstances have to be accorded full

                                          State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                           PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>
                                11

                  weightage and just balance has to be
                  struck between the aggravating and the
                  mitigating circumstances before the
                  option is exercised.


13.           In case Bablu @ Mubarak Hussain Vs. State of

Rajasthan, AIR 2007 SC 697 the Supreme Court observed

as under :-

      "In rarest of rare cases when collective conscience
      of community is so shocked that it will except the
      holders of the judicial power center to inflict death
      penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as
      regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death
      penalty, death sentence can be awarded. The
      community may entertain such sentiment in the
      following circumstances :-

         i. When the murder is committed, in an
            extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical,
            revolting and dastardly manner so as to
            arouse intense and extreme indignation of
            the community.

         ii. When the murder is committed for a
             motive which evinces total depravity and
             meanness; e.g murder by hired assassin
             for money or reward or a cold-blooded
             murder for gains of a person vis-a-vis
             whom the murderer is in a dominating
             position or in a position of trust, or murder
             is committed in a course for betrayal of
             the motherland.

         iii. When murder of a member of a Scheduled
              Caste or minority community etc.,      is
              committed not for personal reasons but in
              circumstances which arouse social wrath,
              of in cases of 'bride burning' or 'dowry

                                            State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                             PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">IPC</a>
                                 12

            deaths' or when murder is committed in
            order to remarry for the sake of extracting
            dowry once again or to marry another
            woman on account of infatuation.

         iv. When the crime is enormous in proportion.
             For instance when multiple murders, say
             of all or almost all the members of a family
             or a large number of persons of a
             particular caste, community or locality,
             are committed.

         v. When the victim of murder is an innocent
            child, or helpless woman or old or infirm
            person or a person vis-a-vis whom the
            murder is in a dominating position or a
            public    figure   generally loved   and
            respected by the community."



14.        On the basis of above observations and discussion

in the present facts and circumstances of the case, the

present case does not fall within the category of "rarest of the

rare category", as such, the death penalty cannot                            be

awarded to both the convicts. The latest decision of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India pertaining to imposition of

sentence in the case of <a href="/doc/1312651/" id="a_26">Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan

Bariya   vs.      State    of   Maharashtra</a>,          decided               on

13.05.2009.     Another    important     facet      pertaining                to

sentencing the procedure being considered. Imprisonment for

life as a penalty entails that the convicts must remain in the

                                           State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06
                                            PS : Sultan Puri // u/s 302/452/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a>
                                13

imprisonment till his life i.e would never to set free from the

jail. However, the code of Criminal Procedure provides power

to executive under <a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_28">Section 433</a> CrPC which subject to the

restrictions provided by <a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_29">Section 433</a> CrPC. According to which

a convict sentenced to imprisonment for life for whose death

sentence has been commuted to imprisonment for life cannot

be released for prison unless served at least 14 years of

imprisonment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case

of Swami Shraddhanand vs. State Karnataka 2008 (13)

SCC 767     imposed upon State the condition that accused

would not be entitled to any commutation or premature

release.



15.        In this case, convict in most brutal manner killed a

child namely Roshan aged about 2Â½ years in front of his

mother eye witness PW1 Smt. Madhu Devi. Hence I sentence

convict Rizwan to    undergo    Rigorous Imprisonment for

life along with fine of Rs. 20000/- (twenty thousand), in

default of payment of fine, the convict shall further

undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 03 year

(three years) under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_30">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_31">34</a> IPC.

16.       Convict Rizwan shall also undergo Rigorous

Imprisonment for a period of 07 years (seven years)

along with fine of Rs. 5000/- (five thousand), in default

of payment of fine, the convict shall further undergo

simple imprisonment for a period of 01 year (one year)

under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_33">Section 452</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_34">34</a> IPC.

17.       All these sentences awarded to all three

convicts shall run concurrently. Benefit of <a href="/doc/914361/" id="a_35">section 428</a>

Cr.P.C. Shall be given to the convicts.

18.       It is made clear that in view of the law laid down by

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Swami

Shraddhanand      (Supra)    the   appropriate         sentence              of

imprisonment of life is that the convict namely Rizwan have to

undergo actual sentence of 30 years and grant of remission

shall not be considered till the actual sentence of 30 years.

to jail after committing the murder of someone ("tune meri

beizzati ki hai samaj mein, main iska badla loonga. Aise to

main jail gaya nahin lekin murder karke jaonga") and after

four days accused Rizwan committed murder of her son

Roshan. She clarified in her examination in chief that she had

not taken the threat of accused Rizwan seriously but disclosed

the same to one Vijender Giri who assured her not to worry

and accused Rizwan is not going to do anything wrong. PW2

Sunder Giri, who is the neighbour of PW1 Madhu Devi as well

as of accused Rizwan has deposed that on 05.06.06 police

persons came to him and told him that a compromise had

taken place between accused Rizwan and PW1 Madhu Devi

deposed that accused Rizwan had returned money to his wife

under pressure and so he was having grudge against them.

suggestion or question was put regarding the earlier incident

which took place between PW1 Madhu Devi and accused

Rizwan which was compromised in the form of PW1/D.

</p><p id="p_64">21.       I have heard and perused the judgments put

forward by Ld. defence counsels. In the case of Rudrappa

(supra) it has been observed that each case must rest on its

own facts. In the cited case, there was unlawful assembly with

an common object of murder and causing dangerous injuries.

Two groups clashed and they were having cordial relations

with each and incident took place on dismental of public tap

in the village. The other judgment relied upon State of M.P.

(supra) there was delay in lodging of FIR as well as that two

family prior to the incident were involved in a case of theft

and complainant blaming the family of accused. It was found

to be weak motive. Both the judgments are distinguishable in

the present facts and circumstances of the case as in the

present case a police complaint was made regarding the theft


                                          State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

of jewellary items and then a complaint was made to the

police. It was compromised. The witnesses of compromise are

also examined by the prosecution. In the present case

accused Rizwan gave specific threats to PW1 Madhu Devi

complainant. Hence both the judgments relied upon by the Ld.

Defence Counsels are distinguishable.
</p>
<p id="p_65">

</p><p id="p_66">22.       The submissions made by Ld. Defence Counsels

that motive is weak and flimsy. As discussed hereinabove

PW1 Madhu Devi and her husband PW4 Ganesh                               Shah

specifically explained and deposed about the incident that

took place on 05.06.06. The incident is corroborated by two

police DD entries i.e. DD no. 6 Ex. PW24/E and DD no. 14 Ex.

PW24/F. It is pertinent to mention that on this important

aspect no cross examination has been done and therefore,

these facts established beyond reasonable doubt the motive

of accused. The motive of accused is not weak and flimsy but

substantial   and   proved   upon       actual       incident             and

circumstances. The incident is further corroborated by PW2

Sunder Giri and PW8 Ranbeer Singh. I may mention here

again that Pw2 Sunder Giri is having good relations with

accused Rizwan and he also stood surety for accused Rizwan

when he was released on interim bail at the time of death of

his father. I have also gone through the above mentioned

judgments      which   are    distinguishable             in     the        present

circumstances.

circumstances, prosecution has succeeded in establishing the

motive of accused Rizwan in the present incident in which a

child named Roshan aged 2Â½ years was murdered.

absence of blood spots at the spot of incident which created

doubt. No blood stain was found at the spot although

allegations were that all three major incised wounds on the

body of deceased and the behaviour of PW1 was found to be

unnatural and unusual. I have gone through the said

judgment. In the present case PW1 Madhu Devi has not

deposed that there was any blood on the body of the

deceased. The medical evidence i.e PW5 Dr. Manoj Dhingra

has also not observed from head or neck any blood oozing

out. None of the police witnesses including the crime team

witness PW11 SI Mata Din testified that they had seen any

blood on the spot. In the present case the cause of death of

deceased is asphyxia and it is not a case of incised wound

where blood oozed out of the injuries. The 2Â½ years old son of

PW1 Madhu Devi died due to pressing of his neck. Therefore,

the judgment relied upon by Ld. defence counsels is

distinguishable in the present circumstances of the case.



</p><p id="p_85">31.       The doctor conducted the postmortem after about

08 - 09 hours after the death and the police witnesses had

seen the dead body at about 6.00 am. There is every

possibility of hemorrhage as observed in the internal injuries

which resulted in the bloody froth coming out of the mouth

after 08-09 hours after the death. So there is no material

recording of their statement at 10.00 / 10.30 am by PW24

Insp. Meer Singh, no body was aware about the assailant.

Therefore, the conduct and behaviour of PW1 does not inspire

confidence and is not reliable. Ld. Defence Counsels have

relied upon the following judgments : -

</p><p id="p_98">35.          I have gone through the judgments relied upon by

Ld. Defence Counsels. Ramseak and Ors. has already been

discussed above and the same is distinguishable. Lalloo &amp;

Anr. (Supra) is based on the conduct of the eye witness

found to be unnatual and unreliable. However in the present

case PW1 Madhu Devi's conduct is not found to be abnormal

and immediately she rushed for help and called the police.

This   judgment    is   distinguishable   in   present           facts        and

circumstances of the case. In Arun Kumar Sharma (supra)

FIR was lodged after five days of the incident. In the present

case the FIR was registered on the same day. In this case no

statement u/s 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_68">CrPC</a> was recorded. Hence the present

judgment is of no help to the defence and is distinguishable.

State of A.P. (supra) has also been discussed in the later

part of this judgment.

those two persons one was muffled face. Accused Rizwan was

identified by her who lifted her deceased son Roshan from his

neck, pressed it and then dropped her son on the floor and

she started crying and thereupon both the persons fled away.

She lifted her son Roshan and found that he was dead. Her

police reached as per PCR form filled up part II and part III but

in the PCR register brought in the court, these parts were

blank. As per procedure described by Ld. APP a PCR form

received by the police station is filled up and the original

remain with the PCR is not completely filled up. This is the

reason that when original PCR form was brought to the court,

the two parts remained unfilled because they were filled by

the local police. The other contention raised is that the police

which PW16 ASI Krishan Kumar reached at the spot at 4.45

PW14/A shows that time of call is mentioned as 5.54 am from

mobile no. 9811929653. The second and third part is filled up

by the local police official concerned who had reached at the

correct address and police reached at around 6.00 am or 5.54

am. In the PCR form Ex.PW14/A the informant name is

mentioned as Madhuri. These circumstances have to be

appreciated while considering in mind the mental condition of

PW1 Madhu Devi when her 2Â½ year old son has been

murdered by strangulation. At that time her husband was in

another room which was closed from outside. When the dead

body of her son is lying in front of her, how a normal person

can react. The discrepancies mentioned in the informatioins

are not material. The neighbours are not supporting her as

per testimony of PW6 Budhi Ram and PW7 Tribhuwan Kumar.

to light of any police official or Dr. Manoj Dhingra. Ex. PW14/A

shows   that at 6.00 am, police came to know the name of

assailant as accused Rizwan who is living in Gali no. 5 had

trespassed in her house and pressed the neck of her 2Â½ year

old son Roshan and consequently he died. The name of the

other person is not known as he was muffled face.

reaching there he saw the dead body of the child and later on

investigation officer PW24 Insp. Meer Singh and other senior

police officials arrived there. In the cross examination PW16

Krishan Kumar specifically mentioned that PW1 Madhu Devi

referred the name of accused Rizwan and also that he is

residing in the same locality but he did not further inquired

about accused Rizwan. He further explained that rukka was

not prepared in his presence as he was basically involved in

getting the postmortem on the body of deceased done and

prepared all the inquest papers.
</p>
<p id="p_141">59.       I find no merit in the submissions that prior to

10.30 am name of the assailant was not known to the police.

The brief facts Ex. PW16/A2 also mentions the name of

accused Rizwan and one associate who is involved in the

incident. Hence on the basis of the above discussion and

observation I find that there is no concealment of genesis of

occurrence of information of accused Rizwan and one

associate. There is no drastic improvement in the version of

PW1 Mashu Devi regarding the incident and involvement of

accused Rizwan.

Evidence of PW1 Madhu Devi and PW4 Ganesh                             Shah
un-reliable and not trustworthy :-
</p>
<p id="p_144">
</p><p id="p_145">60.       The next contention of Ld. Defence Counsels is that

the testimony of PW1 Madhu Devi and PW4 Ganesh Shah is

not trustworthy and reliable. In order to appreciate this

contention I have already discussed in detail the testimony of

PW1 Madhu Devi and PW4 Ganesh Shah. PW1 Madhu Devi is

the eye witness to the incident. She explained how the

incident took place at about 2.30 am. In the mid night her son

Deepak got up for urinating. The main gate of the house was

locked but the door of the room in which she was sleeping

was open. Her son Deepak came out for urinating but got

scared and embrassed her and then asked for water. He took

water from the pitcher. In the meantime, her younger son

Roshan also got up and asked for water. Deepak gave him

water. Thereafter she came out keeping her son Roshan in her

lap. When she entered the courtyard, she noticed that two

persons were there. One person caught hold of her hand and

the other slapped her. She cried and her mouth was gagged.

She identified one person as accused Rizwan and other

person was muffled face. She described the role of accused


                                          State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                               55</span>

Rizwan that he caught hold of his deceased son from neck,

lifted him, pressed his neck and then dropped him on the

floor. She started crying and then accused Rizwan alogn with

other person fled away. She also explained that when her

deceased son Roshan was dropped by accused Rizwan on the

floor, the other person put his foot on the body of his son and

abused by retorting whether her son is dead or alive. She

lifted her son and found him dead. Her husband could not

come to rescue as the door was bolted from outside.

Thereafter she described how she made the call and police

arrived. She proved her statement Ex. PW1/A on which

present case has been registered. She also testified the

earlier   incident   which   has   already        been           discussed

hereinabove which constitute the motive for the murder of her

deceased son Roshan. In her further examination in chief she

resiled and Ld. APP for the state cross examined her on the

point of involvement of co-accused Janak Raj @ Rekhi and his

identity. Her testimony in witness box and statement Ex.

PW1/A are both complementary to each other and there is no

improvement in regard to the incident dated 11.06.06. She

further proved the arrest of accused persons on 15.06.06.

</p><p id="p_147">61.        In the cross examination by Ld. Counsel for

accused Rizwan, she explained that she has been living in the

locality for the last 09-10 years and accused Rizwan also used

to live   and accused Rizwan also used to live in the same

mohalla. There are many constructed and vacant plots in the

locality. She knew accused Rizwan for the last 2-3 years but

she had no interaction with him. She admits that her son

Deepak recognizes accused Rizwan. She further corroborated

that her son Deepak had gone for loo but he disclosed the

identity of accused. To a specific question that both persons

were muffled face, she replied that she could not say about

the same with certainty but both persons slapped her. Again

she replied specifically as to whether she identified accused

Rizwan on the basis of his voice, to which she replied that

there was no exchange of arguments between them. She

further admitted that many locality persons gathered there.

She has also stated that she is illiterate but can sign and put

thumb impression. She further corroborated the fact that

police reached there house at about 6.00 am. She explained

that she was not in complete conscious and crying. This

conduct is natural about the mother whose son's dead body is

further explained that she disclosed the earlier incident with

accused Rizwan. She also replied to the specific questions

regarding her mental condition when insisted on presence of

accused Rizwan at the place of occurrence.

</p><p id="p_148">62.       PW4 Ganesh Shah, who is not an eye witness to the

incident, has deposed the hear-say facts which are not

admissible. However he denied that he had forgotten the facts

about the identity of accused Rizwan and Janak Raj. In cross

examination he explained that his wife told him in the

morning that accused Rizwan and one other person killed

their son Roshan (deceased). He is not an eye witness to the

incident which took place in the mid night at about 2.00 / 2.30

am.

</p><p id="p_158">64.        I    have   gone    through     the     above           mentioned

judgments and have considered the same. Lalloo &amp; Anr.

(Supra) is based on the conduct of the eye witness found to

be unnatual and unreliable. However in the present case PW1

Madhu Devi's conduct          is not found to be abnormal and

immediately she rushed for help and called the police. This

judgment       is   distinguishable   in     present             facts          and

circumstances of the case. In Arun Kumar Sharma (supra)

FIR was lodged after five days of the incident. In the present

case the FIR was registered on the same day. In this case no

statement u/s 164 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_92">CrPC</a> was recorded. Hence the present

judgment is of no help to the defence and is distinguishable.

In Hasan Murtza (supra) there was only sole eye witness

and could observed that the testimony contained material

improvements and was unsafe to              rely. However in the

present case the testimony of PW1 Madu Devi does not suffer

from any improvement. Her statement is on the basis of

statement recorded on 11.06.06 and 12.06.06. In the present

case there is no burning incident which took place where PW1

had any chance to save his son from burning. The present


                                                 State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                  59</span>

judgment    relied   upon   by        Ld.   Defence         Counsels              is

distinguishable in the present circumstances of the case. In

State of H. P. (supra) there were more than one eye

witnesses who saw the incident but in witness box they

deposed contradictory facts. However in the present case

there is sole eye witness of the incident PW1 Madhu Devi and

she reiterated whatever she said before the police in the court

also. Hence the present judgment is also of no help to the

defence and is distinguishable. In State of T. N. (supra)

there was contradiction on the date and time of the incident.

However in the present case there is no contradiction on the

time and date and hence the same is distinguishable in the

present facts and circumstances of the case. In Sardul Singh

(supra) the same is based on the theory of interested

witnesses. It lays down the testimony of interested witnesses.

In the present case the only sole witness of the incident is

PW1 Madhu Devi, mother of the deceased and her testimony

has been scrutinized with utmost care and found that it has a

ring of truth and inspire confidence and hence the same is

distinguishable in the present facts and circumstances of the

case. In State of A. P. (supra) there were two diametrically


                                               State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                               60</span>

adverse statements given by witnesses. However in the

present case only sole witness is PW1 Madhu Devi and no

adverse stand has been taken by her during her testimony

and hence the same is distinguishable in the present facts

and circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_159">

</p><p id="p_160">65.       On the basis     of the above observation                      and

discussion, I find that there is no element which makes the

testimony of PW1 Madhu Devi and PW4 Ganesh Shah non-

trustworthy and non-reliable. PW1 Madhu Devi being illiterate

lady explained the incident as she understood it. She

reiterated and confirmed the identity of accused Rizwan.

However she is shaky in her examination in chief as well as in

her cross examination about the identity of accused Janak Raj.



Place of Occurrence highly suspicious :-



</p><p id="p_161">66.       The Ld. Defence Counsels further contended that

place of occurrence is highly suspicious. PW1 Madhu Devi has

deposed that she used to reside in Gali No. 2, Prem Nagar but

did not recollect the house number. PW16 ASI Krishan Kumar

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                61</span>

has deposed that the exact address is E-2/72A, Gali No. 3,

Prem Nagar III and same are correctly mentioned in the brief

facts. PW11 SI Mata Din of mobile crime team mentioned the

address as H. No. E-2/72A, Gali No. 3, Aman Enclave, Nangloi,

Delhi. PW24 Insp. Meer Singh, investigation officer mentioned

the spot as House no. E-2/72A, Gali No. 3, Prem Nagar III.

Therefore, these witnesses create suspicion regarding the

place of incident. As per statement of PW1 Madhu Devi Ex.

PW1/A, her address is E-2/72A, Gali No.3, Prem Nagar III. She

is an illiterate lady and was examined about one year after

the incident. Since she could not recollect her earlier address,

does not mean that she stated some wrong address which

could create suspicion. Rukka Ex.         PW24/A specifically

mentions place of occurrence as E-2/72A, Gali No. 3, Prem

Nagar III, Delhi. PW16 ASI Krishan Kumar also mentioned the

same address. PW11 SI Mata Din has mentioned the same

address also but added Aman Enclave, Nangloi. However his

report Ex. PW11/A specifically mentions the place of incident

as H. No. E-2/72A, Gali No. 2, Prem Nagar III. PW11 SI Mata

Din was examined after about three years of the incident and

not immediately and if he included Aman Enclave does not

include any suspicion because his report mentions the correct

place of occurrence.

place of occurrence :-

<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171">70.          The Ld. Defence Counsels further pointed out that

dead body of the deceased was shifted and no blood stains

were found. PW1 Madhu Devi testified that accused Rizwan

dropped her deceased son on the floor. PW16 ASI Krishan

Kumar also explained that dead body was lying on bricks.

PW12 Ct. Dalbir Singh, photographer took the photographs Ex.

PW12/1 to PW12/10 which shows that dead body was lying on

pink colour mattress. PW11 SI Mata Din pointed out that dead

body of deceased Roshan was lying on the left side of the

room. PW24 Insp. Meer Singh testified that the dead body was

lying exactly in front of the door of the room in the right side.

Therefore,    as   per   witnesses   the   place     of     dead          body

established that it was shifted and not found at actual place.

</p><p id="p_181">73.       I have considered respective submissions and

perused the record. PW11 SI Mata Din in his crime team

report Ex. PW11/A mentioned that in H. No. E-2/72, Gali No.2,

Prem Nagar III, the dead body was found. In his testimony, he

proved his crime team report. In the cross examination he

explained that the dead body was lying on the floor outside

the room on the left side but this fact is not recorded in his

report. PW12 Ct. Dalbir Singh, photographer admitted that the

dead body was lying on the hand made mattress and he took

</p><p id="p_184">74.        PW16 ASI Krishan Kumar also corroborated that

dead body was lying outside the room. PW16 ASI Krishan

Kumar and PW24 Insp. Meer Singh both corroborated each

other that the dead body was lying on the brick floor. No

suggestion or question was put to them that whether the

mattresses were there or not as per photographs. The

photographs shows that the dead body was not lying in the

room but was on the floor. The photographs taken by PW12

Ct. Dalbir Singh shows that the dead body was lying at the

place of occurrence. No suggestion was given to PW1 Madhu

Devi that she shifted the dead body from the actual place i.e.

where it was lying just after the incident. It might be possible

that PW1 Madhu Devi being illiterate lady prior to reaching of

the police might have put some mattress under the dead

body at the same place where it was left by accused Rizwan

and his associate. These facts have to be appreciated by

analyzing the state of mind of a mother in whose presence

her 2Â½ year old son has been killed and thrown on the floor.

Therefore, I do not find any substance in the contention of the

Ld. Defence Counsels that the dead body was shifted from

actual place of occurrence.

No independent witness examined by prosecution :-

</p><p id="p_187">75.        Ld. Defence Counsels further contended that no

independent witness was examined. As per prosecution case

there was no independent witness of the incident. The

investigation    officer   joined    all   the   witnesses             i.e.      PW3

Chandrika Shah, PW4 Ganesh Shah, PW6 Budhi Ram and PW7

Tribhuwan Kumar who are connected with the incident.

Therefore, there is no substance in the submission that when

there was no eye witness, how the investigation officer can

join them. There is no need to join any spectator after the

incident during investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_188">76.        In support of his contentions, Ld. Defence Counsels

has relied upon the following judgments : -

Entry to the house of occurrence not proved :-

</p><p id="p_196">78.        Another contention raised by Ld. Defence Counsels

is that prosecution has not proved the entry to the house. My

attention has been drawn to the testimony of PW11 SI Mata

Din, PW1 Ct. Dalbir Singh, PW1 Madhu Devi and PW24 Insp.

Meer Singh. PW11 in cross examination described that there

was a wall of around six foot on the main gali in the house. In

the mid night around 2.30 am nobody will knock the door to

enter the house and commit such a crime. Further all these

three witnesses i.e. PW11 SI Mata Din,PW24 Insp. Meer Singh

and PW1 Madhu Devi corroborate the fact that there is a 5-6

feet high wall. This height of wall can be jumped by a person

who has intention to commit such crime. Therefore, there is

no substance in the contention that no entry has been proved

by prosecution into the house at the time of incident.


Testimony of PW24 Insp. Meer Singh, Investigation
Officer is not trustworthy and having contradictions :-

</p><p id="p_197">79.        Ld.   Defence   Counsels    also     highlighted                the

contradiction in the testimony of PW24 Insp. Meer Singh which

are stated to be material and vital points. PW24 Insp. Meer

Singh in cross examination has explained that he reached at


                                           State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

the spot at 09.00 am and came to know the name of accused

when statement of PW1 Madhu Devi was recorded at around

10.00/10.30 am. The dead body at that time was already

removed to SGM Hospital Mortuary by PW16 ASI Krishan

Kumar. The Ld. Defence Counsels picked up one line from the

cross examination of PW1 Madhu Devi about signature on

already written papers. This line appeared regarding the

incident that took place earlier and not on 11.06.06. PW11 SI

Mata   Din    and   PW12    Ct.   Dalbir   Singh      explained              that

investigation officer did not tell them to take photograph and

at the time of inspection of the spot no body was allowed near

the dead body. I find no material contradiction in the facts

stated by these two witnesses and PW24 Insp. Meer Singh.

</p><p id="p_198">80.          Further there is no contradiction that investigation

officer PW24 Insp. Meer Singh had himself at the spot not

seen the dead body. He correctly deposed that the dead body

was already removed to the hospital by PW16 ASI Krishan

Kumar. This fact is corroborated by PW16 ASI Krishan Kumar.

Another point has been made that according to PW11 SI Mata

Di and PW12 Ct. Dalbir Singh there were 100 to 60 people

gathered at the spot. These persons are gathered as


                                              State Vs. Rizwan etc. // FIR No. 898/06

material contradiction has been created in the statement of

investigation officer PW24 Insp. Meer Singh.

Arrest of accused persons not proved by prosecution :-



</p><p id="p_208">83.       Ld. Defence Counsels lastly pointed out that

prosecution has failed to prove the arrest of all the accused

persons on 15.06.06.     They pointed out the testimony of

PW15 SI Dinesh Dahiya, PW1 Madhu Devi, PW4 Ganesh Shah

and PW24 Insp. Meer Singh. Both the Ld. Defence Counsels

contended that Ct. Suresh Kumar on whose identification

accused persons were arrested is not examined by the

prosecution. The testimony of these witnesses highlights that

both the accused persons were arrested at five different

places. Accused Rizwan and Janak Raj were shown to be

arrested from grocery store, from a plot, residential area,

Prem Nagar and Police post Prem Nagar. I have gone through

the testimony of all the above stated witnesses. PW15 SI

Dinesh Dahiya deposed that he received information about

both accused persons namely Accused Rizwan and Janak Raj

at Janak Raj grocery store, D block, Prem Nagar at around

7.20 am. He   accordingly informed the investigation officer

PW24 Insp. Meer Singh and on his directions he along with Ct.

Suresh Kumar reached there. Ct. Suresh Kumar recognized

them and brought them to PP Prem Nagar. In the meanwhile,

PW24 Insp. Meer Singh also reached there. He proved the

arrest of accused Rizwan and Janak Raj vide memo Ex.

PW1/E1 and PW1/E2 and their disclosure statements were

recorded vide memo Ex. PW15/A and PW15/B. He further

proved the personal search of both accused persons vide

memo Ex. PW1/E3 and PW1/E4. He further deposed that PW1

Madhu Devi and her husband PW4 Ganesh Shah also came to

the police post. PW24 Insp. Meer Singh interrogated them and

accused persons were arrested and taken to SGM Hospital for

medical examination.
</p>
<p id="p_209">84.        In the detailed cross examination PW15 SI Dinesh

Dahiya explained that accused persons were arrested near a

plot where shot was situated. He denied that accused were

lifted from their houses and falsely implicated in this case. In

detailed cross examination by Ld. counsel for accused Rizwan,

specially regarding incident dated 11.06.06 all irrelevant cross

was conducted. Ld. Defence Counsels for accused Rizwan also

put irrelevant questions regarding the informer. He also

explained that he had no role in this case from 11.06.06 to

15.06.06 till 7.00 am. He explained that accused Rizwas was

arrested in residential area. He also explained the personal

search of accused Rizwan. He also explained that except

disclosure statement, arrest and personal search, no other

document was signed by him.

when Ld. APP for state cross examined her testified that on

memo and personal search memo of both the accused

persons. PW4 Ganesh Shah testified that he does not

remember that his statement was recorded on 15.06.06 and

went to police post along with his wife but he specifically

stated that accused Rizwan and Janak Raj were arrested by

police. On this there is no question put by Ld. Defence

them.

</p><p id="p_214">86.       PW24 Insp. Meer Singh further corroborated the

testimony of PW15 in respect of the arrest of accused

persons, interrogation and disclosure statement made by

accused persons. The testimony of these above discussed

four witnesses did not establish five places of arrest of

accused persons. They were found at grocery store or near

the store in residential area near a plot and brought to Prem

Nagar Police Post where they were arrested. In view of the

above discussion, I do not find any merit in the contentions of

Ld. Defence Counsels on the point of arrest of accused

persons.
</p>
<p id="p_215">


</p><p id="p_216">87.        The above detailed discussion on the testimonies

of prosecution witnesses and the submissions made by both

the defence counsels is discussed on the basis of analysis of

evidence led in this case. The prosecution has to establish the

identity of both the accused persons beyond reasonable

doubt. Accused Rizwan as per testimony of PW1 Madhu Devi

is her neighbour and at the time of incident on 11.06.06 at

about 2.00 / 2.30 am, identified and described the role that he

caught hold of his deceased son Roshan, lifted him, then

pressed his neck and dropped him on the floor. The

prosecution further established the motive of accused Rizwan

which is discussed herein above in detail for commission of

the offence. The identity of accused Rizwan is established

beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. Accused Rizwan

was not alone at that time as per testimony of PW1 Madhu

Devi. He was having an associate whose face was muffled

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                               74</span>

with handkerchief. That associate put his foot on the

deceased son of PW1 Madhu Devi and abused and retorted

whether son of PW1 Madhu Devi was alive or dead.



</p><p id="p_217">88.       In the examination in chief PW1 Madhu Devi turned

hostile and Ld. APP for the state cross examined her. In her

cross examination she testified that she knew accused Janak

Raj who was having shop in the neighbourhood. She admits

that on 12.06.06 police made inquired from her and then she

disclosed that the person who accompanied accused Rizwan

on the intervening night of incident was Janak Raj @ Lekhi.

She identified him. She further explained that the other

person who was muffled and threatened her that in case she

disclosed the name of anyone then he will kill her other son

also. At this juncture, a court question was put by Ld.

Predecessor about the identity of Janak Raj @ Lekhi. She

answered the question that she cannot say specifically but

from the identification of voice the said person was not Janak

Raj @ Lekhi. It is natural that if muffled face person is to be

identified the only factor is the voice. A person who has a

shop in the neighbourhood and is muffled face can only be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                75</span>

identified on the basis of his voice. PW1 Madhu Devi in

respect of the identification of accused Janak Raj @ Lekhi was

the associate of accused Rizwan is shaky. Initially she did not

named him. In the examination in chief Ld. APP cross

examined her then she admitted the question and suggestion

put to her. However when court asked a specific question to

fix the identity of Janak Raj @ Lekhi then she again took a

somersault     and   replied   that   on   the     basis        of      voice

identification she cannot say that Janak Raj @ Lekhi was the

associate of accused Rizwan on the intervening night of

incident have his face muffled with handkerchief.



</p><p id="p_218">89.        After analyzing and appreciating the testimony of

PW1 Madhu Devi, the sole eye witness of the incident, in

respect of the identity of accused Janak Raj @ Lehi, raises

doubt about the identity that he was the same person who

trespassed with accused Rizwan in muffled face in the house

of PW1 Madhu Devi. The shaky and doubtful testimony of PW1

Madhu Devi on this aspect generated doubts, therefore,

accused Janak Raj @ Lekhi is entitled to benefit of doubt.
