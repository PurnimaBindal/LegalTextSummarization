                           2.1.   As would be evident, both the trademarks have common alphabets
                          i.e., AMPM, although, the defendants&#x27; trademark i.e., the impugned
                          trademark is stylized i.e., is written in italics, with the word &quot;designs&quot; as its

                          footwear, belts and other accessories.

                          paragraph, there is a reference to other pending applications, as well.
                          3.4.   The details concerning the revenue generated by the plaintiff and the
                          expenses, include the following:

                          its expend, from Rs.10.86 lakhs to Rs.1.08 crores in 2018-19.
                          3.5.    Besides this, the plaintiff, to demonstrate the visibility of its trade
                          mark, has adverted to the fact that various celebrities are associated with the
                          AMPM brand, in myriad ways. There is also a reference in paragraph 18 of
                          the plaint to shows/events, which the plaintiff claims to have held in various
                          parts of the country.

</p><p id="p_13">                           4.       It is the case of the plaintiff that, it became aware that the defendant
                          was operating its business in breach of the impugned mark, in May 2020.
                          4.1.     The plaintiff claims that the impugned mark, for the first time, was
                          noticed in the form of a pop-up advertisement on Instagram. According to
                          the     plaintiff,   the     pop-up     advertisement      was      linked    to
                          https://www.instagram.com/ampm_designs/.
                          4.2.      It is also the assertion of the plaintiff that, upon its representative
                          checking the internet, it found a website under the domain name--
                          www.ampm-designs.com [hereafter referred to as &quot;impugned domain
                          name&quot;]. A perusal of the said website, according to the plaintiff, revealed
                          that it is a portal dealing and/or providing services, under the impugned
                          mark.
</p><p id="p_14">                          4.3.      According to the plaintiff, the Whois records revealed that the
                          aforementioned impugned domain name was registered by the defendants on
                          25.10.2015.      It is asserted by the plaintiff that, a perusal of the
                          WayBackMachine portal revealed that, the impugned domain name had
                          become operational, as recently as 08.01.2018.
                          4.4.    It is also the assertion of the plaintiff that, the defendants have
                          wrongly used the symbol ®, along with the impugned mark &quot;AMPM&quot;.
                          4.5.    It is, however, not disputed by the plaintiff [something which is
                          mentioned in the plaint], that the defendants have obtained registration for
                          the impugned mark under Class 42.
</p><p id="p_15">                          4.6.    What is sought to be highlighted is that, these applications were filed
                          only on 03.05.2019, with an endorsement that the said marks were
                          &quot;proposed to be used&quot;.

                           4.7.    The plaintiff avers that, its registered marks, along with the formative
                          marks are well-known, not only in India but throughout the world.
                          4.8.    Likewise, it is claimed by the plaintiff, as noticed above, that, the
                          clothes and accessories, in which it deals, are sold not only in India but also
                          in various parts of the world. The plaintiff claims to be a prior user of the
                          mark i.e., AMPM. The plaintiff asserts that the impugned mark, not only
                          infringes its statutory rights but also violates its common law rights.
                          4.9.    The plaintiff submits that, the use of the impugned mark has diluted,
                          degraded, and tends to erode the goodwill, which the plaintiff has,
                          assiduously, built around its AMPM marks.

                          mark, have a somewhat similar story. It is claimed that they are in the
                          business of &quot;interior design and lighting solutions&quot;.
                          5.1.    The mark ampm, according to the defendants, is an acronym for the
                          names of the owners of the mark i.e., Akash Anil Mehta and Poonam Mehta.
                          5.2.    It is claimed that they [i.e., the owners of the ampm mark] entered
                          into wedlock, on 09.12.2012. It is also claimed that their business of interior
                          design and lighting solutions was carried out, to begin with, under the
                          umbrella of a proprietorship concern, which morphed into a partnership
                          firm.
</p><p id="p_19">                          5.3.    According to the defendants, they have been using the ampm mark,

                          is modest, as compared to the amounts spent by the plaintiff. According to
                          the defendants, between 2017 and 2020, they have spent towards
                          advertisement (approximately) a little over Rs. 10 lakhs.
                          5.5.    Insofar as the revenue that they have generated, it is claimed that it
                          has increased from Rs.7,00,994/- in 2014-2015 to Rs.1,00,27,712/- in 2019-

</p><p id="p_20">                          5.6.    The defendants also claim that they have received feedback and
                          testimonials from their customers; a reference qua the same is made in
                          paragraph 12 of the written statement filed on behalf of the defendants.
                          5.7.    Similarly, the defendants have also alluded to various accolades that

                               which have their name beginning with AMPM, and that the said companies
                               have their names registered with the Registrar of Companies.
                               6.2.    In sum, the thrust of the defendants&#x27; defence is that the plaintiff
                               cannot claim an exclusive right and/or monopoly, vis-à-vis the mark
                               AMPM, as it is used by various entities/persons, dealing with

                          concerned, they can be paraphrased as follows:
</p><p id="p_27">                          (i)     The plaintiff has, in its possession, registration of the word mark
                          AMPM and device mark AMPM.
</p><p id="p_28">                          (ii)    During the pendency of the matter, it has secured additional
                          registrations of the word mark AMPM in classes 18, 24 and 35. An
                          application under Order VI Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the CPC has
                          been moved in the suit action, for including details, concerning additional
                          registration(s).
</p><p id="p_29">                          (iii)   The plaintiff&#x27;s AMPM marks have been in use, since 2002.
</p><p id="p_30">                          (iv)    The plaintiff has expended monies in excess of Rs. 1 crore in 2018-
                          2019, on promotional expenditure, and have garnered revenue amounting to
                          (approximately) Rs. 28 crores in the same year i.e., 2018-2019.
</p><p id="p_31">                          (v)     The plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark AMPM is a well-known trade mark and that
                          it satisfies the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1797427/" id="a_1">Section 11(6)</a> of Trade Marks Act, 1999 [in

                          marks, stand completely incorporated in the impugned mark. The mere fact
                          that the word &quot;designs&quot; is used as a suffix in the impugned mark will not

                          mark is an insignificant appendage, and hence, should be ignored. [<a href="/doc/175451084/" id="a_2">See The

</p><p id="p_33">                          (vii) The defence put up by the defendants, that, the plaintiff is only in the
                          business of selling goods and not rendering services, is no longer tenable, as
                          the plaintiff has now secured registration under Class 35, which concerns
                          services.
</p><p id="p_34">                          (viii) The Intellectual Property Appellate Board [as it then was] [hereafter
                          referred as &quot;IPAB&quot;], vide order dated 30.12.2020, had directed the removal
                          of the defendants&#x27; registration of the mark &quot;ampm designs&quot; in Class 42.
                          This decision has not been overturned, as yet, although, a writ petition has
                          been filed by the defendants, which is pending consideration before the
                          Bombay High Court.
</p><p id="p_35">                          (ix)   The fact that the rival marks are similar and are likely to cause
                          confusion is demonstrable from the notice of opposition filed by the
                          defendant, qua plaintiff&#x27;s application bearing no. 3500631. In this notice,
                          the defendants have admitted that the plaintiff&#x27;s application for interior
                          design services and fashion design services is likely to cause confusion. The
                          defendant, now, cannot claim to the contrary. The defendant cannot
                          approbate and reprobate. [<a href="/doc/30079339/" id="a_3">See Karam Kapahi and Ors. vs Lal Chand

</p><p id="p_36">                          (x)    Interior designing is a natural expansion of the business, in which the
                          plaintiff is presently involved in i.e., fashion designing.       These two
                          businesses are allied and akin to each other, and therefore, according to the
                          plaintiff, it is natural to progress from fashion designing to interior

</p><p id="p_37">                          (xi) It is well-established that, the initial interest confusion is sufficient for
                          triggering an infringement or passing off action. It is not unknown that, even
                          sophisticated customers are likely to get confused [<a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_5">See Baker Hughes

</p><p id="p_38">                          (xii) The defence raised that, the defendants adopted AMPM as their mark
                          because it was an acronym for the names of the owners of the mark i.e.,
                          Akash Anil Mehta and Poonam Mehta, is false, if one were to peruse the
                          audited balance sheets filed by defendant no. 1 for the financial year (FY)
                          2014- 2015 and 2015-2016. The said balance sheet for the FY 2015-16, as
                          on 31.03.2016, shows that commission amounting to Rs.6 lakhs has been
                          paid to Ms Poonam Mehta.
</p><p id="p_39">                          (xiii) In support of this plea, reliance is also placed on the partnership deed
                          dated 25.01.2017, which refers to defendant no. 2 as &#x27;Miss Poonam Suresh
                          Kumar&#x27;. Likewise, reliance is also placed on the Goods &amp; Services Tax
                          Certificate, dated 02.08.2017, filed by the defendants, which refers to
                          defendant no.2, as &#x27;Poonam&#x27;.

                          is not goods/services-centric. The fact that defendants use the domain name
                          www.ampm-designs.com and www. ampmdesigns.in would show that it is
                          likely to cause confusion.[<a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_6">See Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Sifynet Solutions

                          the mark AMPM is generic.
</p><p id="p_43">                          (xvi)     The reliance placed by the defendants, concerning the stand taken by
                          the plaintiff in respect of certain pending applications i.e., 3887492,
                          3887493, and 3887496 in Classes 03, 14, and 35, vis-à-vis third-party marks,
                          is meritless, for the following reasons:
</p><p id="p_44">                          (a)     There is no assertion made in the pleading filed by the defendants.
</p><p id="p_45">                          (b)     The submissions filed in response to the examination report are not
                          the plaintiff&#x27;s stance. The response was signed and filed by the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          erstwhile agent, and no sooner was the error pointed out, corrective
                          measures were taken.
</p><p id="p_46">                          (c)     The aforementioned applications are pending consideration before the
                          Trade Marks Registry. The Trade Marks Registry will determine as to,
                          whether the marks referred therein are to be registered, after having regard

                          these marks are active. The plaintiff has selectively targeted the defendants,
                          not by filing an opposition application, at the point in time, when the
                          defendants had moved the Trade Marks Registry for having the impugned
                          mark registered, but at a much later point in time, by way of a rectification
                          application filed before the IPAB.
</p><p id="p_52">                          (iv)    Although, the IPAB, vide order dated 30.12.2020, has directed
                          removal of the defendants&#x27; mark, a writ petition has been preferred qua the
                          said order [i.e., Writ Petition bearing Stamp No.4339/2021], which is
                          pending consideration before the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High
                          Court, via order dated 23.04.2021, has stayed the &quot;effect, implementation
                          and operation of the order dated 30.12.2020&quot;. Therefore, as of today, the
                          defendants&#x27; mark stands on the register maintained by the Trade Marks
                          Registry.
</p><p id="p_53">                          (v)     The rival trade marks are distinct and different. The plaintiff&#x27;s mark is
                          used for goods, whereas the defendants&#x27; mark is used for services. The
                          customers of both parties are discerning and highly educated.
</p><p id="p_54">                          (vi)    The distinction between the two marks is evident, even on mere
                          ocular examination. The impugned mark is in lowercase and written in
                          italics, with the word &quot;designs&quot; appended to it, as a suffix. The plaintiff&#x27;s
                          mark is in upper case i.e., capital letters and does not bear the word
                          &quot;designs&quot;, which is an integral part of the defendants&#x27; mark. Additionally,
                          the defendants&#x27; mark, now, expressly bears the names of its owners i.e., Anil
                          Mehta and Poonam Mehta. [<a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_8">See S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd</a>.

                          and/or cognate; the two businesses are distinct and incomparable. The
                          plaintiff has admitted that it has not delved into the business of interior
                          designing.

                          cognate, the following is required to be considered [see Balkrishna
                          Hatcheries v Nandos International Ltd.&amp;Ors., 2007 (35) PTC 295(Bom)]:

</p><p id="p_64">                          (viii)(a)      If the aforesaid tests are applied, it would show that the two
                          businesses are neither alike, nor akin. While the plaintiff deals in clothes
                          and accessories, the defendants are in the business of interior design and
                          lighting solutions. Both businesses are unrelated and have different trade
                          channels. The plaintiff&#x27;s goods are found and sold through physical stores
                          and e-commerce platforms, whereas the defendants render services by
                          taking direct and personal charge of their client&#x27;s project.

                          result in an arbitrary or non-generic mark. [See the judgment dated
                          12.10.2020 rendered by this Court in CS (COMM) No. 217 of 2020 in the

</p><p id="p_66">                          (x)    There are several third parties, which use AMPM as their trade mark.
                          Some of these trade marks are registered in different classes, and some even
                          predate the plaintiff&#x27;s registration. Furthermore, there are many registrants,
                          who are active in business and use the trade mark AMPM.
</p><p id="p_67">                          (xi)   The Registrar of Trade marks letter dated 07.07.2010 would show that
                          an objection had been raised by the Trade Marks Registry qua the grant of
                          registration, on account of a pre-existing registration, in favour of an entity
                          going by the name of Atlantic Richfield Co., based in California, United
                          States of America.
</p><p id="p_68">                          (xii) The recent applications filed by the plaintiff for obtaining registration
                          in Classes 3, 14 and 35 have met with roadblocks, since the Trade Marks
                          Registry has brought to fore the fact that, there are third parties, which have
                          registered their AMPM marks, in these classes. In response to the same, the
                          plaintiff has filed replies and taken the stand that, the said mark is different
                          from the cited mark, as it is based on the names of its co-founders i.e.,
                          Ankur Modi and Priyanka Modi.
</p><p id="p_69">                          (xiii) The fact, that the plaintiff has filed a revised response, shows that it
                          has changed its stance to suit its purposes. Additional registrations of the
                          word mark AMPM obtained by the plaintiff in Classes 18, 24, 25 and 35

                          record, the following facts have emerged:
</p><p id="p_74">                          10.1. The plaintiff is in the business of dealing in high-fashion clothing and
                          wearable accessories, such as footwear, belts, bags, and on the other hand,
                          the defendants are in the business of interior design and lighting solutions.
                          10.2. The earliest registration, which the plaintiff obtained concerning its
                          trade mark, was, on 14.05.2009, with a claim that it was being used, since
                          01.01.2002. This registration was obtained qua goods falling in Class 25.
</p>



<p id="p_75">                          10.3. The other set of registrations were obtained by the plaintiff, on
                          02.07.2012. The plaintiff claimed usage of these marks, since 01.12.2005.
                          These registrations were obtained under Class 23, 24, 25 and 26. Besides
                          this, there were two other registrations obtained by the plaintiff, on
                          13.07.2018, under Class 18 and 25. The plaintiff claimed usage of these
                          marks, since 01.04.2016.

                          period, which predates 2006. This admission has been made in an affidavit
                          dated 31.12.2016, filed on behalf of the plaintiff by one of its directors i.e.,
                          Mr Ankur Modi, with the Trade Marks Registry. The plea taken in the said
                          affidavit is that the record is old, and therefore, not available. It is claimed in

                          for registration of the impugned mark, on 03.05.2019, bearing no. 4165858.
                          This application sought registration of the impugned mark in Class 421.
                          10.6. Although, the defendants had, initially, made an endorsement in the
                          application for registration of the impugned mark, to the effect, that, they
                          proposed to use the mark in future, a rectification application was filed with
                          the Trade Marks Registry on 08.08.2020, wherein it is claimed that they
                          have been using the impugned mark, since 10.01.2014. In support of this
                          plea, the defendants have relied upon the following documents:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                              a) An e-mail dated 30.01.2014 sent by Kotak Mahindra Bank to

                          over three years i.e., between 2017-18 and 2019-20 have spent one-tenth of

                          2018-2019 have achieved a turnover of Rs.1,04,70,447/-.
                          11.3. There are several AMPM marks on the Register of the Trade Marks
                          Registry, falling in various classes, which predate the registration of the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s marks.
</p><p id="p_86">                          12.     Therefore, what emerges from the record is that, undoubtedly, as
                          between the plaintiff and the defendants&#x27;, the plaintiff is the prior user of the
                          mark AMPM, although, there is nothing on record, as yet, which would
                          prima facie establish that the plaintiff has been in using its mark, since
                          01.01.2002. As noted above, the material placed on record by the plaintiff,
                          relates to the period, commencing from 2006.
</p><p id="p_87">                          12.1. That being said, the plaintiff&#x27;s marks stand registered qua a class
                          other than Class 42. Concededly, the plaintiff has not obtained any
                          registration in Class 42.
</p><p id="p_88">                          12.2. The plaintiff is a purveyor of designer clothes and accessories. It has
                          not yet ventured into interior design and lighting solutions, which is the
                          business carried on by the defendants. Clearly, the trade channels through
                          which the businesses are conducted by the plaintiff and the defendants, are
                          distinct and different.
</p><p id="p_89">                          12.3.    The plaintiff deals in goods, which are bought off the shelf or sold
                          through e-commerce platforms, whereas the defendants&#x27; are in the business
                          of providing services, which are personal and customized. The skills that
                          one needs for designing clothes and/or accessories are not necessarily the
                          same, like those required to design physical spaces.

                          Likelihood of confusion:-
</p><p id="p_90">                          13.     Given the fact that the registration obtained by the plaintiff [as against
                          a mere application filed by it] falls in a class different from that of the
                          defendants, the applicable test, as noticed above, undoubtedly is : whether
                          there is a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the services offered by
                          the defendants, insofar as the relevant denomination amongst the public at
                          large is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_91">                          13.1 When applying the test, one has to make a &quot;global appreciation&quot;. The
                          &quot;global appreciation&quot; test requires one to examine, inter alia, the following
                          facets, albeit, holistically as they are inter-dependent:
</p>
<p id="p_92">                          (i)     The degree of visual, aural and/or conceptual similarity between the
                          marks.
</p>
<p id="p_93">                          (ii)    The overall impression created by the marks.
</p>
<p id="p_94">                          (iii)   The impact that the impugned marks have on the relevant public i.e.,
                          the matter should be considered through the eyes of an average consumer,
                          who would buy or receive the goods or services.
</p>
<p id="p_95">                          (iv)    The distinctive character that the infringed mark has acquired i.e.
                          either because of the mark per se or on account of reputation that it has
                          enjoyed in the public space.
</p>
<p id="p_96">                          (v)     That the average consumer has an imperfect recollection.

                          purveyed under the rival marks.
</p>
<p id="p_99">                          [See SABEL BV vs. Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport [1998] R.P.C. 1992 &amp;

                          13.2. It needs to be emphasized that, while evaluating the aforesaid facets,
                          one has to bear in mind the global/composite appreciation test, which
                          enjoins that each of them is inter-connected and explicable, as a whole. In
                          other words, an integrated rather than a compartmentalized approach is
                          required to be adopted. The proclivity of giving weight to one facet as
                          against the other facet(s) is to be abjured. It is only an overall evaluation of
                          all facets which helps in ascertaining, whether or not there is a likelihood of
                          confusion. Likelihood of confusion would arise, if there is a risk of the
                          relevant consumers/public believing that the goods or services offered by the
                          defendants originate from the plaintiff or in some way, are economically or
                          commercially linked to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_100">                          13.3. The point in issue can be elaborated by referring to the ratio of the
                          decision rendered in Sabel BV case. This was a matter in which Sabel BV, a
                          Dutch company sought registration of its mark in Germany, which was
                          opposed by Puma AG, a German company. The rival marks, which depicted
                          a feline, had an analogous semantic content i.e., a &quot;bounding feline&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_101">                          13.3(a).        In this context, the point which arose for consideration before
                          the court was, whether mere association which the public might make

                           between the two marks, through the idea of a &quot;bounding feline&quot;, would
                          justify refusing protection to the SABEL mark in Germany for products
                          similar to those on the list of articles covered by Puma&#x27;s priority mark.
</p>
<p id="p_103">                          13.3(b).     Significantly, the court ruled that the concept, likelihood of
                          association is not an alternative to that of likelihood of confusion but serves
                          to define its scope.     Furthermore, it went on to state that &quot;the mere
                          association which the public might make between the two trademarks as a
                          result of their analogous semantic content is not itself a sufficient ground for
                          concluding that there is likelihood of confusion.........&quot;

<p id="p_104">                          13.4. The chances of the customers being confused as to, who is the
                          originator of the services rendered by the defendants i.e., interior design and
                          lighting solutions, seems remote, at this juncture. The principal purpose
                          and/or the function of the trade mark is to guarantee to the customers that
                          the origin of the goods and/or services; infringement by a defendant should
                          affect this principal function, apart from other functions, such as quality,
                          communication, investment or advertisement of goods and/or services on

                          13.5. The plaintiff has not placed any material on record, in the form of an
                          affidavit, of any customer, which would persuade me to hold that, there was
                          a scope for confusion being created in the minds of customers, as to the
                          source of the services rendered by the defendants.

                           from the plaintiff--the same would have to meet the tests, which are
                          ingrained in a passing off action.
</p>
<p id="p_106">                          14.1. Passing off action is a tort that veers around deceit. For such an action
                          to succeed, it must, at the very least, have the following three indicia,
                          commonly known as the &quot;classical trinity&quot;. The said markers are articulated
                          in, what is commonly known as, the Jiff Lemon case [Reckitt &amp; Colman
                          Products Ltd. vs. Borden Inc., [1990] 1 All E.R. 873] and can, broadly, be
                          paraphrased in the manner set forth hereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_107">                          i.     First, the plaintiff must be able to establish that it has the necessary
                          goodwill and reputation in the goods sold or services offered to the
                          consumers at large which in turn should be interlinked with the get-up in
                          which they are proffered.
</p><p id="p_108">                          ii.    Second, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that the defendants&#x27;
                          misrepresentation, made qua the goods or services offered by him, have led
                          consumers to believe that they originate from the plaintiff.
                          iii.   Third, that the action of the defendant has resulted in damage or is
                          likely to result in damage on account of the misrepresentation of the
                          defendant concerning the origin of the goods and services.
</p>
<p id="p_109">                          iv.    To establish misrepresentation, the plaintiff must be able to

                          services. The belief that the plaintiff has sponsored or may have given
                          financial support to defendants would not ordinarily give the public that

                           v.    There is no requirement for the plaintiff to show that the defendant is
                          carrying on a business which competed with that of the plaintiff or which
                          would compete with any natural extension of the plaintiff&#x27;s business.
                          However, absence of common field of activity is a significant and relevant
                          consideration in deciding whether there was a likelihood of confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_111">                          [See judgement dated 27.11.2020, passed by this Court in I.A.No.6865/2020
                          in CS(COMM) 319/2020, titled <a href="/doc/64878627/" id="a_11">RB Health (US) LLC and Anr. vs. Dabur

                          14.2. In the instant case, the plaintiff could not have placed anything on
                          record to establish that it has the necessary goodwill/reputation in the
                          services offered by the defendant [i.e., interior design and lighting
                          solutions], as it has, admittedly, not embarked on that business, as yet. Thus,
                          at present, the field of activity of plaintiff and defendant remain starkly
                          different and distinct.
</p>
<p id="p_112">                          14.3. Furthermore, there is something to be said about confusion on account
                          of the similarity between the rival marks. Confusion--it is well-established,
                          is not the same, as deception or misrepresentation. The plaintiff, clearly,
                          cannot show, at least at this stage, that the use of the impugned mark for
                          interior design and lighting solutions by the defendants has led to or is likely
                          to result in damages on account of misrepresentation made by defendants,
                          concerning the origin of services offered by them.

</p><p id="p_114">                           15.   Pertinently, the test of likelihood of confusion applies to both an
                          infringement action as well as an action for passing off. [See McCarthy on
                          Trademarks and Unfair Competition, 4th Edition, cited with approval in
                          <a href="/doc/23763843/" id="a_13">Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. vs. Allied Blender &amp; Distillers Pvt.

</p><p id="p_115">                          16.   The other argument, which is advanced on behalf of the plaintiff, is
                          that confusion is caused on account of initial interest being triggered in a
                          purchaser, due to semantic similarity of rival marks. The doctrine of &quot;initial
                          interest confusion&quot; is a subset of the likelihood of confusion test, which
                          applies, at a stage, prior to the purchase of goods or receipt of services. This
                          doctrine needs to be applied with extreme care and caution, as it dilutes the
                          &quot;global appreciation test&quot;, adverted to hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_116">                          16.1. Having said that, in this case, in my opinion [apart from the lack of
                          material on record, to even suggest that, there have been instances of initial
                          interest confusion], the fact that the plaintiff and defendant are in different
                          trade channels, catering to consumers who have different expectations and
                          demands makes the submission completely untenable. The plaintiff is, to
                          reiterate, in the business of fashion designing and, thus, deals in wearables
                          (i.e., goods and jewellery) whereas the defendant is in the business of
                          interior design and lighting solutions.
</p>
<p id="p_117">                          16.2. The fact that some fashion designers have graduated into interior
                          designing is neither here nor there. Undeniably, the plaintiff has not, as yet,
                          ventured into interior designing.

                          the trade mark AMPM, would not, to my mind, be enough, at least, at this
                          stage, to injunct the defendants from using the impugned mark.

                          ubiquity of a well-known mark. Even if I were to accept the assertions made
                          in the plaint, concerning the advertising spend, the turnover generated and
                          the claim of the sales made in and outside the country- it does not add up to
                          demonstrate that the AMPM mark can only be associated with the plaintiff.

                          the trade mark has been registered in good faith, after disclosing material
                          information to the Registrar or where the right to a trade mark has been
                          acquired to use the same, albeit, in good faith, before the commencement of
                          1999 Act, then, nothing contained in the said Act will prejudice the validity
                          of registration of that mark or right to use that mark on the ground that the
                          said trade mark is identical with or similar to a well-known trade mark. In
                          other words, in such a situation, the rival mark can cohabit with a well-
                          known trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_127">                          18.4. Thus, the registered trade mark which has a reputation in India can
                          sue for infringement under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_29">Section 29</a>, if the affected

                          takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to the distinctive character or
                          repute of the registered mark. However, where the proprietor of an earlier
                          trade mark, which could be a well-known trade mark in India, has
                          acquiesced for a continuous period of five years in the use of its registered
                          mark, the fact that the concerned party is aware of its use shall disentitle
                          such affected party to seek declaration that the registration of the latter mark
                          is invalid or to oppose the use of the latter trade mark in relation to the
                          goods and services qua which it is used. However, this handicap will not

                          notwithstanding that the earlier trade mark can no longer be invoked against
                          the latter trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_129">                          18.6. In sum, as indicated above, for exercising rights qua a trade mark
                          which is a well-known or reputed in India, it is not necessary that it should
                          be used or registered in India. That being said, before a mark can be
                          categorized as a well-known mark, it should, inter alia, gain recognition or
                          be in the know of, in the relevant section of the public in India.
</p>
<p id="p_130">                          18.7. As alluded to above, there is nothing on record which would show
                          that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark AMPM has acquired the status of well-known or a
                          reputed mark. There are no survey reports of relevant sections of public
                          placed on record which would, at least, prima facie have me believe that, the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s mark has attained a status of well-known and/or reputed mark.
                          The material on record, concerning period the mark has been in use [i.e.,
                          since 2006], the advertising and promotion spend, the &quot;presence&quot; on e-
                          commerce platforms--only fortifies my view that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark does
                          not qualify, at this juncture, as a well-known mark. Therefore, this
                          submission of the plaintiff, which can be categorized as a leap of faith, is
                          rejected.

<p id="p_131">                          18.8. In this case, it is quite clear that the plaintiff&#x27;s registered marks have
                          not met the threshold prescribed for a well-known mark. The plaintiff&#x27;&#x27;s case
                          is that it has physical outlets, although it claims it has a presence on e-

                           commerce platforms. There is no material on record that would demonstrate
                          as to the number of actual and potential consumers of its goods, the number
                          of persons who are involved in the distribution channel set up for selling its
                          goods and/or the knowledge or recognition in the relevant section The
                          promotion material and the advertising spend is not so large or expansive
                          which would have me conclude, at this stage, that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is a
                          well-known mark. A mark may have a reputation and maybe well known but
                          it still falls short of a well-known mark.
</p>
<p id="p_133">                          19.     There is no denial by the plaintiff of the fact that, on the register of the
                          Trade Marks Registry, several marks are found, which bear the alphabets
                          AMPM and are, perhaps, active. Although the mere fact that a mark sits on
                          the Register maintained by the Trade Marks Registry gives no tangible
                          rights; at the interlocutory stage, it could turn the balance when examined
                          alongside other material on record.
</p><p id="p_134">                          19.1.    Given this situation, what is not fathomable is as to, why the plaintiff
                          has not moved against such entities/persons to protect its interests, if it
                          claims that, it is the owner of the mark, which is well-known not only in
                          India but outside the country.
</p><p id="p_135">                          19.2. The defendants have set up a plausible defence, at least, at this stage,
                          that, the mark AMPM is used by several entities/persons carrying on myriad
                          businesses.
</p>
<p id="p_136">                          Conclusion:-
</p><p id="p_137">                          20.     Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I am not inclined to grant an
                          injunction, as claimed by the plaintiff.

                           20.1. However, since the defendants have on their own volition filed an
                          additional affidavit dated 18.01.2021, whereby they have agreed to add the

                          also submit a quarterly account statement to the Registry of this Court,
                          concerning the turnover generated hereon, under the impugned mark.
