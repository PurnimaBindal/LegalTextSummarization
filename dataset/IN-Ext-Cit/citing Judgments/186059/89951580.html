            the lodging of the complaint on 7.4.2006, the prosecutrix who was about

            15-16 years years old was enticed by accused Veerpal Kaur by giving `10/-

            for purchasing Guava fruit from a shop and sent the girl to the room where

            accused Avtar Singh and Baljinder Singh were present. Accused Baljinder

            Singh first raped her against her consent. Thereafter accused Avtar Singh

            also committed rape upon her forcibly against her will. Accused Baljinder

            Singh and Avtar Singh threatened her not to disclose the act to anyone else.

            One month thereafter both the accused again committed rape upon her

            forcibly in the public toilet of the village. The prosecutrix had pain in her

            stomach one month thereafter. She informed her parents. PW4 Bikkar

            Singh the father of the prosecutrix lodged a complaint with the police.

            Based on the complaint, the accused were booked for gang rape. PW1

            Dr.Asha Kiran conducted medico-legal examination of the prosecutrix on

            7.4.2006. She found that there was abdominal mass palpable upto 26 weeks

            of uterus size. The hymen was found ruptured and healed. The vagina

            admitted one finger. The prosecutrix was advised for ultrasound

            examination for conformation of pregnancy.              On receipt of ultrasound

            report, she opined that the prosecutrix was 26 weeks pregnant which would

            mean that she was subjected to sexual intercourse. PW2 Dr.Vijay Kumar

            above 13 years as 2nd Molar was found erupted. But she was below 17 years

            as 3rd Molar was found absent. It is his opinion that 3rd Molar would erupt

            only at the age of 17 years. He would also depose that the prosecutrix could

            be of 14 years of age.

<p id="p_7">            7.                 The trial Court having completely relied upon the evidence of

            PW5, the prosecutrix in this case returned a verdict of conviction and

            sentence as stated supra.

<p id="p_8">            8.                 Learned counsel appearing for the appellant Baljinder Singh @

            Binder would vehemently submit that there was a delay of 6 months in

            reporting the alleged gang rape committed by accused. After much

            deliberation such a criminal case has been lodged as against the accused.

            Therefore, the delay was fatal to the case of the prosecution. As far as the

            second occurrence alleged to have taken place at the public toilet, no site

            plan was prepared by the investigating official. Further, the case of the

            prosecution that there was a gang rape committed by accused Baljinder

            Singh and Avtar Singh at a public toilet is found to be quite unnatural. The

            medical evidence does not clinchingly establish the exact age of the

            prosecutrix. No medical examination of the accused was done. Even the

            child allegedly born to the prosecutrix was not subjected to DNA test.

            Lastly, he would submit that the sentence imposed on the appellant may be

            reduced.

            Singh as well and assist this Court. It is his submission that there was no

            corroboration for the evidence of prosecutrix. Just to save the honour of the

            prosecutrix who became pregnant, the case was formally booked as against

            the accused. As regards the age when two views are possible, the view

            which would go to the benefit of the accused shall be taken by the Court.

            As far as accused Veerpal Kaur was concerned, there was no role assigned

            to her as regards the second occurrence of gang rape. No motive also was

            attributed to her. The other two accused were not connected with Veerpal

            Kaur. The documents on record would go to show that she was living in a

            different village. As regards the enticement, three versions had been put

            forth by the prosecutrix; one through the first information report, another

            through the mouth of PW4 and yet another thorough the mouth of PW5.

            Such an inconsistent version creates a doubt in the version of the

            prosecutrix.         There is no allegation that accused Veerpal Kaur ever

            threatened the prosecutrix. It is his last submission that no offence under

            <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_5">Section 376(2)(g)</a> read with <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_6">Section 109</a> IPC was made out as against

            accused Veerpal Kaur, as she had allegedly enticed the prosecutrix and

            facilitated the other accused to have intercourse with her.       Therefore,

            accused Avtar Singh and Veerpal Kaur are also entitled to acquittal, it is

            PW2 Dr.VijayKumar Singla, Medical Officer attached to Civil Hospital,

            Mansa has determined the age of the prosecutrix between 14-17 years. He

            has categorically deposed that the ossification test he conducted would not

            conclusively determine the age of the person. Therefore, the approximate

            age on the basis of the ossification test PW2 Dr.Vijay Kumar Singla has

            fixed the age of the prosecutrix between 13-17 years.

            for the purpose of determining the age of the prosecutrix. The Medical

            Board having thoroughly perused the entire materials including ossification

            test report Ex.PE submitted by PW2 on the basis of X-ray he had taken has

            come to the unassailable scientific conclusion that the prosecutrix was

            above 13 years as 2nd Molar was found erupted and she was below 17 years

            as the 3rd Molar was found absent. The Board has categorically opined that

            inasmuch as the 3rd Molar which would erupt only at the age of 17 years had

            not erupted, the prosecutrix would be around 14 years of age.

            an intercourse with a girl aged under 16 years of age would amount to rape

            categoric version that accused Veerpal Kaur enticed her by giving `10/- for

            purchasing Guava fruit and sent her to accused Baljinder Singh and Avtar

            Singh for committing gang rape. She has clearly deposed that both the

            accused committed rape upon her and thereafter they wielded a threat to her.

            intercourse and that she was pregnant by 26 weeks at the time when PW1

            examined her on 7.4.2006. PW9 S.I. Nachhatar Singh has recovered the bed

            head ticket Ex.PH of the prosecutrix which would establish that the

            prosecutrix was blessed with a child. PW4 Bikkar Singh who heard the

            unfortunate incident from his daughter after 6 months time has set the law in

            motion by lodging the complaint. In my considered view, the prosecution

            has established the charges as against the accused-appellants.

            was also one of the grounds on which the accused who was charged with

            gang rape were acquitted. In my considered view, the delay alone was not

            the primary ground on which the accused in that case were acquitted. In the

            instant case, there had been a threat to a minor girl who was subjected to

            case. Therefore, the above ratio will not apply to the facts of this case.

</p><p id="p_18">            18.                The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vijayan Vs. State of Kerala,

            (2008) 14 SCC 763 has held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                               "5.   The present case wholly depends upon the testimony of

                               the prosecutrix. The incident in the present case took place

                               seven months prior to the date of lodging the complaint as a

                               realisation dawned upon her that she has been subjected to

                               rape by the appellant-accused. No complaint or grievance was

                               made either to the police or the parents prior thereto. The

                               explanation for delay in lodging the FIR is that the appellant-

                               accused promised her to marry therefore the FIR was not filed.

                               In cases where the sole testimony of the prosecutrix is

                               available, it is very dangerous to convict the accused, specially

                               wen the prosecutrix could venture to wait for seven months for

                               filing the FIR for rape.         This leaves the accused totally

                               after the incident, there would have been some supporting

                               evidence like the medical report or any other injury on the

                               body of the prosecutrix so as to show the sign of rape. If the

<p id="p_21">            In the aforesaid case, there was no evidence to show that the accused

            threatened the prosecutrix from making public the occurrence. Infact, it was

            a sexual intercourse based on a promise made by the accused to marry her.

            Further, in the above case, the prosecutrix was a major. Therefore, I find

            that the above ratio is factually distinguishable and therefore, the same

            cannot be applied to the present case.

<p id="p_22">            19.                Of course, there is a delay of 6 months in lodging the complaint

            with the police. Firstly, I find that the prosecutrix was just 16 years old at

            the time when the occurrence took place. Secondly, the evidence of the

            prosecutrix who was examined as PW5 would go to establish that there was

            a threat wielded by accused Baljinder Singh and Avtar Singh. As she

            became pregnant, the entire episode had come to light.

</p><p id="p_23">            20.                Every delay in lodging the first information report would not

            prove fatal to the case of the prosecution. There was no question of

            deliberation to falsely implicate the accused in this case. There was no

            reason for the prosecutrix to name these accused for the rape committed

            upon her. Further, I find that by no stretch of imagination the case booked

            as against the accused could be classified as false case on account of the

            party faction. As it has been established that the prosecutrix had given birth

            to a child and the names of accused Baljinder Singh and Avtar Singh had

            been shown as father of the child. Under the above facts and circumstances,

            the delay does not loom large.

            a false plea that she was subjected to second rape as well by accused

            Baljinder Singh and Avtar Singh. At any rate, I find that the prosecution

            has established the first gang rape committed by accused Baljinder Singh

            committed rape upon her forcibly against her will. Further, a child also was

                               gone through the record. We first take up for consideration the

                               question of the conviction under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_11">section 376</a> of the IPC. We

                               find from the medical evidence and from the chemical

                               examiner's reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken

                               from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen. There

                               is however absolutely no evidence to suggest (even assuming

                               that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant) that

                               he had done so without Mukhtiar Kaur's consent or against her

                               will. Some suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised

                               had some tell tale injuries been detected on Mukhtiar Kaur's

                               person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot

                               wounds i.e. injury No.3 being on the left pinna and No. 4 an

                               abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape

                               or the commission of rape.      It is also significant that the

                               investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the

                               appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to

                               perform sexual intercourse. The learned State counsel relying

                               on the statement of PW14 Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh has

                               however submitted that the examination had not been possible

                               as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury

                               and was hanging between life and death. We agree with the

                               submission of the learned counsel that an examination could

                               not have been carried out immediately but we see no

                               justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him

                               even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between

                               the two had indeed taken place it cannot be said from the

                               the wishes of Mukhtiar Kaur. We, therefore, find that Ujjagar

                               Singh's conviction under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_12">section 376</a> of the IPC cannot be

</p>
<p id="p_30">            26.                Firstly, in the above case there was no evidence that the

            accused had intercourse with the victim against her will. In other words, the

            sexual intercourse had been performed by the accused with the consent of

            the victim. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above decision has made

            only a passing reference about the factual aspect that the accused were not

            subjected to medical examination to ascertain whether they were capable of

            performing sexual intercourse. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has not held in

            the above case that the failure to subject the accused to medical examination

            to ascertain their capability to perform sexual intercourse would culminate

            in acquittal. Even otherwise, in the instant case, as already pointed out by

            me, the prosecutrix's evidence was clear that she was subjected to rape by

            both the accused and she became pregnant and delivered a baby as well. In

            the above factual scenario, the above decision cited by learned counsel

            appearing for the appellants will not apply to the instant case.

            evidence on record would go to establish that both the accused had

            committed gang rape upon the prosecutrix. The failure to subject the child

            to DNA test would not throw the case of the prosecution under Section 376

            Tappa and not in the occurrence village. There is no dispute to the fact that

            accused Veerpal Kaur was born and brought-up in the occurrence village.

            Veerpal Kaur has her parental house in the occurrence village. Accused

            Veerpal Kaur may be living alongwith her husband in the matrimonial

            home. But when the parental house is their in the occurrence village,

            accused Veerpal Kaur cannot claim that she was a stranger to the occurrence

<p id="p_34">            30.                No motive need be attributed to such occurrence. Of course, in

            monetary consideration accused Veerpal Kaur indulged in such obnoxious

            act. During the course of evidence PW4 gave up such a stand taken by him

            in the first information report. PW5, the prosecutrix in this case deposed

            that accused Veerpal Kaur sent her to have sexual intercourse with accused

            Baljinder Singh and Avtar Singh saying that they were smart boys. In my

            considered view, there is no inconsistency in the version of the prosecutrix

            as regards the motive attributed to accused Veerpal Kaur. Even if there is no

            motive, the case of the prosecution does not fall flat.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                           Crl.A. No.317-SB of 2007                     -16-</span>


            326(2)(g) read with <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_23">Section 109</a> IPC in case she had abetted such gang rape.

            In my view, accused Veerpal Kaur was rightly charged and punished based

            on the evidence available on record that she abetted the commission of the

            offence under <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_24">Section 376(2)(g)</a> read with <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_25">Section 109</a> IPC. What she

            abetted was only the gang rape. Therefore, she is liable to be punished

            under the aforesaid penal provision of law.

<p id="p_40">            33.                Very strong reasons will have to be assigned by the Court to

            reduce the minimum sentence fixed under <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_26">Section 376(2)(g)</a> IPC. The fact

            that accused have undergone major portion of the sentence cannot be a

            sufficient reason to reduce minimum sentence which was already awarded

            by the trial Court. Further, I find that a poor victim was subjected to gang

            rape. She became pregnant and delivered a baby as well. Under such

            circumstances, I am disinclined to reduce the minimum sentence imposed

            on the accused by the trial Court.

<p id="p_41">            34.                In view of the above, confirming the judgement of conviction

            and sentence passed by the trial Court, the appeal stands dismissed.

            Accused Veerpal Kaur is on bail. Her bail bond stands cancelled. She shall

            surrender within 15 days from the date of this judgement before the Chief

            Judicial Magistrate, Mansa, who shall send her to jail to undergo the

            remaining part of the sentence. If she fails to surrender, the learned Chief

            Judicial Magistrate, Mansa shall take coercive steps to secure her presence

            and send her to jail to undergo the remaining part of the sentence.
