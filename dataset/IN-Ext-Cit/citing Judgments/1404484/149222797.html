<p id="p_2">1. The challenge in this petition under Section 482 read with <a href="/doc/834094/" id="a_1">Section 407</a>

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>) is to the orders dated

23rd October 2007 and 29th January 2008 passed by the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate (MM), Delhi in the Criminal Complaint Case

titled "Lord Krishna Bank v. Hitesh Mohan Nagpal".

 amalgamated with Centurion Bank Ltd. and which in turn has been

amalgamated with HDFC Bank Ltd., filed five separate criminal

complaints against the petitioner in relation to dishonour of several

cheques. In C.C. Nos. 458/1, 459/1, 460/1 and 462/1, the complaint was

in respect of three dishonoured cheques each whereas C.C. No. 461/1 was

in respect of one dishonoured cheque. All these cheques were in the sum

of Rs. 3 lakhs each except one cheque No. 911543 (which is one of the

cheques mentioned in C.C. No. 459/1) which was for a sum of Rs.

1,20,000/-. The said cheques were dishonoured on the ground of

insufficiency of funds. Five separate orders dated 25th October 2005 were

passed by the learned MM in these complaints summoning the petitioner

for the offences under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act,

1881 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">(NI Act</a>).

<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3. In the first instance two applications were filed by the accused. One

under <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_5">Section 219</a> CrPC and another under <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_6">Section 220</a> CrPC. In the

present case, we are concerned with the second application. By the order

dated 23rd October 2007, the learned MM rejected the second application

pointing out that "the complainant had clubbed three cheques which were

dishonoured" and in any event "all the cases are being tried together and

no prejudice would be caused to the accused". The petitioner filed a

further application seeking clarification of the aforementioned order. The

said application was rejected by the second impugned order dated 29th

<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4. The arguments of Mr. Vijay Aggarwal, the learned counsel for the

petitioner have been heard at great length. According to him, there should

be a single trial for the dishonour of all the cheques for only then the

punishment, if any, awarded to the petitioner can be directed to run

concurrently. According to him, if there are five separate complaints and

separate trials, the sentence, if any, in each of those complaints could be

directed to run consecutively and this would greatly prejudice the

petitioner. He refers to the illustrations under <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_7">Section 220</a> CrPC and in

particular to the sentence at the end of the illustrations (a) to (h) which

states: "The separate charges referred to in illustrations (a) to (h)

respectively may be tried at the same time". Reliance is also placed on the

judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_8">State of Andhra Pradesh v.

Cheemalapati Ganeshwara Rao</a> 1963 (2) Cri. L.J. 671 and <a href="/doc/839304/" id="a_9">Adnan Bilal

Mulla v. State of Maharashtra</a> 2006 Cri LJ 564 (Bom); <a href="/doc/1249857/" id="a_10">Ravinder Pal

Singh v. State</a> 1993 JCC 219; <a href="/doc/725578/" id="a_11">Smarty Machra v. State</a> 2007 (2) JCC

1570 and Raja Dayanand v. State 2004 (3) JCC 1886. Mr. Aggarwal

also refers to <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_12">Section 31</a> CrPC read with <a href="/doc/396582/" id="a_13">Section 71</a> IPC which deals with

the question of consecutive sentences.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">5. Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the

petitioner, this Court is not persuaded to take a view different from that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CRL.M.C. No. 646/2008                                          Page 3 of 10</span>
 taken by the learned MM. There is no dispute that under <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_14">Section 219</a> of

the CrPC, a person accused of more than one offences of the same kind

committed within space of 12 months may be charged with and tried at

one trial for not more than three offences. The dishonour of each cheque

constitutes a separate offence and not more than three cheques have been

clubbed together in one complaint. Therefore, there cannot said to be any

non-compliance with <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_15">Section 219</a> CrPC. <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_16">Section 220</a> (1) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">CrPC</a> reads as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "220(1). Trial for more than one offence.__(1) If, in
           one series of acts so connected together as to form the
           same transaction, more offences than one committed
           by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried
           at one trial for, every such offence."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_11">Illustration (d) under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">Section 220</a> (1) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19">CrPC</a> reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "(d) A has in his possession several seals, knowing
           them to be counterfeit and intending to use them for the
           purpose of committing several forgeries punishable
           under <a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_20">section 466</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
           1860). A may be separately charged with, and
           convicted of, the possession of each seal under <a href="/doc/649216/" id="a_21">section
           473</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_12">6. Although at the end of the illustrations it has been stated that the

separate charges referred to therein "may be tried at the same time", there

is no compulsion that the court must at all times try all the offences

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.M.C. No. 646/2008                                           Page 4 of 10</span>
 together at one trial. If a harmonious construction is to be made of

<a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_22">Sections 219</a> and <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_23">220</a> CrPC then the legislative intent appears to be that in

one complaint case, the accused can be proceeded against for the

dishonour of a maximum of three cheques. For offences committed in

respect of more than three cheques, a separate complaint has to be

registered, and consequently separately tried.

</p><p id="p_14">7. <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_24">In State of Andhra Pradesh v. Cheemalapati Ganeshwara Rao</a>, the

Supreme Court was dealing with the corresponding provision, i.e. <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_25">Section

239</a> of the CrPC of 1898. It was explained that <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_26">Section 239</a> was to avoid

multiplicity of trials and that "the only limitation which could properly be

placed on the trial of several persons for the same kind of or different

offences would be that which considerations of justice and fairness would

require. No doubt, such a construction would also give rise to the result

that whereas so far as the trial of a single accused person is concerned the

charges must be limited to three offences committed by him within the

space of 12 months from the first to the last of such offences, there would

be no such limitation when along with that accused person there are one or

more persons who have jointly committed those offences. The reason for

this possibly is that the Legislature did not want to differentiate between

cases where any number of different offences were committed jointly by a

group of persons from cases where any number of offences of the same

kind were committed by a group of persons." The words "same

 transaction" occurring in <a href="/doc/1604716/" id="a_27">Section 235</a> of the CrPC 1898 (corresponding to

<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_28">Section 239</a> of the present <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_29">CrPC</a>) was further explained by the Supreme

Court in the following manner (Cri LJ @ 682):
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              "Under<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_30"> s. 235(1)</a> what has to be ascertained is
              whether the offences arise out of acts so connected
              together as to form the same transaction, but the
              words "so connected together as to form" are not
              repeated after the words "same transaction" in s.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              239. What has to be ascertained then is whether
              these words are also to be read in all the clauses of
             <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_31"> s. 239</a> which refer to the same transaction. <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_32">Section
              235(1)</a>, while providing for the joint trial for more
              than one offence, indicates that there must be
              connection between the acts and the transaction.
              According to this provision there must thus be a
              connection between a series of acts before they
              could be regarded as forming the same transaction.
              What is meant by "same transaction" is not
              defined anywhere in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_33"> the Code</a>. Indeed, it would
              always be difficult to define precisely what the
              expression means. Whether a transaction can
              be regarded as the same would necessarily
              depend upon the particular facts of each case
              and it seems to us to be a difficult task to
              undertake a definition of that which the
              Legislature has deliberately left undefined. We
              have not come across a single decision of any
              Court which has embarked upon the difficult task
              of defining the expression. But it is generally
              thought that where there is proximity of time or
              place or unity of purpose and design or continuity
              of action in respect of a series of acts, it may be
              possible to infer that they form part of the same
              transaction. It is, however, not necessary that every
              one of these elements should co-exist for a
              transaction to be regarded as the same. But if
              several acts committed by a person show a unity of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CRL.M.C. No. 646/2008                                            Page 6 of 10</span>
               purpose or design that would be a strong
              circumstance to indicate that those acts form part
              of the same transaction. The connection between a
              series of acts seems to us to be an essential
              ingredient for those acts to constitute the same
              transaction and, therefore, the mere absence of the
              words "so connected together as to from" in clause
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              (a), (c) and (d) of<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_34"> s. 239</a> would make little
              difference. Now, a transaction may consist of an
              isolated act or may consist of a series of acts. The
              series of acts which constitute a transaction must
              of necessity be connected with one another and if
              some of them stands out independently, they
              would not form part of the same transaction but
              would constitute a different transaction or
              transactions. Therefore, even if the expression
              "same transaction" alone had been used in<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_35"> s.
              235(1)</a> it would have meant a transaction
              consisting either of a single act or of a series of
              connected acts. The expression "same transaction"
              occurring in cls. (a), (c) and (d) of<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_36"> s. 239</a> as well as
              that occurring in<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_37"> s. 235(1)</a> ought to be given the
              same meaning according to the normal rule of
              construction of statutes. Looking at the matter in
              that way, it is pointless to inquire further whether
              the provisions of<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_38"> s. 239</a> are subject to those of<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_39"> s.
              236(1)</a>. The provisions of sub-s. (2) and (3) of<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_40"> s.
              235</a> are enabling provisions and quite plainly can
              have no overriding effect. But it would be open to
              the court to resort to those provisions even in the
              case of a joint trial of several persons permissible
              under<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_41"> s. 239</a>."

<p id="p_16">It must be mentioned here that <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_42">Section 239</a> of CrPC (1898) corresponds

to <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_43">Section 223</a> of the present <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_44">CrPC</a> which indicates which persons could

be tried jointly.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CRL.M.C. No. 646/2008                                              Page 7 of 10</span>
</p><p id="p_18"> 8. On a conspectus of the above provisions as explained by the Supreme

Court, it appears to this Court that in the instant case although the cheques

were issued pursuant to the same agreement, and therefore the "same

transaction", the offence as a result of the dishonour of a cheque is a

separate offence. The question here is not whether in respect of these

separate offences there can be five separate complaints. In fact it is not in

dispute that there has been compliance with <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_45">Section 219</a> CrPC. The

question is whether in terms of <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_46">Section 220</a> CrPC all these offences must

be tried at "one trial."
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">9. Although the dishonoured cheques may have been issued pursuant to

one agreement, the instance of the dishonour of a cheque is a separate

offence and not „connected‟ with the dishonour of the previous or later

cheque. It is possible that the first and third cheques are honoured and the

second, fourth and fifth are not. The language of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_47">Section 220(1)</a> indicates

that it is an enabling provision which leaves it to the discretion of the court

concerned to charge and try the accused, who has committed more than

one offence forming part of the same transaction, at one trial. The word

used is "may" and understandably so since the trial court has to also

comply with the mandate of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_48">Section 219</a> CrPC whereby a maximum of

three such cheques can be combined in one complaint. That requirement

would be rendered redundant if <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_49">Section 220</a> were to be interpreted to

permit the trial of all the offences pertaining to the dishonour of each of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CRL.M.C. No. 646/2008                                             Page 8 of 10</span>
 the cheques at one trial which in turn would warrant only one sentence of

punishment if the accused is found guilty.      It would also completely

denude the penal provision of its deterrent effect. In other words, there

would be no change in the consequence if the accused is found guilty of

one such offence (pertaining to the dishonour of one cheque) or twenty

such offences (pertaining to the dishonour of twenty cheques). That can

never be the intendment of the legislature in enacting <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_50">Section 220</a> CrPC.



</p><p id="p_21">10. The decision in Ravinder Pal Singh on which considerable reliance

has been placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner, does not really

help his case at all. It is a short one-paragraph order in a case where

instead of furnishing three sureties in respect of three offences committed

within one year, the petitioner was permitted to furnish one surety. The

decision in Raja Dayanand only talks of the same court having to try

together the cases for the offences under the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_51">Arms Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52">IPC</a>. The

decision in Smarty Machra also does not help the petitioner. There, the

petitioners and the accused were charged with having committed the theft

of certain articles. The offences were committed in the intervening night

on 18th/19th June 1998. Since the offences were committed within a year it

is held that the <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_53">Section 219</a> CrPC would apply and the petitioners should

be charged jointly for the offences under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_54">Section 379</a>/<a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_55">411</a>/<a href="/doc/1495541/" id="a_56">31</a> IPC.



</p><p id="p_22">11. Consequently, it is held that in the instant case, the five complaints

 would have to be tried separately and not at one trial as urged by the

learned counsel for the petitioner. It is however possible that all the five

complaint cases are heard and tried in one court for the sake of practical

convenience. It is premature to speculate about the consequential sentence,

if any, and whether they would be directed to run concurrently.



</p><p id="p_23">12. For the aforementioned reasons, this Court finds no infirmity in the

impugned orders passed by the learned MM. The petition is accordingly

dismissed with no orders as to costs. The application also stands

dismissed.
