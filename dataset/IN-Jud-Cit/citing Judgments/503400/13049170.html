IA No.10139/2016

</pre><p id="p_1">1. The Plaintiff, ITC Limited („ITC‟), has filed the accompanying suit
against the Defendant, Britannia Industries Limited („Britannia‟), for
permanent injunction seeking to restrain Britannia from violating its
rights in the Plaintiff‟s packaging/trade dress of „Sunfeast Farmlite
Digestive - All Good‟ biscuit by using a deceptively and confusingly
similar trade dress for its Nutri Choice Digestive Zero biscuit. The relief
claimed in the suit is also for an injunction to restrain Britannia from (a)
passing off ITC‟s rights in the trade dress/ packaging/ label, (b) diluting
the mark, (c) infringing ITC's copyright in the said packaging and for
delivery up, damages and rendition of accounts etc. By this application


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                           Page 1 of 28</span>
 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908
(CPC), ITC seeks an interim injunction to restrain Britannia from
continuing to use the impugned packaging for its Nutri Choice Digestive
Zero biscuit.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. The packaging of ITC‟s „Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All Good‟
biscuit which was launched in February 2016 is as under:
</p>



<p id="p_3">3. In July 2016, Britannia launched in the market its Nutri Choice
Digestive Zero biscuit, the packaging of which is as under:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                      Page 2 of 28</span>
<p id="p_4"> 4. According to ITC, Britannia‟s impugned packaging for its Nutri
Choice Digestive Zero Biscuit is an imitation of ITC‟s packaging for
Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All Good. When placed next to each
other, they are indistinguishable to the unwary customer.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                    Page 3 of 28</span>
<p id="p_5"> 5. The photographs depicting the manner of the products being
displayed in the market place/stores when placed next to each other have
been placed on record. It is pointed out that Britannia has been
marketing and selling digestive biscuits under the mark „Nutri Choice‟
for the last several years. According to ITC, after the launch of its
„Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All Good' biscuit with „No Added Sugar‟
and „No Maida‟, Britannia filed a complaint before the Advertising
Standards Council of India („ASCI‟). After failing attempt to the said
complaint, Britannia, in July 2016, introduced Nutri Choice Digestive
Zero biscuit claiming „0% Added Sugar‟ and „0% Maida‟ in packaging
which is nearly identical and/or deceptively similar to that of ITC‟s
packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6. At the first hearing of 22nd August, 2016, Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned
Senior counsel, instructed by Ms. Ishani Chandra and Mr. Sagar
Chandra, Advocates appeared. Summons in the suit and notice in this
application were accepted on that date itself. After the case was heard
for some on that date, Mr. Chandra stated that he needed some time to
take instructions on the suggestions made for possible variation in the
impugned packaging. Therefore, no interim order was passed and the
case was adjourned to 24th August, 2016 on which date both parties
agreed, without prejudice to their respective rights, to sit down and
explore the possibility of settling the dispute pertaining to the wrapper in
respect of the Nutri Choice Digestive Zero biscuits of Britannia. The
case was then listed for 31st August, 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7. An offer was made by Britannia that they would substitute the blue
colour in the impugned packaging with dark or navy blue. This was not
acceptable to ITC. It was pointed out that Britannia has been using a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                          Page 4 of 28</span>
 different packaging for the same version of its Nutri Choice Digestive
zero sold internationally. The Court was shown the said packaging
which is as under:
</p>



<p id="p_8">8. It was stated on behalf of ITC that as long as Britannia adopts the
above packaging for its Digestive Zero biscuits in India, it would have
no objection. Alternatively, it was suggested that if the blue colour in the
impugned packaging is substituted by any other colour (other than a
different shade of blue), ITC would have no objection.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9. On the side of Britannia, it is stated that yellow colour of Britannia‟s
packaging was an essential and prominent feature and formed part of a
colour scheme that identified a range of Britannia's digestive biscuits.
Mr. Chandra pointed out that there were three variants in Britannia's
digestive biscuit segment. Two of the variants i.e., Nutri Choice
Digestive Hi-Fibre biscuits and Nutri Choice Digestive 5 Grain biscuits
were introduced in October 2014 and the third variant was the Nutri
Choice Digestive Zero biscuit. The packaging of the three variants are:
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                          Page 5 of 28</span>
<p id="p_10"> 10. It was submitted that the blue colour has been used by Britannia for
a wide variety of its biscuits. Moreover, the colour blue is supposed to
reflect the 'World Diabetes Day'. Britannia has been using the colour
blue on its other range of zero per cent added sugar Nutri choice
Essentials Oat and Ragi cookies at least since November 2010. The
current packaging of the said biscuits retaining the colour blue was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 6 of 28</span>
 launched in November 2014. Apart from Britannia‟s own Nutri Choice
Nice Bite Biscuit, a reference is made to the packaging of Britannia
Coconut Crunchees, Nice Time, Marie Gold, which has been marketing
its products to show that the combination of yellow and blue packaging
finds place in all these biscuits.
</p>

<p id="p_11">11. Britannia pointed out that ITC had earlier adopted for the Sunfeast
Farmlite Digestive All Good Biscuits a packaging which was a
combination of lemon green and blue. Therefore, if ITC was prepared to
give up the yellow colour, Britannia would replace the blue colour on its
packaging for some other colour.
</p>

<p id="p_12">12. Since there was no meeting ground between the parties as far as the
above suggestions were concerned, the Court on 2nd September, 2016,
proceeded with the matter on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_13">Submissions on behalf of ITC
</p><p id="p_14">13. Appearing for ITC, Mr. Rajiv Nayar, Mr. Sandeep Sethi and Ms.
Pratibha M. Singh, learned Senior counsel submitted that ITC‟s
packaging „Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All Good‟ had certain unique
distinctive features, as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (a) The brand name Sunfeast is written on the top-left hand side of
     the label on the yellow coloured portion with the trade mark
     „Farmlite‟ below it and the mark „Digestive - All Good‟ appearing
     below „Farmlite‟.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (b) The colour scheme used in the trade dress is Yellow and Blue.
     The left part of the packaging is in a yellow background and the
     right side of the packaging is in blue and both colours are separated


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 7 of 28</span>
      by a curved line.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (c) The picture of the biscuits appears on the right front side of the
     label which is depicted with a wheat spike/sheaf of wheat with
     grains lying at the bottom of an individual wheat biscuit with the
     words "No Added Sugar/Maida" written on the biscuit in a bold
     white font. The words Sugar and Maida are separated by a white
     horizontal dividing line between the two words.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">14. It is further submitted that ITC, which is a major private sector
company, is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of its diverse
categories of products. It had a turnover as of 2015-16 of Rs. 51,582
crores. Its branded packaged foods business is one of the fastest growing
foods businesses in India. It is stated that it entered the biscuits segment
in the year 2003 with the launch of Sunfeast and in the year 2005, ITC
launched cream biscuits under Sunfeast Dark Fantasy. It is further stated
that thereafter ITC launched branded snacks, juices etc. and products in
the dairy and that its foods business has grown to a significant size. It is
pointed out that ITC has made sales of its „Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive -
All Good‟ since its launch in February 2016 until July 2016 to the extent
of over Rs. 5 crores and has invested over Rs. 14 crores towards
marketing expenditure with respect to „Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All
Good‟. The copy of the certificates issued by the Chartered Accountant
to the above fact has been placed on record.
</p>

<p id="p_16">15. The case of ITC is that Britannia was aware of ITC's packaging
since February 2016 and chose not to enter the market till July 2016
with its competing product. It is pointed out that Britannia made no
grievance in the first place about ITC's packaging since it first went with



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                          Page 8 of 28</span>
 a complaint against ITC about this very product (and not its packaging)
before the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and it was
only after it was unsuccessful there it decided to launch the Nutri Choice
Digestive Zero biscuit by imitating ITC's packaging for the Sunfeast
Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuit. It is further pointed out that
Britannia‟s „Nutri Choice Digestive Zero biscuit‟ has, in the packaging
in small font, stated that "this biscuit contains sucralose not
recommended for children". This would tarnish the image of ITC
inasmuch of ITC products, including „Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All
Good‟ biscuits as they are suitable for consumption including children
and an unwary consumer is like to pick the Britannia‟s product thinking
the same to the ITC‟s product. This would also dilute ITC's brand and
harm its reputation since ITC's biscuit in fact has no added sugar or
maida and is suitable for children and adults alike.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16. The central thrust of ITC's submissions is that Britannia has copied
the unique colour scheme and combination, and the method and
placement of the various elements of ITC‟s trade dress. The products are
identical. The trade channels are identical. Thus, this is a case of triple
identity and it is bound to lead to confusion and deception. It is
submitted that Britannia being a subsequent adopter of the packaging,
was aware of ITC‟s products, including Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive -
All Good, and has copied the packaging, get up, lay out, colour scheme,
concept, overall appearance etc. in order to pass off their „Nutri Choice‟
Digestive biscuit products as another product of ITC itself. It is stated
that even the pricing of the competing products is identical. Each pack
is priced at a maximum retail price („MRP‟) of Rs. 25. It is further stated
that there is bound to be confusion at the retailer level as well as at the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                         Page 9 of 28</span>
 level of the purchaser. Packaging is said to play an important role in this
category of food products and the consumer is bound to be confused
between the two competing packets of biscuits.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17. In the plaint, it is averred that there is also a copyright infringement
by Britannia. It is stated that a mere glance at the impugned packaging
would show that Britannia could not have designed it without having
ITC‟s impugned product packaging/label of Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive
</p><p id="p_19">- All Good in mind. It is stated that the use by Britannia of a deceptively
similar packaging for an identical product constitutes infringement of
the original artistic work in the unique product packaging/label of ITC
under <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_1">Section 51</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957. It is stated that the illegal
act of Britannia constitutes misrepresentation and unfair competition and
is likely to dilute the distinct character of ITC‟s brand. However, it
requires to be noticed that during the hearing, the aspect of copyright
infringement was not touched upon by counsel for ITC.
</p>
<p id="p_20">Submissions on behalf of Britannia
</p><p id="p_21">18. Mr. Sudhir Chandra for Britannia began by pointing out that
Britannia is the market leader and had over 66% of the market share (in
both volume and value) whereas ITC had only 1.8%. He pointed out that
Britannia has been manufacturing and marketing the above range of
Nutri choice Digestive biscuits with the primary/predominant colour of
the product packaging below yellow along with a secondary colour to
indicate the variant since 2008.
</p>

<p id="p_22">19. Mr. Chandra debunked ITC's submission that only after Britannia‟s
complaint before ASCI was dismissed, it decided to introduce Nutri
Choice Digestive Zero biscuits. It is pointed out that the complaint was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                         Page 10 of 28</span>
 rejected by ASCI by its order dated 12th July, 2016 whereas the date of
manufacture of the Nutri Choice Digestive Zero biscuit as shown in the
packaging placed on record by ITC itself is 30th June, 2016. It is pointed
out that Britannia's nutri choice biscuits have been in the market since
2008. However, it was not disputed by Mr. Chandra that this particular
variant viz., Nutri Choice Digestive Zero biscuit was introduced only in
July 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20. Referring to the decision in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_2">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v.
Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories PTC (Suppl</a>) (2) 680 (SC),
Mr. Chandra submitted that there was a distinction to be drawn between
the action and infringement of action for passing off. In an action for
passing off, it had to be demonstrated that the added matter in the
defendant's mark was insufficient to distinguish its goods from that of
the Plaintiff. Mr. Chandra enlisted what he considered to be the
distinctive features of the impugned packaging. First, the word
„Britannia' itself appeared prominently against a red background in one
corner of the impugned packaging. Secondly, the word „Nutri Choice‟
featured prominently and this was not present in ITC's packaging.
Further, the shades of blue and yellow were different. Lastly, the entire
get up was itself distinct. Mr. Chandra stated that while there might be a
similarity in the two packagings, when viewed as a whole there was no
case made out for passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21. Mr. Chandra referred to the decision in Reckitt &amp; Colman Products
Limited v. Borden Inc. (1990) 1 All ER 873 and emphasized that of the
three essential elements which had to be established by the Plaintiff in
an action for passing off, ITC here had failed to show that it had a
formidable goodwill or reputation in the particular brand i.e., Sunfeast


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 11 of 28</span>
 Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuit relatable to its packaging. Having
launched the said product in February 2016, ITC cannot possibly claim
that it had built a reputation in that particular biscuit already by July
2016. Reputation, according to Mr. Chandra, had to be built over several
years and not in a few months. He also referred to the passage from
Kerly‟s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names.
</p>

<p id="p_25">22. On the aspect of deception and confusion, Mr. Chandra referred to
the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Wal Mart Stores Inc. v.
Samara Brothers Inc. 54 USPQ2d 1065 to urge that colour per se was
not an element of distinctiveness for identifying the source of the
products. Referring to the decision in Laxmikant v. Patel v. Chetanbhat
Shah 2002 (24) PTC 1 (SC) which in turn referred to the decision in
Oertli v. Bowman (1957) RPC 388, he submitted that ITC failed to
show that the get up or trade dress was distinctive of its goods and had
acquired a 'secondary meaning' deserving of protection in an action for
passing off. He referred to extracts from the 'Law of Passing Off: Unfair
Competition by Misrepresentation' by Christopher Wadlow. Mr.
Chandra submitted that in the advertisements for its product, ITC was
actually projecting its trademarks i.e. ITC, Sunfeast and Farmlite. It was
not selling the product on the basis of its packaging. He submitted that
ITC should be prepared to fight Britannia in the market place by a
superior quality product and not resort to litigation. He maintained that it
was ITC that was coming closer to Britannia by adopting the yellow
colour as a prominent feature of its packaging rather than the other way
around. There was no need for Britannia, being the market leader, to
adopt anyone else's packaging.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                         Page 12 of 28</span>
<p id="p_26">  Rejoinder submissions of ITC
</p><p id="p_27"> 23. Replying to the above arguments, Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned senior
 counsel for ITC, first pointed out that the lemon green that was
 contemplated by ITC as a possible colour on the packaging for Farmlite
 Digestive All Good biscuits was, in fact, only used at the planning stage.
 The product was never launched with that colour combination in the
 packaging. He pointed out that ITC was in the market with Farmlite
 Digestive All Good biscuits since February 2016 whereas Britannia
 entered with Nutri Choice Digestive Zero only in July 2016. Relying on
 the decision in <a href="/doc/1096754/" id="a_3">Ishi Khosla v. Anil Aggarwal</a> 2007 III AD (Del) 421,
 Mr. Nayar pointed out that reputation could be built, not necessarily
 over a large number of years, but even „overnight‟. The fact that since its
 launch in February 2016, ITC has been able to sell Rs. 5 crores worth of
 Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuits reflected its growing reputation.
 Further, the fact that Britannia chose to file a complaint to the ASCI and
 then in July 2016 introduced its own variant imitating ITC‟s packaging
 also showed that ITC was posing a good competition with the growing
 popularity of its product. He submitted that if indeed Britannia had a
 66% market share, it should really not be worried about a competitor
 who had less than 3% market share. By trying to stymie healthy
 competition by imitating the packaging, Britannia was indulging in
 unfair trade practice.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24. Adverting to the aspect of confusion in deception, Mr. Nayar referred
to the decision of the learned Single Judge in <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_4">Baker Hughes Limited v.
Hiroo Khushalani ILR</a> (1999) I Delhi Page 41, where the Court
elaborated on the concept of 'initial interest' in a product. If the initial
interest is based on confusion and deception, it can give rise to a cause of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 13 of 28</span>
 action for a tort of passing off. He pointed out that although the decision
of the learned Single Judge was reversed by the Division Bench, the
Supreme Court, ultimately affirmed the Single Judge in <a href="/doc/207134/" id="a_5">Baker Hughes
Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani</a> (2004) 12 SCC 628. Referring to the
decision in <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_6">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co</a>.
(1970) 2 SCR 224, he submitted that in an action of passing off, the
question required to be addressed was "whether the defendant was selling
goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to
believe that they are the plaintiff‟s goods?" He also referred to the
decision of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/792062/" id="a_7">Gorbatschow Wodka KG v. John
Distilleries Limited</a> 2011 (47) PTC 100 to urge that merely because the
purchaser may be educated and have greater discerning capacity, the
likelihood of deception is not minimised. He also referred to the decision
in <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_8">Parle Products (P) Ltd v. J. P. &amp; Co. Mysore</a> (1972) 1 SCC 618.
</p>

<p id="p_29">The aspect of reputation
</p><p id="p_30">25. The Court proposes to begin the discussion by recapitulating the
difference between an action for infringement and that for passing off.
The decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_9">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt
Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>                  (supra) is
considered a classic in this context. The relevant extract of the said
decision, which has been reiterated in many subsequent judgments reads
as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not
       essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the
       case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in
       respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a
       registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions
       might         coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 14 of 28</span>
        imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such
       in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the
       correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for
       infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of
       the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity
       between the plaintiff's and the defendants mark is so close either
       visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the
       conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required
       to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in
       another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the
       plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-
       up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the
       packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
       differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of
       the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas
       in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he
       can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods
       from those of the plaintiff. "
</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">26. It is this very distinction that has been reiterated subsequently by the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_10">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara
Engineering Co</a>. (supra) where it observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "In an action for infringement where the defendant's trade
       mark is identical with the plaintiff's mark, the Court will not
       enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive
       or cause confusion. But where the alleged infringement
       consists of using not the exact mark on the Register, but
       something similar to it, the test of infringement is the same as
       in an action for passing off. In other words, the test as to
       likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of
       marks is the same both in infringement and passing off
       actions."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">27. The question that had to be asked as far as passing off action,
according to the Supreme Court was:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 15 of 28</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or
       calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the
       plaintiff's goods?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">28. The present case is focused on trade dress and getup in the packaging
of the competing products which are identical products inasmuch as both
are digestive biscuits and are sold in the same trade channels and are at
the same retail price. What is the extent to which, in the passing of
action, the trade dress and getup can have an impact was examined by the
House of Lords in Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc.
(supra).

<p id="p_34">28.1 The facts of the case were that the appellants, a company in the
USA, and its Belgium subsidiary began marketing lemon juice in
conventional bottles in 1975 and by the end of 1980 their sales were at
25% of the total sales of lemon juice in the United Kingdom (UK). The
Respondents, on the other hand, marketed lemon juice in convenient
plastic squeeze packs from 1956 onwards. With the growing sales of the
Appellants, the Respondents launched sales of their products in
conventional bottles. The Appellants then responded by selling their juice
in plastic lemon shaped squeeze containers. The case brought forth by the
Respondent was that the Appellants were passing off their lemon juice as
that of the Respondents by using a getup deceptively similar to the one
used by the Appellants. The Court of the first instance granted an
injunction in favour of the Respondents which was upheld by the Court
of Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_35">28.2 The House of Lords dismissed the further appeal by holding that the
plastic lemon container was not an object in itself but was part of the get-
up under which the Respondents‟ product was sold. Although the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 16 of 28</span>
 protected get-up consisted of both the container and the label, there was
no reason why a part of the get-up viz. the container could not be
separated from the subject matter of protection in its own right. Once it
was established that what the Appellants were doing constituted a
misrepresentation which effectively deceived the public into an erroneous
belief regarding the source of the product, it was immaterial whether that
resulted from the similarity of their get-up to the whole of the
Respondents‟ get-up or only to the most striking part of it.
</p>
<p id="p_36">28.3 It was observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "the essence of the action for passing off is a deceit practised
       on the public and it can be no answer, in a case where it is
       demonstrable that the public has been or will be deceived, that
       they would not have been so deceived if they had been more
       careful, more literate or more perspicacious. Customers have
       to be taken as they are found; there is no principle of law that
       there must always be assumed to be a literate and careful
       customer".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">28.4 Immediately relevant to the case at hand are the three elements that
must be shown to exist for a Plaintiff to succeed in an action for passing
off:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill
       or reputation attached to the goods or services which he
       supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association
       with the identifying "get-up" (whether it consists simply of a
       brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of
       labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or
       services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is
       recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the
       plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a
       misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or
       not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe
       that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 17 of 28</span>
        of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff's
       identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or
       services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a
       particular source which is in fact the plaintiff. For example, if
       the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name
       in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not
       at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity
       of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must
       demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet action, that he is
       likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief
       engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the
       source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the
       source of those offered by the plaintiff."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_38">29. In a concurring opinion of Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle in the same
decision, it was observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "However, it is a prerequisite of any successful passing off
       action that the plaintiff's goods have acquired a reputation in
       the market and are known by some distinguishing feature. It is
       also a prerequisite that the misrepresentation has deceived or
       is likely to deceive and that the plaintiff is likely to suffer
       damage by such deception. Mere confusion which does not
       lead to a sale is not sufficient. Thus, if a customer asks for a
       tin of black shoe polish without specifying any brand and is
       offered the product of A which he mistakenly believes to be
       that of B, he may be confused as to what he has got but he has
       not been deceived into getting it. Misrepresentation has played
       no part in his purchase."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">30. In Kerly‟s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, on the aspect of
the plaintiff having to prove reputation it is said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "As in any other passing off case, a claimant relying upon get-
       up must prove his reputation: he must prove, that is, that the
       get-up concerned indicates his goods and no one else‟s. In
       particular, he must show that distinctiveness lies in the get-up
       and not (for instance) in his name or trademarks, if those



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                         Page 18 of 28</span>
        appear on the goods. Thus, if a claimant by his cautions and
       advertisements shows that he relies wholly or mainly on his
       trade mark or business name, he makes his case on general
       get-up, apart from trade mark or business name, more difficult
       to establish. A trader who introduces a new feature into the
       get-up of his goods does not thereby acquire any proprietary
       interest in it, so as to be able to prevent its use by competitors,
       until it has become so identified with his goods that its use by
       others is calculated to deceive. No case can be made merely by
       showing an imitation of the parts of the get-up of goods which
       are common to the trade. But very little evidence of user may
       be sufficient to establish distinctiveness where the get-up is
       not only novel but striking, even though its consists of a
       combination of commonly used parts."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">31. On the aspect of reputation, there is merit in ITC's contention that it is
not practicable and in fact not necessary, particularly when a new product
with a distinctive packaging is introduced in the market for the Plaintiff
to show that it has established a formidable reputation in that product for
a number of years. The averment of ITC that the sales of Sunfeast
Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuits has been to the extent of Rs. 5
crores in a period of over five months since it was first introduced in
February, 2016 is a significant factor in examining the reputation of the
product. It has further been averred by ITC that it has incurred over Rs.
14 crores as marketing expenditure. It has placed on record the
certificates of its Chartered Accountant in support of the said averments.
In reply to the said averment, Britannia states that contents thereof are
wrong and ITC should be put to strict proof of the same. Therefore, there
is no specific denial as such.
</p>
<p id="p_41">32. It is not impossible that a consumer product, which is a new biscuit,
can acquire popularity in a short span of time. The trend of sales over say
six months can be indicative of whether the popularity is growing.
While, these would be matters of evidence, it cannot be said that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                          Page 19 of 28</span>
 reputation attached to a product can develop only if it has been in the
market for a number of years. In the particular segment of consumer
durables and eatables, it is not unknown that a product that caters to a
particular taste or choice of a consumer can become popular in a short
span of time. As observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1096754/" id="a_11">Ishi Khosla v. Anil Aggarwal</a>:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "To acquire secondary meaning/distinctive meaning it is not
       necessary that product is in the market for number of years, as
       observed earlier. If a new idea is fascinating and appeals to the
       consumers, it can become a hit overnight.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">33. Health conscious consumers are likely to be discerning on their
choice of food, including biscuits. A high fibre content or a variety of
grains present in the biscuit would make it a likely choice. It is this
category of consumers that is being targeted by the food industry, which
now includes ITC and Britannia. What is of interest here is the clear
announcement on the packaging that there is no Sugar or no Maida. This
was not a prominent element of Britannia's earlier variants of Nutri
choice Digestive Biscuits. It appears that the clear indication on the
packet that there is no sugar or maida obviously has an impact on the
discerning health conscious consumer. The fact that Britannia for some
reason did not think of introducing the Digestive Zero variant till six
months after ITC introduced it is a factor that weighs in favour of ITC. It
is arguable that Britannia woke up a bit late to the potential after realising
that there is a niche market for this variant of zero sugar and zero maida
digestive biscuits.
</p>
<p id="p_43">34. It is in the above background that the question whether this particular
product of ITC has acquired a reputation requires to be addressed. The
question whether the packaging of Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good
biscuits has become identified with the product is a matter for evidence.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                         Page 20 of 28</span>
<p id="p_44"> However, the fact that sales of the said biscuit had picked up to an extent
of Rs. 5 crores in a short span of over five months should be an indicator
of its growing reputation. Consequently, this Court is satisfied that ITC
has been able to establish prima facie that its product Sunfeast Farmlite
Digestive All Good biscuit has acquired a growing reputation in a short
span which is deserving of protection.
</p>
<p id="p_45">The aspect of deception and confusion

</p><p id="p_46">35. Turning next to the aspect of deception, it must be noticed at the
outset that during the course of arguments counsel on both sides who had
brought their respective competing products to the Court were
themselves confused as to which was their client‟s product. At one stage,
Mr. Chandra picked up ITC's product when in fact he meant to show how
Britannia's packaging was distinct and not similar to ITC's packaging.
However, this by itself cannot be determinative of there being deception
and/or confusion as a result of both packets being juxtaposed.
</p>
<p id="p_47">36. Biscuits are normally stacked on shelves in a grocery shop or a
supermarket. Usually there is an entire section where the biscuits of
different manufacturers are arranged side by side. Where the product is
an eatable like a biscuit, the colour and the colour scheme of the
packaging plays an important role in the consumer making an initial
choice and in enabling a discerning consumer to locate the particular
brand of a manufacturer. The aspect of 'initial interest' was explained by
this Court in <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_12">Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani</a> as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "In some case, however, it is also possible that such a
       purchaser after having been misled into an initial interest in a
       product manufactured by an imitator discovers his folly, but
       this initial interest being based on confusion and deception can


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                       Page 21 of 28</span>
        give rise to a cause of action for the tort of passing off as the
       purchaser has been made to think that there is some
       connection or nexus between the products and business of two
       disparate companies."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">37. Therefore, when another competing variant of the biscuit is
introduced six months later and a consumer on the basis of the popularity
of a product that has recently been introduced makes a mistake as to
which packet of biscuit he is picking up, it can be argued that the initial
interest was based on confusion and deception and, therefore, gives rise
to a tort of passing off. In Wal Mart (supra) it was observed that the
product‟s trade dress can be protected only if it is shown that it had
acquired a secondary meaning "since design, like colour, is not inherently
distinctive." However, the product in that case was a certain kind of
clothing. In that context, it was said that the colour by itself does not
identify the source of the product. However, that may not be entirely true
when it comes to products like biscuits. The packaging of a biscuit does
become associated with the manufacturer or brand. The colour on the
wrapper would certainly play an important part.
</p>
<p id="p_49">38. Similar marks or features used in wrappers of competing biscuits was
the subject matter of <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_13">Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. &amp; Co</a>. (supra). The
Appellants there owned certain registered trademarks one of which was
"Glucose" and was used on their half pound biscuit packets. Another
registered trade mark was a wrapper with its colour scheme, general set
up and entire collocation of words. The wrapper was of buff colour and
depicted a farm yard with a girl in the centre carrying a pail of water and
cows and hens around her on the background of a farmyard house and
trees. The Respondent's wrapper contained a picture of a girl supporting
with one hand a bundle of hay on her head and carrying a sickle and a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 22 of 28</span>
 bundle of food in the other, the cows and hens surrounding her. The trial
court declined the injunction. The High Court looking at the broad
features did not think that they were so similar so as to deceive an
ordinary purchaser. Since it was an action for infringement, the Supreme
Court declined to treat it as a case of passing off. Nevertheless, it
explained that in order to come to a conclusion whether one mark is
deceptively similar to another "the broad and essential features of the two
are to be considered." It was further explained as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are
       any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of
       such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken
       for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears
       such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be
       likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept
       the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the packets
       are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two
       wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not
       identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be
       mistaken for the other. The essential features of both are that
       there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying something in
       the other with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens in
       the foreground. In the background there is a farm house with a
       fence. The word "Gluco Biscuits" in one and "Glucose
       Biscuits" on the other occupy a prominent place at the top with
       a good deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in,
       our opinion who has a look at one of the packets to-day may
       easily mistake the other if shown on another day as being the
       same article which he had seen before. If one was not careful
       enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the
       plaintiffs goods, he might easily mistake the defendants'
       wrapper for the plaintiffs if shown to him some time after
       he had seen the plaintiffs'. After all, an ordinary purchaser
       is not gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock
       Holmes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants'
       wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' which was
       registered." (emphasis supplied)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                          Page 24 of 28</span>
 of the wrapper with yellow colour on the left and blue on the right, the
positioning of the letters 'No Sugar' above and 'No Maida' below are
strikingly similar. The words Nutri Choice merges with the background.
As a result what strikes the eye from a distance of say even 10 ft. is the
colour combination of yellow on the left and blue on the right. The Court
is, therefore, satisfied that the impugned packaging for the Nutri Choice
Digestive Zero Biscuits launched by Britannia is deceptively similar to
the packaging of ITC's Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuits and
such deception is likely to confuse the consumers of such biscuits, even
the discerning health conscious ones, into thinking that Britannia's
biscuits are that of ITC's.
</p>

<p id="p_53">Likelihood of damage
</p><p id="p_54">41. As regards the third element of damage that is likely to be caused to
ITC if Britannia were not injuncted, it is possible that Britannia being a
66% market holder can swing ITC's customers away from ITC's
competing product as a result of the deceptive packaging. The packaging
of Britannia's earlier two variants of digestive biscuits did not contain the
blue colour. They were a combination of yellow and red and yellow and
green. Those variants were introduced in October 2014. ITC was the first
as far as the 'No sugar' and 'no maida' variant is concerned. ITC's product
was launched in February 2016. Britannia was aware of and lived with
the yellow and blue packaging of ITC's Farmlite Digestive All Good
biscuits for about six months. Even if it were to be accepted that yellow
colour is integral to Britannia's packaging scheme for Digestive biscuits,
Britannia's purpose would well be served by adopting a colour, other than
blue, to combine with the yellow colour of its packaging. Further, even if
Britannia insists on having both yellow and blue as part of its packaging,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 25 of 28</span>
 then ITC's suggestion that Britannia can use for its Indian market the
same wrapper it uses for the same product in the international market
appears reasonable. Britannia's rejection of these suggestions has brought
about a situation where the deception and confusion in the mind of the
average health conscious consumer is likely to persist.
</p>

<p id="p_55">42. The question whether a deception of this kind will affect the
consumer's choice cannot be answered in the abstract. It will depend on
the type of product, the marketing practice peculiar to the industry and
trade, the profile of the targeted consumers and so on. While it is true that
superior quality of ITC's biscuit will ultimately determine its popularity
in the market, if the initial choice that a consumer makes of this particular
brand of biscuits gets altered on account of the possible deception and
confusion, because the packaging of the two products resemble each
other too closely, then it gives rise to an actionable tort. There is also
merit in the contention that while ITC's variant is suitable to all age
groups, Britannia's is not on its own admission on the packaging suitable
for children because it has sucralose added. This can lead to possible
dilution of the reputation and goodwill attached to ITC's product. So long
as the deception persists, it would have an adverse impact on sales of this
particular product of ITC. A market leader like Britannia can certainly eat
into the market share of a relatively smaller player like ITC in the biscuit
trade by adopting a deceptive variant of the latter's get up and trade dress
but the converse may not be true. The new entrant with a product that
enjoys a growing popularity might require protection.
</p>

<p id="p_56">43. The three elements for an action of passing having shown to prima
facie stand fulfilled, the Court is satisfied that ITC has a prima facie case


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">  IA No. 10139/2016 in CS (Comm) 1128/2016                        Page 26 of 28</span>
 in its favour and that the balance of convenience in granting an interim
injunction is in its favour. Since it is just about two months since
Britannia has introduced its variant with the impugned packaging, it is
likely to suffer a far less damage if the injunction were to be granted
when compared to the damage that ITC is likely to suffer if it is not
granted. Without such interim protection, ITC is likely to suffer
irreparable hardship since the loss of market share cannot adequately be
compensated later.
</p>

<p id="p_57">44. An interim injunction is, accordingly, issued restraining Britannia
from using the impugned packaging get-up/wrapper for its Nutri Choice
Digestive Zero biscuits in the present form during the pendency of this
suit. It will however be open to Britannia to adopt the packaging it uses
for the product internationally or while retaining the yellow colour,
substitute the blue colour in the impugned packaging with any other
distinctive colour other than variants of blue. In sum, it can adopt any
packaging which is distinctively different from the packaging that is
currently used by ITC for its Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good
biscuits.
</p>

<p id="p_58">45. The Court grants Britannia four weeks' time to phase out the existing
stocks of Nutri Choice Zero Digestive biscuits with the impugned
packaging. Britannia will maintain true accounts of its sales of Nutri
Choice Zero Digestive biscuits with the impugned packaging from its
launch till the date of discontinuance in terms of this order.
